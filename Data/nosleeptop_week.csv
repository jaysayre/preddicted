Jaunt,68,167,1qwru3,715,I opened the present What the fuck is this shit Oh wow grandpa thanksHe pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and said Its a Ham Radio son I used to have one when I was younger Its got a hundred mile range so you can talk to people all the way out in Fairview Real conversations not the text messages or emails you all use these days Ill even let you use my old license and call signYeah Im never going to do any of that Sounds great grandpaLets set it up togetherUh yeah coolHe spent two hours setting it up showing me how to operate it and telling me stories about the other hams hed met over the years He switched it on and got in contact with some gruff sounding dude out in Fairview They had a lively discussion about how the FCC was oppressing their constitutional rightsI caught a movie with Jeremy got some free pancakes at IHOP and turned in early A mediocre birthday like always I have a bad habit of drinking soda before bed and as usual I ended up staring at the ceiling wide awake I browsed Reddit for a while but you can only see so many cat pictures before they all start to look the sameI flicked on the ham radio and fiddled with the tuner Other than the police band the air traffic tower and some guy ranting about the Federal Reserve it was quiet I sighed laid back in bed and started to doze offThats when I heard itAt first I thought I imagined it I was in that halfawake halfasleep state where your thoughts start to play tricks on you I thought maybe I had started dreaming before I was fully asleep and had hallucinated a soundA sound like a voice calling through staticI listened for a moment Nothing Just a dream I turned over on my side and closed my eyesI snapped back awake There it was again for certain this time A voice calling out as if from a great distanceIt was coming from the radioI turned the volume up as far as it would go but I could still hear only the faintest sound like someone calling from the bottom of a well I adjusted the tuner for better reception but it didnt help I picked up the microphone and spoke into it HelloThe voice stopped There was a long moment of silence Then the voice called out again more clearly this time Hello HelloHello Can you hear me I suddenly felt very stupid It was probably just another weirdo survivalist out in the woods who wanted to babble about EMP blasts and the gold standard or something Still there was something in his voice An urgency that was hard to ignoreThere was a fluctuation in the static and the voice came in again Hello He said something else something in what I assumed was GermanIm sorry I cant understand you I only speak EnglishHe spoke again and I could hear how thick his accent was Please I ask you When are youWhere am I Im in Chester About forty miles outside FairviewNo no The static was starting to overtake the voice again When are youExcuse meWhat time What yearI stared at the radio So this was one of those ham weirdos that grandpa was talking about I shook my head and chucked a little Uh its  dudeThere was an excited barrage of German that turned desperate when the static started drowning him out Please I must ask you Please waitThen nothingI set the microphone down Great Another outlet for creepers to say creepy shit We sure dont have enough of those in the world I switched the radio off and went to sleepWhat the fuck is that shit Jeremy saidI rolled my eyes Ham radio My grandpa got it for my birthdayThats hilarious Does it workYeah hundred mile range Its stupid though The police band is sort of interesting but other than that its just survivalists and conspiracy nutsThats awesome We should pretend were under siege during a zombie attack like do some War of the Worlds shit with this thingI laughed I dont know man its just a lot of weirdos on there Like the other day I was listening to it and this one guyJeremy switched the radio on and immediately I heard a frantic voice calling out Hello HelloThis guy I said This guy is a fucking psychoDude sweet I love talking to psychos Jeremy picked up the microphone HelloHello the voice sounded overjoyed Please do not go I do many fixes to machine Transmission is very much betterJeremy giggled Dude youve got fucking Bruno on your radio He spoke into the microphone Ja das is gut Much sound BravoSprechen Sie DeutschIve had a few semesters yeahThey spoke back and forth in German for a bit What are you saying I askedJeremy sat back and shook his head This guy is a piece of work I asked him where hes located and he said long ago many years in your pastWhen I talked to him he wanted to know what year it wasHes playing a prank He probably goes on here pretends to be a time traveler to troll the survivalists and then puts the recordings up on YouTube Actually pretty brilliant if you ask meAsk him how hes communicating from the pastJeremy spoke into the microphone and there was an excited flood of German from the other endWhats he saying I askedI have no fucking ideaI thought you spoke GermanLevel three If he was describing the animals he was seeing on a safari I could maybe follow him But hes talking about like particle tunnels and chaotic duality waves or something I dont think I could understand him even if I was fluentThe voice on the radio sighed and took a long pause Then with heaviness in his tone he said Please Tell me about your worldI scoffed We should switch it offJeremy looked shocked WhyHes fucking with usSo Hes doing a great job of it Dont be such a downer This is the most interesting conversation Ive had in a while so I say fuck it Lets play time travelersWe told him about our future world We described airplanes selfdriving cars space stations microchips We tried to describe a smartphone which was difficult to do with the voices shitty English and Jeremys shitty German He was fascinated by the Internet awestruck by the moon landing greatly amused when we played some Daft Punk as an example of futuristic culture Jeremy spent a weird amount of time talking about his VitamixAnd through it all the voice kept repeating Beautiful So beautifulOkay enough about us mein herr Jeremy said Your turn Tell us about your worldA long silence My world the voice said is very dark Bad things happening I do not knowhow we will escape the shadowThis guys a great improviser Jeremy saidPlease my friends I have question It is very important I must ask youJeremy smiled Sure man go aheadThe voice asked something in German Jeremy frownedSuddenly there was a noise like breaking glass from the radio The voice gasped Nein nein There were other voices angry voices clamoring and shouting It sounded like a crowd was in the room and they were wreaking havoc Loud bangs and thuds like furniture being turned over The voices grew louder and louder There was a tremendous crashThen silenceI looked over at Jeremy What the fuck happenedHe shook his head I dont know Other people were there They were saying Dog Worthless dog over and over again Sounded like they smashed the place upI fiddled with the tuner but there was no sign of the voice Jeremy and I sat quietly for a momentHis question I said What did he ask youJeremy stared at the radio He said Can they be stoppedToo much soda again Another insomniac night I counted the cracks in the ceiling over and over Over and over My eyes began to feel heavy at lastA burst of static from the radio made my heart jump I shot upright in bed and looked over The static faded out and the voice faded in He was speaking German quite softlyAnger flared in my chest I was sick of this Sick of him and his stupid pranks I wanted to smash that goddamn radio to piecesI grabbed the microphone and shouted Leave me alone for Christs sake I dont care about your stupid fucking time travel act just stop bothering me and leave me aloneBut he just spoke over me like he couldnt hear me at all His voice was shaky and quiet I couldnt understand what he was saying but I could feel a great sadness in his toneI grabbed my phone and opened the voice recorder I sat there listening and recording until he was finished speaking I sat in silence for a few minutes to make sure nothing else was coming through then I switched the radio offI sent the audio file to Jeremy with an explanation of what had happened I asked him to translate The next day at school he handed me a sheet of paper at lunch He didnt say anything he just handed it to me and walked awayIt readgt My friends I do not know if you can hear me I do not know if you could ever hear me or if I was imagining our encounter But I hope you are out theregt The machine is critically damaged Perhaps with a great deal of work it could be repaired but I doubt that I will have either the resources or the time necessary for such a task I am deeply saddened that we could not speak further There are so many questions I wanted to ask so much more I wanted to learn about your world But please know that in the brief time we were able to speak you gave a tired man a reason to continue livinggt I know now that the madness that has gripped my country cannot be stopped I tell my son to be strong I tell him that our people have endured for thousands of years I tell him that if we were strong enough to build the Pyramids we are strong enough to withstand a few grunting apes in jackboots But he knows I am afraid too We are marching forward into a nightmare that will take a terrible toll on all of us I do not know when it will end The only thing I can cling to is the fact that somehow our world will lead to yoursgt I think of your world and I feel something I havent felt in many years An emotion almost unknown to the people of my time I feel hope For in a world such as yours a world of such wondrous invention and progress what use could there be for war What reason for hunger What tolerance for injustice I know in my heart that you have solved the problems that have plagued our species and created a world of enduring peace and unitygt I do not know how such a world could spring from the darkness that is enveloping this continent But I hope that the future is as beautiful as you described it I hope you have built the world that we could not I hope you have learned from our mistakes I hope you treat each other with the dignity and respect that is the birthright of all humanity I hope you have forgotten the word for hate I hope that things are differentgt Goodbye my friends from the shadowsgt Dr Albert Bachman Frankfurt Germany November th A prank Thats all it was I dont even know why Im even posting this Theres no way it was actually some scifi miracle It was obviously just someone with too much time on his hands playing a big joke on us Hes probably listening to the recordings and laughing at us right nowJust a prankButI still keep the radio on at night Ill switch it on as Im laying in bed and sometimes when Im starting to drift off Ill think I hear a distant voice calling out in the dark A voice from the shadows tiny and frail yet full of hope And Ill sit up in bed and listen Ill listen for a sound a word anything But I never hear more Just my mind playing tricks on meI dont sleep much anymore Probably because I drink too much soda rightRight,The Voice on the Radio,882
horriddaydream,86,144,1r338n,570,My mother left when I was fourNormally that wouldnt mean anything but I suspected for a long time that the porcelain dolls were coming from her like some pitiful little attempt to show me that she loved me My father he worked overtime to keep things going in the household even if it was just the two of us His hands were always worn from working the machines at the shop and he slaved even more when he got home and had to make supper for himself and I and go through my nightly routines before I hit the sack I sometimes woke up in the middle of the night and he was still awake cleaning a room in the house and I thought to myself This man is dedicated Has to be awake in only a few hoursand here he is I love my father and I always haveOne of his most trusted friends from high school Alexander was my babysitter from the time my mother left to the time I was about seven years old We trusted Alexander He worked night shift and so he was able to work babysitting in around his hours and he would have done anything to help out my father to make that work My father paid him even though he asked for nothing he said he was just doing his good deed and I like it anyway My dad used to come home from work and Alexander would pick up his bags full of toys that we played with he always brought the best toys and trinkets with him His daughter had passed away when she was ten years old and I think it brought him great joy to now share her old toys with another little girl He would say to my dad She was great for me She ate well and she took her usual long nap Ill be back tomorrow And he always came back Well eventually times changed and my dads work schedule changed with them We didnt see Alexander anymore because we didnt NEED Alexander anymore My father thought that they lost touch permanently and when I asked about him he told me truthfully that Alexander was a very busy man And he understood that and I did too For my eighth birthday the first porcelain doll arrived It had beautiful blonde curly hair and a painted on face She was wearing what looked to be an expensive velvet dress with an attached tutu She came inside a stuffed envelope with nothing else on the package to identify who had sent her Just my name that was all The first thing that my father did was call my grandmother who said No I didnt drive by and place a present on the porch Im not her coward mother I would have given it right to her That gave my father the second idea my mother Only thing was we had no way of getting in touch with her and finding out for she had literally taken off and abandoned us both And over the next few weeks nobody came forth and said they had gotten me the doll so we assumed this is who had sent itThey showed up every year since then Each unique in their own ways each more beautiful than the last I thought it was a little odd yes Especially because my mother made no outreach to me so if she was sending me gifts but not bothering to even so much call me and check up then that was just plain rude of her and her gifts meant literally nothing But I continued to set them up on my shelf in my bedroom and they looked nice there I supposeThe year I turned nineteen I was moved into college and was taking courses on my birthday My father called me from home and asked me when I was coming back home for a break and I told him that I had time this weekend but I only said this because I sensed some urgency in his voice I could make it work He told me not to worry about anything but that he would really like to see me Then he stressed that I always lock my doors and always have somebody walking with me if I was out past dark which I already knewI returned home that weekend and my father said there had been an accidentMy porcelain birthday doll had arrived my nineteenth year doll When my father brought it inside the house it had smashed into a hundred separate piecesInside there was a diary entry on a piece of paperWe spent the entire day smashing open every porcelain doll and the entire night speaking with the policeAlexander had written diary entries for every time he had drugged and molested me each more explicit admitting that he had done the same to his daughter up until the time of her horrible death My father and I hadnt a dry eye in our house that entire night and I continued to have problems throughout my college career knowing that Alexander was somewhere out there probably assuming a new identity and doing the same thing to other girlsNow I know why he had always commented on me taking such usual long napsFollowhttpswwwfacebookcomDaydreamPublishing,Birthday Presents,714
honeymoonatthefalls,59,123,1r0fus,539,The falls have a pull according to the locals  Something dark and unearthly like a sirens song sweet and somehow terrible  It draws people of a certain intent  Thats the polite way to say a lot of people end up crushed on the rocks below their limbs torn apart by the unending rush of water the brains that made them who they were nothing more than bits of foam and meat floating to the surface   a year in fact depending on who you askWe were happy  Werent we  I thought we were  I thought maybe we were different from everyone else that wed actually make it  We wouldnt end up in that  statistic  Wed grow old together laughing at the same stupid jokes knowing what was going to come out of the others mouth before they even had a chance to say itWas it the pressure of the wedding  The fact that Im still between jobs  Young somethings in one of Americas bleakest economies doing what we could to get by  Scrambling for every scrap as the magazine covers reminded us how worthless our generation is the snide remarks about our smartphones and Facebook and selfies  Maybe getting married wasnt a good ideaBut we were in love  We were in love and we knew deep down in that secret place in our stomachs that she was the one for me and I for herSo then why did it happenNo  Im not supposed to ask that anymore  Im supposed to accept that shes gone  Im supposed to accept the fact that shes her own statistic now one of  people a year  Another tumble of bones on the body count thats reached over  since the falls became an attraction both for tourists and people with death on their mindBut its hard to accept when I can still see her face so clearly that sweet heartshaped face with the little crescentmoon scar on her left nostril the way her big blue eyes lit up when she showed me the fantastic deal she scored on Groupon a Niagara Falls getaway for our honeymoonIf only I could go back  Tell her that the price was nice but Id rather go to a beach or Ireland it doesnt matter anywhere but those cursed fallsIts impossible to describe how it feels to stand at the crest of Niagara the mist peppering your face like cold little kisses drinking in the smells and the sound and the remarkable way the water rushes down down ever down  Your existence seems like a cosmic joke in comparison to this almost hauntingly beautiful feat of nature  For a moment it isThe locals say you can tell who has a death wish by how close theyll get to the edge  Those who shy away who shake their heads and insist nervously that they can see just fine from where they are thank you very much those are the ones who cant trust themselves to get too close  If they get too close to the edge some little part of them knows theyll jumpShe didnt shy away  She went right up to the railing  She was smilingThats the worst part  She was smilingIt was early in the morning one of those damp gray dawns only possible in the new spring of upstate New York  We had the sight to ourselves  It was a little spooky being out there alone the kind of spooky you get from being in an empty shopping mall after hours all those metal gates pulled down and the lights turned offShe was standing there a little too high on the guardrail leaning just a little too far over smiling as the mist touched her lips and made her hair curl in damp little tendrils on her cheeks  She was beautifulIll never know why I pushed herThats something I have to acceptWe dont sleephttpwedontsleepanthologytumblrcom,Ill never know why it happened Thats something I have to accept,662
yurglar,64,92,1qrlzl,389,This is a true story and by all means I am fully aware all stories on this website are true however I am also fully aware of the suspicion natural to people upon hearing something beyond their comprehension The case Im about to relate to you is one of those situations where reason and logic mean nothing when compared to the facts and I wish to find someone who believes me here I am a doctor a pathologist normally in charge of autopsies and anatomical studies at a highly regarded university its name is not relevant for the narrative I am writing here in this site because all my doctored friends do not believe a single word I tell them and I have also been threatened of losing my post at both the morgue and the university I do know however that I am perfectly saneThe events began when I took a trip alone as I have no close family to the north of Europe to Sweden It was not on holidays the University of Uppsala invited me to give teach there an offer which I quickly accepted I needed the money and Uppsala was quite a prestigious university boasting  Nobel Laureates However I did not stay in Uppsala I stayed at a town further north near a forest a beautiful and serene place just half an hour away I stayed in an old typical Swedish house painted red with a dark rooftop and a small garden There was something odd about it but I ignored it I should never have done so I stayed there a few nice months opening bodies and examining entrails until it started getting cold and the ravens started circling around the village crops The leaves were starting to fall and there was something ominous about the whole village atmosphere People seemed sullen and shut in old ladies gave me hateful looks and kids avoided my path like I was some kind of pedophile I was starting to think the townsfolk were avoiding me for some reason and upon reaching that conclusion I decided to talk to the only friend I had there named Father Erik the local priest I told him about the townsfolk behavior as he was the only man who did not show any signs of being afraid of me He looked at me and I remember he smiled his teeth shining through his thin lips They think you are this years Midvinterblot Midwhat I replied Father Erik then explained it to me how in this place back in the Viking age and throughout the middleages had a ritual performed here where men were chosen to be sacrificed to please the old Norse gods Midwinter blood Father Erik Ragnerson said slowly like the words meant anything to me And how is that related to what I told you I asked as politely as I can He shook his head Youre not from here you wouldnt understand These people think he chuckled think the dead come back every nine years to claim another sacrifice another Midvinterblot I saw the Christian disbelief in his green eyes and the same disbelief was also in mine pale blue eyes Viking dead I asked somehow amused to which he responded affirmatively I cannot remember his words correctly adding that the souls of previous Midvinterblots are the responsible for the collection of yet another We quickly shifted the conversation as another proof of how foolish town superstition is something global and went through several beers to which he did not say no in spite of being a man of GodThat night I returned home from the church slightly dizzy with the beverage There was snow all over and I held my scarf over my nose afraid it would freeze My house was at the end of the road and I kept walking steadily I remember as if it had been yesterday the shivers that ran down my spine as I head distant loud horns playing and ululating voices Coming from the dark from the forest The streetlamps flickered and I closed my eyes shut and when I opened them the sound was gone with the wind I thought back then the cold was just messing with my brain so as soon as I got home I drank hot tea and sat in front of the fireplace I googled all Father Erik Ragnerson had told me and confirmed it Then with some curiosity I accessed the towns morgue register That was one of the privileges my profession had Running through the names there was an odd pattern I ran my hand through my hair and that time the hair on the back of my neck prickled Every nine years a person had been found dead in gruesome circumstances in the snow of Midwinter However suicides were far more common in Sweden than car crashes where I come from and the police never paid it any heed That was when I should have left but my stubborn mind refused to see the evidence and I lingered until Midwinter finally arrivedThat day I had forgot about all the townsfolk nonsense and was busy in my study drawing an anatomical diagram when someone knocked on my door As a precaution I had become weary of serial killers or general psychos and went to the kitchen grabbed a butchers knife and opened the door to find a small old wrinkled woman looking up at me Hello I asked inquisitively the knife hidden behind my back Wear this tonight For Midvinterblot She held out a white tunic to me I remember snapping angrily at her telling the few Swedish insults I knew and grabbed the tunic from her shriveling hands hellbent on burning the thing The woman walked away and when she turned her head she had the ugliest expression I have seen in this world an expression of hate disgust and cruelty combined Angrily I kept working until I fell asleep on top of the table only to be awoken by a man on the TV announcing a starless night That is when the knock came As soon as it hit my door I felt my heart sink the TV went quiet and all the lights candles and illumination were gone with wisps of smoke I stood up gulped nervously and rationally grabbed the butchers knife still standing near me from my encounter with the old woman earlier I took cautious steps to the door and inhaling deeply opened it with a full swingThe image that was before my eyes still haunts me today A procession of people walking in the snow along the village road dressed in white tunics all shaven and either with their throats slit or limbs chopped of All of them were pale wore blank expressions and had dirt all over them like they had literally rose from their graves The drums sounded loud and all was silent but from their thud As soon as I opened the door they all stopped and turned their heads to me at once some in impossible angles twisted and turned Screaming I closed the door The townsfolk were hiding in their homes afraid and I remember how quickly the dead began to bang on my door on my walls Thinking quickly I came up with the stupidest idea I dressed the white tunic took some white powder I had in the bathroom and ran to the backyard and around the house pretending to be another one of the dead As I struggled through the thick snow my heart stopped when one of the dead turned its shaved head which I remember was painted with dark patterns and circles and spoke to me in a deep voice something so obscure it still shivers me today For some reason he seemed regal as if he was the commander of the procession He said something in old Swedish a harsh voice from the afterlife impossible to describe in words I nodded instinctively almost pissing myself and the man turned away and kept walking towards my houseI ran as soon as he was a good distance away my feet burning in the snow and my entire body turning purple with the cold I remember knocking at Father Eriks house and how he opened the door I remember taking a shower and crying in front of him like a baby as I told him how I had luckily escaped After I recovered somehow Father Erik still eyed me with disbelief The man actually talked to you Yes he bloody did I snapped angrily What did he say the calm still rational priest asked Surely he had heard the drums I though I told him the words the dead had said in old Swedish and I saw his face go pale and his eyes widen What does it mean I asked half afraid of the answer It means Father Erik said trembling Death awaits the heathen priest I dismissed his superstitions trying to convince him there were more priests in the surrounding villages and the next day I left Sweden Father Erik Ragnerson and the town behindYesterday after nine years I received a mail from Swedish authorities telling me how a man had been brutally nailed to the front door of my previously owned house in Sweden and that they would desire to ask me some questions His name was Erik Ragnerson,Midvinterblot,481
narrativeofthelife,79,264,1qv1z1,377,I might be a big fat idiot but I didnt think anything was wrong when the CAPTCHA Are you Human screen told me to kill one of my roommatesI was trying to stream Twilight online but I want you to know right now that its not because I actually like the movie I was drunk and needed something to laugh at okayAnyway I was past three shots of rum when the CAPTCHA

movie while our other roommate Ava did homework in her roomI was hungover in the morning so I stayed in bed and streamed more movies It was time for Breaking Dawn except this time I was actually interested in Bella and Edwards relationship Dont judge I was sprawled in my bed weakly navigating to the stream page when another CAPTCHA appearedKILL AVAI narrowed my eyes What the fuck I forgot about Breaking Dawn and sat up rubbing at my eyes At this point it wasnt funny anymore it was just weird Ava isnt a very common name and what kind of sick CAPTCHA algorithm would generate stuff like

gone and Ava was usually at the Souths most annoying megachurch NewStart Yes the churchs name has two exclamation points in it I heard some rustling on the other side of the apartment Ava mustve skippedYo Ava I yelled Maybe CAPTCHA went all NSA on me Come on I want to show you somethingYeah She rounded the corner into my room wearing her usual placated smileI spun around the laptop on my lap to face her I tilted the screen so she could read and as I did her expression dropped from a smile to neutral as stoneI watched her expression with one of those eager dog faces after you show someone something funnyShe punched me in the mouthI whipped over the side of the bed and smacked on the floor eyes rolling to Ava for a split second before she kicked me hard in the stomachI retched and rolled over scrabbling to get up hair in my eyes and my heart thumping She was screaming the entire time this shrill onenote screech kicking me over and over again As she rolled back for another kick my mind suddenly snapped into action I threw myself to my desk and she threw herself at me screaming and scratching at my eyes I grabbed the knife in my desk and jammed it in her shoulder She screamed dislodging herself before running out of my roomI stood shaking before lunging at my door to lock it I drew back and caught my face in my mirror my mouth was dribbling blood and I was missing a front tooth I looked like a hillbilly Whatever I already go to college in South Carolina Deal with that laterNothing that happened in the past five minutes made any sense but I knew that I had to get out of the house I couldnt stay locked up in the apartment with herI grabbed my tote bag and pocketknife before waiting at my door for a minute listeningNothingKnife in hand I cracked my door open and looked

whispersFIRSTANDLASTfirstandlastfirstandlastnonononononononononononoFirst and last Uh no thank youI rushed past her door and out the front door to the apartment complex I decided to go to my friend

the door on the first knock giving my hillybilly mouth the stinkeye Kierra what the hell happened to your faceAva beat me upWhatI pushed past him and dumped my stuff on his couch before grabbing paper

mofoWas she drunk he askedNo You know she doesnt get drunk I was getting antsy I tossed the paper towel in the trashcan once the bleeding steamed The whole thing seemed completely batshit Ava was

thorninhisside,78,176,1qtj6z,353,I dont know if what I saw was true But Im pretty sure it was You might think me mad but Ive read loads of accounts of people on the internet where people who have had shit like this happen to the recount it for others to read And now Im doing the same So here goesSnapchat is a fun little app where people take selfies and send them to each other I used Snapchat pretty much every day to send pictures of myself doing stupid things to my friends and they would send pictures of themselves back That was up until that one afternoonI had just returned home after a long day at school made even longer by my friends absence due to his little brothers funeral so I decided to recline on the sofa and procrastinate on my IPad for a while As it usually did my procrastination took the form on messing about on Snapchat I had a few unopened pictures several of them from my friend who had been absent that day I opened them Each of them was a selfie of him in his room after the funeral He looked like shit I guess he just wanted sympathy from the many girls he was looking to hook up with So I sent him a picture of me with a message attached saying Chin up man It wasnt long until he replied He just replied with a sombre image of himself and a simple message saying thanks But something caught my eye for the briefest second  A pair of eyes sunken and dead peering out of his wardrobe I was a little shaken by this as I could not be sure that I saw what I saw For images sent via Snapchat can only be viewed for  seconds then theyre deleted I replied immediately Are you all right man With a picture of me trying not to look freaked out I waited anxiously for his reply When the little notification that I had  unread Snapchat popped up on my screen I was slightly nervous about opening it I was worried about what Id see I was worried about what was waiting for me Curiosity took the better of me  I opened the message Another picture of my friend and a simple message saying Yeah At this point my IPad froze leaving the picture message from my friend on the screen I couldnt do anything The home button didnt work nor did the lock button I was left with the image of my friend staring back at me  This gave my chance to view the picture with more depth After close inspection I saw nothing out of order No eyes in the wardrobe door In fact his wardrobe door was closed I was about to hook my iPad up to my computer to see if I could unfreeze my device when I noticed that my wardrobe door was wide open,Snapchat,529
TheeMikeG,19,57,1r4fsf,275,Dear MikeTheyre letting me write a letter so I figured Id get my story out thereIt was a routine night drop nothing different from what weve done countless times before The steady hum of the C as it tore through the clouds was the only thing keeping me calm Yeah Ive done this a lot but you can never get rid of the nerves before a mission We had an idea of what awaited us down there but we couldnt be a hundred percent sure People are unpredictable and thats scary The plan from higher was to have our five man team infiltrate by night drop a small village I cant pronounce to search for and capture or kill a HVT whose name I also cant pronounce The gunship would rise up and provide overwatch until we were extracted Airborne all the way hooah The LT joined us again which he decided to do from time to time Nice enough guy I respected him Was supposed to be having a baby girl soon he would always talk about it during PT Good for him I could never hold down a relationship for very long I figured it was just because Ive seen too much shit to be normal and cuddle or whatever the fuck it is that couples do The rest of the squad was the usual guys Mitch Craft and Burroughs All experts in their craft We were a solid group and Id take a bullet or hell even two for any of them Thirty seconds shouted the LT from the bench a few spots to my right closest to the door The jumpmaster heaved the door upward and the familiar sound of air whooshing past the plane made my heart jump There was always a kick Hook up he shouted We all stood up in unison and clipped our static lines to the wire that ran through the plane above our heads I tugged on my static line to make sure it was attached There were no reserves for this one The jumpmaster held up his hand Five seconds The red light turned green and the LT positioned himself by the door The jumpmaster smacked his rear and the LT jumped out and was whisked away My stomach turned in knots Over a hundred jumps and I still hated this shit I was last to go out I tucked my head took a hop out of the plane and suddenly there was the rush and I felt myself getting tossed I heard my chute above and I breathed a sigh of relief Looking up to check my canopy I saw a fully inflated chute and I thanked the Lord once again I looked down for the rest of the squad and saw their chutes inflated too Past them I expected to see the ground but there was only a thick smoke or at least thats what it looked like A storm cloud Why didnt the jumpmaster hold off the jump until the bad weather passed Staus check I heard the LT ask through the radio As I watched the others canopies disappear into the black cloud I began to worry I heard the squad all check in though so I felt a little better  I held my hand up to my ear to activate our comms Sir whats the situation down thereZero visibility guys Pretty foggy Cant see my own canopy he saidThen I entered the black cloud and couldnt see a damn thing I heard something nearby Flapping My radio clicks before Mitch starts talking I heard something Flock of birdsWere too high replied the LT Eyes and ears open I tried to look around but there was no point I couldnt even see my canopy What if I was falling to my death right then Heavy flapping got my focus It sounded large whatever it was Sir something is up here with us I saySimmons stay calm whats gotten into Fuck Craft interrupts through the mic Then I hear a long painful scream far below me Jesus Christ yelled the LT Craft You thereSilence Not even static Guys stay calm Get ready to hit any minute I cant see the ground in this shit but well sort this out on the DZI checked my watch It takes maybe two minutes to hit jumping from a mile up Its been six minutes and I know this wasnt a HALO jump Was I caught in a thermal I pulled on my risers and felt myself drifting through the air When I released I didnt notice any change in descent speed The LT must have noticed the same thing because I could hear him cursing through the radio Theres a loud screech unlike anything Ive ever heard After it ended a few seconds later the LT had to shout over the commotion we were all making on the radio We were scared Guys I dont know what the fuck is going on but stay calm Weapons on amberMy combat gear was in a large sack between my legs but my USP was on my belt I took it out and held it ready I didnt know for what but I was ready to go How had we still not hit the ground yet Then I got an idea My combat load We are supposed to release if before landing and it slides down a twenty foot rope so we dont break our legs when we land I thought if I could cut it free maybe I could hear it hit the ground I asked for permission from the LT who quickly approved He must have been as freaked out as me to allow me to abandon my combat gear I pressed the handle on my hip and the gear slid down the rope and out of sight into the darkness I took out my knife and sawed at the line until it snapped I waited and waited but couldnt hear a thing I heard the flapping again and someone fired their weapon two three times Then silence Jesus Christ whispered the LT Status checkBurroughsSimmonsNothingSir what the fuck is going on I knew he wouldnt have an answer but I was desperate I have no ideaWe drifted through the air for ten more minutes Then I touched down I didnt hit hard it was like I was just set down Didnt even have to fall over I still couldnt see a damn thing though I heard quick steps and then Burroughs burst into view and tackled me to the ground He was frantic He begged me through tears to follow him We wandered around until we came to the LT He didnt have a right half of his body He was barely alive sputtering through bloody lips for us to run My baby my baby my baby he whispered over and over until he didnt say anything anymore The cloud cleared from the area behind him and there was this thing All I saw before I turned and ran was large leathery wings I heard the screeching and the flapping of those awful wings again Burroughs screamed as he was ripped backwards from beside me Somehow I burst out of the cloud and I saw headlights I nearly got hit by the jeep but dove out of the way just in time Out got two guards who spoke a language I didnt understand Burroughs was the translator They prodded me with machine guns and kicked and beat me until I was barely conscious How did they not see the thing behind me They dragged me into the back of their vehicle and drove me to their camp Ive been their POW for nearly a month now If you get this letter please get my story out there Im not crazy I promise I cant explain what happened any better than that Were not alone Something terrible is going on over here Time to go theyre beckoning me to come outside Its awfully dark out there Is a storm coming in ,Airborne Infantry,332
AmbiguousGopher,26,58,1r5xlc,275,For most of my life Ive been drawn to a certain room of my house A bedroom at the far end of my basement which used to be a guest bedroom I cant really explain why but I just always wanted to sleep there Until the age of  my older brother and I shared a room right across the hall from the bedroom of my parents When he was  however he moved into that bedroom and over the years the room become even more interesting The room is now filled with posters of The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix an authentic Spanish sword he bought hangs above his desk and loads of other bits and pieces which captured my imagination when I was younger To top it all off there was an air vent connecting his room and mine Almost directly below my room I could hear him some nights talking to his friends on the phone while playing video games late into the night I envied his freedom If I had tried that my parents right across the hall would hear me and Id be groundedWhen I was  myself my brother and sister twins left for college Now the only child at home I called my brother up one weekend and asked Can I have your roomMy brother paused for a long time before respondingNoHe gave no explanation but I didnt really care I could understand that when he came to visit Hed want his own room to sleep in For  more years i didnt ask to have the room again but when i was  my brother bought a house To me it seemed like he was pretty much beyond the point of having any reason to care about his old room so one day when he called to check up on things I asked againThis time he responded more quickly His voice sounded casual but at the same time It kinda freaked me out He saidNah let mom make it a guest room again Besides your room is super classy My room isnt that greatAnd so yet again I let it go I stayed in my room and didnt really think anything of it that is until last week This summer I started having severe anxiety attacks coupled with spells of incapacitating depression especially at night Ive been on different medicines to help and have been going to therapy to help work on relaxation techniques Last week my therapist noted that sometimes the brain can form associations with certain rooms or areas She suggested that my brain due to the recurring spells in my room may have formed a negative association with it She told me that switching rooms may help me relax when I start having an attackThat night I did it I switched to my brothers room and it was amazing Since my basement always stays around below room temperature the sheets and pillow stayed cool which was just to my liking I slept better than Id slept in weeks and thought that perhaps this room was going to turn things around But the second night didnt go as well I woke from a nightmare and felt as if there was someone watching me I shook the feeling and went back to sleep This kind of thing happened for a few more nights each time I awoke more worried than the last Then came the big one I fell asleep as usual and I began to dream another nightmare but this time it was more vivid In the dream I saw looking at my brother when he was only  or  years old He was sitting on his bed talking to something I couldnt see it but he was looking at an angle which suggested something much larger than himself Tears were flowing steadily from his eyes and he was pleading BEGGING the thing to go away to leave him alone The power in the room went out I heard a horrible screeching like a pig being tortured The lights turned back on and my brother lay there unconscious A large black bruise had appeared on his ribs The clock in his room recovered from the power outage blinking the numbers  My brother then jerked upright and walked over to the only poster in his room at the time his Hendrix poster He took a pen form his desk and put a tally mark on the wall behind itI jerked up in my brothers bed I turned on the lamp and looked around the room I noticed every poster Sweat started pouring from my forehead burning my eyes I looked at the clock The numbers blinked ,My Brothers Room,333
horriddaydream,37,132,1r0562,261,By the time that I was seventeen years old my parents sighed as they walked into my room one afternoon and told me that it was a necessity that I get my license I had been hanging onto that shitty little piece of paper for months that said that I could drive that meaningless little permit that meant nothing in comparison to the real deal My own license My reasoning behind waiting to get it I was terrified of the road despite the recognition others gave me that I was doing fairly well as only a permitted driver My father handed me the keys to his old Explorer that night with the promise of If you schedule your appointment and make it happen this SUV is yours And as far as I was concerned that was all I needed to hearThe license took a good four attempts Parallel parking was not right up my alley and every time I would exit the driving center with that smug look of sadness written across my face my father would pat me on the back and say Next time And he was right after that fourth time and only a few short months I had received my license and I exited the center that day smiling as I held up my temporary card flashing it to both of my parents them excitedly smiling and nodding at one another I drove them out for pizza right afterWe lived in a fairly disgusting country area even though my parents were welloff and lived on their own secluded road in a huge stone house that all my friends seemed to be quite envious of There was always your usual shit on the backroads to my house  dead animals trash things left behind from peoples midnight outdoor sex sessions including garments of clothing and used condoms I would shake my head and swerve out of the way for these things as carefully as possible protecting this SUV was a very important ordeal to me One day as I was driving into town from our backroad I came up around the corner and had no time to think as my eyes met with a cardboard box fairly large maybe even large enough to hold a large screen television In the blink of a second my car has collided with it and it took a few seconds for it to become apparent to me that I had hit HARD and whatever was inside it was now damaged all to hell My tires had shredded the box to pieces as I had seen it fly up in front of me as it got pulled along with the car I hadnt seen what was insideI was cursing up a storm inside my car as I pulled off to the side There were no houses around here and I felt uncomfortable with doing so because it was getting closer to night and I really didnt want to be back on a nearabandoned road checking out some stupid persons box contents and be picked up by some creep who would want to do whoknowswhat with meI turned off the car and slowly opened my door not looking into my mirror or anything before getting out I slammed my door and trudged back to the start of the bend where the box had been It was in that moments time that a part of me wished that I had  Either not gone back there or  Not even left the house that night to go pick up some measly groceries for my parents Nothing could compare to the feeling that struck my heart as I noticed the two small bodies ripped nearly to shreds in front of me two little children who had been alive and well probably playing inside of a box before I came along and completely fucked their day all to pieces They wore looks of total sadness on their faces from what I could make out a brother and a sister perhaps both with black hair and rags for clothing Underprivileged DeadThe trauma and torment I endured within the next few weeks was the worst experience of my life I worked alongside the police as these children went unidentified and nobody could piece together where these two children had come from I got little to no sleep at night wondering what their lives had been like what their parents were thinking wondering about where their two kids were Did they even care Had their parents been homeless and just left them alongside the road in a box and they had decided it would be worth a try to make a game out of it and push the box to the middle of the road I mean why One night I was getting a good nights sleep for once after this traumatizing incident and I heard a knock at the front door to our house I swept out into the hallway and noticed that my parents door at the far end of the hallway was still closed and that they hadnt heard the rapping which was usual because they were horribly heavy sleepers I ran downstairs as lightly and quickly as possible and opened the front door but to my surprise nobody was standing there as I had thought would be I assessed the situation and realized that it was stupid of me to answer the door in the middle of nowhere late at night but then I saw the box It was sitting off to the side of the porch and I leaned out of the door plucked it up and brought it into the house There was nothing on it It was light It was around the same size as the one that contained the childrenI took a kitchen knife and seized open the tape that held the box closed and again to my surprise noticed that the only thing inside it was a small piece of paper with writing on the insideMy heart skipped a beat I dropped it to the floor and screamed in sheer terror and panic until my parents were both at my side hugging me and comforting me Unwanted child Make a

theworldisgrim,42,79,1qsnvw,252,I was jolted awake about an hour ago confused and disoriented my heart was pounding and my sheets were soaked in sweat Some slavering malevolent horror was in the trailer with me creeping up on me while I slept with poised claws and razor teeth The absolute certainty of this coated my mouth with the metallic taste of fear sour and dry and thick I grabbed the baseball bat that lays beneath my cot and tiptoed around the cramped darkness of my trailer straining to hear over the keening of the wind outsideAnd the pounding of my own heart Of course there was nothing here except my goldfish and yours truly the sweaty guy in his underwear It was the gusting wind that startled me awake  it happens quite often in the late autumn and early winter The wind rips through the scrub of skeletal trees that surround the trailer park and charges with a lions roar into our lonely huddle of frail little shelters It gibbers and shrieks and pounds on our walls with fists of dead leaves and frozen gritSatisfied that I wasnt about to become chow for some unspeakable creature I laid back down on my squeaky saggy old cot and tried to get back to sleep  but I couldnt Instead I found myself thinking about that night in the penitentiary the night of the lockdown I kept thinking about Mikey and Big Rob and the rest of them all of us huddled in a cell with the lights off and the frigid northwest winds howling at the walls After a while I gave up trying to sleep Instead I sat down in front of the computer and I started typing Im no story teller not like Mikey or Hutch but Ill try my bestWhen I first came to the Pen the thing that struck me the most about the place was just how much the cons talk On the occasions when Id served time in the County jail there had been talk sure but it was terse and impersonal   when theyre only serving a few months I guess a lot of people feel the situation is too temporary to bother forging any ties with their fellow inmates Youd play cards with your cellie or youd sit in the day room and watch TV in relative silence the only time that there would ever be any noise or action was when a scrap broke out over a card game Fights were the only thing that passed as excitement in County every other moment of the day was comprised of dull boring nothing Going in you just hoped that the food wouldnt be too bad and that your cellie wouldnt end up being a gang member or a methhead biker waiting out a long patch of dead time People in other words who might beat the shit out of you as a way to pass the hoursThe Pen though  its an incredibly noisy smelly vocal environment I remember very clearly the moment when my little group of new arrivals were let out of the Fish Tank and into our new home a pod housing two hundred inmates I was overwhelmed by the deafening din of voices and activity when the hacks marched us bundles in hand out onto the range Of course there were the obligatory catcalls and wolfwhistling but most of the cons seemed completely oblivious to us  they were too busy living the ebb and flow of penitentiary lifeOf course this was not actually true Cons see everything And I mean everything But they talk even moreMy first cellie wanted both my bale and my ass in that order That wasnt happening I hammered him in the mouth and it was on  the fight spilled out of the cell and into the corridor of the pod He was a big tough old bull but I had him leaking and his confidence was shaken Before the COs got to us Id managed to get the nasty old fuck facedown onto the floor and was whamming away on the back of his head and neck like a jackhammer Then the hacks got there and one of them laid a size twelve boot upside my skull The kick knocked my brain clear over the Moon the world immediately went out of focus and it stayed that way for almost twelve hours I spent the next three weeks in the Hole for fighting and when I got out I was placed in a different pod Word had got around that this fish wasnt exactly new and that I had a mean rightcross no one bothered to try and roll up on me in the yard that day and when I sat down at chow with my new cellie and some of his boys no one objected I had been checked and Id passed the test I wasnt a punk or a sissy I could sit with the menYeah its a different world the Pen is and it has wildly different rules You couldnt fully understand unless youve been thereIt wasnt long before I settled into a routine up for headcount and chow off to work in the laundry chow nap work out chow  and then the struggle to fill the dead hours between supper and lightsout There wasnt much to do The cons played cards betting with tobacco bales purchased from the commissary and individual handrolled smokes Some watched TV and others watched the wall Some watched each other tensions were always high between the rival gangs Dope fiends spiked what they liked to spike in the bathrooms Daddies took their sugarboys into rented cells or the showers and they got some asspussy while a homeboy held watch for the copsAnd there was of course a lot of talk Talk of family back home women had and lost of misdeeds proudly done There were enough stories flying around that place to fill a library My cellie was an old con named Mikey He had originally been sentenced to fifteen years for seconddegree murder during a robbery  but he had gotten into so much trouble since landing in the Pen that hed managed to acquire an additional ten years on top of that Mikey was doing all day and hed made peace with that fact  a good cat all in all a straight shooter who didnt fuck with the spike The thing was hed kill just about anyone if he got it into his head that he wanted to In earlier years Mikey had been a triggerman for the bikers Hed been convicted for the murders of six people and was a suspect in sixteen others  and I can well imagine that a number of them had probably been friends of his at one point or another In certain circles a good friend can become your murderer in the blink of an eyeThats the kind of people you do time with in Maximum securityMikey and his crew liked nothing better than to spend a Sunday evening crowded up in someones cell drinking Pruno and shooting the shit Personally I didnt care much for the hooch  it tasted like rotting garbage with a heavy fruit bouquet  but the stories were welcome When Mikey or one of his homeboys were on a roll we could all forget ourselves and be somewhere else for a little while As far as cons go they were good fuckin guys they were and these bull sessions were the glue that held Mikeys crew together I remember watching and listening for hours on end spellbound as Mikey or Big Rob or whoever wove a tapestry of words in the thin air around us Theyd make us roar with laughter clench in rage and even silently choke up in sadness Some of those guys could play a mans emotions like a violin with their storytelling They were masters of the formMost of the time the stories were pretty coarse which was to be expected  look where they were coming from and occasionally they were downright fucking horrifying But  theres one in particular that I can remember word for word quite literally I can actually close my eyes and see Mikey and Rob Hutch and the rest of them sitting there in the cell that night all of us bathed in the sickly red glow of the emergency lights and transfixed by what we were being told This particular story likes to pop up in my head in the small dead hours of the night when the harsh winds of drab old November lash and rock my rusty little trailer hard enough to wake me up as they did tonightCoincidentally it was on a November night just like this when I heard this story I was about a year into my fouryear sentence for armed robbery and this was my second winter in the Pen I recall that the goddamned wind was cutting through the walls really badly that night and the drafts were freezing our toes solid There had been a murder that day and the whole Pen was on lockdown all five pods and the Protective Custody unit too Big Rob Hutch was a man who had his ear to the ground and he had known that the lockdown was imminent we had just enough time to make preparations for what was coming Happy for a chance to hang out and get fucked up seven of us quickly herded into his cell with our bedding snacks from the commissary and as much gear as we could get our hands on I remember that we were all wrapped up in our thin scratchy blankets like convict burritos The blankets were grey and made of rough wool upon checking into the Razor Wire Inn you were issued one and one only In the winter blankets were at a premium Men would fight for them sometimes even kill for themMikey and Big Rob were both sitting on the lower bunk Coltrane and his kid Remmie had the top one I was freezing my ass on the floor along with Nick and Richie The young pups had to sit on the floor thats just the way it was The old cons got to snuggle their asses into the relative comfort of the thin mattresses that covered the squeaky springslats and in Coltranes case the old cons bitch as well We werent complaining out loud about it though  we knew better than to do thatBig Rob was a trustee and one of his duties was to mop the floors in the prison morgue He was telling us what had happened when the coroner performed his autopsy on Stutters Stutters was a junkie who had been suspected of ratting out various other cons to the cops in exchange for smack He was the reason why the entire Pen was on lockdown He had been discovered in his bunk after lunch dead as dayold dogshit and full of ragged holes The shiv was found in a toilet in the shower room It had been made from plastic bags heated to melting with a Bic then compressed to form a sturdy sharp little weapon So Im mopping up by where they keep the gurneys and down the hall the doors open a bit so I can see the Doc leaning over Stutters on the table Hes humming and singing to himself like usual and Im smiling at how shitty his voice is when all of a sudden the Doc says Holy shit wouldja lookit that and then he starts gagging and retching Then  get this  then he actually screams  for real he fuckin screamed  and he yells Jesus Christ its all over my fucking arm He runs outta the room and down the other hall and Im like What the fuck is that all about I heard him yelling for his assistants or whatever they are the younger ones They all come runnin back and I heard one of the assistants say Oh fuck you gotta be kiddin me Then the smell hits me from all the way down that longass hallway and its putrid boys  it smelled like a combination of rotting flesh and an old shithouse in August I had to grab my nose and run the fuck outta there Worst thing I ever smelledNick asked What was it from and shifted uncomfortably where he sat beside the toilet  He was a good bit younger than me hed just celebrated his twentieth birthday a few months ago It was his first time in and hed drawn the fuckin short straw  fifteen years eight before hed be considered for parole His uncle fortunately for Nick was also serving time in the same facility he was an upperechelon Hells Angel who ruled both B Pod and C Pod with an iron fist As a result Nick was getting the easiest ride a firsttimer to the Pen ever had Coltrane and Mikey had personally welcomed the kid into the crew as per the old mans orders He was freshfaced and physically soft I occasionally wonder if hed ever really known just how bad it could have been for him in thereApparently Big Rob said lowering his voice to a husky stage whisper Stutters was getting checked for pokes and track marks pretty regular because he got busted so much for possession So he started shooting in his ass But not like in his asscheek ya dig I mean right into the wall of his rectum He was shooting it right inside his fuckin asshole man Can you imagine that Pretty soon he developed a fuckin horrible abscess Because of all the fecal bacteria and crap that was living up his old dirt road the abscess got infected real bad After a while it skinned over with a crust of white blood cells and gross stuff and ballooned out into a giant pusbubble That bubble got so big that it eventually closed up the poor fuckers ass and I mean right fuckin shut He was apparently going around like that for weeks man for real Weeks It musta hurt like a bitch  so the Doc saw something kinda bubbling out of the dead fuckers asshole and he prodded at it with his scalpel and pop Out gushes a metric fuckload of bloody green pus full of dead bacteria and stinkin like the Devils ballsackAw fuck thats just dirty man Mikey groaned and mimed throwing up all over Hutch We were all wrinkling our noses in disgust and shaking our heads Dirty was not nearly adequate for this disgusting imageThat aint it though my friend  that aint it The worst part he continued was the fact that Stutters had been bunged up with this fuckin pus balloon for a few weeks or so yknow It stopped up his shitcanal When the Doc popped that thing with his scalpel  aw hell It was a literal shitstorm It spurted out of his ass like a highpressure hoseWe regarded that image for a moment or two in stunned silence I felt a bit illSo  fucking  DIRTY Mikey roared and despite what Id just heard I had to laugh Coltrane and the others joined in Remmie just looked disgusted He was filing his nails Remmie was no longer just another cellblock punk a weaker man that traded what he had to trade in order to get by in world dominated by strength in recent months hed gone and went fullblown sissy After a year or so of enduring the subservient female role at the receiving end of Coltranes hogleg Coltrane was in fact the one whod turned Remmie out in the first place hed finally stopped playing the part of a woman and was now living it  It was apparent that hed started taking illicit female hormones his arm hair had thinned out and it seemed that he had recently grown the barest suggestion of breasts beneath his orange jumpsuit By the time I got out of the Pen Remmie had changed his name to Rhianne and was the wife of get ready for this none other than Nicks uncle the unofficial King of Pods B and C Rhianne was known for causing savage fights amongst inmates who were vying for his attention That incidentally was exactly how Coltrane ending up earning an unexpected early parole  a backdoorparole as they call it Because you dont leave through the front gate when youre deadSo the Doc got shit on by a corpse said Richie in a slow and dreamy tone It was puscovered shit Thats fucked up man Hey  do ya think that happens a lot to him Or like was that the first time Richie had snorted some hydromorphone earlier and now he was somewhere in the clouds floating around with a stoned grin on his face Richie thats just fuckin  Mikey trailed off Actually its a good question Want some hootch boysI was just opening my mouth to say Fuck no and then there was a POP and everything was dark The cons began yelling and hooting all across the pod both tiers on both sides Big Rob yelled Shut up ya fuckin idiots Its just a blackout fer Christs sake pipe the fuck down and for a wonder some of them actually did The thing was Big Rob Hutch was  well just that Big He was as big as a buffalo I was surprised that the lower bunk could support both Rob and Mikey who was not exactly small himselfThe emergency lights snapped on soft and red and eerie It made the common area of C Pod look like a scene from an apocalyptic horror movie We could see the guard standing there in the guard hut through the bulletproof glass waiting to see how the cons were going to react to the power going out during a lockdown now not only were we being sequestered in our cramped little cells for an indeterminable length of time we had also been rendered unable to properly read a book a number of the cons could actually read and did or see your hand while playing cards or even listen to the radio for Christs sake The hack was a dark figure swathed in dim red his body language alert and poised for action Im pretty sure it was Robson who was the boss on hut duty that night Robson was a deadeyed squarejawed oaf without an ounce of empathy in his whole body  and he just so happened to have a twelvegauge shotgun on hand with a modified choke I fervently hoped that no one would take it into their heads to start some serious shit  because if they did there was a good chance wed all regret itThere was a lot of hollering and doorkicking around the pod but it soon became apparent that the ruckus was just for show and was halfhearted at best We all silently thanked Whoever might be listening that the Emergency Reaction Team wasnt going to be called in The ERT didnt fuck around Kevlarsuited and anonymous in their visored helmets theyd march into the pod and indiscriminately barge into cell after cell busting heads and whapping out teeth with their batons Hell you might even get shot  and the ERT shoot to killRichie broke the silence Man I was gettin real worried there for a minute If the fuckin Goon Squad busted in here and found all our shit wed be dicked Richie was doing six years for selling pills the sentence for a secondtime loser Oxycontin and Hydrocodone were his chemicals of choice Faced with the boredom of prison life hed started using the products he sold He was a straightup junkie by Christmas of that year Mikey didnt care about anyone using junk  would even have a little snort here and there himself  but he didnt like addicts not one bit He cut Richie out of the crew Addled by junk plagued by debt weak and alone Richie ended up bunking with some fellas from the top tier across from us The black tier In a maximumsecurity penitentiary this has unpleasant connotations Business might occur between the color lines but thats generally where any benign fraternization ends You might not be racist when youre on the outside but when youre inside you dont have much choice To be blunt its like this if youre white you stick with the whites The black and Hispanic cons dont want to be your buddy and vice versa There are for a variety of reasons a large number of hostilities between the color lines Theyll stomp the shit out of you  or worse When we got word that Richie had been seen walking his face cast down up the stairs to that second tier  well we knew Richie had heavy debts Forced to either trade himself or die Richie had chosen lifeJesus I felt horrible for how it ended for Richie I still do His desperate last bid to cling to his wretched mortal existence only prolonged the inevitable he was dead within a month One day after enduring his morning gangrape something must have finally snapped in Richies head His will to live crumbled and fell Richie stayed behind while his tormentors went down for morning chow and he stuck a spike in his arm for the last time High as a kite Richie then hung himself from the corner post of the top bunk He did it with a rope made of knottedtogether socksIm rambling now arent I Sorry I do that sometimes  youll just have to bear with me I guess Im not a good at this not like Mikey or Hutch Im just a lonely guy who cant sleep some nights when the shrieking wind could be mistaken for the wailing of lost souls shaking and rattling the windows in their frames Even though I was released from the Pen fifteen years ago I cant shake the feeling that Im somehow still inside But I suppose that were all imprisoned by something on some level arent we On nights like tonight my prison is this rusty trailer Its my pathetic menial job My divorce My raw redeyed fury unfocused and impotent Its sorrow and regret On nights like tonight my prison is the past and my inability to leave it behindSo there we all were sitting there in the weird red gloom and listening to all the yelling and bullshit slowly die down Richie abruptly went on the nod Nick balanced a shoe on his head We all chuckled Coltrane started talking about the hockey game that was about to start then abruptly shut up We were on lockdown with no electricity  there would be no hockey game that night not for us We passed a jay around and when that one was roached we passed anotherFinally Mikey spoke up and broke the silence So  whos up for some Twilight Zone shit tonight I gotta good one for ya You remember the last time the power went out HutchHutch shot him a dark look then did something very unusual for a hardened con  he shuddered You wanna tell the boys that story I dunno man Why not Fuck the lights are out and the winds ahowlin out there Perfect time for it Okay fuck it Lets do it Big Rob cleared his throat and said Okay boys its time for a scary story Crowd around the fuckin campfire and grabba cup of this fine wineIts more of a brandy I think Hutch Mikey grinned and offered me some Reluctantly I accepted a Styrofoam cup of the murky eyewatering stuff and steeled myself to swallow it I was feeling a bit happier now  Ive always been a fan of spooky storiesHis voice stern Mikey growled Okay first things first  this shit is one hundred percent true Got it Were not bullshitting about any of this For real So dont tell us that were full of shit or you can go have a fuckin sleepover with that asshole over in the Hack ShackGot it Richie grunted then flopped over onto the floor He was out of itThis all went down a long time ago before any of you were here At least twelve years Id say MikeyYeah fer sure At least that long Back when these little punks were still givin out handjobs in Juvie haIt was a while back anyways Me and Mikey here were both running with different crews back then into different shit but we knew each other I guess I woulda been about your age he said pointing down at me So one day The Fish Tank had just been emptied out into the pod and theres a new fish with em that immediately starts turning heads I was playing checkers on the tier upstairs when they all came walking through the gate looking like a bunch of lost little lambs down there on the range They came toddling in behind a couple of the hacks and at the end of the line is the prettiest little sweetboy this whole penitentiary has ever seen I dont play no grabass like Coltrane up there but this kid  he was I dunno  almost like an angel or something He was too perfect like a picture out of a magazine yknow Slender and fairhaired teenybopper heartthrob material Yeah the kid was pretty all right and he looked like hed be easy to punkBig Rob took a moment to pause and force back a swig of the awful cloying Pruno a noxious blend of fermented fruit sugar packets and yeast As he grimly swallowed it down Mikey jumped in and continued the story The new fish immediately drove the whole pod completely fuckin nuts The wolves were losing their minds for real The guards were looking worried  a pretty kid like that can cause a lot of hard feelings between the bulls Hard feelings usually turn into murder So they released the other fishies to the care of the boss at the guard hut then hustled the prettyboy off to Protective Custody postfuckinhaste They kept him there for a few days but the wolves didnt forget about him not for a moment All the time theyre asking about the kid to the trustees who had access to PC Theyre asking if the kids lonely if he wants a candy bar or a fuckbook or a baggie of fuckin horse whatever the kid might possibly want  theyre handing the trustees love notes to give to him money weed all kinds of shit Finally a con named Holbrook called in some heavy favours and the hacks moved the kid back into the pod More to the point into Holbrooks cell I remember watching as the hacks walked the young fella across the pod and up the stairs to his new home The kid had no expression in those wide blue eyes None at all Just  blankHolbrook was a big greasy son of a bitch real nasty You could smell him from twenty feet away Complete psycho that guy Man Ill tell ya  watching as Brookie grinned and waited at the door of his cell for his new little bunkbuddy to arrive hell  it made me feel sorry for the kid He was planning do bad things to the boy you could see it in that grin He was gonna hurt im No expression at all though on that kids face I remember thinking that the fishie was either brave as fuck or just too stupid to understand what was in store for himRob tossed back the rest of the hootch in his Dixie cup and tried not to gag Gah this shit is just fuckin awful Who brewed this His voice sounded dry and burntOur fine neighbours just down the hall thats who Mikey chuckled They managed to hide it in the toilet tank long enough to get er finished and holy Jesus aint it nastyFuck I think Im going blind already Hutch held out his cup and Mikey poured him another glurt out of the plastic bag taking care to make sure that the sock he was using as a filter didnt slip out and spill rotting fruit cocktail all over the bunk I tried a sip of mine and almost retched They all had a good hardeehar at this  except for Richie I guess Richie was still laying on the floor his eyelids fluttering and twitchingIt broke more than a few hearts to see Holbrook get his dirty hooks into the kid first He would wreck the kids asshole and destroy his soul that was the general consensus Come morning theyd be rolling the kid out to the infirmary and afterward probably stick him back into PC for a twentyfourhour suicide watch Even if he did come back to the pod again no one would want the kid not after the permanent damage that Brookie was liable to do to himSee how lucky you are Coltrane said to Remmie and the little Frenchman smiled down at his nails in response Then kept filing them delicately with all of his concentration Every now and then I wonder if Remmie was already planning the flirtations and indiscretions that would inevitably result in Coltranes murder his skull smashed in with a twentypound dumbbell in the weight pit Coltrane the bull queer who had taken Remmies manhood and eventually transformed him into something that hed probably never wanted to be  thinking about it now Im pretty sure he was And I cant blame him for itRob told us I heard screaming that night It was muffled but I could still hear it So did my cellie  back then it was old Johnny Franzini I whispered up at him Hey you hear that shit man Fuck thats awful and he answered real matteroffact That boy he hadda know it was coming hey Hes too pretty like a girl to be here in this place He should have never come here As if the guy had fuckin volunteered or something I just shook my head and told Johnny to go to sleep I felt so bad for the kid yknow I think that was one of the worst nights I ever had in hereI heard it too Mikey interjected  I think we all did including the bosses on duty that night But no one went to check on him cuz money makes the fuckin rules around here not the Warden or the government Its money I dont doubt that the sick fuck offered big coin for the kid And some cold son of a bitch sold him without a second thoughtHutch nodded sourly Moneys a whore Thats okay though cuz theres a thing called karma too When morning came lo and behold Brookie aint standing outside his cell waitin to be accounted for Neither is the kid A whisper popped up real quick and spread down the lines like the breeze and it said Holbrook went apeshit on the kid last night n killed him Hes waiting in his cage for the ERT to come in and bust his head The boss doing the head count paused at Holbrooks cell and every con craned his head to see what was gonna happen next all of us in unison I seen the hack pull out his radio with one hand and his club with the other He started talkin real fast into his radio at the same time hes slowly walking towards the door of Brookies cell with his club poised to bash a skull in like hes trying to ward someone off He started yelling for the other hacks to get the fuck over there pronto They all came thundering past with their keys jangling and their boots clomping and then we all got ordered to step back into our cells with empty bellies I heard em down there at Brookies cell yelling into their radios and stomping around and then I heard someone barf I heard the puke splatter on the tilesWe had to stay in our cells for a few hours and there was a lot of bitching I remember being totally completely pissed at Holbrook me and Johnny Eff Wed assumed that hed gone psycho on the new fish and cut the kids throat while he was fuckin him or some shit like that But then some of the emergency response guys came past wheeling a gurney and when they wheeled it past us again you coulda knocked me flat with a peashooter  because it was Holbrook strapped in there not the kid I only saw him for a few seconds but I remember that his face was fucked It was mostly gone Stripped right down to bloody sinew and bones No skin or muscles left It was fucking gruesome I kinda gasped out loud and even closemouthed crookednosed old Johnny Franzini had to look twice and say Eh what the fuck They only way I knew it was him was the hair  a big greasy mop of it like a caveman The sheet covering the body was soaked right through with his blood I think that the rest of him had matched his faceNick whistled and said Fuck man thats hardcore then sparked another joint We floordwellers had almost forgotten about the discomfort of our numb behinds and tingling feet wed forgotten the lockdown and the power outage and even poor Stutters whod not only died a violent death but had also died with his ass blocked up by a cystic sore the size of a mans fist Mikey and Hutch were telling a story and we were living it you know what I mean We were right thereMikey said Mustve been five minutes later the cops are rolling this crazylooking thing down the block and Im like What the fuck is that to my cellie but he dont know either Before too long they roll it past again and Im like Ohhhhh shit lookit this You ever see Silence of the Lambs The dollycart thing that they strap Anthony Hopkins into when theyre moving him Yeah thats exactly what it was  and theyve got the kid strapped into it Bitemask and everything And the kid is just soaked in blood man It was dripping off his clothes and I could hear it pattering on the floor behind him It left a trail on the floorThey let us out for breakfast about a halfhour after that but by then it was almost lunch and we got served a fuckedup mix of warm lunch and cold breakfast There was more talking going on than eating though  and everyone was saying the same thing we were all saying What the fuck did the kid do to im Most people thought that he mustve gotten hold of Brookies shiv somehow then sliced the fuckers shit right off Whittled him right down to the bone But  Brookie was a really big dude and the guy was a crazy motherfucker How a skinny little bitch like that could have overpowered a bad dude like Holbrook so easy  well we didnt knowThe joint travelled across the floorfolk and was then handed up to the bunks Mikey hit it hard and made that funny choking noise that older guys sometimes do when holding in a big toke nasal and strangled He gave Nicky the thumbsup and blasted out smoke like a grizzled old dragonShits pretty good Nicky Good score  gotta get some more of that So yeah the kid  he got rolled off to the Hole on his fuckin Hannibal Lecter dolly and they had him on a supertight lockdown nobody even catches a glimpse of im They had the kid on a twentyfour hour watch and the whole works A couple trustees tried asking the hacks what happened with him and Brookie and they got told to mind their own business and mop the fucking floorsThe kid was in the Hole for a week then two then a month  all the while aint no one heard a peep about him getting charged with murder There was a rumor going around that the coroner said in his report that Holbrook had died from a heart attack Maybe his heart seizing up was the thing that actually killed him sure  but there wasnt any mention of the way hed been carved up like a Sunday turkey None at all Mikey poured himself another round of refreshment and the stink of the open bag made my eyes waterHutch smiled a little an action with no real humor behind it Well tongues were wagging as they tend to do and pretty soon people were saying that maybe the kid wasnt natural That he did Brookie in with his teeth  that he ate the fucker alive like some sort of monster Guys were even saying that the priest paid him a visit in the Hole and ended up leaving with tears in his eyes  actually fuckin crying and shit Wouldnt say what happened just that he didnt wanna talk to the kid never again He quit working here not long after that happened Just up and quit and I heard that the Padre ended up selling his house and moving away Like across the country Somewhere far far awayMikeys irongrey beard

courtneymadison,32,78,1r2j24,235,Im just a normal  year old that lives at home and goes to class Ive never really had any unexplainable experiences but I had one today I woke up and started getting ready for class I thought I saw my mom in her room so I started having a conversation with her while I was getting dressed She was responding as per usual so I thought nothing of it Quick sidenote Nothing felt wrong with the way she was responding Whatever this was it sounded just like my mom After a while she stopped replying to me Being curious I decided to go see why I went to her room and it was empty looked in the kitchen and it was empty She would of had to have walked past me to leave the house so I knew she hadnt left I decided to call her to figure out where shed gone and when I looked I had a text from her that was received at  am saying Got called in to open Be home at  so you can take the car I called her to see if she was messing with me but she was actually at work I dont know who Ive been talking to all morning and Im really freaked out Can anyone help me EDIT I asked my little sister if when she had had anything strange happen when she was getting ready for school and she looked at me like Id lost it For all the people that asked about the conversation the previous night my mom had found a ouija board unused and still in the packaging in my closet and she had thrown it away She was talking about how ouija boards are dangerous and I shouldnt mess with them She was very persistent that I dont get involved with things like that but shes always saying stuff like that so it wasnt a very out of the ordinary topic for us The conversation was about an hour long and I was fully awake when it took place We checked the house and nothing was missing or out of place We live in an apartment and all the windows were locked and the screens were intact so someone couldnt have gotten in or out through them My mom is really into the weirdparanormal stuff so I told her everything and she has no idea what it could be Also I feel I should mention weve lived here for  years and nothing like this has happened beforeBONUS EDIT My mom went to leave for work and there were footprints leading out of our house in the snow,Who was I talking to,313
PeckerPoker,41,68,1r58lt,209,Ok so this isnt a long story filled with twists and turns but it just happened about  minutes ago and Im a little uneasy nowFor reference my husband son and I moved into an apartment in the tophalf of a centuryhome a couple months ago The doors all have old knobs and the doors dont always close easily  you really have to pull sometimesAnyway I just put my son almost two years old down for his nap I told him nightnight as I closed the door As I always do I pulled the door shut firmly and made sure I heard it click I swear I heard it clickI walked away and into the bathroom to go pee As I sat down on the toilet I heard my son start crying which isnt that unusual but normally he doesnt do more than fuss for a minute before falling asleep I even kept him up a little longer than usual to make sure he fell asleep He seemed pretty ready to go down thumb in mouth under his blanky he rolled over onto his side and put his blanket over his head like he does when hes really tiredI finish peeing and walk out of the bathroom and his door is wide open I see him standing in his crib crying I go in feeling uneasy and lay him back down and cover him back up He lays there and just keeps crying as I check his closet like there would be someone hiding in there or something Kind of dumb I know but I couldnt just shut him back in his room alone without checkingEven if I was wrong and the door didnt click shut which is possible it shouldnt have been wide open When I havent completely shut it in the past it will open up about  or  inches Its never opened up all the way like thatI checked the rest of the rooms and closets feeling nervous but kind of stupid Of course there wasnt anything unusual anywhere Still Im kind of on edge I wish my husband was home,Nap Time,277
PlotThickener,12,42,1r0aj7,183,This is a story Ive never discussed with anyone aside from those people involved But I figured it belonged here For the longest time I chalked it all up to pranks my imagination whateverbut hopefully youll all be able to make more sense of itI was driving in a rural part of Wisconsin which if you live there you know is much of the state Lots of flat farms country highways named for letters empty back roads etc It was  pm or laterI dont really remember when but it had been dark for some time and it was the middle of summer so it must have been late It was the time of night cars stop moving on the rural roads so its just you and your headlights and the world around you starts getting really creepy Plus youre always watching out for deer on these roads which can just pop out at any moment so youre kind of on yellow alertIm driving north on a long section of road Theres a big flat farm on my left mostly emptylooking probably planted with soybeans which dont grow high Im concentrating on the edges of where my headlights meet the darkness to watch for deer and I think I see one walking out of the farm toward the roadI tap the brakes not sure of what I see but soon I realize its not a deer Its upright something walking on two feet and its HUGE And its all black Its still moving but its not moving with any kind of walking movement its just sort of gliding across my visionAt this point Ive stopped the car completelyin the middle of the road just watching One instinct was to hit the gas and drive past because I could have easily passed it but Im not sure if it was about to jump out Im not really afraid yet Im just frozen you know those moments where you cant figure out what something is so there are no real emotions That was meThen it comes into clearer view in the headlights Well thats not very accurate to say because it didnt seem to reflect any light It was like the light moved through it if that makes sense But I could see the outline of the figure against everything else that was litthe road the trees etcThe figure looked like Death I mean EVERYTHING you imagine when you read the storiesthe scythe the big black hood It was exactly what you think when you think Grim Reaper only unnaturally tall and thin It was so tall and thin it looked a lot like this guys halloween costume when he wears it after about five minutes or so httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvIPoCkNKDGk Especially how tall it was I mean ten feet minimum I think most people think of the Grim Reaper as being as large as a big person but it wasnt really like thatBut that was my first thought A halloween costume It was still summer though so not Halloween But I rationalize maybe its just a prank But then I pay attention to how it moves to the middle of the roadIt just GLIDES I see no feet no hint that this thing is doing anything but flying off the ground but you cant see feet or anything because the robe hits the groundThen in the middle of the road maybe ten feet in front of me it stopsThe hooded face turnstoward meIts so slow and smooth and just plain UNNATURAL that I completely freeze in the car My hands are locked on the wheel The face is turning to me slowly perfectly smoothly and Im scared out of my mind Even if this is some prank this thing clearly means business Maybe its some psychopath scaring people and not just an innocent prankIt sees me I dont see eyes no glowing eyes or anything just black but somehow I KNOW that its looking at me making eye contact I got goosebumps even on my scalp I remember my hair feeling like it stood straight up I feel like I was literally looking death in the face My stomach sank like someone just told me a loved one had died I mean you do not want to feel this feeling Ever The thing stood perfectly still too as if considering me or weighing me I felt really judged if that makes sense Like I was being consideredThen he glides off so fast I dont even see where he goes The roads are clear again and then I heard the engine running as if all of the worlds sound had suddenly been unmutedI drive back home still frozen still rationalizing what I saw A prank I figure It had to be a prank some overzealous Halloween lover setting up rumors of the Grim Reaper walking around the farms I tell my parents about it and theyre sure its a prank So sure that I eventually rationalize it away and the memory is filed away as creepy but nothing supernaturalAt about the same time I heard that a farmer who owned that soybean field had died that night But it took me a long time before I put two and two together when I realized that I saw something that looked like THE FREAKING GRIM REAPER on the same night that farmer died I remember when I first had the thought and my stomach sankIt was like the rationalization I had used to remember the story of the Grim Reaper was suddenly stripped away and I had to confront the fact that I saw something very very scaryBut what else can I do but live my lifeI went back to collegeevery time I came back home at night I took an alternate road just because I got the creeps so bad Had a good semester mostly As had some good times with friends I drive back mostly during day or evening time so I dont have to revisit those unpleasant memoriesThen my parents tell me that there are more Grim Reaper stories going around lately all pretty similar to mine When you live in a  small town it seems like there are a lot of funerals for old people that you know or at least heard of going on all the time At one funeral an old ladys granddaughter cried because she saw she said a big black figure over the casket My parents heard that story and thought of mine but they still just treated it as a jokeI would stay up a lot later than the people in my house parents  younger brother plus an uncle aunt and cousin who were spending Christmas with us and slept in a room upstairs on this little side road in a rural subdivision No streetlights out there just the lights that other people kept on their garages all nightOne night I went up to my room at about  am and of course the whole house is quiet and I go to my room and turn out the lights so I can go to bed I usually throw a glance out the window and you can see most of the side street because the neighbors kept their garage light on all nightThis time the whole scene looks a little different Theres a big shadow looming in the front yard and its blocking a lot of light Then I look closer and I realize its not a shadowits something black thats cutting THROUGH the lightThen I feel my heart practically stop as I realizeits back The Grim Reaper figureIt was just like before It cast no shadow The scythe was there and the tall hooded cloak with no faceThe breath went out of me when I realized that unlike before this reaper was not looking to the side when I discovered it It was looking right at our houseII stood there frozen again my finger still on the switch from just having hit the light It was a windy winter night and you could see some snow move but the creatures robe didnt move at all The same way its movements before had been unnatural now it loomed like a statue No flailing around in the wind Just standing tall scythe up high staring at our houseI looked away then looked back again Still there Looming I didnt get the sense that it was looking at me but I still couldnt stop staringThen I looked away and looked back again This time I KNEW it was staring Again it was hard to seethere was really nothing that I could tell that suggested it was looking at me No evil glowing eyes or anything I just felt it Felt the same feelings as beforea rotten pit in my stomach the feeling of being measured and weighed and consideredI heard a squeak and realized it was me My breath was being squeezed out of me simply from the fear Keep in mind I had no idea what this thing would do next What fly up to my window Suddenly disappear Rip off its hood and reveal a laughing skullAfter a moment its gaze departed from me again I felt good enough to go to my brothers room and wake him up to show him something in the window It took him forever to get out of bed but it may have only been a few minutes By the time he woke up rubbed his eyes and listened to the panic in my voice a few minutes had at least past I showed him the window but of course the figure was goneBut still that was it I knew The night I saw deathThat was the night my uncle died,The night I saw death,225
theworldisgrim,30,64,1qv2sj,177,The first chunk of this story can be found herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqsnvwthenewfishBig Rob grunted Billy Tremont and hauled hard on the joint decimating it to a smoldering ember between his thick fingersYeah him Billy Tremont He was a hack who worked the night shift and Ill tell ya something  he was just as dirty as they come Fucking guy wasnt just on the take  he was the take you know what Im sayin He was as much a gangster as any of the boys in here He controlled what came into the Pen and when and who got it and how much they got The dude squeezed out whatever competition he had from the other cops that were playing the game by any means available  he set em up to get fired payed to have em shitkicked by the bikers you name it He was a complete fuckin asshole but he was also real good at getting you what you wanted  for a priceWell its a fact that people love a mystery especially people who aint got fuckall to do with their time A few guys pooled together some cash and they came to Billy cuz if anyone could find the answers to their questions Billy Tremont could Billy laughed and tells em that hed love to take their money but he couldnt do what they were asking He says The weird little bastard didnt have no file as far as I can tell I dont know who he was why he came here or where he came from No one does and thats the goddamned truth The guys called him a bullshitter and Billy got serious on them He narrowed his eyes and said to em You guys dont think I tried to find out for myself already Hah Far as I can tell the kid just sorta popped up into the Fish Tank outta thin air Looks to me like everyone just kept processing him along cuz no one wanted to admit that they didnt know who the fucking kid was Call me a liar again and Ill beat the fear of God into you It was clear that they werent gonna get anywhere with Billy so the guysWhat kid Wait a minute man  which ones the kid Richies eyes looked like black bottomless pools I remember that He had already sunk deep into the mindless tar pit of addiction by then He was past the point of no return You could see it in his eyesShut up dummy Rob turned to Mikey and made a gesture that said please continueMikey gave Rich a cold stare then said So the guys gave up and said Fuck it then and thats that for a while Life goes on Then a day comes when Billy sidles up to one of the cons while hes standing in the morning chow line and tells him that hed found some information on the fish if anyone still cared to know Billy was lookin bad they said He looked tired and scaredThat night Billy comes to see the guy in his cell after lightsout He asks the guy for a smoke  and Billy had quit smoking years ago Billy says to him I dont want any money for this Keep your lousy fuckin money I dont wanna be the only one that cant sleep at night is all You pieces of shit got him into my head and I couldnt get him out Fuck you for doing that Fuck you people sideways The guy said that Billy Tremonts hands were shaking so fuckin bad that he could hardly get his smoke litBilly tells the con that curiosity had been eating him fuckin alive so he spent some time thinking on how to go about getting want he wanted  then he picked his mark Billy always had his ear to the ground yknow the type  he knew this and that who did what and where and why He knew stuff about people He knew that one of the suits in the office had a bad coke habit the kind of raging habit that most people cant afford for long He also knew that the suit and the Warden were both banging the same chick  the Wardens secretary Billy gave him an quarterounce of good rock cocaine and told him what he wanted He promised to shoot the guy an eightball on top of what he already gave him if the guy could deliver the goodsThe suit came back to him a few days later with the sniffles and a file folder that looked older than the Bible It was made outta some kind of rough crumbling old cardboard dry as dust The office stiff says that the Wardens secretary told him where to find it locked up in a cabinet in the Wardens office He said that hed put himself in all kinds of danger to get it and he wanted more than a ball for his troubles He wanted more than a quarter too Billy told him that he could either take the ball or Billy could let the Warden know that one of his minions wasnt just a cokehead and a thief but he was dipping his wick into the Wardens honeypot too Billy told the suit that the assfucking the Warden would give him wouldnt be anywhere near as bad as the one the wolves would deliver The guy shut his yap took his eightball and they parted waysSo in between drags of his smoke Billy tells the con that the first documents in the folder were pages taken from a court transcript some backwater courthouse sittin way out in cow country They were handwritten with an oldtime pen Billy said you know the kind that you had to dip in a fuckin ink well then pat dry against a blotter so the shit didnt smear Thats how old the thing was All the dates and the kids name were scribbled out Billy said but he figured that the first documents in the folder were from the late sNick snorted What That aint even possible Mikey shrugged It is what it is Nicky The transcript said that the kid had been charged with multiple murder practicing Satanic rites cannibalism arson mayhem  he was only sixteen years old when they tried him The prosecutor wanted to hang im for his crimes But the defense lawyer that the Crown had appointed some greasy little fucker  he argued it would be Godly to let the kid live out the rest of his days in jail seeing as how the kid was known to be an orphaned vagrant whod raised himself in the woods No moral guidance in the woods that was the argument The jury ended up getting all pious and they commuted the kids date with the rope to a life sentence They shipped im off to the clink and that very first night he killed his cellmate Killed him with his nails and teeth and then he ate the poor sonofabitchColtrane looked disturbed Holy fuck This is horror movie stuff Im sorry but you guys have gotta be shittin usMikey shrugged again Kinda wish I was But Im not Not according to Billy Tremont anyway Billy said that they stuck the kid in a loony bin for the criminally insane after he ate his cellie Put im in a strait jacket At some point the quacks realized that the usual treatments werent working for shit so they decided to give the kid a lobotomy He was out like a light from the ether and they were just getting ready to start when the kid suddenly breaks his arm restraints and sinks his teeth into the lead surgeons throat just like a goddamned wolf Ripped it right out Theres no way that he should have still been conscious let alone being able to snap those thick bands of leather  but he was and he didWay I heard it Hutch said after he killed the quack they put the kid back on the stand  and this time he got twelve votes for death They took him to the town square and marched the kid up to the gallows with all the townspeople screaming and throwing moldy bread and cow shit at him He was laughing at em The hangman put the rope around his neck and asks the kid if he has any last repentant words to share with the crowd The kid says loud and clear Theres nothing to repent in doing what you want Id fuck your mothers ass and fry up her heart if I wanted to and after I was done picking my teeth I wouldnt so much as fart her a blessing Why should I So the cops beat on the kid with their clubs a bit put the hood on the little fucker and the hangman pulls the lever  but the trap door wouldnt open He fiddled with it and tried three more times and each time the fucking door wouldnt swing open They didnt know what to do All the while the kid was laughing and cursing at them and praising the Devil just being a general pain in the ass People were screaming for him to swing It was getting ugly out there and fast So someone gets the bright idea that they could just put the kid up against a wall and shoot him and be done with itOnly that didnt work either Mikey added His words were becoming thick and slurred  it sounded like the hootch was starting to do the trick They put the kid up against a brick wall and five cops took aim Five cops pulled the trigger and five guns misfired They tried again and the same shit happened again By now the people watching were getting spooked The crowd of farmers and mill workers who came out to watch the kid hang  they all suddenly had places to go Everyone left and the Lords Prayer was on more than a few sets of lips as they went Id bet When everyone was gone the cops packed the kid back into the wagon because there was nothing else they could do They took him back to the courthouse and after some debating behind closed doors the judge had him sent to a different jail where he was locked up in an unused room in the basement Then they boarded up the door  and then for good measure they bricked the whole thing overRichie attempted to focus his eyes up at Mikey and asked Can they  can they really do that man Just put someone in a hole and brick the fucker overNick spoke up His voice was hoarse Maybe not these days but were talking back when a lot of people didnt even have a birth certificate Sure they coulda done that Whod ever know He lit another joint and passed itSo what man They just left the crazy little fucker there to die Richie appeared to be in the grip of a dubious species of moral outrageAnother good question Richie Maybe you havent killed every single brain cell yet after all Mikey slugged back some more of the noxious hootch and grimaced Billy Tremont said that there was only two other documents in the folder  an extremely fuckin old mug shot and a report to the Board of Corrections from a sanitation engineer It was written sometime in the Fifties Hed been down in the old basement of the very same prison where they walled up the kid he was down there checking out the shitpipes It didnt have fuckall to do with what he was looking for but the engineer mentioned in his report that hed found a brickedover doorway down there Curiosity got the better of him and he tore away the crumbling old brick with a crowbar Pried the boards off and popped the door open Do you know what he foundA skeleton Richie muttered He was struggling to keep his eyes from sliding shutNo Nothing Thats what he found When he forced the door open the room was emptyWe all took a few moments to digest this And then Bulldog ate his gun dont forget about that Hutch rumbled He handed the jay back over to Nicky Nick curled his lip in disgustWho slobbered on this shit he demanded Its wet as fuck Gross man fuckin grossNo one owned up to the deed Nick started to bitch about it some more and Hutch gave him that look the one that said shut up immediately or regret it Nick shut up Mikey snickeredThank you kindly Hutch  and Nicky Cmon kiddo just pinch off the wet part and stop yer bitching Anyhow that fuckin prick Bulldog  he was one of the leastloved hacks in the entire history of this joint A real genuine dyedinthewool piece of shit He was still a few years south of retiring when this all happened  late fifties Id say A huge fat redfaced motherfucker he was Meanern fuck His blood pressure was right off the scale all the time there wasnt nothing he liked better then to find an excuse to smash some unfortunate bastard upside the head Hed do it with a sock full of quarters that he kept hanging on his belt When you heard the jingling of the change you straightened up and stopped fucking around until it was gone If that nasty old fuck was in a mood well you steered clear and you kept yer big yapper shutSo they put this fuckin guy on watch in front of the kids cell doing the graveyard shift right He was all alone too no partner or nothin  I guess the other hacks didnt like the fat mouthy fuck either There he was night after night just him and this creepy fucking kid all night long Normally this wouldnt have been very good for the con being watched  being alone with a tired grumpy Bulldog and no witnesses It woulda been a long long season in Hell for most cons But the fish wasnt the usual whiteboy dummy we get in here  you know what I mean Like a kid who got mixed up with something stupid then wasnt rich enough to buy his way out of it Not this fish He was something else entirelyMikey paused to force down a big glurt of Pruno and Hutch jumped in Well Ol Bulldog only lasted for about a month before he goes to his shift supervisor and requests that he be taken off the watch The head screws office door was open a bit and some dude named  uh Tags or Rags some shit like that I cant remember  anyway he supposedly overheard most of the conversation while he was waiting to see the WardenWhy was he waitin to see the Warden Richie mumbled As per usual with Richie he wasnt really getting the main focus of the story Fuckin ratting on someone right Fuckin goof I hate those fuckers Rats need to get hurt bro Fuckin rats need to get Jesus Richie go on the nod or something wouldja Youre a waste of skin Hutch looked dangerously displeased Richie grinned a big goony grin and whispered Fuckin rats thoughHutch frowned at him thunderously then continued So Tags or Rags or whatever hears Bulldog say that he wants off the watch His boss asks him why and he wont say Just that hes tired and he doesnt like watching the kid Boss asks if he wants a partner and Bulldog says nope he just wants off the goddamned watch and thats that So the head screw huffs and puffs and blows him off He gives Bulldog some shitty speech about not wanting to abruptly change everyones schedule for one fucking guy and how if he did do that little Johnny wouldnt see his Daddy up in the fucking stands at his next ball game and it would fuck him up for life You know  guilting the fat prick and all that sorta thing Then he tells Bulldog no and sends him on his way So Bulldog went home and he drank most of a bottle of whisky  then stuck his service pistol in his mouth and pulled the triggerNicky roached the allegedly slobberedon joint and blew out a tremendous lungful of smoke There was no way that the smell of the dank wasnt rolling through the whole goddamned pod by then but none of us were concerned about it If everyone was behaving themselves the COs would leave us to our vices in peace The situation was volatile enough alreadyMikey piped up and said Its a sad fuckin thing you know  when one of us string ourselves up or gets his hands on a razor blade no one gives a fuck The hacks laugh atcha because your bowels let go and you fuckin shit yourself when you died and thats your obituary Life goes on and no one gives you a second thought But this asshole sticks a gun in his yapper and blows his brains out the top of his head and hell suddenly hes a hero There was even a big article in the local paper about how the stress of being a Corrections Officer causes depression and blah blah blah sensitive souls cant handle the gritty reality of working with druggedout assfucking convicts It was kinda laughable really Whoever wrote that article didnt know Bulldog personally thats for sureHutch interjected But the fuckin newspaper didnt mention nothing about what actually drove the piggy to pull the trigger and ventilate his own skull fuck no No mention of the kid at all The kid was the Wardens nasty little secret Because they still didnt know who the fuck the kid was or where he came from and one way or another the creepy little bastard was making people dead All they had to go on was an old court document that read like a horror book a passing mention in a sanitation report and a blackandwhite picture of someone who looked like the kid but couldnt possibly be the kidI was suddenly aware that I was getting a bit freaked out In the soft red gloom stoned out of my tree every word that Mikey and Hutch uttered seemed frighteningly plausible I cleared my throat and announced I gotta tell you guys this is a fucked up story Im getting creeped out down hereHutch blinked down at me with inebriated surprise Shit I forgot that you were even down there Quiet little fucker aint he More bubbly in yer cup my friendI still hadnt managed to finish my first helping of the vile stuff I shook my head and finished up Nickys doobie instead Mikey lapsed into silence and we were silent with him Even Richie In the silence something dawned on me I said Hey Mikey  when they brought the kid to a different jail and walled him up after they couldnt execute him  that was this place wasnt it When you guys first saw him he wasnt a new fish at all  the kid was the oldest con in this entire jointThis ones pretty smart Mikey Hutch said Compared to Richie hes a fuckin scholar We should make him our Treasurer or something whaddya thinkWe aint got nothin to treasure here old man Not in this fuckin shithole Mikey poured himself some another shot of the eyewatering concoction in the bag Yeah you got er buddy  according to Billy Tremont it was right underneath this very building He let out a raspy sigh and hoisted aloft his Dixie cup of hootchTo Billy Tremont he said I sincerely hope God took it easy on youHowd he die Nick asked and Mikey flashed that humorless smile againNot long after Bulldog ate some lead we woke up to the sound of gunshots in the middle of the night again They found Billy Tremont dead in the COs locker room His brains and bits of his skull were sliding down the wall beside his body like snails The coroner declared that it was another suicide but heres the thing  they found five chunks of lead embedded in a wall all at chestheight And one in his brain There was a full cup of coffee spilled on the floor beside him and he still had a vacation request form clutched in his free hand Mikey leaned back against the wall and let out a scornful gust of air So according to the official report heres Billy sipping on a fresh coffee just about to go to the office and request some vacation time  when suddenly right then and there with no warning or reason he decides to shoot himself But before he does that he fires all the bullets in his service pistol into the wall except for the one that he fires through his own temple Thats a hell of an odd way to commit suicide dontcha thinkNick looked disturbed The kid came for him Thats what happened isnt itHe appeared very young and very vulnerable in the dim crimson light his face unlined and guileless It got out of its cell and  it was coming for him The cop tried to shoot it then turned the gun on himself before it could  get at himCant say for sure Nicky The only guy who can is thirteen years in his graveRemmie tentatively cleared his throat from the top bunk You said something to Hutch about the power going out before and something that happened when it did What were you talking aboutNah maybe we shouldnt get into that tonightHell might as well tell em the rest Hutch rumbled Gone this far havent we A week after Billy bit the dust a storm rolled in and knocked the power out clear across the county We were all herded into our cells and told to shut up and fuckin behave A lot of the hacks couldnt make it into work that night on account of the roads being all fucked up with accidents and torrential rain and shit  so the bosses who did make it to work were all carrying heavy firepower They made it clear that they werent going to fuck around if somebody got out of handRight around midnight I heard a shotgun go off somewhere on the other side of the Pen Cant mistake that sound if youre familiar to it I was wide awake and on my feet in a heartbeat Then sort of muffled and far away I heard screaming There was a boss standing nearby my cell and over his radio a voice was squawking Hes out Hes out of his cell and he killed Aimsley Hes ripping everyone apart Get your asses over to Solitary NOW The hack took off running and I turned to Johnny Franzini  but he stole the words right out of my mouth He said The boy  he is loose This is badIt was dark in there but Im pretty sure I saw Johnny cross himselfMikeys eyes glittered at us in the semidarkness glassy from the drink and wide from the memory on his lips There was a second gunshot and then a whole lot more They echoed and boomed and scared us shitless When they tapered off we heard more screaming It sounded like  like animals at a slaughterhouse squealing and bucking while they breathe their last Me n my cellie we fuckin hid in the corner with a mattress in front of us We didnt know what was happening just that the hacks had tried to shoot  something and they didnt fuckin succeed Im not afraid to admit it  I was shitting my pantsI heard feet come slapping against the cement and then three hacks sprinted past our cell Hutch said They werent just running  they were fuckin sprinting haulin ass like Olympians I seen their faces for a second and they were wild with fear Ive never seen anyone look like that before or since Everyone was hollerin at em as they passed asking them what the fuck was going on They didnt answer didnt even hear us  they just ran on by and kept goingAfter a few minutes a fourth guy comes along and hes limping real bad using his rifle as a crutch He got left behind I guess The hack was looking over his shoulder a lot and sorta joghopping as fast as he could manage He was leaving a trail of blood behind him The hacks uniform was shredded and torn on one side of his body flapping around like rags I yelled at him Hey What the fuck happened to you guys Whats going on and he stopped in front of our cell I could see the guy a little better now and I wished I hadnt It was Aimsley He wasnt dead after all  at least not yet His right arm had been shredded to almost nothing I mean it was just a few flapping pieces of meat and stringy shit oozing blood and barely holding the bones together His right thigh was missing huge chunks of meat too  and most of the foot The guys face was grey from blood loss His eyes were like a dolls  like twin pieces of round murky glass He was in shock He moved his mouth trying to find some words then said I think Im dying Then he started hopping again There was a puddle of blood on the floor where he had stoppedOkay thats enough Remmie said and his voice quavered a little I dont want to hear anymoreI dont remember asking if you did Mikey rasped Remmie pursed his painted lips and was silentHutch continued I heard something else coming then It sounded like something running on all fours something with claws I backed up against the wall as far away as I could go and Johnny cowered down into his bunk with his blanket pulled up around his face It came in fast and ripped past my cell just a fuckin blur of arms and legs and about ten seconds later I hear Aimsley start wailing like a siren It was awful Those were deathscreams man  nothing else can force a living creature to let out such awful fucking sounds it took me a moment to understand that Aimsley wasnt just screaming he was saying something He was saying Mommy Its eating meeeeee Mommy Its eating meeeeee Then I realized that I was screaming right along with him So was Johnny The whole pod was screaming You remember that Mikey All of us two hundred murderers and stickup men fuckin screaming in unison like little girlsI wont ever forget that Not ever Mikey said quietly The hack finally stopped making noise and we all did too You could almost taste the terror in the air sharp and bitter I could smell Aimsleys blood that coppery smell that gets in your throat and makes you want to retch It was so quiet  silent as a tomb You could have heard a pin drop And then slowly  so slowly  a figure comes strolling into view on the range It was the kid He was red from head to toe completely covered in blood and guts and shreds of stuff that kept sliding off of him and dropping onto the floor He wandered right down the middle of the range and he was carrying Aimsleys head by the hair dangling beside his leg as he walked I watched him as he passed by and I didnt breathe not once did I even fucking dare to breathe The kid ambles on up to the Hack Shack just as casual as could be and he puts Aimsleys severed head up on the ledge of the window Then he walked out into the middle of the range raised his arm and pointed at all of us each individual cell Like he was marking us each and every one Marking us for deathWhen he was done the kid walked back the way he came and he disappeared from view That was the last anyone ever saw of him He was just  goneThere was a full minute of silence Finally I spoke up Why the fuck did I never hear anything about this before How This should have been everywhere  the news TV crime shows fucking everywhere Nick chimed in and said I never heard nothing about this either and used to love those fuckin crime showsNo you never heard nothing about that  but you might have heard something about a prison riot Mikey said According to the newspapers the cons took advantage of the power outage and went apeshit for a few hours Most of the guards on duty died trying to stop us or so the story goes The government funded a swell new electronic locking system all because of what happened that nightI thought about this for a moment then said I dunno  What dont you know Huh Ill fuckin tell you the rest hows that Hutch glared down at me and his narrowed eyes slammed phantom punches into my face I froze The three hacks that we seen running for their lives  they ran right into the arms of the SWAT team whod just gotten on the scene with their guns drawn The cops busted through the gate and they found what was left of Aimsley first They ignored our hollerin and followed the blood trail They found the rest of them in the hallway that runs down the middle of Solitary lying in a raw heap with the blood congealing in a pool beneath the bodies like gravy All the cell doors had been ripped away from their hinges and the cons inside had been torn into pieces From what I heard it took a crime scene cleanup crew six days to clean out that wing And even after that the cons and the hacks were finding driedup bits of flesh and bone for months on end We toldja what happened and you can believe it or not I dont give a fuck and neither does Mikey Ask around if you wanna  theres some longtimers here that might talk about it if you give em something to loosen their lips Once again I dont give a fuck This whole pod had nightmares for a long long time Im probably gonna have em til the day I die and I doubt Im the only one There is something within these fuckin walls that looks human but isnt Its something that you dont want to meet and believe me  you better hope you never doHutch stopped talking then and as the hour was late and we were all pretty fucked up the silence soon turned to sleep I recall dreaming of a fairhaired young man who stood amongst us as we slept silent as a shadow His eyes were completely black in the feeble glow of the emergency lights his expression vulpine and hungry I remember that in the dream I was very very afraid that the boy would sense that I was not actually asleep If he discovered that I was awake hed devour me I remember this quite clearlyWe awoke early in the morning to the pitiful sounds of a junksick Richie dryheaving into the toilet The lights were back on and the lockdown was over Richie wasnt the only one who was feeling like shit that morning  we were all in pretty rough shape especially us floorfolk Sleeping in a sitting position on cold concrete makes for a stiff painful morningNone of us had much to say We all sat and smoked and waited for the hacks to do morning head count I wondered if pounding hangovers werent the only reason for that I suspected that I wasnt the only one whose sleep had been disturbed by the fairhaired spectre A thing that should have ceased to walk the earth years before but had not A thing with a terrible appetiteThe cops finally came around and let us out of our cages They pointedly did not perform the morning cell check If they had there simply wouldnt have been enough cells in Solitary to confine all the rulebreakers We all trooped off to stand in the chow line except Richie who opted to stay behind and undoubtedly indulge in a snort or two and thats pretty much where this story endsWell almostI was released a year early for good behavior During the rest of my time there most of Mikeys crew were paroled either through the front door  or the back Richie was the first one to get wheeled out the back way Then eight months later Coltranes skull was pounded into a new and messy format and he followed Richie out the back door Six months before I was uncaged Big Rob Hutch had a heart attack while walking up the stairs that led to the tier above ours He fell backwards clutching his chest and was dead before he somersaulted over the last few steps and landed at the bottomSo for a while it was just me Mikey Nick and a few casual homeboys It got boring The crew unraveled at the seams and by the time I was paroled it had ceased to existA few months after my divorce was finalized I got nostalgic one night and decided to try and find Mikey online Soon enough I did  through his obituary He died in hospital of a short illness not long after I was released Remmie was also deceased the victim of a showerroom rape and stabbing And Nicky I discovered that he was in a mental institutionI visited him in there once Id rather be in jail any day Most of the patients I saw there were zombies chemically bitchslapped into subservience by their meds There were a few others who were just  strange Their gaze made me feel unsafe  and for Christs sake I did time in a federal penitentiary I was shown to where Nicky sat by himself at a table and he instantly recognized me We greeted each other like old friends and made small talk just like anyone would He seemed completely normal to me I didnt understand why he was in there  until I mentioned HutchWhat do you think happened to Hutch exactly I asked him and his relaxed grin suddenly became a twisted grimace of fear He seized me by the front of my jacket and hauled me close and his eyes burned bright with the fire of insanity He hissed The kid pushed him down the stairs It wasnt a fucking heart attack thats a coverup The kid got Mikey too  it ate everything but his head it left his head on his fucking pillow The orderlies grabbed Nicky and pried him off of me and they dragged him away while he screamed and flailed and twisted in their iron grip I watched this with an open mouth and my heart pounding Then I went home and got very very drunkSomewhere within those prison walls there is a thing that hungers And sometimes  it feeds I dont expect you to believe this any more than I did But you know what On nights like this with the wind howling and the fine hairs standing up on my neck I couldnt care less what you believeAnd if you were ever unfortunate enough to meet him face to face well  Ill bet the kid wouldnt care what you believe eitherNote crossposted from rTheAssembly  a sub featuring the work of the writing collective The Assembly one that I am happy to be a member

NEWACCOUNT,57,57,1qs3hz,173,I suffer from sleep paralysis pretty regularly  Ive grown accustomed to it so its not really an issue anymore  It terrified me back when I was like eight but Im twentyfive now Ive learned to copeIt only happens to me under certain circumstances  Only when Im asleep on my back Never in any other position  Its much more likely to occur during the day if I doze off for a nap  It happens plenty at night too if im too tired or not tired enough to sleep yetThe first step to dealing with it is to realize that I am in fact having an episode or whatever you call them  Thats pretty easy if I am awake scared and unable to move its pretty much a given  This seems like a trivial step realizing that im paralyzed but its really important  Having that realization help me block out all the terrifying shit thats going on in my head  It helps dull the ominous chanting that I always experience  Helps me ignore the shadows moving around the room  Helps dull the terror I have of whatever is behind my bathroom door that I generally assume is on its way to get meThe fucker behind my bathroom door isnt always behind my bathroom door  It depends on where Im sleeping  Sometimes hes around the corner of my living room  Sometimes hes coming from the back door  He was even coming from the closet door once though I dont know how he managed to cram himself in there  Its hard to convey the visceral terror that fucker instills in me at least to those who havent experienced such a phenomenon  Hes the only thing that haunts my paralysis  Others get ghosts or demons sitting on their chests or whatever but all I get is the sense of impending doom knowing its right there coming for me to do only god knows what  Its a feeling of allconsuming fear of absolute and complete panic and of utter helplessness  Which leads me to  The next thing to do obviously is snap right the fuck out of it  I think most people who deal with this regularly probably have their own little tricks to get out of it  Mines simple I shake my head back and forth  Thats it but its easier said than done  Because I cant actually move my head hence the paralysis  But I put forth the effort  Over and over again back and forth back and forth  Honestly this is the most terrifying part  It really sucks to try to move and not be able to  Especially when that fucker in the bathroom is on its way  But eventually after some time one of the mighty shakes of my head manages to move me and then everything is okay  The chanting stops thank god  Why my head conjures up some cultist shit is beyond me  The corners of the room clear out and that fucker in the bathroom goes away  The sense of terror evaporates and thats thatNext thing to do is to roll over onto my belly to ensure it wont happen again grab my girlfriend and go back to sleep  No big dealThats how it usually goes anyway  But lately its not quite been the same  Ill explain more about that in a bit but first lets take a detour to address the question that some of you may be asking NEWACCOUNT why dont you just you know not go to sleep on your back  And thats a good question with a simple answer  Its because sleeping on my back in addition to being a prerequisite for sleep paralysis is also a prerequisite for lucid dreaming  Lucid dreaming needless to say is a lot more fun than sleep paralysis  So much fun that its worth the risk of waking up paralyzed  Whats more is that im certain that these two phenomena are related in some way  For me the circumstances have to be identical for either to occur  Asleep on my back  More frequent during daytime naps or when im too tired or not tired enough to sleep  They both occur in the interlude between sleep and notsleep  At their core I think they are essentially just two tricks of the mind  One is me doing the tricking while the other is my mind playing tricks on me  Two distinct phenomena but related in some way or another  Generally its a crapshoot which one I get at a given timeThats how it usually goes anyway  But lately its not quite been the same  They are no longer distinct the barrier between paralysis and lucidity has diminished  It started off small  Id be flying around and hear ever so faintly chanting  Or id feel a bit uneasy about whats behind a door Im about to enter because maybe thats where the fuckers coming from  Not the pure panic im accustomed to because im free to move around but a sense of apprehension  Gradually it became worse over the ensuing weeks  Id emerge into the world of lucidity to fullblown chanting that came from nowhere but came from everywhere The fear and terror id only experienced when paralyzed would overcome me and id have no choice but to flee  But no matter where id go no matter how fast id run or fly away I knew that fucker from my bathroom was close  I couldnt open any doors because I knew hed be there  I couldnt stop moving or hed catch me from behind  I couldnt fly too high because I just knew he was waiting in the clouds  There fear was allencompassing Pure and absolute terror was the only thing my mind could comprehend  Id wake up exhausted from spending all night in fightorflight modeThis new phenomenon was infinitely worse than sleep paralysis  When I was paralyzed I could eventually shake myself out of it  But now I couldnt force myself to wake up Im trapped for as long as the dream lasts Im free to roam but I know hes coming All I could do is keep runningThats how it usually goes anyway  But lately its not quite been the same  Because last night I had normal dreams  The kind you cant remember when you wake up  I had to pee when I got out of bed but I didnt really like the bathroom door  I was groggy though and didnt think much of it  I used the bathroom downstairs before I made myself some eggs  When I got back to my room and turned my computer on to browse reddit I heard something  Ever so slight like it was far away I heard an all too familiar chanting sound  Whats worse my dog Riley wont go anywhere near the bathroom door,Sleep paralysis is one thing,230
SamMarduk,16,57,1qvt4k,169,I have been a Disc Jockey for five years and counting  I started at high school sporting events with a cheap ipod mixer but slowly moved up both in equipment and venuesBeing a DJ is just as monotonous as any other job for most gigs  Usually the client only wants top s hits with smooth transition to each song no silence in between  God forbid they let you showcase any talent  On the off chance youre allowed to scratch and mix you have to still be careful not to let any expletives slip out or else be fired on the spot without payI have done jobs for churches and the community and Ive done high school house parties and college keggers  My rates dont change and I get it up frontNow the scariest thing for some DJs is the equipment you never know if it will work when you want it Other DJs have wicked stage fright so they just create music on their computers and post it online  Some DJs are afraid of lower in venues like a house party All it takes is one drunken boyfriend one time to beat the shit out of you and no more house parties for that DJIve dealt with all these things and yet I have only truly been afraid onceIt was a pretty large party  The client called me two weeks in advance and gave me the rundown  I was thrilled  He offered double my asking rate and told me it would be all EDM techno and that he wanted a show The crowd was set at It was a dream eventI arrived about  hours before the event started  I came to the address I was given to a large empty warehouse  I parked at the back in some tall grass and brought my stuff insideWhen I walked in the door I saw the stage lining the short wall at the end of the building  This place was huge and it could easily hold   The dome lights that all warehouses have were brightly lit so the staff could set up There was a large circular bar in the center of the floor and multicolored lights all over the ceiling  There were tables on the far side opposite the stage and one main entrance besides the two emergency exits  Throughout the entire ceiling there were cages with paid dancers waiting to climb inside to perform  There were waiters and bartenders standing around and a few burly guys taking posts at the doors  Yo DJ A voice called  I saw the client approaching from the far wall He was a young rich white guy probably in his sWe shook hands and he showed me to the stage after quick helloIt was massive  I could see the whole warehouse Lights were all aimed at me and the crowd area Behind the stage was an emergency exit for the performersSetup was very routine and soundcheck went well  He had a great speaker systemAll was well and I could tell it was going to be a good night  Everything was perfectAll except for my headphonesIn my ears behind the tracks I swear I heard what sounded like static whispering  The main lighting turned off Then the colored lights flicked on The cage dancers started moving in their cages  Smoke machines poured fog into the giant dance floor and the staff took positionThe doors opened and people began flooding in as I hit the first trackSeveral girls who I assumed had pregamed before entering came in dancing and several douchebag guys followedAs the stage lights came on and as the fog thickened I began to see less and less  While they danced I realized that I could only see the lasers in the fog and maybe a few feet in front of the stage  I was having a blast and so were the patrons  Until that noise came back this time clearer I could make out chunks of hissed wordsEssaaa Hialaa CharamphObviously not real words but god it sounded so clearThe night rolled on past midnight and it was insane People were drinking dancing probably doing drugs and banging on the dance floor  I kept playing until I heard my headphones make a static coughing noise  This time it was loud enough to mess up my focusThats it I thought Im fixing this asapI let the track play as I examined my headphones  I turned my laptop brightness up and for a split second I thought I saw a face  Eesh Probably the lights against my relfection I gave up and kept playing through the off and on static noises the headphones tightly attached to my earsIt was roughly  am and I decided to scan the crowd The fog was still thick but I could see heads dancing  I looked until I locked eyes withsomethingAt first glance she was a college aged girl She was in a pink raver tutu and had pigtails  However the closer I looked the more horrified I became She was soaked in blood  On her skin looked like black scuff marks  She had one eye bulged out of its sockets and her jaw looked smashed  Her arms and legs were mangled beyond the point of function but she still stood hunched but still standingI shook my head to make sure I wasnt insane but the next moment she was gone I want to point out that I was entirely sober for this event All that I heard and saw was done so in my right mindI tried hard to ignore what I had seen so I made sure my ears were covered by my headphones and continued to playI was getting worried that the stress of such a high profile event was getting to me but I was able to brush it off and return to my work Until  amAt around three the static was backThis time very clear after a few seconds  I heard in my noise canceling headphones a tiny hissing womans voicesee shee leiiia ssssss shhhh shsa  SHUTUP SHUT UP SHUT UPFollowed by an intense screech I yelled and tossed my headphones off onto the tables silencing the trackAs my ears adjusted from the ringing I heard itScreamingSeveral people were screamingThe main lights suddenly came on and the doors opened as people rushed out One of the security men ran upIts a good thing you saw thatSaw what I replied as the fog was still thinning slowlyThe cage I cant see ten feet man I retortedOh god the big bouncer mutteredWhat the hell is going on I demanded more annoyed than confused at this pointA cage fell Nearly a hundred feet Crushed the dancer and some poor girl under her Her friend was screaming and thats why we thought you stopped the songI walked out to my car after the paramedics came and placed the dancer DOA The other girl was crippled but survivedI saw her body as the smoke cleared She was the same crushed corpse that watched me that night She was the same voice I heard as foreshadowing to her deathI am not afraid of the crowdI am not afraid of my equipment malfunctioningI am not afraid of people dying at my shows  But there is one thing I am afraid of I am afraid when Im at a prom or block party or house rager and in the back of the crowd I see a trampled bloody body wearing a pink tutu,What scares a DJ,226

deleted,18,51,1qvjha,148,The shadiness of this whole ordeal wasnt apparent at the time but boy do I feel stupid nowIt was a Friday I think and I had just signed onto Facebook and noticed that I had a friend request Im usually very cautious when it comes to adding people but the person listed their college as the one Im attending so I obviously accepted After scrolling through my timeline for a bit I decided to call it a night and go to bedThe next morning I woke up because my phone kept constantly buzzing practically begging for my attention Through my blurry vision I was able to read the notifications and they were all from the guy that had added me Most of them were him liking my photossome of them being ones I posted years ago but whatever it was just a guy trying to get my attention rightI shrugged it off and scrolled through my timeline in my tired state and noticed that he had tried messaging me He said that he claimed hes seen me around campus which wasnt exactly unusual but then he started to message me about trying out an app for him He said I could be one of his first beta testersI gladly accepted because what if the app became the next big thing Id be one of the first people to have used it How fucking radHe eventually sent me the file via messenger and he told me to just drag it into iTunes easy enough rightThe app was titled Smile for the Camera and the icon was a glossy animated girl with gigantic breasts typical maleWhen I opened the app I was greeted by a friendly message explaining how I was merely a beta tester for the app and any progress made may or may not continue onto the final version whateverIt made me sign in through Facebook which I wasnt too bothered by but I was beginning to think that all the hassle wasnt necessarily worth itFast forward ten minutes of trying to navigate around the app and I found myself at the main menu I clicked the Instructions option and it redirected me to another page Since the app is no longer available Im trying my best to recall what it had said but it was something like Load the app Obviously Once you are redirected to the Main Menu click the small camera icon located to the left Now that you have the camera loaded take a few pictures and then you can post them onto Facebook or whatever social media you have connected Be sure that you have your location enabled for Twitter You can add a few filters but not too many your natural state is always the best By then I had concluded that it was a sort of Snapchat knockoff but continued on anywayI clicked the icon and proceeded to take a few pictures flashing a few funny faces that I was sure my friends would get a kick out ofWhen I had taken quite a few I clicked the Export option and it redirected me to Safari and loaded what seemed to be the Facebook login pageI put in my information and clicked Log In and was redirected to yet another pageThe site looked like something Facebook would make and it had a few boxes that asked me to type in a mailing address because they occasionally liked to ship out Facebook merchandise Maybe that shouldve been a red flag right thereI put in my colleges address just for safe measure because whatever they shipped out could easily be given to me so I clicked on the Next option and Safari then closedOnce I had got to college I opened my laptop and checked Facebook to see if the pictures had actually posted and they were nowhere to be seen I tried to message the guy who had originally given me the app to test out but he had evidently deactivated his account Red flag number twoRight then and there I uninstalled the pointless app and thought nothing of it until this past FridayI was in my Anatomy class when an officer came into the room and asked for me By then I was freaked out because as far as I was concerned I had done nothing wrongHe asked me to come with him to the stationwhich I gladly compliedOnce there I was sat down with two other officers and they started asking me about the damn appI told them everything I knew from the guy giving me the download straight to when I tried to post them on FacebookBy then they were rubbing their temples clearly flustered by the whole situationThat app that app was a sex trafficking app One of the burly officers said sighing as he leaned back in his chair That guy that claimed to go to your college wasnt a real person Well they were but not who they said to beBy then my eyes were brimming with tears I was honestly terrified what did this all mean for meYou see these criminals did their research You were merely a target It looks like they gathered as much information as they could about you to make it seem legit Youre lucky we got to you in timeWhat do you mean I remember asking trembling as they explained it furtherYou see those pictures you took were listed on a sex trafficking website If they wanted you all they had to do was bid on you and you wouldve been stalked and eventually kidnapped to finalize the sale were assuming I talked to other victims who almost got kidnapped but managed to get away They didnt really give us much to work with they just said that theyre cleverer than we all take them for We had a few undercover cops bid on that website and we bid on you  Once youre sold your information is revealed to the buyer but it mentions that whoever you bought the person from will get them to you within a weeks time We noticed that it was a local colleges address so we went to get you and here we are now By then I was dumbfounded it all made sense once you put the pieces together and I cant believe that I almost fell prey to something so sinisterAfterwards they had told me that if anything fishy happened to call the immediately and they also mentioned that they were close to busting the caseI think its safe to say that Im staying away from anything having to do with pictures for now,Smile for the Camera,199
mathearetice,17,51,1qsodj,142,About a year ago give or take I took my time walking home from class at around  at night The reason why I was out so late was that it was a Friday night The night my stepfather would always become intoxicated and abusive not something I enjoy being around I was never afraid my mum would sometimes question me otherwise and Id always joke about how even junkies can be lovely I remember it had began to drizzle a little bit but I didnt bother quickening my pace I enjoyed rainy nights so I took the route that would add about an hour to my journey a bit quicker if you ran I came onto a narrow back street it before I saw the silhouette of a tall skinny man emerge from the shadows I stopped in my tracks I wasnt scared he was in my way I couldnt really see him because he was standing next to a dimly lit bus stop I squinted as best I could before I noticed him getting closer For every step he took hed purposely drag his other foot behind him I could hear the Stomp scraaape just barelyStomp scraaapeStomp scraaapeI knew he wasnt really handicapped his movements were too quick and easy  As he limped closer I noticed his hair was long and hadnt been washed in what looked like foreverHis clothes were white and covered in dirt His lips looked blood red like he had put on lipstick Stomp scraaapeWhat really put me off about him was that his clothes were close to looking brand new I found it very odd Stomp scraaapeStomp scraaapeHe stopped He stopped limping and he stopped facing me He had turned to look at the sky to me it looked like he was admiring it Maybe he wasI was a full moon tonight an especially bright one He faced me againHe started to limp and before I knew it he was feet away and at this point I was scared He did this disturbing giggle Girly he cried Come with me Lets Have some fun He reached out his bony hand that was attached to a long skinny armIt took me forever before I figured he must have been drunk so I politely said no and smiled His face went twisted with anger for a few seconds in the dim light  He was provoking me and it was workingGirly he growled are you sure I gave him no answer and continued to walkI dreaded every step that brought us closer before realising he wouldnt let me pass I decided to be brave and walked right up to him leaving a few inches between our faces He smelled putrid like fresh road kill I didnt show any sign of wanting to puke I stared him in the eyes and tried to look fierce My instincts told me to be defensive To say something threatening like Get the fuck out my way so I did Well I tried All that came out was a whimper get the fuuuJust because humans cannot smell fear doesnt mean we cant hear it I heard it in my own voice anyone couldFor a second I thought he didnt hear it was wasnt affected by it at allWithout saying a word he turned and limped away I watched him disappear into the darkness before taking the next turn out of the street Stomp scraaapeStomp scraaapeStill shocked from the strange encounter I began calculating the quickest route home The best I could think of was a walk that would take  minutes  if I ran Even after figuring it out I didnt start walking not for a few minutes anyway I finally managed to bring my foot forward and start my pace again constantly keeping a look out for any weirdo jumping out of a bush or shadow I was halfway down the street before I began to feel a bit calmerI could hear something in the distance I turned around for the last timeStomp scraaapeOh noStomp scraaapeNoAs I did my heart erupted and all blood vanished from my head He was standing there about a trucks length away from myselfThis time I could see him perfectly under the streetlight between us He was hunched over but his eyes looked straight up at me burning two holes into my face while his teeth were bloody and grittedI wish I said he was drunk or high But he wasnt Not at all He was very very insane He was the scariest THING I had ever seen He started to limp Every step he took pained me like he was killing me on the inside When he was just a foot away from me horror had consumed my whole body We were in the light I could see everything His lips werent covered in lipstick but in blood and that wasnt dirt on his clothes When I gasped from the sight he just smiled I didnt get my phone out because it was dead I didnt run because my legs wouldnt listen They just shook And I wish I had pulled out my pepper spray but I left it on the counter I finally looked up at his blood red eyes His mouth got wider and became an unnerving smile Get the fuuu he mimickedSilence had ceased the moment His eyes wide and wild his mouth still holding that painful smile He raised his hand to me expecting me to give him mineI took a step back instead His face snapped straight into rage and grabbed my arm Just as he took a loud deep breath I ripped myself out of his grip and ran for it I ran for my life The agonizing roar behind me made me run fasterGIRLY he screamed GIRLYIt sounded inhumane like he was possessed My arm hurt so much I felt tears in my eyes I think it was brokenI didnt want to look back I didnt want to see that rage in his face I tried thinking of all the routes possible but his roars clouded my mind I tried blocking them out as hard as I couldIf I took the next turn and went straight home not only would he follow me home but hed know where I lived If I ran to the park to try and lose him Id probably fall into a ditch and break a leg Then Id be done for My only hope was to run to traffic that was on the end of the street I ran the hardest I had ever in my life My lungs were aching and my chest was sore but I didnt careBy the time I had reached the end I spun around and saw no one I looked around frantically hoping I could lead him into traffic hoping someone could run him over But I couldnt He was goneI ceased the opportunity and went as quick as I could back home checking every shadow every bush When I reached the front gates of my home I looked around for the last time He was nowhere to be seen I exhaled loudly and collapsed onto the floor I felt an overwhelming wave of relief hit me and I began to smileI made it I thought to myself I actually fucking made it My celebration was interrupted by my stepfathers drunken cries and relief had disappeared I got up ready to open the gateStomp scraaapeWaitStomp scraaapeNo fucking wayI looked down the hillside of the street and there he was Right at the bottom Even in the distance I could see his wide eyes and smile He raised his hand and waved at me I wanted to scream but my vocal chords didnt want to cooperateHe started to limp Stomp scraaapeStomp scraaape,I now stay home at night,193
FishCustard,21,42,1qrr82,128,This is the story of how I became a monsterI was heading home from work on the day it started  Id stayed late to finish up a presentation for the next morning and had to take the slow train home It seemed to stop at every little place between the city and the small town where I lived The darkness closed in as the train trundled on and I drifted off into a light sleepWhen I awoke a few stations away from home I was startled to find myself staring into the face of a young woman She had long ever so slightly curly black hair bright blue eyes and a very pretty pale complexionHello she chuckled as I blinked myself awakeHi there I replied forcing all the services in my brain to start as quickly as I couldHeading home Im assuming she said smilingYeah I explained that I was heading home from work She asked what I did and I gave a quick overview of my very boring job In almost any other setting this conversation would have been beneath notice but on the cusp of night in an empty train carriage with a beautiful girl it was rather oddI asked her what she was doing out she said that she was visiting someone in one of the towns we passed through as I was sleeping The conversation went on  I learned that she lived in the same town as me that shed just moved into an apartment there and didnt know anyone that she was looking for a job etc We got off the train and exited the station still engrossed in our conversation Before we headed our separate ways I thought I may as well ask for her phone number  this wasnt something Id usually dream of doing but we seemed to have just clickedShe smiled took my phone and tapped in her name and numberElysiaA pretty name to go with the pretty girl I thought as I walked home We continued our chatting via text over the next few days and even had a Skype session over the weekend during which we argued the merits of the latest film releases and swapped favourite moviesEverything was going swimmingly until I received a text one evening that made my chest tighten instantlygtJake Im scared I think theres something weird going on heregtWhat do you mean whats going ongtYesterday when I got back home the door was already wide open Nothing was taken though Thing is the same thing happened today and now theres a horrible smell in the bathroomgtOk call the police and Ill be right over Whats your addressShe texted it to me  one of the new build apartments on the edge of town I remembered them because of how unusual the blocks are each floor is painted a different colour the first floor is blue the second green and the top floor is red They looked a bit like alien angel cakesI drove out to her as quickly as I could without drawing unwanted attention to myself The parking lot was almost empty so I parked as close to the entrance of her building and rushed in I looked at the address again to confirm  that means th floor I thought to myselfI decided to forgo the elevator and bounded up the stairs two at a time heart thumping through my ribcage When I got to the th floor landing it was pitch black A strong uneasy feeling crept up my spine but I crept forward groping the wall for a light switch as I went Eventually the lights came on of their own accord  a faulty motion sensor I thought to myself as I headed for  at the far end of the corridorElysia opened the door as I approached she must have been watching through the spyholeYou didnt have to come over but thanks she saidNo problem  did you call the policeYeah although they didnt seem to take me very seriously They said theyd send someone though to take my statement and have a look aroundI asked whether she wanted anything but she declined I continued by asking whether she minded if I had a quick look around myself  she didnt I started with the bathroomAs soon as I walked in I was hit by a disgusting combination of sicklysweetness and metallic tang I checked everywhere I could think of to find the source of the smell but it seemed to be coming from all around me there was nothing obviously out of place no rotting horrors under the bath no Cthulhoid beings in the toilet cistern I was about to head up into the loft space when the lights went deadI froze for what felt like a whole minute but could only have been a second or so I called out to Elysia No reply ShitI fished my phone out of my pocket and turned on its flashlight I crept out of the bathroom and walked straight into something Leaping back in terror I turned my flashlight on it expecting to see some shambling horror but was immensely relieved to see that it was only ElysiaYou frightened the life out of me I saidSorry I didnt know you were still in there I dont know what happened everythings dead Elysia said What do we do whats going onPutting my arm around her I led her toward the front door gently but quickly I dont know but I do know we have to get out of hereBut the policeWell wait for them in the lobby where its bright and theres more than one way out okay I think I was trying to convince myself of the plan more than her Nevertheless I felt her head nod against my shoulderAs we reached the door there came the sound of scraping metal from outside My heart nearly lept out of my mouth until I realised it was the elevator doors opening  the cops must be here The sound of heavy boots striding down the corridor followed I looked through the spyhole and immediately wished I hadntThe lights outside were flickering on and off bathing the corridor in stroboscopic lighting In the flashes of illumination I saw three large figures heading directly for the apartment They had elongated faces that appeared to taper to a tentaclelike appendage no mouth and huge black sunken eyes They walked slowly with a vaguely stooped gaitAs they approached the door I heard their raspy gurgling breathing Only then did it click that these things were right outside the fucking doorI grabbed Elysia and ran to the kitchen telling her to hide in a closet She screamed at me that there were no closets in the kitchen I was about to tell her to make a run for one when there was an almighty crash  the splintering and rending of wood They were insideI frantically searched the drawers for a knife eventually finding one I grabbed another and gave it to Elysia A second later one of the things filled the kitchen doorway I ran at it knife raised but the next thing I knew I was on my back on the floor  and the knife had slid somewhere under the cooker Elysia was too terrified to do anything  the monstrous being simply picked her up and put her over its immense shoulder I got back to my feet and looked around for another weapon eventually settling on a large marble rolling pinI followed the thing out into the living room only to be confronted with what must have been one of the others By now I was running on adrenaline only and my eyes had adjusted to the dark somewhat I swung the marble rod at the creatures head with all the force I could muster expecting it to magically deflect or simply have no effect But it didnt It connected and the horrible thing collapsed to its knees I struck it again and it collapsed to the floor its unearthly rasping breaths laboured and unevenDespite my triumph two lights clicked on in my head One by now the thing that had taken Elysia would be long gone back to whatever fucking dimension these things came from Two there were three of themI turned on instinct Too late It was on me before I could react punching me to the ground with a massive fist I tried to stand but fresh darkness was creeping into my vision As I drifted away from consciousness my arm began to burn with pain  it had injected me with some kind of venom I was going to dieOnly I didnt That might be the worst part of all thisI woke up to blinding white light and an unfamiliar ceiling I looked around and new fear gripped my heart I had no idea where I was but I knew I had to get out  clinical white walls intense lighting and nothing in the small room bar a metalframe bed and a bedside table One door I tried to get up but I couldnt coordinate any of my movements properly What did that thing inject me withThoughts swam through my brain as I remembered the beings and the apartment Elysia They took Elysia My train of thought was brought to a shuddering stop by the door opening I fully expected to see one of the tentacle faced horrors come to finish the job but it wasnt A man wearing a crisp black shirt black trousers and a deep red waistcoat stepped in to the room His clothes were totally at odds with the bright white room but his hair seemed to blend in nicely It was thick almost bushy and bright whiteIm sorry about all this he said His accent was odd British I couldnt place it Were normally a lot better than this Long storyWhat did you do with Elysia I shoutedThe girl Shes safe For nowYou monsters I spat imagining what they would do to herThats a very interesting point the man said walking to the table and pouring two glasses of water from a jug I hadnt even noticed He offered me one but I obviously declined Hm I dont blame you he muttered at that pointWanting any answers I could get I blurted out what the fuck were those thingsWhat thingsThe tentaclefaced things that took Elysia Theyre something to do with you I assumeThe man looked genuinely confused for a moment before his face fell Was this what you saw he said heading back to the door He muttered to someone just outside the room and one of the horrific beings followed him insideOnly it wasnt a horrific being It was a man A man wearing a fullface gas mask and some kind of respiration equipment on his back A long rubber tube connected the bottom of his mask to the pack on his back and there were two large black lenses over his eyes The equipment must have been heavy as he walked with a slight stoopWhat the fuck is going on here I just about managed to sayThis is Iain the man continued Youre fine to breathe in here this ones clean The monster reached up and took the mask off Underneath was a broadfaced brown haired man of about  He nodded curtlySo what happened I said unable to form more of a thought than thatWell tell me about Elysia the first man repliedI told him the story of us meeting on the train how we got closer over a few weeks and then how she texted me to say that her apartment had been open and there was a weird smellThis is the interesting bit he said almost smiling Where did she liveIn an apartment on the edge of town I said sighing Clearly they knew all thisYes one of those weird multicoloured lowrise blocks Which numberThe instant he said that my world started to upside down  I whisperedRealisation hit me again like a freight train Those wacky buildings where the first floor is blue the second is green and the third is redThere is no fourth floorWhich leaves us with the question of just where you were last night the man said He continued prattling but I wasnt listening  I was too busy replaying events Meeting Elysia after waking up on a midnight train texting her she never mentioned work or even what she did all day Then the dark landing the smell in the bathroom the lights going out the fact that she didnt reply when I called out to her yet she was right outside the door I practically fell over her when I came out of the bathroom Oh GodSo Elysia I said unable to finish the sentenceLets just say that you werent meant to get out of that buildingBut she looked perfectly normalBut we now know that appearance is far from everything It was dark Did you really look at Elysia after the lights went outAs I replayed my memory to see if I could pick out anything about Elysias appearance something else jumped out at me I hit one of them I waved a finger at Iain with a rolling pinThe whitehaired man sighed Yes you did Understandable under the circumstancesWhat happened to himHe died Subdural haematomaI collapsed back onto the bed cold and shaking Whats going to happen to meWell under official procedures youll have to be charged with manslaughter probably Obviously youd have selfdefence and diminished responsibility as defences though Cant guarantee you wont go to jail theyre under instructions to push for hard sentencesInstructions from whom Area  CIA NSA The SCP FoundationThe mysterious man stared at the floor for a couple of seconds When his eyes met mine there was a distinct sadness in them No MeFor a brief moment silence filled the room Then I burst out laughing Wait youre going to tell all this to a judge and jury I killed some man in a mask on a floor that shouldnt exist while he was trying to stop some fucking demon from eating meThey they dont eat people the man corrected as if Id just said that two plus two is nine Anyway not that kind of court Youve heard of military tribunals and such yesI noddedIts like thatDespair was about to consume me when I caught onto something Hang on you said officiallyThe man smiled Well I am one operative short now And things are so inefficient these days theyre always losing evidence and having to drop casesAnd so that is how I became a monster A monster with a long face black sunken eyes and raspy gurgling breath trying his best to save the next person from similar fate,Elysia,170
PatMallon,18,49,1qwsuf,128,It had me where it wanted delivering its final test or perhaps threat Blink and they will all be gone Everyone you love Everyone you care for Stripped from your mind like they were never thereThe following minutes were agonizing feeling like an eternity My eyes twitched repeatedly as I unnaturally pried them open They streamed tears of both pain and misery but soon those tears ran dry and dust began collecting  Thats when the burning started like hot irons singeing my corneas Despite the suffering I cried out I must keep them open But I knew I wouldnt be able to do this foreverSoon I regrettably freed my eyelids from their pry and let my lashes engage Moisture returned The pain ceased  not just the searing of my eyes but the sadness within I suddenly realized its plan was flawed I raised my head with a cocky grin to let it know that it should have chosen someone unlike me who actually had others to loveFor whatever reason it simply returned the very same grin,Blink and they will all be gone,177

youarealljerks,24,49,1qyvt1,125,I grew up in northern NJ my entire life  We lived in a couple different housesapartments in nice quaint neighborhoods with good neighbors and an all over good vibe  The first house we lived at after my parents split up will be one I will never forget and I was only  when it happened My parents were divorced on my first birthday and a year later my mom aunt and I rented a house in the small town of Blairstown  The house was split into two houses as it was a fairly large older house  We had the upstairs and a rabbi lived below us he lived there for many years  Even though I was only  or  at the time it seems like yesterday  I remember being in my moms arms as we took a tour through the house and I just felt very uneasy like someone was watching me  I guess my aunt and mom liked it because no sooner had we looked at it did we move in  As most normal renters do when they move in we cleaned the house up there was this weird red paint on the walls and water in the kitchen we thought there was a water leak  After a plumber came there was no water leak so we just assumed someone left the picture window open during the storm the night beforeEverything seemed to be going great the first couple weeks  It was a lovely neighborhood and all but there was just this weird vibe I kept getting  I woke up one morning to my aunt screaming it wasnt loud or anything but just a small shriek of surprise  Getting out of my bed I noticed the floor was really cold but then again it was winter and real hardwood  But the heat was on last night why was it so cold  I walked down the hallway and saw my aunt and mom with buckets cleaning this red paint off the walls again  I overheard them talking in low voices to one anotherMom Gum my aunts nickname was Gumby this smells like blood not paintGumby I noticed  They continued to wash the walls off as I being the little explorer I was decided to go upstairs to the attic to look for my barbie dolls  The attic door was at the end of the kitchen and usually hard a hard time closing the house was way old  As I  walk up stairs I smelled something really bad like warm dog poo on a hot summer day bad  I get up stairs and see a pile of what looks like coal in the corner and a big red door next to it  A noise from behind the door startles me and I run back down the stairs nearly falling on my butt most of the way  When I open the door I start crying and run to my mom  She asks me whats wrong and I tell her there is a big red door up stairs and theres something behind it My aunt looks at her she looks at my aunt and they both tell me its probably a squirrel or something I knew better than that  There was something bad up there I could feel itA few more weeks pass and things are getting more and more creepy  Every morning I listen to my mom and aunt clean blood off the walls  They just kept saying it must be paint that is bleeding through the wall paper  You could tell by their voices they were scared  I spent most of my time playing barbies or doll in the living room but it kept getting really cold  The pilot light on our furnace kept blowing out and we couldnt figure out why  Again my aunt and mom told me it was cold because it was winter  We would sit on the couch and watch a movie or TV at night before bed  One night my mom and aunt watched a scary movie of course I wanted to watch and they actually let me but said I couldnt get scared  Looking back now I laugh at my childish self I am a wimp for good reason  We were about  minutes into the movie when I heard a knock on the window next to the couch  I look over and see someone looking in our window waving  It was hard to tell if it was a male or female it was solid but not had a face but didnt  I screamed and jumped on my moms lap yelling Mommy someone is outside  My mom quickly glances at the window she saw it I know she did  She runs out the front door and around back  Only a few moments later she came back pale as could be and told me to go to my room  I cried that I didnt want to but she said it was time for bed  I stayed up and listened to my mom and aunt talk at the kitchen table Mom Gumby that window is  feet up off the ground there is no way someone could be in the windowGumby Tee my moms name is Tina shes a kid she probably just saw a reflection of the TVMom I saw it too It wasnt a reflectionThe house got this eerie quietness to it  I went to bed and fell fast asleepThe next day I wake up to footsteps in the attic I go out into the living room and see the attic door open my aunt is cleaning up the blood  I asked where mom was and she said Upstairs checking out that door for you  I had completely forgotten about the door I go outside and sit on the porch the neighboors dog comes up to me and starts licking my face he was the cutest black lab ever  Suddenly  his fur stands straight on end and he starts viciously barking at the front door of our house before whimpering off as if someone scolded him  I go back inside and my mom is pacing around the kitchen talking on the phone to someone  Under the door knob to the attic was my little rocking chair I had it was in my room I wondered why my mom put it thereThat evening we were eating dinner and I felt weird again  I was sitting across from the attic door eating when I noticed my rocking chair was ever so slightly rocking almost as if the wind blew it but it was smooth  Never really slowing down or speeding up  I guess my aunt saw me staring at it and looked over  I felt her kick my mom under the table and nod towards the door  My mom turned her head after a few more rocks the chair stopped dead  The lightbulbs in the small chandelier over the kitchen table started dripping water  At first it was slow but it increased to the point where there was a steady stream coming out of the bottom of them  We all looked up completely silent you could feel the wave of panichorror in the room though  I look back at the rocking chair and there is a little girl with a grin on her face looking at me  Her fingers are all bloody and her old school dress looks torn  My mom let out a shriek my aunt jumped out of her seat and ran to the attic door just before the little girl turned and walked through it  The water stopped drippingMy mom worked nights and had to leave that night for work my aunt was watching me  She put me to bed with a glass of water as usual  I dont know what time it was but I know it was before AM  I woke up and was really thirsty I reached down on the floor and picked up my glass of water  After a nice big drink I start putting the glass down and it falls shattering into a million pieces  I looked at the door I hear my aunt come running down the hallway  When I looked back down I saw a face in the puddle of water  I blinked twice thinking it was the reflection of the moon playing tricks on me  I was mesmerized by this face  It was purple and black and had this slightly evil yet welcoming grin on its face  I reached down to touch it when all of a sudden I felt this pain on the back of my hand  I screamed and the trace was broken as my aunt flung my door open  She picks me up and takes me to the kitchen where she sits me on the table  The back of my hand is covered in blood I guess the glass cut it all up but why the top of my hand and not my palm I wondered  My aunt ran my hand under water and it became clear why it was bleeding so bad  It was glass that cut me it was teeth  There was a full imprint of teeth on the back of my hand  My aunt started yelling at me for biting my hand and I told her it wasnt me it was the lady in the puddle  She didnt say much after that  She just bandaged up my hand the best she could as she called my mom to tell her she was bringing me to the doctor  The doctor looked at my hand and confirmed that I did not bite my own hand  He also had to take imprints of my  mom and aunts teeth to rule out child abuse  They werent a match and everything was fineWhen we get home I over heard my mom and aunt saying that they want to move  My mom suggests they talk to the rabbi and see if he knows anything about the house  We all head downstairs and knock on his door  His smile is warm and welcoming and he lets us in  He gives me a toy to play with and I go about letting my imagination run wild but still keep an ear open  My mom and aunt tell him everything  The big red door in the attic that goes no where is hot to the touch and doesnt have a knob  The bat crap thats next to it that she cleans up every day  The pilot light constantly going out the kitchen raining the face in the puddle the window EVERYTHING  After choking back tears my mom asks what we can do  He suggested to move out and leave everything  He pulled out a box of newsclippings and started showing them to my mom and aunt  There was a mother and little girl who used to live in the house years ago  They didnt have much money so the mom worked all of the time  One cold windy night the mom left to work leaving her daughter in the house  The wind blew the pilot light out on the furnace and with the age of the house the wind whipped through there making it nearly freezing really fast  This little girl got cold and wrapped herself in a blanket  The walls of the kitchen were still warm since the furnace was close to there  She began taking panel after panel off the wall to get to the warmth  She crawled into the insulation to keep warm and doing that cause her to choke on fiberglass and die in the wall  When the mother came home to see her daughter dead she hung herself by the window in the back  There it was all laid out on the table  The rabbi explained that most people who had lived in the house since then didnt have a problem unless they had a small child particularly a girl  My aunt and mom thanked him and we left back to our houseA week later we were finally moving into our new house  That week was the week from hell in our current house  We packed our essentials and left them in my moms truck  I had a diamond cross that was given to me as a baby that I wanted but it was stuck upside down on my dresser  The diamonds also looked like they were dying that is the best way I could describe them  The last night we were there we decided it would be best to put the queen mattress in my room since it got the most light from the outside light and moon and we would all sleep there  I was in the middle my mom to the left my aunt to the right  My aunt being the prankster she is kept knocking on the floor to scare me  Finally my mom reached over and slapped her and told her to stop because it was scaring me  A few seconds later she did it againMom Gumby knock it the fuck off youre scaring herGumbyIts not meNo sooner did she say that and my water glass started to move across the floor towards the hallway  We looked down the hallway and saw this figure at the end of the hallway where it meets the kitchen kneeling down and pounding on the floor  It was pounding so hard that you could feel the vibrations in the bedroom  The figure also sounded like it was wailing  A shrill cry of sorrow and despair is the best way I can describe it  We slammed the bedroom door shut and locked it  My mom grabbed her cross on her neck and just held us all close until the pounding stopped  I dont know when it stopped I was being clutched so tight the only thing I could hear was my moms heart beat until I fell asleepThe next day we were gone at the crack of dawn to our new place  We had left so many things in that house we were too scared to go back in let alone possibly bring something with usTo this day I still remember everything pretty clear for the most part  There are a few things I have forgotten but that is to be expected after almost  years  Whenever I am back home I like to cruise up to Blairstown and drive by the house  I still get the creepy vibe but then again thats the whole town  After doing some research my mom found that the town was once known for devil worshiping  Makes sense as to why my cross looked like it was dying and there was bat poo all by a red hot door that led no where  Id definitely like to go back in one day just to see how things are  Id also one day like to go to the library there and do some more research on the town and that houseOh and to this day I am still afraid to pick up broken glass for fear of seeing that face again,The house on Lake street,174
OdysseyTheCrip,40,36,1r4dm5,122,Fuck meI was told to come here by a friend of mine having never heard of nosleep personally Im not really on board with the idea of having a community of people read my story for personal pleasure but hey what ever I guess a little bit of back story is needed here I live on the nice end of Vancouver city with my grandmother Im in secondary school and that school is in my general poshish neighborhood   days ago I was Getting home from a longass boring day at school I decided to Fuck around on DayZ until either I died or fell asleep at the keyboard At around  my Dog Buddy Decided to be the most annoying little shit possible So i turned my computer off and put the little fuckers leash on At this time of night the whole block was lights out I Could barely see  feet minutes of walking later I began to feel a bit paranoid street lights were flickering fog was getting thicker Buddy on the other hand was  trotting along rubbing his little schnauzer face in the frosted grass Then he stopped Dead in his tracks then buried his head in my calves I urged him to keep moving and after much encouragement he reluctantly followedI rounded a corner going back toward my place when i spotted a figure in the fog a big one Thinking nothing of the fact just someone else enjoying the fucking weather or something As we got closer buddy started barking crazily I urged him to shut up lest he wake the neighbors Then I got a good look at the figure It was a man  about pale He had a brown tweed waist coat a brown tweed fedora and some brown baggy suit pants As we neared him Buddy grew more and more franticThats when I noticed his smile The scariest fucking smile you will ever see He looked like he won the lottery got laid and inherited a mansion within a period of  minutes It stretched from ear to ear a yellowed fake smileGod i wish i could have unseen itI was within about  feet of him then the smell hit me It was a mix between pure decay shit aged cheese Then he stopped right in front of me and said in the most strange voice like an elderly man trying to be smoothYou have a cute dog there boyUh yeah thanksI guess something in my voice must have pleased him or something cause he chuckled a sick smokers laugh I began to move away from him breaking eye contact Looking back on it I should have just fucking ranHe grabbed my armDo you want to see my dogI looked down and i realized he had a leash too He yanked on it and trailing blood Came the corpse of a maggot riddled dogI threw up in my mouth This thing that was once a dog was missing patches of white fur its skin was turning green bits of skin were missing its ear was ripped and an eye was gone I couldnt even tell what the dogs fucking breed wasThrough his smiling teeth he saidPet the dogMy dog was oddly quite this whole timei missed his barkingI tried to get away he tightened his grip on my arm then he dug his finger nails into mePet the dogPlease No was all that came out of my mouthHis smile drained instantly Into an angry twisted frown teeth still showing PET THE FUCKING DOG He screamed yellow spittle flying from his mouth my arm was turning red from the irritation his brown fingernails were causing meI had no choice but to pet the dog I reached down slowly and ran my free hand along its back The fur and skin began to peel back as maggots crawled along my palm My hand was covered in a clear slimy film He let go of my arm then shoved me I landed flat on my ass on the pavement Then i took off running My dog was sprinting along with me Then i heard him laugh then screamNOW I WANT TO PET YOUR DOGMy blood went coldI heard pounding on the pavement behind me and a dragging He was coming after me pulling his dog along with him Running  straight blocks i ran down my alleyway my house was at the end of the block I flew down the alley still hearing his laughter and slamming footsteps behind me I got to my house ran up the stairs and fumbled for my house keys As His laughter grew in volume to an unbearable height i got the door open shoved my dog in then slammed it and locked it not even a full second after I locked the door there was a slam on it He had ran into the door This slamming continued for  minutes and then silence I waited  minutes then called the cops in less than  minutes they were here I told them exactly that what happened they told me theyd book the guy Until then they told me not to leave the housenot  minutes after they left i was asleep on the couch with my dogI was awoken to the sound of a door bell ringing I practically jumped off the couch ran into the kitchen grabbed a kitchen knife and went to the door thinking to myself Im gonna kill this bastardI Flung open the door knife in stabbing motionNo one was there NobodyThen I looked down And threw up The fucking dog corpse was sitting there in a pool of bloodNailed into the dogs head was a noteI dont like it when they runRight now Im sitting in my house With no one but my grandmother who is too sickly to get out of bed My parents and my little brother are out of town at a dude ranch in the interior of the province Fuck dammitEDIT Im sorry if theres any spelling mistakes grammar errors or punctuation issues Im shaking right now,Pet The Dog,158
horriddaydream,11,40,1r68c5,117,My father always taught me to be kind to everyoneThere was this garbage dump close to my home I cant say anybody got a thrill out of living closely to the wretched thing for it stunk all to Hell and the trucks constantly entering and exiting could be an extreme annoyance I walked on the outskirts of town frequently past midnight which you may say is stupid especially if you saw my build and how small of a person I am and just how difficult it would be for me to protect myself from anyone A few times as I passed by the alwaysopened gates of the dump I also passed the man who would enter their limits every single nightAs shady as he was he had a lot to sayHis name was Terrance and he had been staying in the dump at night ever since it had opened back in  He had long straggly hair and he claimed that this area was just too dry the job shortage was unbelievable He would probably never have his own house I felt the upmost of pity for him and sometimes I even welcomed him to walk with me Everybody always seemed to know Terrance He was like the friendly neighborhood hobo They would nod to him wave give him a few dollars thank me for being so kind to him even though I would shrug it off and whisper that he was simply good company I asked him where he went during the day and he just said everywhere He had a huge black satchel that he slung over his back that probably contained normal homeless materials like paper towels maybe a few little scraps of food It always smelled but he smelled in general though I was too nice to say anything He claimed that there was a hollowedout truck near the far side of the garbage dump and he would stay there at night because it was warm and it was shelter It made me want to cry just the situation that this poor man was inI lived with only my father and so on occasion I would invite Terrance home to have a warm meal and my father was more than happy about this He was a kind man as I was a kind young adult and he completely understood that my heart was in the right place Terrance knew everything about our family in only a short amount of time and he never once took advantage of us He was just a man who had no direction after losing his wayTerrance disappeared for a couple of days I peered in through the gates of the garbage dump thinking twice about entering I walked to the back and noticed that there was nobody inside the shell of the truck that he had described to me a many of times But as I peeked inside the windows I saw many black satchels just like the one that Terrance was always carrying Most of them were empty but others were still shut tightly and looked full I reported the sceneThe cops had found small children of all shapes sizes ages and genders inside the bags He had been living off of them for years There was a lack of missing children in the area though some were found to be local Nobody knew where they had all come fromHe had been inside our house He had been inside my headNow he was nowhere to be foundFollow httpswwwfacebookcomDaydreamPublishing,Black Satchels,157
Magnum,32,58,1r5par,111,Born in the mid s i grew up active and was outdoors alot However as the technological age began I found myself inside more and more As I grew i spent more and more time watching TV playing videogames on my Super Nintendo And when the Sony Playstation came out my parents couldnt pry me from the screen As a consequence my eyesight suffered Slowly at first but as i got older it became an issue It was never so bad that I couldnt see without glasses but it was bad enough that i needed them to drive when i turned  However as senior in high school i quickly lost my glasses and proceeded to drive anyways No wrecks no tickets I thought that maybe my eyesight had improved over the few months that i had actually worn my glasses Oh how I wish I had been right Halfway between being  and  i picked up a job as a delivery driver Easy at first Until i had to start driving at night The night I almost ran off the road because I couldnt see through the oncoming cars headlights was the night I knew I had to get a new pair of glasses The next day I made an appointment and    business days later i had my new glasses Nothing special Just a simple blue metal frame with slightly skinnier than average lenses I Wore them all day And whenever someone asked how it felt to have new glasses i smiled and would comically sing Its a whole new world you know that cute little song from The Little Mermaid Oh how right i was As I prepared for bed that night getting changed taking a shower It all seemed normal Until I wore my glasses into my darkened bedroom No light was on in my room And i had foolishly turned off the hallway light before entering my bedroom Now in total darkness I realized just what real fear was You see with my slightly blurred vision of not wearing glasses any shadow could be brushed off simply because i couldnt focus and see what was just beyond the outer veil of darkness that covered them But now with those infernal glasses I could see them clear as day The creatures from monster stories My own personal Boogiemen All sitting around my room watching waiting inviting me to lay down and fall asleep right in their midst Right in my own bed I stood stunned Terrified Not Knowing what to do When suddenly one of them spoke The most terrifying voice I had ever heard Why not run away again child It amuses us to watch you at night oblivious to our very existence Unaware that you lay right where we want you Each and every night I stared blankly and felt confused Again How could i have seen these creatures before and not remember it Surely I would have some memory But none came As if to answer my question it spoke again Perhaps these will jog your memory It brought up its gnarled hand and unclenched its fist palm up to reveal my original pair of glasses A pair now almost three years old Thats when it hit me I hadnt lost my glasses But thrown them away Into a river Nearly twenty miles from where i lived Now more afraid than anything I did the only thing I could I laid down in my bed Removed my glasses and watched as those terrible Boogiemen again returned into those empty featureless shadows that surround each and every one of us every night as we lay down to sleep,Glasses,169
mrmappy,9,34,1r4x0l,93,I always listen to music as I sleep Before I go to bed I turn on my laptop by my bedside table run any pending downloads I still have open Banshee my music player press play and leave it as I drift off to sleep At times I would wake up groggy and sensitive to the sound so I would stop the music and go back to sleep Two nights ago however what I woke up to was not music Instead it was the voice of my mother Telling me something with the sweetest motherly voice I have long been familiar with  Mom already passed away For almost four years now  Was I afraid if hearing her voice Of course not Everyone at home longed to hear her again Everyone at home longed so much to see her again I missed that sweet voice and boy was I happy to be able to hear that again Of course I understand that it was just a dream A dream in the most familiar of environments with the voice of your late mother talking to you Im happy for just that  What she told me in that dream though did make me scared Her words though in the most caring and motherly of voices were  Hi honey Ill see you real soon okayIm not really sure if it was really just a dream,Mother,127
MikeyDeez,18,27,1r2k1v,95,So Ill admit it I kind of gave up on you guysI used to be on NoSleep every day Id be sitting at work refreshing the page and hoping for another Flawless Frank The Fallen Angelbut when the Boothworld Industriesfiascowent down I checked out If you were an ex girlfriend youd be snickering and telling your friends Ive come crawling back begging for your help Id be embarrassed but I havent felt much in the past few days I dont care anymore I just need to tell this to somebody I need to feel like a person again Have you ever wondered if there was anything more out there I mean literally out there above the sky  Have you ever just stared at the stars and wished that youd some day get to see the Galaxy like it was a Star Wars or Mass Effect civilization I was no naive for the yearning I used to feel Now Im the dog who actually caught the carI have no idea what to do with itand I couldnt laugh if I triedSunday night maybe amI had just shut down my computer after my nightly gaming session  I was laying in bed browsing reddit on my phone and debating whether or not I was hungry enough to eat another can of spaghettios or if it would even be worth the trouble of walking downstairs and waiting for it to heat up Im not sure what made me notice it what actually snapped my senses to the realizationbut it was suddenly too quietGranted it was am so its not like I was expecting any sort of noise in particular  My roommate had fallen asleep hours ago but it was just so still  Im not sure if any of you know what Im talking about but it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up  I felt like I was in a vacuum it was utterly oppressive Im not sure how long I sat there waiting for something before the glow  A deep blood red light had flooded the hall and oozed under my door and it was slowly pulsing  I wanted to call out to tell my roommate to fuck off but I knew it wasnt him I just knew I dont think I couldve formed words if I tried  The vacuum sensation I had felt was gone and now sitting in my tiny bedroom I felt like I was under a microscope That terrible like youre being watched sensation I read about so much hit me like a brick  I cant explain how exactly I felt a mix of horror dread and confusion  I wanted to bolt but I wouldnt have been able to force myself to open that door if I triedI managed to shuffle off my bed and to the floor  I opened up my nightstand reaching for my revolver I needed to feel that cold steel and the heft of it in my hand As soon as I picked it up I was at a loss because for the first time it just felt like a toy in my hand I looked back to the door to that glow and felt completely powerless  There was a shadow now someone was standing outside my bedroom door and I felt like I might as well have been holding a nerf gun  When the long scratch started I felt nauseous  Like I was  again smoking weed in my room when I thought I had the house to myself and my mom knocked on the door asking why the fuck it smelled like burning leaves in the hall That sudden weight in my stomach the sudden dryness in my mouthIt was like a nail being dragged down the door from the top of the doorway to the bottom  I followed the sound with my eyes and when it stopped I heard a voice  Hear might not be the right word because it came from inside my headMichael Please put down the weapon  We do not want to harm you and I do not plan on doing so Your weapon would be useless anyways but I respect your autonomy May I enterThis had to be a dream a nightmare If every waking moment since Iheard that voice hasnt been an eternity in a waking hell I might be able to convince myself that it wasI wish to speak with you Michael We have much to discuss May I enterThere was no fucking way this was happening  Imlucky I didnt need to because I couldnt have spoken if I tried  Whatever it was must have known there was no way I would have let it in because it answered me anywaysNo matter you will see us in due time  We would like to invite you on a journey Michael  You will come with us and see everything you have always wished to Weve known you for a long time you would say years  You have a week to decide we will not force you You will require no luggage no currency You will want for nothing  You will not see your family or friends again but in time you will cease to worry about them   We respect your decisions I do think however you only have one real choice  I will see you soonThen it was all just overI might have sat there for hours At some point I got up and sat on my bed  When I finally mustered the courage to look out the window it was already dawn When I heard my roommate get up and go to work and finally figured it was safe to open my doorI am a shell  I dont know what to do you guys  I havent slept I forced myself to eat something yesterday but everything tastes of cardboard  I booted up my computer but now my life just feels like a game Im sick of I forced myself to talk to my parents the other day and smile at work but any interaction I have feels forced and artificiallike Im just going through the motions There was no way I could mention what happened Sunday night to anyone He was rightI have only have one choice  If I dont go with himwith them Ill be trapped in this empty hell My life feels like a hamster in a cageWho the fuck knows what will happen if I do go with them  I cannot sleep ,Invitation,122

DeviousPigeon,27,21,1r1o1m,81,Help meI dont exactly know where to turn like the majority of the sub Im assuming you share the same interest as me in the supernatural the other side Ive always been intensely fascinated with it usually the furthest I went was browsing rnosleep or heading into abandoned houses to sate my thirst for the creepy although the same routine things quickly became dull and eventually I slowly got desensitized bored This was about the time I started reading recipes for paranormal experiencesThe whole thing seemed awesome the Midnight Man One Man Hide and Seek The Shoebox Telephone All gave me chills but I remained quietly skeptical the whole time Fuck Why did I have to be so blind I still cant find the place to blame myself I mean reading scary stories on the internet posted by a bunch of anonymous people it would be stupid to take it all for fact rightOf all the rituals one caught my eye The Three Kings Im hesitant to post the link but I feel like it would be naive to think that no one would give it a quick search httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentswboupleasedontactuallytrythis A blunt explanation of it would be a recipe where you can contact the dead and ask them questions through two propped up mirrorsAfter reading it I felt like I had to do it I quickly spread it to a few friends and it wasnt long until hype was built upon the whole thing Me and my best mate For his sake ill call him Darcy organized to do this when we had a few friends over for a small gathering whilst my parents were out for the week Funny enough at the time the thing I was worried the most about was it not working We had tried a ouija board once at my request and nothing happened we all just sat there fingers on the cup for  minutes blaming each other for pushing it whenever it moved in the slightest They all probably thought I was an idiot So I thought I would give it a kick my bright idea would be that we would all get absolutely hammered beforehand so that when it surely didnt work we would imagine that it did or at least get really scared in the process Well at least we had the really scared part down patSo everyone came at around pm yesterday and it was all pretty normal caught up bitched about a few people had some laughs and it wasnt until around pm that we started to set up The atmosphere then was so amusing of all things We all giggled the whole time in our stupor acting as if we were kids in primary school kids about to pull a really lame prank It all seemed fun then Of course I had to be the one who volunteered to be the one who sat the throne eager to show my courage off to my friends My lifeline was Darcy if anyone was to hold the key between my life and death id gladly hand it to himFor the sake of the story Ill skip all the tedious setting up and get to am We were all fighting sleep by then and I think Sarah and Alistair were already gone though we were sitting outside that door for so long it was hard for us to miss the time When I had walked in I was immediately hit by the cool air though this one wasnt the ghostly cold it was literally fucking freezing from the fan that had been buzzing on for a few hours Though something did feel off it was either the fact that I was in a pitch black room holding a candle to my chest with a chair and two mirrors propped up adjacent to it or it was that all of a sudden everything was quite As if the world around me was devoid of life bar the constant drone of the fan I sat down clutching the candle tightly persistent to not let it go out suddenly very aware to what i was doing I remember shifting in my chair uncomfortably for a while but what follows that still remains hazy I remember trying to call out for answers Whos there What are you doing Is there another side None were answered just silence and the buzzing of the fan I then said something stupid and heard giggling assuming it was my friends outside I started cracking jokes The more jokes I made the harder they laughed until I said Why arnt you responding too scared to show your faces and looked into the mirrors Now the huge cardinal rules of this recipe is not to look in the mirrors and around about this whole thing turned to fucking shit The worst thing about looking into the mirrors isnt what I saw but rather the absence of it I saw nothing i saw the chair the fan but no me I quickly looked to the other and greeted by the same emptiness Then the rumbling began have you ever been in a house when a plane has flown overhead and the ground slightly shakes It was like that except the sound emanated from the floor rather than the sky It continued to get louder and louder until my eardrums felt as if they were going to burst and then I peed myself The mirrors shattered and sent shards of glass everywhere and my candle was quickly snuffed out and I screamed boy did I scream I legged it out of there like nobodies business and slammed the door behind me Of course everyone was fast asleep but woken up with a few of my screams and sharp kicks to the ribs They attempted to calm me down but i was flailing and screaming I told them we had to get out of my house but where do seven  year olds go at  am in the morning Eventually I calmed down and tried to pass it off as a drunk hallucination which i knew was very impossible but it made my mind sort of at ease We decided to get everyone up and camp downstairs in the living room I felt safer with all of them around me and after much apprehension my tired state got the better of me and I drifted off to sleep Last night was some of the worst nightmares i ever had I saw my friends hanging and mutilated I saw my childhood cat lay gutted on the floor I saw myself smiling at a mirror When i woke up i was upstairs in the room In between both mirrors which had been shifted to face me lying on the floor All my friends had left when i called them they all gave me half ass reasons and some just avoided the question altogether Im scared It is now  and starting to get dark again and I havent been into the room since I woke up this morning Help me please I dont feel alone in my house anymore,Please help I screwed up,102
ephique,27,24,1r5tqd,81,Me and my brother were spending some quality time playing old video games from our childhood just chilling on the couch in my upstairs bedroom when the electricity in the entire house went out It was just us two home at this point and it was pitch black outside In desperation of finding our way through the house we used our phones to take flashshots giving us a small update of where in the big upstairs level of the house we were trying to make our way to the staircase leading downWe finally did and from there it wasnt ridiculously hard to manage ourselves to find some candles and what not We did what we could to drain out the time while waiting out the electricityproblem Eating sausage rolls gossiping and having conversations about what games to play once the electricity was backIt did come back after a couple of hours We already found ourselves in the kitchen positioned in the lower level of the house so we brought some snacks and drinks before we inevitably decided to continue our journeys into Donkey Kong Country Super Mario World and Castlevania  on the Super NintendoUpon starting our Super Nintendo my brother asked me where the remote for the tv was since we both were too lazy to actually use the power button on the tv Although the remote was nowhere to be found While looking for the remote which we both swore has never been anywhere else than on the coffeetable next to the couch the electricity ran out againMy brother expressed as he sighed Oh come on are you kidding me Being slightly more prepared the second time we picked up our phones and started taking flashshots again After a couple of shots the memory on my phone ran out I never thought we had taken that many pictures Either way I entered my image library on my phone to delete the old photos from the first time the electricity went out I took a good look at the first picture I opened it was my brother walking ahead of me just before we reached the stairs There was a man standing just next to him in the picture,Where is the remote,105
BensonHedges,4,21,1r2xlz,77,I heard the coffee pot drip before my alarm even went off bizarre I dont usually set a timer I like to go to the gym before I have my coffee Maybe it was my boyfriend being nice He typically works the graveyard shift and sometimes he comes home in the early morning to leave nice surprises Might as well get up I said aloud to myself since no one else was home My cat was absent from the bed which is also weird hes usually by my head in the mornings As I stretch my legs and arms out I notice an odd chill run up my spine Surely it was the weather New England has a way with inconsistent temperatures and the blanket over me was not quite fit for winter Its November that sixtydegree weather is bound to disappear sooner or later I havent quite figured out the thermostat we just moved in and the heat only seems to kick in on times when Im not home Must be the reason we bought this place so cheapand why people keep selling it New England is not the place to have a busted heating system This has been the biggest point of arguments since my boyfriend and I started cohabitating Get out of bed youre going to be late to your class I said this to myself a few times in hopes to have motivation to get to the am class at the gym I had no idea what time it was but if the coffee pot is going off it was creeping close to sunrise I havent unpacked the alarm clocks yet so my phones been the only thing reminding me what time of the day it is I thrusted my arms to the floor and pulled my phone to my bed   am What the fuck Ive still got twoandahalf hours of sleepand why is the coffee pot onI slipped out of the bed from the left side and stumble to the kitchen to turn off the coffee pot Im a coffee lover but nothing smells worse than burntcoffee As I went to flip the switch to off I realize the time isnt illuminated on the pot Directly above on the microwave  nothing Damnit The power went out The dripsound of the coffee pot was so loud and it was too early I was confused I could even smell the lingering scent of fresh brewed coffeebut it was am my mind must be playing tricks on me I headed back to the bedroom a little freaked out but convinced it was just all a coincidence This hallway seems so much longer in the dark and I still havent gotten used to the layout of this condo As I pass the bathroom I notice a shadow out of the corner of my eye I turned my head and didnt see anything except the shower curtain pulled all the way open Since weve moved in we havent used that showerweve got a shower stall in the bedroommuch more convenient Though I am sure there was a logical explanation for it When I get to the bedroom  another chill down my spine This was uncomfortable it was a winter chill I was feeling I was sure of that Something was wrong but i couldnt figure it out I need to go back to bedI hop in the bed and pick the blankets from off the floor As I turn on my side I hear the heater click on The electricity is back onfantastic I start counting sheep in my head to fall back asleep and keep thinkinghow did the blankets end up on the floorWhat feels like an hour later my alarm finally goes off The smell of burnt coffee has filled the condo and now Im frustrated I should have just unplugged the damn thing And where is my cat I have most definitely woken up on the wrong side of the bed I moved to the kitchen to pour some coffee  and its dry Nothing I must be imagining things That chill again I could feel the hairs spike up on my neck  absolutely razor sharp I decided to skip the gym and start my morning I remained timid but continued with my normal routine As I rummaged around the kitchen I noticed my cat out of the corner of my eye He was twitchy and obviously anxious A few years ago my cat had major anxiety problems and he developed what my vet called  Rolling Skin Syndrome When my cat got anxious his skin would roll around his body it looked almost as if he had a small gum ball moving around beneath his fur Today that ball was most definitely movingHe paced back and forth around the house with me now seeming more comfortable now that I was up with him Every time I moved to another room he cautiously peeked around the corner almost as if he was looking for something We moved to the bathroom I started to floss and then I heard itdrip drip drip I am sure its not the coffee pot and the house starts to smell again As I analyze my senses the smell become more pungent Less of a coffee smell and more of a rancid scent Drip drip dripI follow the noise it seems louder now and it seems like its coming from the bedroom Surely I would have heard it loud and clear when I was in bed earlierit seemed so distant then I enter the bedroom and my cat stopped dead in his tracks His skin is rolling again and he appeared more on edge tail straight in the air and its hairs following suit And that chill of course it was back And my sheets and blankets on the floor againWHAT THE FUCK Im working from home today and every time I walk by the bedroom I get the chills Ive resorted to closing the door until Im not alone It sounds like the wind is blowing up against the windows in that room but from where Im sitting the trees are as still as everEDIT Things are getting weirder or Im just going crazyhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrzlqgoodmorningnotpt,Good Morning,98
CDC,14,31,1qwsx4,76, I always hated going outside after dark Night casts a natural shroud around my home what is familiar during the day becomes a mystery to me at night Its a mystery I have no intention of solving Those were my thoughts as a child At  years old Im suppose to be over my fear of the dark but the darkness fills me with dread As far back as I can recall going outside alone after dark has scared me As a child I had a ritual If for any reason I had to walk outside after dark I was not allowed to turn around and look behind me  There was no rhyme or reason for it I just had this very real sense this feeling that if I turned around someone would be standing there waiting for me to see them The feeling was almost a taunt as though some force was daring me to turn around but I couldnt seem to bring myself to do it At around  years of age I had been dealing with this problem for quite some time Be that as it may my absent minded ways got the better of me and all to often I would leave my bookbag in the car after school After dinner it was homework time and I inevitably would have to go outside to fetch my books My mom drove a Cutlass but we also lived with my grandparents and my grandfather had a rather large GMC van It was fun to take camping which we did often The van was parked parallel to my moms car in the driveway On the nights that I would leave my bookbag in the car it was same system every time Walk straight to the car open door grab bookbag spin around look directly at front door walk straight inside never look back on the way inside Never  One night everything changed Ill never forget that night My grandmother had made fried chicken for dinner and it was an especially cold night so I put on my blue coat to go out to the car I loved that jacket though I was beginning to grow out of it My arms stuck too far out of the sleeves and it was beginning to look ridiculous on me  Such is life I suppose People outgrow things and they replace them Although I could feel the brick in my stomach in regards to having to go outside after dark it was a brick that had been laid long ago and was generally regarded as a familiar fixture That night I walked out the front door walked to the car opened the car door leaned in grabbed my bookbag spun around saw the front door in the distance maybe  feet and I began walking slower than usual Im too old to be doing this anymore I told myslef out loud I stopped walking I stared at my front door for a while longerFuck it I told myself for perhaps the first time ever  I slowly turned my head and my body followed Turning I saw my moms car about  feet away from me I spun all the way around and looked directly at my moms car Same as it always was No different Nothing I raised my head ever so slightly and caught view of my Grandfathers van beside my mothers car I didnt notice it at first I stared for probably  whole seconds before we locked eyes Peering at me from behind the van were two eyes two unfamiliar eyes The eyes were connected to a face that seemed to be grinning at me ear to ear For a moment I stood frozen eyes locked on the man behind the van His smile seemed to get wider the longer I stared All I could see of the man was his face partially obscured by the blanket of night and his right hand planted firmly on the back door of the van I couldnt tell you how long the staring match lasted It felt like an hour though it was probably more like  seconds There was a taunt in his expression a dare Was he daring me to come closer To Turn back around and walk toward the door I felt there was nothing I could do but continue this stand off until his head slowly pulled back behind the van and he was gone I walked back into the house backward never taking my eyes off that spot on the van Somehow I managed to make it back inside without falling Good memory I suppose Today Im  I still have to go out to the car after dark somtimes but I never dare to look back I know hes there watching waiting He wants me to know hes there he wants me to see him Hell never leave me The winter is coming and Ill need to start wearing a jacket soon I bought a nice heavy one about  years ago Kind of old I know but it does the trick and this one fits me just fine ,Hes still there,107

JohnFrostNeruda,6,16,1quu9h,60,Strange things used to happen in my childhood home The house that I lived in was ancient almost a hundred years old Its only reasonable that a couple of people could have died in it right  Over the course of ninetysix years five people died in that house I did research on all of themBecause I saw all of themEvery single night the house would force the souls to replay their deaths  I noticed this when I was fifteen yes it took awhile  I was up to get a midnight snack when I saw James Gunderson in the kitchen with his greasy haircut his leather jacket and denim jeans  He was vomiting uncontrollably and then he passed out choking on his own filth  His spirit was gone the next morning  You would think I was scared out of my mind but I was more perplexed  I looked up James Gunderson and found that he died of alcohol poisoning after coming home from a party in   He was sixteen I never touched alcohol after watching his deathJames Gunderson was there again the next night and he had company  Alice Williams was chasing a dog down the stairs when she slipped and fell She was such a cute girl too with blond curls and deep nutbrown eyes  She wouldve been a heart breaker Her head struck the edge of the fifth step  I would then see her mom run screaming down the stairs to find her five your old daughter spasm uncontrollably as the family dog lapped up poor Alices blood That was a sad case But you should never leave your toys on the stairsJack Saline was an elderly man who slowly passed away in his room which my mom turned into a guest bedroom  I remember enjoying watching his death It was somewhat serene Mr Saline would gaze out the window as a spectral beam of sunlight would hit his face He smiled and then closed his eyes for eternity His body would shake with a death rattle and then he would fade out Until the next night of courseThe fourth death was strange because I never could figure out who it was A man was in the basement I heard him thumping around one night and went to investigate The mans face was sweaty and his face was stained with anxiety He got up to pace around when he looked up at the top of the basement steps Our eyes met and I saw years of wear and tear on the mans face  He nodded his head like he knew me and then he walked out of site into a dark basement room leaving his cause of death unknownThe next person to die in my house was my sister  She was never right in the head and we seldom spoke to each other  She was the eldest of my parents children and yet it seemed like she was forgotten She hung herself on the ceiling fan in her room  I remember my mother and my two other sisters being devastated but my father and I were largely indifferent He always had trouble finding feelings for others and I was a regular chip off the old block  The night after her funeral I watched Ellie grab a rope from the tool shed and tie it to one of the fan blades She hesitated a little bit when she put the noose over her neck and stepped on the chair Our eyes met and I saw a hint of fear in her eyes  She took a deep breath and jumped Her face got redder and redder and redder and she started tugging on the rope to set herself free but she was only making it worse She had second thoughts She didnt want to die like she thought she did This wrestled with me for a couple of days My parents decided it would be best to move and I agreed with themBefore we left I set the house on fire I didnt even think about it that much I just did it  I watched it burn and it was strangely comforting  I dont know if it had any effect but I like to think it did,Souls Rewinded,76
UnrealsKY,4,21,1quz7p,60, Part  Stupid bitch Die after workThose are the words that hung over me like a prophecy Im not sure exactly why normally Id dismiss such comments as someones emotions and sense of selfimportance getting the best of them But for some reason this time the words worked their way into the back of my mind like little tendrils Strangling all reason and perverting my perceptionIm getting ahead of myself I should explain a few things before sharing my experience I work at an answering service and about a year ago I worked third shift What this means is I answer phone calls for businesses from all over the country when they arent in or are otherwise unable to answer their phones I then take messages and either forward them to the office or dispatch them to people on call Third shift meant I was manning the phones pa by myself I was the sole person in the building from p to a most nights Now the majority of the calls we receive are people complaining about something They need a prescription called in their water heater is leaking or theyve locked themselves out of their apartment Something along those lines And people will often get upset when youre unable to help them This is usually expressed through yelling and cussing etcI want to share with you a series of calls I received one night around a and my experience afterwardsIt began with an older woman calling on a public housing property management account She had a southern accent The kind where the letter R has two syllables instead of one Like areuh Anyway I answered the line by saying our answer phrase for the particular accountThis is how I remember the call goingMe Thank you for calling blank Housing Authority This is UnrealskyHer Thank goodness yall answered I need help You have tosomethingShe was rushed out of breathe The end of her last sentence was unintelligible she was speaking so fast This isnt uncommon People tend to panic when their apartment is being flooded or something similar My job is to keep them on task gather their info and get someone out as soon as possibleMe The office is closed maam youve reached their answering service What is the reason for your callHer Im telling you its not workin Oh lord please help me please It took my boy I IShe had started sobbing now That last statement was kind of strange but I moved onMe What is not working maamHer Oh my god Oh my lord Im sorry Something Im sorry Oh my godHer voice trailed away as she moved away from the phone I then heard a familiar beeping on the line On this particular account the company has one of those buzzer boxes on the front entrance of the building where you can ring a particular apartment to be let in or you can press a certain option to get the office or security desk or whatever After hours choosing that option causes you to get the answering service  me  and we have no way of letting anyone in or anything like that Were in a completely different state And the line is timed so when that time is up the line will begin to beep notifying you that its about to be disconnectedAnd the line disconnectedThe call kind of rattled me People will act like anything is the end of the world but she sounded like she was actually in fear for her life Like she was in immediate danger I sat there a minute just looking at my screen as I pondered the idea of calling the security guy I mean I knew she was at the front of the building he could go check it out But before I got a chance to the same account popped up on one of my other lines I answered itMe Thank you for calling blank Housing Authority This is UnrealskyHer Let me inShe screamed this at the top of her lungsMe Maam Im at an offsite location I dont have the abiliShe interruptedHer God damn it Please let me in I cant something Oh god itsMe Maam MaamI tried to interrupt herHer Oh god Oh please Her voice trailed away from the phone again but came back Her pleading had morphed into anger nowHer You son of a bitch You dont let me in I swear boy IMe Maam I want to help you I cant let you in but I can contact securiAs I started the beeping started as well Right before the line disconnected she said those five words  yelled them actually  interrupting meHer Stupid bitch Die after workA chill went down my spine and my heart started racing There was so much hate in her voice It was terrifying Briefly paralyzed by fear and confusion I stared at the screen scrambling for what I should do Her voice and those words felt so powerful Finally my brain found its way back to reality and I quickly pulled up the number and called the security guy on his cell phone As it rang I tried to figure out a way to put what I just heard into wordsSecurity HelloHe sounded groggy I woke him upMe Hello this is Unrealsky with your answering service Ive got kind of a strange call for youSecurity  Yea What is itMe I just had two calls they both came in from the buzzer box on the front of the building It was a woman and she was kind of hysterical Sounded like she was in danger practically begging to be let into the buildingSecurity ShitI could hear him moving probably getting out of bedMe YeaI didnt know what else to saySecurity Probly some stupid crackheadMe Um I dont know It sounded legitimate to me I thought Id at least notify you in case you wanted to go check it outSecurity Alright Ill go check it outI started to say thank you but he hung up on me before I could get the words out He didnt sound very pleased to be woken up I didnt care thoughWhat she said echoed in my mind Stupid bitch Die after work I had done everything I could I did my part but I still felt antsy Uneasy Afraid I wasnt really worried for the womans safety It was just that her threat  no her curse  had freaked me the hell out It sounded unnatural Powerful Real That was when I realized that I had been sitting up straight in my seat the entire time had started to sweat pretty profusely and was bouncing my legs up and down like a maniac I had to laugh at myself Why was I letting something like this get to me Being concerned for her safety made sense but why was I so scared Why was I taking her emotionally charged but completely insubstantial curse so seriouslyI stood up from my seat and threw my headset on the desk I had to walk around Walk it off Forget about it I made my way out into the break room and grabbed my coffee cup from the cupboard As I was filling my cup with the fresh coffee I had just put on not long before I was playing the calls over in my head Trying to make sense of it allWhat did she mean by its not working and it took my boy And why did she say after work I mean I understand people get upset and will say anything when theyre mad but why after work Seems unnecessarily

taken over ten years ago I remember the vacation vividly My twin brother was tormenting me as much as always but the picture was one of the few where I actually looked as though as I was enjoying

looked at the house there are no openings for anything to get in but I didnt believe animal control so I ripped out a panel of drywall and found nothing I have not been dreaming at all the last weekOctober st  Its again the picture fell off my dresser I cannot think of a reason why this would happen maybe my dresser has a tilt to it When I picked the picture up I stared at it for a few seconds I could almost swear I am turned more toward the ocean than I remember being Not to mention the fact that I look Im not really sure how to explain itthe smile I remember me having in the picture is more of a frown I am going back to sleep now but it just bothered me enough I felt like I had to write this down tonightIts morning now took another look at the picture nothing has changed I must have been halfawake last night when I thought I saw that stuff Though honestly the stuff with the picture is starting to creep me out I have it set on the floor now There is no way that it can fallOctober nd  I woke up to a sharp pain in my foot and found myself standing in the broken glass from the picture frame There was a little blood but not much if it continues bleeding I will go to the hospital I havent slept walked since I was a kid Im going to have to buy a new frame for the photo As I picked up the picture from remains of the frame I saw another change I am almost positive I have taken a few steps away from where I used to be I am behind my family I know that is not what the picture looked like before I decide to put off cleaning up the broken frame until the morning I stare at the picture studying it I doubt I will fall asleep tonightI fell asleep at some point last night and woke up with the picture underneath me It was exactly as I remembered it a little crinkled from me sleeping on it though I must have been imagining things again last night I would write it off as all a dream if it wasnt for the cut on my foot and the shattered frame on  my floor which I still have to clean up My birthday is coming up in a couple weeks we are supposed to be having a family dinner I am going to ask my mom if she has another copy of this photo Its one of my favorites from my childhood and I want an unblemished copyOctober th  I have continued to wake up at  every night I stopped looking at the picture I put it in a drawer But tonight I dreamed about it In my dream  year old me was moving backward slowly like some invisible force was dragging me toward the ocean The first thing I do in the morning is look at the photo Its still the same Always the same The five of us my mom and dad in the center with my dads arm around my moms shoulder Smiling the happiest of smiles My older sister next to my mom her head on her shoulder a half smile on her face and her hand on my brothers shoulder Then me and my twin next to my sister in one of the few moments where he wasnt trying to strangle me we almost look as if we want to be around each other All this on a beautiful beach with blue waves crashing in the background A picture perfect happy family I know this picture by heart It cant change its impossible I tried calling my mom she didnt answer My sister also didnt pick up her phone Ill try again tomorrowNovember st  I decided to look at the picture when I woke up tonight I pulled it out and was horrified Im in the water now up to my neck choking on a wave I immediately shoved it back in the drawer After a few minutes I reconsidered opened the drawer again and carefully placed it in an envelope further adding another layer between it and me I tried to call my mom again but its late Im not surprised she didnt answer My birthday is in two days We never came up with any solid plans but I always go home for dinner on the holidays so I will see everyone soon and maybe this will make more sense I havent been sleeping well since all of this startedI didnt sleep last night I spent most of it thinking I dont know when was the last time I talked to my family Or saw them for that matter I wonder if I did something to upset them I mean thats the only reason I can think of for them avoiding me Maybe it was that fight I got in with my brotherNovember nd  I managed to sleep for about  hours last night and I had a very disturbing dream I dreamt that my brother was laughing and eating me alive I think I might be going crazy I pulled the picture out at around midnight and it was normal Looking at it though I dont really look included in the family I dont think it represents the happy memory I want it to November rd  Todays my birthday I am about to drive to my parents house Im bringing the picture along to show them    I dont know who I am I dont know whats going on Are all my memories false am I crazy I am trying to calm down enough to write this outI arrived at my parents house a little after pm Dinner is always at  Their old black sedan was parked in the drive the same as always At the last second I hesitated and decided to leave the picture in the glove box I have gotten too obsessed with it and I dont want to scare my family And I can describe which one it is pretty easily anyway to see if my mom has another copyI went up to the door and rang the bell I havent had a key in a few years My mom opened the door and looked confused She asked what I wanted I told her I was there for dinner just like always she only looked more puzzled She said she had no idea who I was but she was very busy getting ready for her sons birthday dinner I thought she must be trying to play some kind of joke on me I reached for the screen door to open it She yelled out Stop sounding afraid I jumped back I realized she truly didnt know me I wondered if in the time since we last talked if she had had some kind of accident or started to develop early onset Alzheimers I was very worriedHaving heard my moms yell my brother appeared at the door behind her and asked what was going onTrying to cope with what was happening I started talking to her as if she was a child I told her I was her son I was born November   She told me she only has one son My twin brother was standing right behind her getting scared I yelled at him asking what was going on He responded that he had no idea who I was but November rd was his birthday and he did not have a twin Upon hearing this my mother began crying Through her tears she told my brother he did have a twin but he was underdeveloped and died at  AM the night they were bornAt this point I was terrified and confused As a last ditch effort to understand what was going on with my family and make them understand they were mistaken I told them to wait I had something to show them I frantically ran to the car and popped open the glove box I pulled out the envelope with the picture and ran back to the doorstep I told them it was a picture of our family at the beach around  years ago I slowly pulled out the photo and turned it over It was a picture of a happy family of four people I wasnt in the picture My mother and brother both gasped seeing that it was indeed a picture of them My mother then began to get angry and demanded I leave before she called the police because she thought I was trying play some sick prank on them I got in my car crying and came home Im still sitting here in shock not knowing what to do next I pull out the picture looking at it Im not in it How am I not in it I cannot accept this as the truth    I found the picture he was obsessed with Its actually kind of funny there is someone who looks a lot like me standing in the background,Family Photo,82
iwillneverbefree,8,18,1r1p8k,50,Im just your average everyday guy with a job I cook I clean I drink hell I even had a girlfriend before all this started going down If you saw me on the street youd walk right by me without a second glance Its just that I have a job Im a ParamedicI dont do anything important I just help those in need I started doing this because I didnt feel great about myself I always loved helping others and I always loved AampP so I saw this as a logical step I loved every second of it when I first started There was no greater high than when your adrenaline kicked in and your hands moved faster than your mind could think It was ecstasy This went on for  years Every day I fell more and more in love with my job My calling The only thing that bothered me was that overwhelming sense of being in a battle I thought it was normal afterall I was fighting for someone elses life I thought If only I knew how true that statement wasIt started off with a shadow when I walked onto a scene I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me Maybe it was my constant concern of someone attacking me God forbid I got shot while working I should have known something wasnt right when my partner looked in the same direction when I did I should have known better when he just shut down and barely spoke the rest of the night This went on for a while every so often seeing the shadow Things started to get worse however when the whispering startedAt first they were nonsensical Sometimes I wondered if they were even there at all if I was just going fucking nuts But they were They WERE there It only took me losing my first patient to hear them clear as day They were congratulating me They were telling me how great of a job I did I didnt understand then My mind had been turning on me it had to have been Its the stress Its the stress of losing someone I told myself on my way home I sat at home and hit the bottle Hoping that my next shift would be an easy one one quiet shiftIt wasnt quiet I should have known better than to use that word Its bad luck The voices didnt go away They only got louder Every patient I had I could hear them Its their time Shes ours now Let her rest I thought I was just compensating for losing someone I thought I was just preparing myself if I lost another one The more people I lost the more they got more sinister Youre almost ready I havent seen one this talented in eons You cant change fate Come join us I didnt understand right then but I understood it all soonIt was a  year old male His heart stopped I had to save this one he was just a child I HAD to save him We got him to the back of the ambulance and I started my work Things felt odd I felt as if I was in a daze My vision was blurry the lights seemed faint against the road I tried not to think about the voices I tried to block them out I did a damn good job until it screamed my nameJOHN I heard I stopped and slowly raised my head to look at the bench seat across from me It wasnt what you would expect death to be It wasnt a man in a robe with a scythe It was just a man in a suit with black eyes I froze I had to have been insane I needed to tell my partner to drop my off in the psych ward when we got to the hospital His smile was calming It was the kind of smile youd expect a great car salesman to have calming but also sinister His hair was well kept for a man his age Id have to say s or s His eyes like a void of everything that makes us human as if they were a black hole that sucked all feeling out of whatever had the poor misfortune of getting caught in their pathHavent you been listening John He said with a caring toneYou know what you must do You know who youll become Why are you fightingI started screaming at him Who are you What do you want Why have you been following meHe ignored all of my questions He simply put his hand to the child and started rubbing his headYou fought for so long John You know this is your fate How much more pain can you endureWhat are you talking about I yelled at him as the childs rhythm became worse and worseDont you understand John weve been with you since day one We are who you fight every day We are the ones who you ignore to do your job We are youI began to understandJohn you must know something He said looking at the monitor as it flatlined This will also be your fate You will die just like everyone else Theres nothing you can do about itDont you think I fucking know that I yelled grabbing the epinephrine out of my bagJOHN He yelled again knocking the epinephrine out of my handYou need to understand the forces that be When you die John you will become one of usThe fuck I will I said standing up but was forced back down by some unknown forceIts not something you can change John You have so much potential so much promise Weve been watching you from the day you were born and we are very very excited to meet youI stopped fighting I looked into his eyes and I felt something Something I wish I never would have felt I felt at peace It was if all the stress of saving a life was gone It was as if I didnt have to fight anymore It felt like I was being held by my mother again like all was right with the worldI sat there and placed my hand on the child I felt death pass through me I felt the coldness of the nothing reach my heart and sit there I understood now I understood why I am who I am It was as if everything made sense to meYou dont have to believe me Hell if I was you I wouldnt either All that I ask of you is that the next time you see an ambulance look closely for the man in the suit with black holes for eyes Maybe Ill see you too,I work with death,68
jinn,8,40,1qzm6d,48,Ok so Im not a writer so please excuse my mistakes and storytelling telling style Im not great at descriptions or anything like that so forgive me This actually happened in  I have a son who at the time was  years old when his father and I moved us into a small two bedroom house in an older part of the city I was telling him about the spooky things that happened  in that house and this is when he told me something new about our time thereFirst I have to describe the place When Lee and I went to look at it it was so adoreable on the outside It was painted white on a quiet street with a huge backyard It completed my ideal of a family home We were living in a basement suite at the time and I was tired of living in suites I wanted my own space and backyard This little house was within my budget It was a two bedroom the second bedroom being in the basement The first bedroom faced the street and to right of that small bedroom was a livingroomkitchen area and towards the back to the left a bathroom and across from  that to the otherside of the kitchen a stairwell into the basementThe very first night Lee left me and my son alone I dont remember why I just remember that I had this continuing nightmare throughout the night about something dark coming for us from the basement and it took its time I felt frozen in the front room and I struggled to get to the front door which was a few feet from where we slept At about sunrise I woke up finally The horror of the dream lingered but the sunrise eased my fears I made it away in my dream but after I woke up I still felt haunted That was the first nightLee and I got a dog We adopted one from the spca and he was already full grown He was named Sparky  my son named him Sparky was a lively gentle and smart dog He had something stuck in his paw but he never snapped at anyone who bumped it We only found it after we had taken him to the vet It was open and bleeding and we had to give him antibiotics for it and keep it cleaned but he never snapped or showed any discomfort The reason why Im going on about this is because when i tried to get him to come downstairs so he could sleep there instead of outside he growled when i pulled his collar and he knashed his teeth at meSo he had to sleep outside Lee worked until am because he was a cook and so it was me my son and Sparky each night except for weekends when my step kids came over to stay with us Anyways this dog would always bark at  at the back door I told that to Lee and the dog had to sleep outside after that because he was noisyLee had three other children Sally who was  Asher who was  and lily who was  months old Thats a different storysigh Our family was complicatedThe first thing I suspected something was wrong was the night I went to bed downstairs Lee was already under the covers and I was in my tshirt at the foot of the bed I felt this draft come from the floor up my legs under my shirt I got goosebumps all over me It couldve been a draft I know  A draft that went up and across me It was a basement afterallThe second thing that happened was in that basement bedroom again I woke up with the moon shining brightly through the small window above our bed I looked over at Lee and he had this grimace on his face and it changed his face his expression made him look like an older man plus ive never seen him make that face before I got chills and rolled over to face the wall and cringebut then i thought maybe he was having a nightmare so i turned back to see if he was ok his face was smooth and he looked like Lee again I dont know how I fell asleep but I didLife continued Lee and I were arguing in the basementwhen al of a sudden he went white and his knees buckledshit that scared me I grabbed him and put his arm around my shoulder and took him upstairsHis daughter would scream and cry when he tried to bring her down there I told him the second time she did that to stop bringing her down there I knew the house wasnt right I just had other more pressing things on my mindOk this is part is from my sons point of view It was a weekend i had the kids and it was a hot summer day Sally was feeling left out from the boys and so I told Asher to stay with my son while i went ot get ice cream with Sally I wanted to have some girl time and make her feel special and wanted because with the new babylily it was a rough transition to going from daddys girl to big sisterAnyways we get back and I knew something happened Both my boys were in the backyard and not arguing just serious and outside watering the lawn I asked Asher what happened I was thinking an accident of sorts He tells me there was a man in the basement A man with a green shirt My son collaborates with him on this and they are both looked very disturbed by this I asked him where he went and a white faced Asher says he didnt know he didnt come out The chills up my spine man I asked if the man talked to them tryed to come close to them or anything to make sure they hadnt been touched or anything and they said he didnt come close to them he just walked around downstairs thats when they ran outside and waited for me to get backThis last part is when my son told me just recently He said one night he and Sarah were awake in the bedroom  they all had to share that one room Asher and Sarah on one side Aer on the other bedIn the white light fixture it was one of the square white shallow dishes put over the light bulbs Anyways in the light fixture in the saw a woman in the kitchen moving around looking like she was cooking something but the could clearly see the kitchen and no one was in there and I guess Sally asked Aer if he saw it too He said no because he didnt want to say yes out loud he said he was too scaredhe said it was the middle of the night we were downstairsWe moved out shortly after For different reasons but that house without a doubt had something in it I tried to ask the neighbor next door but she said nothing ever happened there It looked so cute out on the outside,The cute little white house,88
UnrealsKY,1,37,1qxu2p,45,Sorry for the delay You know rules and all of that Part httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsquzpstupidbdieafterworkpart if you missed it Part   I started walking back into the call center from the break room when a thought occurred We have a voice logger that records every call that takes place on our system so I stopped at the supervisor station on the way back to my desk Maybe if I tried to figure out the pieces of what she said that I couldnt understand I could make some sense of it I pulled up the logger and searched for all the calls on the account in the last hour There were three The two from her and the one where I called security I clicked on the first one to start playing itMe Thank you for calling blank Housing Authority This is UnrealskyBut then where I should have heard her voice there was just this static It kind of waved in and out getting higher pitch at times but there was no woman Just staticMe The office is closed maam youve reached their answering service What is the reason for your callAnd then the same static again There was nothing besides my voice talking to and responding to this static I sounded crazy I set down the headphones I was using to listen to the call  What the hell is this and various other similar thoughts trampled through I tried to mitigate the wave of confusion and fear with some sort of reason Maybe theres just a problem with the call or the voice logger and it only recorded my side of the conversation Maybe it was because she was calling from that buzzer box Maybe it was just that callI picked up the headphones again and clicked on the second callMe Thank you for calling blank Housing Authority This is UnrealskySuddenly this painfully loud static screeched through the headphones causing me to drop them I could still hear it as they laid on the desk so I clicked stop on the call and just stared at the screen for a whileI reasoned that that had to be it then When they use that buzzer box to call in it has to cause some sort of problem with the way the lines are forwarded or something and for whatever reason the voice logger cant pick up the other end of the call It just comes through as static Its the only thing that made sense It was the only explanationDeciding to just forget about it I walked back to my desk and sat down A few calls came in on other accounts before I got another call on the housing authority account Nervously I answered itMe Thank you for calling blank Housing Authority This is UnrealskySecurity Hey man its security Just wanted to let you know there wasnt nobody out thereMe Oh um alrightAgain I didnt really know what to say On call people rarely check back with us about this sort of thingSecurity Was probly just some stupid kids out playin pranks tryin to scare people Fuckers spray painted your name on the front door in big red letters He laughed My heart raced and that chill came back My nameSecurity Probly thought you were goin to be the one to find it Heh idiotsI feigned a laughMe Yea people can be ridiculous sometimesSecurity Youre tellin me makin me get up in the middle of the nightMe Yea sorry about that she just soundedHe interrupted meSecurity No no its not your fault this town is full of idiots Bet youre as ready to get off of work as I am to get back to bedHe laughed again Whats with all the small talk They never do this especially not in the middle of the night Ready to get off work Whats it to this guy Whats going to happen when I get off work I feigned another laughMe Yea um you have no ideaSecurity Well you have a good night manMe Alright you too ByeMy adrenaline was pumping Ready to get off of work What the hell was that And my name spray painted on the door It had to just be kids They knew my name from how I answered the phone That made sense And their story wasnt even very good it didnt make any sense Its not working it took my boy Amateur Just some stupid kids trying to scare me Stupid kids and a line forwarding problem Nothing moreRegardless of my attempts to reason it away it all kind of lingered on the edge of my thoughts as I tried to collect myself and took a few calls on other accounts As the time passed I managed to push the subject further and further away but I just couldnt shake it entirely I felt uncomfortable and tense Despite being alone in the room I felt like somebody was watching me Like something was waiting for me When not on a call I paced looked out the windows repeatedly and drank my coffee Hidden in my little room counting the time until I was off work and I could see that this was all just some stupid kids playing a joke and nothing was going to happen I mean they were in a completely different state what were they going to do to meI drank so much coffee that night The rest of the night was really slow even for third shift Usually I would consider that a good thing but that night I hated it It felt like torture waiting and watching the clock I knew nothing was going to happen but that didnt matter Those words had a grip on meStupid bitch Die after workAt a I heard the door buzzer go off meaning someone had opened the back door Only employees know the code to get in but regardless it startled me The back door is in the break room and I could see the door into the break room from where I was sitting so I leaned back to peer through the little window It was the first shift supervisor early for her shift Despite knowing that was who it had to be I was relieved I dont know what else I would have expected We greeted each other as she entered the room and she offered that since she was there early and it was slow that she would just take over for me and I could go home Normally this would be something Id jump at but this time I was hesitant Suspicious I got a grip on reality though and took her up on the offer and thanked her I thought about telling her about the weird calls Id had but figured Id just end up sounding crazy Back in reality it was kind of embarrassing So I just left it aloneAnd thats really what Ive done with the whole thing for the past year Just left it alone Nothing ever came of it Obviously Im here writing this so I didnt die after work I realized it was just one of those things where something finds just the right spot in your brain in just the right circumstances to plant this little seed of fear   of some inexplicable unknown  that grows and grows gripping and strangling your thoughts until you find all the pieces Until you can explain away that unknown And that morning when I got off of work and nothing happened I was able to leave it all behindBut theres a reason I decided to type all of this out I still work at the same answering service though now Im a second shift supervisor and we still answer for that same housing authority One of my agents tonight received a call on that account and asked me to listen to it She said the person gave all of their information really quick and she wasnt able to get it all down before they just hung up on her So I pulled up our voice logger listened to the call and wrote down the information the caller had rambled off At the end of the call though my heart started thumping again The caller didnt hang up on my agent She was calling from the buzzer box I heard that familiar beeping again shortly before the line disconnectedThat means our voice logger works just fine recording the calls from that buzzer boxWho or what did I talk to that night,Stupid b Die after work Part ,82

MissMonstrosity,20,26,1r5z11,47,Hello everyone I told this story to a friend who told me I should post it here in Nosleep Im sorry for any grammatical errors or bad commentary Im not much of a writerAbout four years ago I was a troubled thirteen year old who like most teenagers didnt get along with my parentsIt was just me and my little Brother our Mother who spent more time on the computer then being a real Mother and our Step Father who in most cases acted more like a frat boy roommate then a parental figureAnyway this all started one day when my and my Mother got into an argument only god knows what it was about since we argued all the time  back then All I remember is that I stormed off taking a backpack of clothes and some food with me and ran into the woodsWe live on a huge property in the country and the woods go on for miles and miles in every direction with only a small creek running through it to break up the never ending amount of treesAlot of people might be freaked out by the ominous looking place but I loved it I went exploring out there everyday and I knew those woods like the back of my handI ran to the south west down a large hill that had the creek I mentioned earlier at the bottom of it the creek itself went on even farther than the woods cutting through several private properties and stopped just outside of a town over fourteen miles awayI decided Id follow to town where Id find somewhere to stay the nightWhy not just take the road to town well we lived in the country there were alot of crazy people out here drunks hillbillies prostitutes and a combination of all three I figured if I took the road Id only be asking to get raped or robbedIll fast forward a little about  hours later I finally came to the edge of our propertyThe property after ours belonged to an old man we met him in church a couple times Despite several threatening No Trespassing signs  I wasnt worried If he did so happen to come all the way out here and somehow find me I could just claim to be lost  I was sure he wouldnt be this far out in the woods anyway Here the woods thinned out a little and there were several small fields tucked between the trees I came here before but never went any further then the edge of the fieldsAt this point   the sun was only an hour or so away from setting and I started walking faster to hopefully get to town before nightfall I ran through the creek that separated me from the field and slipped on something causing me to fallIt hurt like hell later I found out I had broken my toe It was bleeding badly and I had to limp the rest of the way through the creek and fieldsI came to the end of the fields several minutes later where a small path either for ATVs or a tractor led through the woodsI never went this far before but I knew if I kept going straight Id get to the town within only an hour or so so I went onAfter what felt like forever of following a twisting path that seemed to go nowhere It finally came to a small circular clearing There was a fence surrounding it with a large sign once again threatening anyone who crossed I thought it was strange we were hours from any house why bother putting up a fence blocking off where no one would ever be likely to go Then again I was going through so maybe it wasnt all that uncommon I crawled under the fence foot still hurting like hell and went on through the clearing I knew I wouldnt be caught theres no way there would be anyone out hereI walked or more less limped through the clearing on the other side there was another small field and just my luck there was a old tree stand in one of the trees surrounding it We have a large hunting community and hunters often hide out in the tree stands that were often camouflaged in the treesI thought it would make a great place to stay the night since the town was still a long ways away and it was already starting to get darkI went up to it and poked my head inside it was perfect Just enough space to lay down and sleep if need be I climbed back out and headed back to the clearing There was a large hill to one side of it I figured if I climbed up it I could see just how far away the town was Ignoring my aching foot I limped over to the hill and right in that moment something hit me on the back of the head It felt like someone angrily poking me or throwing a small  pebbleI turned around quickly expecting to find an angry farmer or hunter no one was there it was probably just an acorn or nut falling from one of the surrounding treesI laughed at myself for being stupid and rubbed at my now aching headFor whatever reason I decided to not try to force my way up the large hill and instead went to the opposite side of the round clearing I dont know why it just felt like something was pulling me thereAbout half way across the clearing I stopped dead in my tracks and gasped I literally uttered  the words Oh my God Before quickly shutting my mouth in fear someone might have heard meThere before me were several grave stones All ranging in height and design The ground in front of some of them was lower than the rest of the ground almost as if the coffins underneath had caved inI stumbled over to the graveyard and bent down to try to read the headstonesMost were unreadable Only one of them had enough words I could make out it looked like two headstones fused togetherThe one on the left read GA Keaton date unreadableThe one on the right said Harriet Keaton   at the bottom just visible was Our angels together in heavenAt this point I turned and ranI blacked out for most of the time I was running I ran through the clearing ran along the path ran across the fields until I was finally back on our property I only slowed down because it was pitch black outside and stupid me forgot to bring a flashlight It was so dark I could hardly see in front of meOnce again Ill fast forward I finally got home after my step father had found me apparently he went out looking for me not to ensure I was safe and guide me home no Only because he wanted to drag me home to make me apologize to my motherI didnt care I happily followed him homeAfter finally getting there I found my brother looking like he was crying and my mom sitting at the table eating dinner looking like she didnt have a care in the world She glanced at me made a face And left the roomOver time I ended up telling her about the graveyard she found it interesting and soon enough all my family knew about the weird graveyard in the woods It became quite a conversation topic in our family before over time being forgottenOne thing I never told anyone though And the reason I went running out of that place like a baby Was because shortly after finding that cemetery I started to hear whispering and among the trees behind the graveyard I couldve sworn I saw something moving Then right after reading what was on the one tombstone what felt like a long boney fingerStarted tapping on the back of my head,A Cemetery in the Woods,73
wezziford,7,18,1qxs1g,46,There is almost nothing that I hate more than flyingUnfortunately yes yes first world problems due to the course my life has taken I find myself on a plane at least once or twice a month  Generally speaking my flights are boring and uneventful with a smattering of panic attacks here and there when we fly through a thunderstorm or encounter severe turbulenceGenerally speakingOne of my more recent flights was from Miami to Boston a voluntary trip home to see friends family and dog  Midafternoon departure exit row to myself  all ingredients for an almost enjoyable flight  Honestly except for the woman in the row ahead of me chatting yelling with her row mates all flight I would have had no complaintsUnfortunately for those of us that fear a fiery plane crash into watery grave type of death the most direct flight path from MIA  BOS is largely over open water  For most of the flight I had my nose in a book and felt no need to even peek out of the window next to me  This time though the captain announced that the left side of the plane had a postcard perfectview of New York City  However as I am lazy and perhaps spoiled in the sense that Ive seen the city so many times I decided to stay put and see if the right side of the plane had any majestic vistas to offerI started to lift the shade  what the fuck was thatAlright wezziford youre a paranoid flyer  Look again  rip that fucker open  Holy shitAn unfathomably huge head blunt at the end and longer than the freighter it was surfacing next to  I looked around me  of course  The view of the city had almost everyone on the other side of the plane oohing and ahhingSnap out of it  Look again  Too much medication before the flightA literal gaping maw  It looked like a portal in the ocean full of teeth on top of teeth  Andshipping containersThe freighter  Fuck  Now listing heavily to one side as its cargo tumbled into the ocean cavern and just as quickly swallowed by the blackness  In about  seconds maybe even less the ocean was still again  The hole in the ocean replaced by what looked like a huge greyblue island that shot a geyser into the air that seemed it would hit the plane before disappearing back into the seaI turned my head from the window breathing heavily and sliding the shade back into place  I denied denied denied willing myself to believe that it was an overactive imagination and paranoid mind at work always assuming the worst when it comes to flight  As I settled back into my seat trying my damnedest to stop sweating I realized how quiet the exit rows were  I noticed wide blue eyes looking around the seat in front of me  the loudmouth  With a face as white as the clouds we were flying through she looked to my window and then back at me  Hands clutching the cross around her neck lips moving without sound I knew at that moment that she had seen it too  This wasnt a Benadrylinduced illusion  This was real and true and completely unnoticed to anyone but usMaybe the Biblical tales and sailors stories have been true all along  We laugh and poke holes in the plots looking for scientific explanations to prove them wrong because it makes it easier to sleep at night  The ocean is vast unexplored and desolate even more so than outer space  Perhaps its best we keep it that way,Livyatan,64
irinax,47,13,1qzk7i,45,UPDATED Ive been trying to find similar stories to mind but I wasnt able to find anything that would help me figure out what is going on But I found this subreddit so I figured I would just register for an account and try to find help hereI recently moved to a new town its all been great and I love it One evening at a park a woman approached me and started asking me how have I been doing how is life and in the end  why am I in that town how did I decide to come she wouldnt expect to find me there She referred to me as Magdalena and asked me why didnt I stay in a certain small village When she figured I had no idea who she is and that I was rather shocked that I was approached by her she got kind of angry and first told me to cut the shit and kept ranting I couldnt shut her up to ask what is this all about she kept rambling and rambling on and on In the end I just told her to shut the fuck up shes a freak I have no idea what was all of that about and I dont want to hear any more I even started making threats She was pissed but she walked away Im not Magdalena that is my greatgrandmothers name She lived in the village the woman mentioned  Shes dead And the woman that approached me couldnt have known her because she doesnt look older than  my greatgrandmother has been dead for more than that People say I look like her when she was young and there is only one picture of her  when I compare it to me yes we do look alike almost the same My grandmother says we even have the same walk same mannerisms and voice But thats not a weird thing  not freaky at allWhat is weird in this  even if this woman DID know my greatgrandmother or saw a picture or whatever  why would she address me as Magdalena No one can stay the same after more than  years and thats how long ago she COULD have looked like I look now If she was alive she sure wouldnt be a young woman walking around parks in random towns Its a ridiculous assumptionI asked my grandmother about this she asked me to describe the woman and tell me about her behavior I did She asked me how did I react and as I explained the exchange she just cut me off and asked me if I was bitchy to the woman I had to admit that yes I was but she provoked that reaction My grandmother said Good she wont bother you again But that was it I asked her about the woman who is she what does she want why and how would she assume I am my greatgrandmother but my grandmother just told me to leave it as it is because I got rid of herMy father told me that its all ridiculous and she must have made a mistake looking for someone else but it doesnt sound like it What kind of a coincidence would it be that she was looking for a Magdalena from that village And plus there are no young people in that village anymore Especially not ones that are called Magdalena and look like meI met her in the same park again and she just apologized to me for her behavior I didnt I figured if my grandmother says I got rid of her by being bitchy Im not going to take it backI was still in shock but a few days later I approached her shes always  in that park in the evening  I asked about her name who is she why did she talk to me that day etc but she wouldnt answer She would keep going off topic saying that its a nice day or that the woman over there has a nice jacket or the dog under the tree is cute etcSo I just let it goBut Im still creeped outPlus I see this woman all the time in that park And the moment I arrive  she turns to me looks stares She listens while I talk to people looks at me no matter what am I  doing When I leave the park she stares at me for as long as she can see me She never gets up even though I assumed shed follow meI dont see her any other place but the parkMy grandmother told me not to talk to her not to mess with this to just let it be and let it go but I cantHelp advice opinions  UPDATE  I called my grandmother since I figured it would be better than trying again with the woman At first she wouldnt tell me absolutely anything but once I said She couldnt have known greatgrandma she cut  me off and said She could and she did Then she said something like But she doesnt need to know you and Im telling you to stay away  Obviously I tried asking who she is what is she but I got no answer so I asked is she dangerous evil  she said no but she isnt such good company either  She compared her to a friend I had when I was about  that wasnt really evil or bad she just often caused trouble and if you were her friend youd be in that trouble too of course Shed stick with you through everything but shed cause the shit that you have to stick through in the first place I told her I want to know more and if she doesnt tell me Ill find out on my own possibly by asking the woman she said I dont need to know but its my choice and if I dont trust her enough to stay away thats fine but shes not talkingMy father told me its all bullshit and I can just go talk to the woman and ask her is she crazy or drunk or drugged or something But how the fuck did she know,Who is this woman,58
Desequencer,3,21,1qwubp,44,I woke up this morning with little to no recollection of the day before Its not the first time eitherI remember waking up I vaguely remember going to work I dont remember what I worked on I only remember waking up again this morningBeing a detective you can imagine that this type of mental illness would not go over well with my higher ups No one knows that I have a fleeting memory except my brother I call him every time it happens because I have no one else to talk toAgain he asked wearily not even greeting me after he picked up the phoneI sighed and rubbed my headStill no headaches or anythingMy brother works in pharmaceutics so he knows his fair share about medicine but hes still no doctor I havent gotten any pills from him instead Ive only gotten pleas do go to a real doctor Like I said I cant do that Not with my jobIm going to work I saidCome on man Be reasonable What case are you working on right nowThat missing person case where the husband claimsRight right He became more serious solemn even I know you dont trust him butBut whatMaybe hes telling the truth I laughed Like hell Theres a realistic explanation for everything that appears supernatural Including hauntingsI believe himAfter the brief chat with my brother I got ready for work It pained me to be unable to remember a single damn thing from the day before The best I could do was believe I followed my usual routine deep into the fog of my memory Shower breakfast drive case I would have interviewed the husband about the case I would have written down new information I would be fineI got to work and found the most recent folder in my case list A missing persons report and the husband was being held for questioning There was no new information from the day before so I wondered what work I had even gotten done yesterdayAn officer brought the husband into one of our interrogation rooms at my request Still no headway huh the officer asked when I met him at the doorI furrowed my brow Why do you say thatHe shrugged Well you were in here with him yesterday You left in a hurry so I figured you you know had somethingI glanced at my folder in which I had written nothing about this interrogation yesterday Struggling with what to say to cover I shook my head NothingDidnt mean to step on your toes Detective Just curiousNot a problem I gave the officer a reassuring smile and entered the roomWhat is this for man the husband asked before I had a chance to shut the door He was frustrated and I didnt blame him I needed answers for more than just this case thoughI sat down across the table from him and opened the folder skimming over it Id already read through the available information but I wanted him to sweat Based on what I had I suspected the guy and I wanted him to think that Id found the evidence to nail him But when I looked up after a minute or so he wasnt sweating He was dejected his face in one of his handsSo whats the story I askedI told you he groaned It was thatThe last four interviews he said the same thing Thats what my reports say But the last time I dont know what he began the story with I glanced up at the camera in the corner of the room deciding to pull the tape and see what had happened As for now Id had enough Why dont you tell me something new JohnLike yesterday He was quick on the trigger What about yesterday huh You hurry out of here like youve got to take a huge shit and now youre back here today starting overI held my hands up to calm him down Alright okayYou didnt find her thenI didnt remember Sorry not yet You know Im working on itGo talk to the dry cleaner or his wife theyll corroborate my storyThat your wife is missing because of a ghost Maybe I had already gone to see them and one of them hit me over the head so I wouldnt rememberThen again maybe my lapses in memory were related to the case Theres a realistic explanation for everything that appears supernatural Including hauntings I was making headway but forgetting the progress and not for inexplicable reasons Was someone keeping track of me I glanced up at the camera again briefly imagining that one of my higher ups was responsible for this I suddenly felt in over my head as I tried to reason through this logic It was as unreasonable as a haunted dress right Are you even listeningI snapped out of my train of thought and looked at John No I was thinkingDonthurt yourself he said quietly sitting back in his chairWhen I noticed that his eyes were fixed on my nose I became aware of something draining from it BloodAre you alright DetectiveI didnt have an answer Ill be I got out of the chair Ill be back I stammered backing out of the roomAfter waving the officer off I got to the restroom to clean myself up The bleeding stopped after a moment but even then I remained to stare at myself in the mirror trying to figure my own self out There was a piece to this puzzle in my brain and I didnt know how to get it out Maybe my nose would bleed it out for meI went back to my desk in a daze I sat down and found that my computer was off which was peculiar Due to the long boot up time I usually just logged out and left it idle overnight Groaning I pushed the power button on the tower and waited the agonizing several minutes before the login screen appearedOnce logged in I used the shortcut to open the program we use for digital case information Instead of opening the program it opened a text fileCheck your trash and youll seeA wave of chills crashed against my back What was I supposed to see I swallowed and looked at my trash can Empty Not that I would rummage through it while the office was busy anyway Then realizing my mistake I checked the computers trashA single text file UntitledI opened it hesitantly and I was greeted with a long slab of prose instead of a single line of text Shaking I began to readIt was that dresshttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsowyathedress,And Youll See,65
Decendent,4,28,1qwq4m,41,My mother recently told me about how sheoblivious at the time was almost raped and possibly murdered by Mike The Mall Passer DeBardeleben httpenwikipediaorgwikiMikeDeBardelebenHe was a serial rapist murderer counterfeit money passer and sexual sadistShe told me recently that in  while she was in college in North Carolina she noticed someone following her in a big car as she walked home one night from class She tried to ignore it at first but when it was obvious that she was being stalked she got scared She saw a cop car parked at a gas station and ran to it and the car that had been following her peeled off Once she thought she was safe she continued her walk home Everything was ok until she had to cross the little footbridge thats on her way home Once she was over it the same car ripped around the corner and stopped her and a man rolled his window down and started small talk and asked her if he could give her a ride She said No and started to turn at which point he grabbed her and tried to pull her into the car She said she jerked away and immediately ran to a house that was across the street and he sped away weeks later she awoke to the sound of her roommate screaming Mom and  other girls all shared a  bedroom apartment so it was  to a room When she gained her vision she saw THE SAME GUY standing in the middle of her room looking at her She said that the look on his face was calculating The roommate screamed Who are you what are you doing here and he turned and replied uhI uhforgot my guitar and grabbed a guitar that was leaning on the wall The roommate shouted Thats my guitar and he threw it to the ground and ran outAfter reporting this event to the apartment manager the manager told my mom that some guy had come by a few days earlier stating that he was a family friend of the pretty girl with long dark hair that lives upstairs and wanted to surprise her So the apartment manager gave her pretty much ever detail about my Mom Where she works goes to school basic weekly routines Of course my Mom flipped out on her as anyone wouldThat was the last she ever saw or heard of him until several years later She was reading a book about notorious serial killers in America and read the story of Mike DeBardeleben Who was all over the country raping and apparently killing some of his victims When she flipped the page and saw his picture she gasped It was him They also showed a picture of his car and it was the one that followed her that night Once she told me I started to research I found this page  httpwwwdocstoccomdocsJamesMichaelDeBardelebenMallPasser that showed that he was in the North Carolina area at the same time my Mom was attending college there Also the victimology shows that he targeted women around age  and  my Moms age at the time Seriously got the creeps He died in  I wouldnt be here today if he had done what he was planning to do Im glad he dropped his pursuit but I wonder more often than I shouldwhy I can only assume that his initial plan failed and it would have been too easy to tie him to any crime committed against my mother at that point so it was easier to move onHis next victim was Laurie Jensen She lived but was repeatedly raped Who knows where she is now but for some reason I cant get her out of my headTLDR  My mother was almost raped and possibly killed before I was born by a serial sexual sadist named Mike DeBardeleben He died in prison in ,I was almost never born,69

DickBanditDoneLanded,10,63,1r1zac,39,As a kid I grew up singing songs of joy with my friends Fun songs that made me feel like a child There was one song that I never really liked for reasons unbeknownst to me but that one song would become a living hell during my adult lifeMy wife packed my sons lunchbox with a pizza lunchables It was always his favorite one I had the privilege of walking him to school that cold October morning holding his hand the whole walk We talked about toys games and then the topic of songs came upHey dadhow come you never showed me the song about Josh Jacob Jinglehyper Smith he asked Haha you mean John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt I never liked that song kiddo I replied I thought his name was Josh like mine He added We got to the school about half an hour earlier than the entry time so I suggested we go to the playground located around back Josh agreed and followed me The air felt relatively dense that day I could barely see fifty feet away and asked Josh to stay in sight and have a little fun before school starts I look away at the birds in the trees and Im startled by the piercing cry of my son nowhere in sight I call his name and he says Sorry dad I fell off the monkey bars Ill be fine I sighed and laughed a little knowing my kid was such a warrior I notice Josh riding a swing and laughing with another little boy who also came to school too early I see his father standing on the side laughing and I worry about not being a good enough dad to Josh I start to walk toward the boys and thats when it hits me I wasnt watching Josh play none of the two boys was mine I tried to keep calm but felt the need to yell out his name to locate him I look around the playground and the school bell rings announcing the schools opening The dense foggy air dissipates and Im able to see everything clearly I find a note in the second floor of the jungle gym it reads I know how hard you tried to avoid me I wouldnt want the same thing happening with JoshMy heart sank and my eyes widened as the note dropped on the mulch and made a thud I felt every possible emotion at that one point in time I didnt know what to do where to go who to ask for help so I walked into the school where I come across a corkboard with pictures of kids on it All of these children were abducted by a strange man who walked into the forest beside the school I knew what I had to do I ran into the woods clenching the note he had written John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt I hear a high pitched voice scream from the bushes as I fall to the ground in fear I noticed a building on a hill about a mile into the wild It was a greenish wooden house much like the ones mystery inc would investigate but this was not a game this was my sons life and possibly that of many other children The smell of rotting was emitting throughout the air and I feared the worst for the status of the kids Not willing to be detected I snuck in through a window that was left open and creeped about the dark house with nothing but my signalless cellphone and my dedication I was in the basement floor and couldnt see anything so I turned on my flashlight app I had no idea I was about to come across one of the most horrible sights anyone couldve seen There were mutilated corpses not just any corpses but children kids who I had met through class pictures my wife bought and showed me The kids were decapitated burned sliced naked I was scared for my life I almost threw up one too many times but swallowed it back along with my will to flee I found a wooden staircase that was old and rotting The first step I took on it made a loud creak and there was a groan in the distance I hid behind a giant flowerpot as a huge figure approached the area I was in I could barely breathe as I noticed this man had blood between his fingernails as if he mutilated the children with nothing but his fingers He returned to the room and I followed him from afar The smell I picked up earlier was much stronger than before and I heard muffled cries coming from the room the man walked into Say it with me now kidsJohn Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt His name is my name too Whenever we go out The people always shout There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schm A kid bit a hole through the duct tape on his mouth and was able to scream while he sang I heard the kids name It was GaryThe children were all able to remove their mouth bindings and cried in unison for about ten seconds Then I hear a loud laugh followed by a SHUT THE FUCK UP At this point I was enraged Nobody has the right to scream at kids like that nobody I barged in grabbing this freak by his backlength hair and slamming his face into a table with limbs on it What did you just say to those kids you motherfucker I yelled oblivious to the children in the room Youre gonna pay for all your shit you son of a bitch I said Well thats just too damn bad He added I didnt know today was the day Id be found Its such a shame youve missed your playdate with your sonhe was SUCH a nice boy He said laughing his head off at the sight of my expression I was cold I was numb My son was dead I unleashed my fury on the man not holding back at all I knocked him unconscious and tied him down to a giant piece of metal I broke both his legs and made sure hed never walk again then I released the children many starving and ready to go home I tugged the slab down the hill and walked alongside the children toward the school The police had previously raided the woods but never came across the house in the entire year he had been performing the kidnappings I called the school and notified the authorities of the serial killer I had slayed and I wanted to make sure he was arrested and would suffer his whole life for what he did to my wife and I She was hysterical unable to perform for almost a whole year We cancelled any holidays and vacations and mourned a year away We finally concluded that our son was happy in a better place with the rest of his friends Although my wife and I never had any other children I became teacher at an elementary school in another state and was happy knowing I had kids who were fun to be around and nice to me One Monday morning we have a new girl come in and I ask her to introduce herself Shes laughing and shes shy and she wants to whisper something in my ear Ill introduce myself if we can just play today She says I promise her along with the class that well have a free day and she introduces herself and makes friends I start to like this girl because I never had a chance to have a daughter and always wanted one She was very sociable and was the class clownShe stopped coming to school for a week and out of curiosity I called her parents to ask about her sudden disappearance Her mother was crying and I couldnt understand her so her father came to the phone I told him about how the class missed her and he told me about a note that was left at their door one afternoon It read Go through her drawings I asked the dad to give me a minute while I did just that HE was in the pictures Every drawing she made had him hiding in the background There was a folded piece of paper that was thicker than the rest Little did I know it wasnt school paper it was skin Pressed and cut to replicate a note I thought by now youd figure out I was never human I got on the phone to tell the girls father the news but all I heard was a demonic maniacal laughter I felt a hole in my chest as the phone line went dead followed by three beeps and elongated static,His name is my name too,102

breezy,4,13,1qvgrc,32,I was about  or  when this happened and I will never forget it I ate lunch with my little group of friends every day at school We noticed that our friend Erin had been overly tired for the past few days and asked her if there was anything wrong At first she answered no but then she said Well there is but you guys wouldnt believe me if I told you Well of course we wanted to know what it was after that We finally got it out of her Ive been waking up in the middle of the night lately andI swear my dolls are breathing Woah What Our friend Blair and myself automatically gained interest  we were big fans of the paranormal Mary wasnt as interested and was very skeptical Blair and I decided a slumber party was in order statThe next day was Friday we all arranged to have a sleepover at Erins house and find out for ourselves about these breathing dolls Erin had a rather large bedroom upstairs At the far end was a bay window with a bench to sit on and on both sides of the window there were two shelves lined with Erins porcelain doll collection probably about  dolls in all We had a great time doing normal dorky things girls do at sleepovers we all practically forgot the main reason we were staying there in the first place Time flew by and before we knew it it was about am Well said Blair lets hit the hay and see what these dolls doWe all settled into our sleeping bags or makeshift beds shut off the lights and waited Occasionally one of us would say something that would make the rest of the slaphappy gang laugh but eventually we settled into silence We all laid there for probably about an hour listening and waiting and trying not to fall asleep I was just starting to doze off when I heard Erin whisper There it isdo you hear it Blair Mary and myself lifted our heads up and listened It was quiet but definitely therea faint rhythmic breathing Are you sure were not just hearing each other asked Mary We all held our breath to test that theory but the breathing still continued Blair the bravest of us got to her feet and slowly made her way over toward the dolls Erin and I got up and followedMary followed also but hung back a waysThe moon was shining through the window illuminating the dolls from the side As we leaned in to have a closer look we noticed somethingcondensation underneath the noses of several of the dolls The condensation coincided with the breathing we were hearing the spots getting larger on the exhale and smaller on the inhaleTHE FRICKIN DOLLS WERE BREATHING Needless to say we freaked out There was a door in Erins room that led to a storage area over the garage We flipped the lights on ran into the storage area grabbed a box and threw all of the dolls in it Then we took it back into the storage area put a couple heavy boxes on top of it then closed locked and barricaded the door None of us slept very well the rest of the night after experiencing that and just knowing that those dolls were still under the same roof as usErins house was and still is incredibly haunted and all kinds of weird things have happened there over the years but this was by far the craziest I had one porcelain doll that immediately went into the trash as soon as I got home To this day I still refuse to own one and really just hate dolls like that in general I know it wasnt the dolls themselves so much as whatever was possessing them but Im definitely not providing a vessel for whatever it was,The Breathing Dolls,45

from school to the recent craziness and she came to the conclusion that I was in mild shock It sounded right I still hadnt wrapped my head around the fact that I was alone now Ill talk to you in a few days she said with a smile resting her hand on my headA woman in her early fifties she had aged well A fine wine among most women who age admittedly like milk She left and I thought I could rest I couldnt I was confronted instead by Officer Hughes a man of Filipino descent He introduced himself asked how I was feeling seemed like a genuinely good man He slid up the chair and sat down looking at me with the somber expression that made it seem like hed be telling me my mother was deadSon Its about your mother My heart stopped My pupils dilated my muscles tensed I sat straight making the bullet wounds stretch and feel just awful Do you have any idea where she might be She was still alive I thought that had been what I wanted to hear but instead I panicked My mother when she was more sane was OCD She didnt like leaving jobs half done Face growing pale I shook my head Uhm I have Grandparents I could barely talk and the answer didnt please himYes we know On your mothers side Theyve both been killed It seems after your mothers escape she went there to talk to your parents We assume that your grandfather decided to call the institution and tell them where your mother was and she found out Your grandmother died from lacerations your grandfather Well Theyre no longer alive he said Now I felt it Remorse pain Without his assurance though I knew this wasnt my fault Mom was She was going crazyHow do you know they were calling the institution The officer smiled They received the call They just never heard his voice She was too fast for them he said trying to say it as calmly as possible From there she took your grandfathers Browning M handgun and  HampH rifle I guess you came into contact with the handgun He seemed solemn My mom Shes not going to jail is sheIf we catch her shell be in an institution the rest of her life Medication forever She wont escape there Is there any other family she might go to There wasnt Do you guys have any regular places youd like to go We didnt Well fuck where would she b his voice was rising but he was cut off by the nurse entering the room quickly We received a phone call she said in a panic The officer stood quickly and she almost started balling Some woman she sounded mad She She said she was coming to pick up her son she said among chokes of tears Goddamnit The officer yelled running his fingers through his hair I didnt understand the problem but apparently the area they thought she was in was the complete opposite side of town from the hospital He was my only protection I have an idea I offered up timidly The officer looked at me bemused and irritated Well If I know her she just wants to finish what shes started Which means she knows charging in here wont work out Shell probably just sit around until I try to go home So why dont you just take me home in your car well beat her there and you guard me You can have your backup waiting like a block or two away And shell think she has a chance if its just me there Kid thats actually a good idea he exclaimed He helped me into a wheelchair and took me to his squad car loading me in and watching his back like he was the one being followed Once I was strapped in he entered his seat and we started driving I arched back watching the hospital fade away as a nurse stepped outside to see me offIt wasnt a nurse though It was my mom in a nurses outfit Shed been in there I was wrong She was going to finish the job in there herself I cried I lost it unable to keep it in anymore and explained through sobs what I sawHe shook his head unable to believe it Dont worry kid I offered my service to this career to help people like you Innocents Itll end soon and youll be okay he tried soothing me I know but it did little to help She almost had me She knows where Im going I can feel it Its about to end I feel scared I feel like youre the only ones I can talk to None of my friends have contacted me and this officer Hes great and all dont get me wrong Nice down to earth and genuinely wants to help But he took me upstairs and put me in my room and has been watching out since The police agree that staking out the house would scare her away and we need her captured fast Hughes will be staying in my house with me sleeping during the day while they have a squad car parked outside and an officer who comes in to check up every five minutes Hughes stakes out at night in my moms old room Ill have no time to talk to him to take the load off my mind But its coming to an end soon I can feel itPlease be with me Nosleep I need you,I Love You Mom Part ,45
IrishSurfer,2,14,1qscwt,31,On June th  my high school was one of many that took us to Disneyland for Grad Night If youve ever been to Disneyland on Grad Night you know how much fun  and how crazy  it can be The park stays open extra late the skippers who drive the Jungle Cruise boats let loose and tell dirty jokes and theres plenty of opportunities for people to sneak booze and weed in Getting a bunch of amped high schoolers in Disneyland is one thing but with a nightlife and party atmosphere behind it things can get pretty nutsMy two friends and I Anaheim locals were particularly excited We all loved Disneyland and while we didnt get to visit often living practically in the parks backyard gave us more opportunities than most In addition we hadnt been since the new Fantasyland opened earlier that year going from a sort of Medieval fairground into a storybook village so I was kind of looking forward to that Unlike a lot of people who were there we intended to keep things clean and have a grand old time of it hit as many rides as possible and just revelBut the big plan for the night was kind of ambitious and maybe a little reckless  to this day I cant remember who suggested it first only that we all thought it was a great idea We had already gotten into the park and gone on a number of rides when it was brought up while we were sitting on a bench in Frontierland eating churros From where we sat we could look across the Rivers of America to Tom Sawyer Island and past that where the river curved to New Orleans Square Poking above the trees was the cupola of the Haunted Mansion with its clipper ship weathervane The sun had just gone down and the sky was awash with dull orange and purple clouds most of which seemed to loom behind the cupola I pointed out how perfect and spooky the whole thing looked and that got us talking about it The mansion was a collective favorite and being dumb kids we agreed to do a little exploring to effectively spend the night in the Haunted MansionWe laughed about as we got in line for it moving past the brick columns and up the walk toward the mansion but inside I was a bit nervous You have to understand security was a bit more lax back then so it was plausible that we would be able to pull this off if we were careful Plus Grad Night always had kids getting into trouble and the likelihood of us getting banned for good was not as high as it could have been But I still felt tense that feeling you get when youre scared about going on a thrill ride for the first time excited but hesitantThe three of us  Mike Karen and myself  had it all worked out when you first enter the mansion youre escorted into a room that seems to stretch and warp before your eyes which is actually an elevator that takes guests below ground where a hallway connects to the ride building beyond the parks berm As everyone else crowded out of the room and into the Hall of Morphing Portraits we lagged behind which the disembodied voice of the Ghost Host jokingly warns you not to do and fell in at the very back of the line By the time we piled into our Doombuggy there was no one else behind us and the black endless procession of clamshelllike cars were emptyWe went through the ride as normal cracking jokes and making banter at all the old familiar scenes until we reached the exit crypt We stepped out onto the moving platform and walked toward the escalator ramp that leads from the crypt back to the park outside If you dont know the escalator hugs the wall on the right but on the left is a small crypt scene where a tiny ghostly bride stands on a stone shelf and tells you to Hurry backHurry back Mike took charge here deliberately turning backwards as we went up to watch the cast member near the buggies below us Mikes a big broadshouldered guy a football player throughandthrough and his bulk hid me and Karen from view as we slowly ascended At his signal when the cast member monitoring the exit had his back turned Karen and I climbed over the rail and dropped down into the crypt scene where we quickly scurried under the dusty space beneath the escalator Mike was over a moment later and we laughed and congratulated each other on a job well doneWe must have spent a good hour or so down there giggling into our hands whenever we heard footsteps and voices overhead of unsuspecting people exiting the ride Karen even had some snacks shed brought with her and we sat there in the dark and ate and whispered to each other It was like being in a weird clubhouse and it felt good that we three shared this delinquency together even as the narration of the ghost bride looped over and over again in the background Hurry backHurry backBe sure to bring your death certificate If you decide to join us make final arrangements now Weve beendying to have youEventually the novelty wore off and we got quiet and then listless Sure wed managed this much but then what Karen pointed out that it had been eerily silent for awhile  other than the monotonous speech of the bride and other spooky ambient sounds there were no more people coming up the ramp Mike said he thought maybe the park had closed but that made no sense because it was open all night on Grad Night Not wanting to get in trouble but also wondering what was up I volunteered to clamber back up and take a look When I did using some of the crypt scenery for hand and footholds I saw that there was no one around not even a cast member down at the unloading platform at the endWhen I reported this Mike and Karen climbed back up as well and we went back down the unloading station to look around All the Doombuggies coming along the corridor were empty and there was not a person in sight It was odd to say the least and I felt like something was definitely off to have the place so empty I was about to suggest turning around and heading back outside when Mike said hed always wondered where the Doombuggies went after they dropped you off They rounded a dark corner in the crypt area and vanished from sight and Mike was curious what was down thereNow really I should have said no that there was no point and that we could get into some serious trouble if we snooped around back there It was probably just a utility corridor anyway since the buggies just looped back around to the loading room anyway But I was young and I was stupid and when presented with a golden opportunity like that it was hard to pass it upSo we went ahead and jumped into a Doombuggy going by and it slowly rounded the corner into the darkness This was uncharted territory for us and even if it turned out to be boring back there at the very least wed get a chance to see it and maybe get another ride out of itHardly a day goes by where I regret not having said somethingThe main thing I remember was how spartan it was It wasnt quite pitch black but it was even gloomier in there than the rest of the ride There were small lights set into the walls on either side of the track but they were low to the ground and far between The walls were painted black and the corridor seemed so narrow that I felt boxed in It was quiet too other than the hum of the track moving the buggies I felt tense and Mike and Karen werent helping that because they looked tense too I think it was dawning on all of us how much trouble we might get inI think a minute or so had passed like this us going down that dark featureless backstage corridor when the ride suddenly stopped and I nearly jumped out of my skin as a voice came from somewhere overhead  and laughed when I realized Id been startled by the normal breakdown spiel Playful spooks have interrupted our tour the recording went Please remain seated in your Doombuggy We will proceed in just a momentThe teasing was immediate as we all pointed out to each other how wed jumped We waited for the ride to start again and every thirty seconds or so the spiel would play We have been unappointedly detained by prankish spirits Kindly remain seated in your Doombuggy We will continue our tour momentarily This went on for good long while  ten maybe fifteen minutes  and still the buggies hadnt moved no one had come looking for us We were getting antsy and the silence between the announcements was becoming unsettlingThen Karen leaned out a bit and looked around and she noticed the door first Just ahead past the buggy in front of us worklights revealed a little alcove and a utility door on the righthand side of the corridor We were so sick of being in the buggy by that point we were willing to try anything so after a short discussion we all squeezed out of the buggy pressed against the wall to go past the next one  Mike had trouble here  and stood before the door I pushed it open finding it unlocked and it led to a metal staircase leading down into the darkness footlights like the ones in the corridor revealing where to go I was thinking up excuses in my head as we went down the stairs to explain why were likely stepping into Disneys underground utility corridors  the infamous Utilidors said to run like a spiderweb beneath Disneyland  if someone found us And by this point I hoped someone didAt the bottom of the stairs another closed door with a sign on it reading Cast Members Only We pushed through that as well and were legitimately surprised to see that it opened into what looked like a themed hallway Disney even backstage seemed to be paying attention to style as this hall sported the purple demon wallpaper and wainscoting of the rooms above It was even lit by candle sconces on the walls the fake flickering bulbs coated with cobwebs and dust Several detailed wooden doors lined the hall with outofplace white placards mounted to them Each was marked as a Prop Room with a corresponding numberAs we made our way up the hall we tried each door we came to and found them all locked The first door Prop Room  shook a bit but wouldnt budge Same with  and  Mike chuckled and said he wondered if we would find Walt Disneys frozen head down here but I could hear a nervous waver in his laugh Even I was feeling some sense of dread with each door we tried something hard to place but nagging At Door  I put my ear to the edge of it and thought I heard what sounded like rushing water or faint TV static from the other side and at  I noticed that the faux candles flanking it were flickering more sporadically than the rest like they were faulty Door  to left and near another plain utility door that marked the halls end was the only one that yielded to us and I was the one who turned the cold handle and opened it for the first timeIts difficult for me to describe what I saw in there without shuddering because even now my telling makes it sound fairly normal That is as normal as a room hidden under a theme park attraction can possibly be It wasnt very big almost like a large storage shed Unlike the hall this one was the bland utility black and lit by a single fluorescent light in the ceiling albeit a dim one The walls were lined with metal cabinets and there was some sort of large archaic gadget shoved into one corner not unlike the old computer banks from the s But what caught my attention right away was the grinning figure near the far wall across from the door  a dummy or animatronic of some sort lifeless and unmoving but standing on its baseThe discovery was fascinating to all of us and without thinking we all edged into the room and immediately approached the figure It was clearly meant to be one of the ghosts in the ride a specter in a top hat with a skulllike face cartoony bulging eyes and a leering smile one of the teeth was even painted gold He stood in a bowlegged stance one gnarled hand holding a cane and the other a hatbox None of us had ever seen this particular character on the ride before though Karen said its face looked a lot like the tall skinny hitchhiking ghost from the end of the rideI was just turning away from the figure to look at the cabinets when there was a combustion roar from the hall outside like the sound of a passing motorcycle followed by a loud bassy boom that made the floor shake The door to the room swung shut and the fluorescent light sputtered and went out leaving us in total darkness Mike gasped and Karen screamed and I was just reaching out for them in the dark when I heard a peculiar whirring sound Another light came on this one a concentrated green light above the hatbox ghost showing its skeleton smile for a moment before that light faded and another faded on illuminating the hatbox I could see through the material of the hatbox now and saw the ghosts head grinning at me from inside The pattern repeated itself rhythmically making it seem like the ghosts head was disappearing from his shoulders and appearing in the hatbox It wasnt a terribly convincing effect but in the dark and with the strange things going on around me it genuinely scared meI turned and stumbled through the room ready to get out of there feeling around for the door Now even the light on the ghost shut off and I heard Karen and Mikes feet behind me a crash and the sound of something solid tapping the concrete floor I tried pushing the door open but it wouldnt budge and somebody slammed into my back in the dark and caused me to hit it hard I was dazed but unhurt and another scream from Karen fueled my adrenaline even more I instead gave the door a tug and it openedI was out in the hall without a second thought without even looking back I started running sprinting back the way I had come gasping for air I was never a very athletic kid but panic kept me going I heard sounds behind me  footsteps Mike and Karen yelling in terror as they followed and what seemed like rapid knocking and banging on the doors around me  but I refused to look over my shoulder Up the stairs and back into the Doombuggy corridor in what felt like a matter of seconds The Doombuggies were moving now endlessly traveling through the shadows I knew it was risky to jump into one in this narrow corridor and for a moment I stopped trying to figure out what to doI finally looked back back down the stairway I had come from I thought Mike and Karen had been right behind me but they were gone I called out their names my voice echoing down the stairs but there was no reply Not until I heard something tapping the metal stairs coming up toward the door and saw an unfamiliar vague shadow on the wall that I flung the door closed and dove into the nearest buggy which carried me down the corridor a little ways before finally emerging into the limbolike loading roomAll of the effects were still running here including the eerie music and sounds but there was still no one else around I yelled for help but no one appeared As soon as I could I jumped out of the Doombuggy and ran back up the line into the Hall of Morphing Portraits Ahead was the door to the elevator the Stretching Gallery but I remembered that this area had a more immediate chicken exit meant for those too scared to ride the ride and wanted to head back up to the park The door was marked with an obvious exit sign sitting between two shuttered windows that made it look like it led outside to a stormy night and without hesitating I pushed through that as wellBeyond was another corridor on either side of me flashing lights pointed at the windows to simulate lightning flickering with each thunderclap that boomed through the hall disorienting me even further Turning left I followed the hall as the floor inclined gently up my throat tight and a stitch in my sideAnd then my throat closed altogether as I turned a corner almost ran into the hatbox ghostIt was standing smackdab in the middle of the hall between me and the door that led outside I scrambled backward instinctively but the figure didnt move It was a static prop grinning its cadaver grin backlit by a ceiling light further down the hall The light also broke the illusion of the hatbox and I could see vaguely the shape of the disembodied head through the scrimI was convinced  thoroughly convinced at that moment  that thing was going to suddenly jerk to life and come after me but it didnt I had no idea how it had gotten there from down in the sublevel or how it had so quickly Maybe the one Id seen below wasnt the only figure maybe Mike and Karen were pulling a fast one on me and had dragged the figure up with them I was frozen trying to figure out where to go next not wanting to go anywhere near the ghost but not wanting to backtrack either because I still felt like there was something sinister behind me Nervously I croaked out the names of my lost friends but there was no reply Noises from the ride seemed to come floating down the hall muted but everpresentThen I heard the groanIt could have been a human groan or something mechanical but I definitely heard it It didnt sound like any of the standard audio and it came from a point somewhere near or past the hatbox ghost maybe even from further down the corridor past the exit As if this were a trigger I realized that either my eyes had adjusted to the dark or the lighting had somehow changed because I looked again at the hatbox and saw the thing inside through the scrimThere was still a head in there but I know it wasnt the ghosts head It wasnt even a cartoon caricature of a head It wasnt Mike or KarenIts at this point the details allude me I know that what I saw shook me to my very core and thats part of the reason its taken me so long to recount this I remember seeing the thing in the box seeing that it was indeed a human head  a mans face a face I didnt recognize seemingly looking back out at me with shocked pleading eyes  but after that theres a blur of sheer terror and snatches of frightening images gnarled hands tombstones pneumatic hissing the stretching room going in reverse shrinking shrinking too fast the ceiling rushing toward me the corpse hanging in the rafters descending on meI try not to dwell on them too much because now Im no longer sure which really happened and which were the results of the nightmares Id have for years afterThe next thing I can remember clearly after that is being on my hands and knees just outside the fence of the Haunted Mansion vomiting onto the pavement while around me crowds of people stood Most of them werent paying me any mind there was lots of whispered talk and a few were crying There were redandblue lights police cars parked nearby but I couldnt tell why I just sat there gulping and sobbing until a cast member finally noticed me and led me to a first aid stationKaren was there when I arrived and she jumped up and hugged me tight when she saw me I dont think either of us made much sense we were both at our wits end but it was such a relief to see her after all that that any questions I had fell by the wayside Ill never forget how haunted she looked wideeyed and pale barely able to form a sentence without tearing upMike never turned upThat fateful night has never left me and in the years since then Ive slowly begun to piece together the details trying to vainly make sense of what happened It became sort of a private obsession something to do in the background as I moved on with my lifeFirst it didnt take long for Karen and I to learn why the police cars were there and they werent for us According to the reports we heard later an yearold guy from New Mexico had died while we were in the Haunted Mansion He and a friend had snuck into a backstage area on Tom Sawyers Island and stole a rubber emergency boat to go for a joyride around the Rivers of America Apparently this guy was pretty drunk and it wasnt long before he hit a rock throwing he and his friend from the boat His friend went for help but he drowned before they could find him His body was discovered an hour laterI wonder now if thats why there was no one around when we crept backstage I managed to track down a few cast members who were working that night and though most of them claim that they were told by management to not cause alarm and keep to their posts several admitted they had gone to check out the grim spectacle especially those CMs that were on attractions near the river like the Haunted Mansion Was the timing such that everyone turned a blind eye while we stumbled into something hideousMikes disappearance was something me and Karen both felt deeply and we tried for years to get something from anyone about it His parents told us later that hed shown up again a day or so later behaving erratically barely registering them deeply disturbed by something Mike had planned on moving out beforehand but that night after lashing out at his folks he grabbed very few personally belongings took the family car and drove off to points unknown After that he dropped off the face of the earthKaren and I eventually drifted probably because we blamed each other for what happened She never expressed to me what she experienced after we got separated either because she wanted me to feel guilty for leaving them behind oh Karen you have no idea or that she like me can only recall so much We were both too shaken to recount to each other But time and distance make things easier and with the advent of the internet there was suddenly a wealth of new information Ive since begun to piece together cluesAlmost immediately I found our Hatbox Ghost Plugging that into any search engine will turn up multitudes of pictures of that bowlegged grinning figure that has often floated through my minds eye in the dark It was apparently part of the attraction when it first opened in  and much of the promotional material of the ride at the time featured this character and his ubiquitous hatbox He originally stood in the attic scene right across from the ghostly bride with the beating heart but was quietly removed from the ride after only a week apparently the effect of his disappearing head never worked properly or so the official account goesIn recent years the Hatbox Ghost has gained a fanbase groups of Haunted Mansion fans that want to see him restored to the ride Its wishful thinking Im sure because that figure had to have been stored downstairs for a reasonIt took longer to find out about the backstage area where the Doombuggies go that empty corridor not originally meant to be seen by guests disabled guests however travel that route all the time Wheelchair access to the ride is done through the Limbolike loading room and guests travel back around to this room to reclaim their wheelchairs and head back out Ive posted about it and posed queries for details about that area but no one has given me a description that sounds anything like what I went through Its been described as short bland and with some sort of catwalk going over the track but no mysterious alcove or obvious doorway It takes less than  seconds for the Doombuggies to go through and then youre back in the loading room I suspect Disney might have changed that area since ht s but whyMost recently though Ive come across an odd factoid that seems more like a morbid curiosity than anything else unless ones been through what I have Its not about the Haunted Mansion however but its nearby Eticket neighbor Pirates of the Caribbean According to the story  and this has been published in various Disneyowned books so its no vague rumor  the Imagineers who built the ride felt that the faux skeletons of the time werent convincing enough for the underground grotto scenes So they borrowed real human remains from the UCLA Medical Center dressed them up as pirates and put them in the caves Let that sink in for a moment millions of people went by on boats and had no idea they were looking at real skeletons all propped up in pirate garb Eventually a later team of Imagineers would replace these with more convincing facsimiles and supposedly the bones were returned to their countries of origin and given proper burialBut whose to say they were What if something was left behind in that basement when the bones were taken And what if Pirates wasnt the only ride that did this The show building of the Haunted Mansion was built along with the rest of New Orleans Square in  but it took another six years for the actual attraction to open Why the delay It couldnt have just been the gridlock from the  Worlds Fair and Walt Disneys death in  could itAll of this is speculation a string of understanding that raises more questions for me than it does answers I want to get to the truth of what happened that night but everything Ive found doesnt add up to a concrete explanation perhaps there isnt one though I desperately want there to be And I cant go back  I wont  not after the things I saw and felt I havent set foot in Disneyland since that nightMaybe though Maybe its time I tried againKaren if youre out there and youre reading this Im sorry about everything Im trying to make it right trying to put some meaning to this Contact me if you can I need to know what happened to you and Mike  maybe you have the key to the mystery in your memories I cant do it alone but together we might get to the bottom of thisFor everyone else let this stand as a testament some things are backstage for a reason and a company like Disney must have a multitude of skeletons in its closets Think twice before you pull some stupid stunt like I did because it might not be security that finds you,Haunted House,45

koolgirl,15,20,1qufp4,27,For those that dont know Canadian woods can get a bit creepy during winter months  Anyway my grandparents own a farm outside of a very small town We only had some horses and ducks but my yearold self thought it was pretty cool There was a field with the main house in it a driveway up a small hill leading to my grandpas garage Just beside the driveway many meters is the barn the barnyard and the  fields behind them down the other side of the small hill The rest of the property is woods that me and my cousins used to explore  Now onto the story in question it was the middle of the night and I was having trouble sleeping Which was odd because I normally slept well especially at their house The guest room door was just open a crack to let the hallway light illuminate the room just a tad I was never afraid of the dark however I was terrified of the idea of someone watching me sleep without my knowledge The bed was parallel to the window so I could see the stars when the blind was down I sat there telling myself to sleep and eventually I did but I just couldnt force myself to at the moment I have a sudden urge to look out the window into the field even though I could already see the outside sky I sit up leaving the warmth and comfort of the blankets A light snow is falling and the beautiful Milky Way lights up the field almost like day I admire the beauty of the snowy field and woods until I notice a shadowy figure crossing the field towards the road staying along the treeline At first I dismissed it as a animal we saw animals a lot then I noticed the way it walked It was eerily human  It may only be a hunter I told myself as weve had hunters trespassing on our property before and I could see tracks behind it that looked human but something was different It was almost like it sucked the light out of the air It looked like it was a shadow Thats when it turns but I cant see if its towards or away from me The hallway light flickers and goes out Leaving only the ominous Milky Way looming over the earth to light the room I lay down  and decide Im imagining it The hallway light can wait until morning plus I dont think my grandparents would be very happy if I woke them up at  am to change a silly light bulb  As I finally feel myself slipping from the hands of reality I feel a breath on my face a small shhhh and hands locking around my neck and I fall into the void of unconsciousness  I woke up with bruises on my neck To this day I dont sleep with the blinds open  I also have many other stories involving that property that I may post in the near future  Edit I remember a whisper That may have been my imagination though   Edit  The tracks There was tracks behind it but they were gone by morning from the snowfall  Edit  Herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqxqptheshadowboy is the next one,The Shadowy Figure in the Field,47

slivr,9,12,1qtewa,27,a little groggy from the beer a few hours earlier a little stoned no worse for wear though  In any condition I was good to drive  I didnt even remember the womans name whos apartment I had just slinked out of at am  It didnt matter anyways I just wanted to sleep in my own bed  I pulled up the drive as I had any other night parked the car in the same spot as any other night  Something felt different this night though  Maybe cause I hadnt smoked or gotten laid in a while maybe cause my guard was down just a little bit more than usual I stepped up to the door reached into my pocket for the keys I thought I heard something as the keys made a light clatter while coming out of my pocket  You know one of those faint sounds where youre probably just hearing things where its probably just the wind going throw some tree branches or something like that  It was dark and I was feeling lucky so I picked one of the four keys and tried it and as I did I heard it again was it calling my name I fumbled as I hesitated while attempting to grab another key and I heard it this time it sounded like it was coming from inside help it was distant but it was urgent  I thought it could be my roommate it sounded like his voice Mike I said as I fumbled through my keys then hastily decided the moonlight wasnt bright enough I had to use the light from my phone  Hello Helpp once again was called out but I couldnt tell if it was from afar or from within my house or even if it was Mike saying it  The voice was so unusually muffled  I was still shuffling through the keys finally under the light of my phone as I urgently said Hang on Im coming I finally grabbed the house key as I heard it again this time it was incomprehensible yet still I could not pin where it was coming from  I unlocked the door and barged in and immediately called out to Mike beckoning for a response Mike Hello Mike  No answer  I stood there waiting for what I dont know anything  SilenceDistraught I went back outside to see if the voice was actually coming from out there My phone is dying  whatever Im at my house anyways I can use it to see in the dark if I need it  I called out Hello loud enough so that it could be heard but not too loud to wake up the neighbors at am  Nothing  A chill of realization goes up my spine as I discern that it has to be be one of two things Im crazy and hearing things or theres something there  Maybe it was the wind maybe I was just zoning out and imagining things  My pride wouldnt let me believe it no I thought I just made a scene in the middle of the night I heard something    I irrationally recalled how I had joked with Mike about our house being haunted after watching The Amityville Horror with him a few nights prior  Stop scaring yourself I thought that has nothing to do with anythingI walked as slowly and quietly as I could throughout the house first  I didnt dare flip the lightswitches for reasons unbeknownst to me  So I used my phone as a flashlight in hindsight this wasnt a bright idea  I didnt realize I still had my keys gripped tightly in my hand until I got to the den  Mike I whispered with doubt in my voice  No response  There was but a ember or two glinting in the fireplace and his car was in the driveway so he mustve gone to bed a little over an hour ago  I didnt bother checking his room I now knew the voice wasnt his He was asleep and I didnt want to wake himIt had to have been from outside  I felt as if I was going crazy but I needed to find out what had happened   fuckin battery always dies when I need it  I shined the light into Mikes car halfexpecting to see something that I dont wanna see  The muffled voice it would only make sense  To my relief and dismay nothing was in there other than the ordinary debris  I walked around to one side house Mikes bathroom light is on this is ordinary though so I trudged back the way I came   Cmon its been like  minutes I called out one last time with hope in my voicea little louder too Hello Fuck the neighbors I wanna know whats going on  I walked around the other side of the house shining my phone left and right methodically at an almost frantic pace  I stopped  There I stood looking into the darkness of my house through the window my phone pointed at the ground  Im genuinely scared to bring the light to it I dont know why it was just like any other night  As I raised my phone to peer inside seemingly irrational fear struck me like a ton of fucking bats flying within my chest trying to get out  I slowly raised the phone from the ground up I saw nothing until until I got to eye level  There they were staring right back at me then GONE in an instant  I shined my phone around what the fuck was that Did that just happen I thought out loud  Then and there right at that very moment my phone died,So there I was driving home from a night out,39
lifecmcs,2,13,1qynx5,25,When I was  years old we moved into a new apartment It was a great deal for my parents and I could remember them being so excited to move there It was across Torrance CA in a Redondo Beach next to the ocean though we still had to go  or  miles to get to the beach and couldnt see it from the apartment It was me my younger sister  years younger my dad and my mom The apartment was also very big with a stairs important detail leading up directly from the front door The only thing that was a bit off was the fact that we were allowed to get the house for almost a  discount I was later to find out that the previous owners had left all of a sudden and only told the owners of the apartment to lease the place Nothing really happened for a few days only the anxiety of going to a new school living in a new house etcPrior to that move I had had no cable tv For some reason my parents decided to get a plasma flatscreen and I became instantly hooked I was watching Spongebob Squarepants Jimmy Neutron etc I was a TV addict Plus the fact that I had almost no friends at school at the time contributed to me watching TV more Then one day I met Jacob Jacob told me that he loved Star Wars and as much as two fourth grader could we became best friends We would hang out all the time playacting star wars Then one day he asked me if I was Christian It was out of the blue I told him that I went to church but I wasnt too convinced Then he told me his dad had told him that God would die Then he gave a prayer to Lucifer who I didnt know Then that was when the wierd shit hit the fanMy mother miscarried my younger sibling Even now the though that I would have a younger brothersister is still haunting to me Then she would have bouts of nightmares where she would scream in the middle of the night scaring me and my little sister Then my dad started having nightmares as well He told me that he heard a horse galloping outside the hooves of the horse hitting the pavement The thing is the last times that had happened his father and grandmother had died This happened three times in a row Turns out one of our aunts in Korea had just passed awayMeanwhile nothing was really happening to me Then one Friday night I was at home watching TV There was Church Service that day but I was at home watching TV Now the thing is the living room is right next to the front door So if you enter the house you immediately see a staircase and to your right you would see the living room i was in the living room watching TV facing the side of the staircase next to the door I saw my basketball roll down and bounce down the stairs I ran to get it looked up and saw my sister standing at the head of the stairs I yelled at her for playing with my ball then threw it back at her Then I went back to the couch and watched Drake and Josh However because my mind was so addled with the hilariousness of Nickleodeon Comedy I failed to realize that my sister was with my parents at church and there was someone else upstairs When I realized this I ran out of the apartment as fast as my legs could carry me But then I locked myself out and got sick cause it was cold and was grounded for a week But still to this day I dont know who the fuck or what the fuck that girl was,Happened to Me,38
BumpinRapTapes,10,8,1r0hla,25,So I got a call from a telemarketer nothing weird about that really  But before I hung up the automated voice started spitting out stuff like my address age stuff like that  And then my social security number  Then a list of my room mates  And then I was concerned  I waited until the machine stopped expecting some numbers to press for more info or whatever so I could find out whats up and get myself off their call list  All the lady robot said though was The Intermed company thanks youReasonably concerned I started doing some research after ignoring a bunch of message board sites  I finally found what I think was the Intermed site in like the fifth page of results  This is all it saidIntermed is at the forefront of the organ trade market and thought processing innovations  All our services are backed with industry leading research and proven by numerous customer testimonials  Many of our customers are satisfied to the point of frequent return and we pride ourselves in maintaining our client pool  Products and services offered by our company are backed with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime maintenance all available with a phone call  Hereditary conditions of the mind and body are often the only thing holding you back from reaching your full potential  Our team of researchers and technicians are here to offer you a remedy to any and all imperfections flowing through your bloodline at a price you wont need to think twice about  Never again will the flaws of your fathers keep you from the life you deserve  Even the best and brightest are far from perfect and we strive everyday to make you the perfect human beingNothing else  White page black text  Thats it  I decided to backtrack to the message boards to see what I could find  This led me to some random sites and eventually I found a few message threads of people sharing stories similar to mine  A weird robot caller with way too much information  One guy got the call in the wee hours of the morning and totally laid a boner kill on a sweaty night with his lady  They all seemed to be on the same hunt I was except for one username that I saw pop up on a few of the sites he called himself ASimpleCipher  All this dude did was sing Intermeds praises how he and his friends had used their products and services to tremendous avail and would recommend to anyone  All very cheesy and all seemingly marketing plants  Since that was my best lead I decided to make an account on one of the thread sites and try and get in contact with himI sent him a rather aggressive message which mayve been a mistake looking back  But regardless and unsurprisingly I got no response  I decided if worse came to worse Id just deal with it when it came up  I put the whole thing in the back of my mind  For a few monthsThen ASimpleCipher responded  Heres a copy and paste of our correspondenceMe  Hey man its really obvious you work for intermed youre not fooling anyone  I want to know who you are what intermed is and how you got so much of my information  And I want MY private information deleted from your database and I want off your call list  Immediately  I will not hesitate to get a lawyer involved if this goes any furtherASimpleCipher   I appreciate your interest in my company Ben  As always customer care is a top goal at Intermed  My representatives tell me that based on market research you would be a prime candidate for our products and services  As a courtesy we like to know as much as we can about potential customers so as to provide the best quality care possible  Like you I once felt a terrible weight in my life one that rendered me incapable of reaching my full potential as a human being  When doctors could not help me mend the flaws given to me by generations past I took matters into my own hands  As it came to pass that effort is what gave way to this current business venture  You may hesitate at terminology like Thought Processing and Organ Trade but let me assure you the danger begins and ends at the television screen  So if I may Id like to draw some common ground between yourself and I  We do share many similarities  As a young man I was plagued with severe asthma like yourself from my mothers side of the family leaving me unable to compete physically with my peers  This lead me to more intellectual endeavors as I began to mature into an adult  Cruel as fate is however I soon discovered Id inherited a more severe form of my grandfathers autism  His genes riddled me with social anxiety and I was thus outcast from much of any community I was ever a member of  In spite of my flawed genetics I was only more driven to clear the blemishes of my being  Nothing I vowed would hinder my quest for perfection of the perfect human being  Given to me from my lineage however was the savvy and cunning of generations of businessmen  Years centuries it seems passed while I honed my craft and built my empire  Once one is outcast from society one develops a strong callous to sympathy  Under a mutual agreement of confidentiality between you and I I will admit to using almost every associate of mine as merely a means to my own end  Well that end is Intermed  Intermed is my true brainchild as it were  I will also admit to misleading you a bit giving the facade of a full staff under my employ  Let me assure you I am fully capable of operating this venture on my own  Let me also assure you your personal information is safe and sound as I said I only aim to ensure the best service possible  Never miss a detail is a creed I operate underEnough business however  Even a jaded outcast such as me has need for camaraderie  During my time working in the shipping industry I found myself in Northern California in the early s  My business associate at the time was a rather unstable man  Every bit of his free time it seemed he would study the art of coded language ciphers cryptograms whatever one may call them  Strangely he got me very interested in the art and it has since become a favorite hobby of mine  Of course his were much more complex than anything I cared to attempt he was also versed in astrology and loved to incorporate knowledge of the stars into his little puzzles This earned him quite the sinister reputation after we parted ways  On the other hand I preferred to leave little clues here and there woven into my business dealings  Now imagine what fun it would be if someone figured out my little puzzles  All that work of building a persona of mystery  Unravelled by a thread Id left loose for some cunning soul to pull  Really I thought someone wouldve found it by now  Even after everyone Ive tried to sell Intermeds services and products to it is you cunning lad who has finally made contact  Very clever indeed  Of course you saw my companies website  I admit it is a bit sparse a work in progress  Reducing my mission for Intermed to a single paragraph however I did put in a bit of extra effortI have been rambling though I do apologize  Thank you for inquiring about my company I hope my response has eased any concerns you may haveIntermedI really dont know what to make of this guy  It really cant be some prank the guy knew I had asthma as a kid  How  I have to say that Ive never experienced such an air of creepiness from pure text  Something about the way he composed his message was off  I dont know  I cant make a lot of sense out of any of this  I stopped my investigation there being as I have seen too many horror movies and dont like the idea of rabbit holes  Its been a few months since and I havent heard anything from Intermed or ASimpleCipher  I check the thread site every now and then  I did go back and check out the Intermed website again  Im really not one for puzzles I cant make anything out of it  So Im submitting it here to see if someone is more cunning than me  I hope so  Anyway that about wraps it up sorry for the length Ive been staying in lately as my asthma has been returning so Ive kind of been alone with my thoughts,A Simple Cipher,33
zombiebunny,9,16,1qu3ux,22,Eyes are stunning They hold your personality your spirt If you look into the iriss of someones eyes you can see the flaps of color that look like the underside of a mushroom If you look at just the right angle you can see the color change as the light hits it differently If you hold the eye up and turn it around the tendons holding onto the eye when pulled will slowly rip away and create the sweet sound of ripping flesh as the eye tears from the tendon if you follow the tendon it will eventually lead to the brain But theres about something the eyes that excites me I cant help myself but to collect them Many eyes blue green and brown sometimes if I get lucky Ill find a amber one those are my favorite The last eyes I got were a marvelous bright blue The woman I got them from was just as beautiful She had blonde hair and a starfish tattoo on her shoulder Her screams they were like a symphony of nails on a chalkboard Her gorgeous eyes flicked from side to side she was terrified Soon she would be with me forever She screamed and clawed at me when I cut her face the blood dripping from the wound and pooling at the hollow of her neck They never like me taking their eyes In fact they dont like me at all I ignore them and keep my collection after all their spirits will stay with me forever Inside glass jars filled with alcohol,Eyes,38
ggtheblock,4,6,1r2ucw,25,I dont know what I saw Im not even really sure I should have seen what I did Two nights ago I was having a wonderful dream There was nothing odd or creepy to it just a dream I woke up in the middle of the night as some people tend to do but then I have wondered since if I ever really did wake up at all From my bed I watched as  figures cloaked in crimsom one considerably taller than the other walked into my room The shorter of the two turned to look at me as he shut off my alarm clock I woke up the next morning several hours after my alarm was supposed to go off Did I unplug it in my sleep Did I even set it in the first place I didnt want to consider any other options Last night however tipped the scales in the other directionLast nights dream is still fresh on my mind I was on a mission to stop a bomb going off I had a key and as I raced through the city streets I checked my watch every block to see how much time I had left I made it inside the building rounding the last corner checking my watch one last time and saw that I had just  minutes to spare but when I looked up I was no longer dreaming I was on my couch looking eye to eye with the hooded figures as they sat only inches away They were green withered The red of their cloaks matched only by the red of their irisis No glow to be found however they had perfect white teeth The smaller of the two had the larger smile clearly taking pleasure in what he was about to do Im sorry but we cant let you do that It was then that I noticed a small familiar watch in his hand and didnt really realize what he did as he removed the final  minutes from the timer I was back in the dream staring in horror at the monitors of the console I was supposed to have reached in time Millions dead cities in ruin more carnage then I have ever witnessed I broke fell to my knees and cried until the buildings security came and apprehended me I dont know what happened Im not sure if I fell into some sort of inception scenario but I pray I do not have anything important to dream about tonight,We Cant Let You do That,31

unforgivingcake,3,14,1qx58h,24,My best friends older sister is pretty InstafamousCaroline has always been fashionforward and very selfaware Ever since Ive known my best friend weve either admired or resented her sister with little middle ground Any time my friend would have sleepovers wed all listen with our ears pressed against the wall to all of Carolines multiple hourslong phone calls and listen to her flirting and giggling This was when she was in Jr High We hardly ever saw Caroline when she was in high school because shed always be off with one of her many suitors or all her friends at some underage clubNow that Instagram has become a thing Caroline has bested us all at that as well She does the weekday themes and hashtagthis and hashtagthat Caroline was big on the leggy shots in a bathtub or holding a beer up next to her giant sunglasses by a pool or snapping a quick photo of her halfeaten salad  sofullInstagram has become an epidemic Its everywhere with its shitty filters and the paragraphs of tags Caroline was no exception to this truthfully neither was I but Im not as fond of my face as she is and now she has nearly k followers the majority of them people shes never met all liking photos of her bellybutton ring and the new bikini she boughtThis past August Caroline moved to New York for an internship She never calls home so my friends family has hardly heard anything from her If they want to reach Caroline they just log onto Facebook or her Instagram and make sure shes alive Eventually shell respond to their missed calls with a short text call u lr xoThen sometime in the middle of October my friend got a call from Caroline early in the morning It was sometime around  AM she told me and Caroline sounded frightened She was telling my friend all about this guy just some guy shed met at a book signing shed gone to and how he hadnt left her alone for daysWhen my best friend called Caroline back the next afternoon she didnt answer but a few hours later insisted everything was fine through texts and that she and this guy were going out for dinner that nightRolling her eyes my friend turned her phone to me that night and showed me Carolines Instagram It was a photo of two plates and candles in between and two glasses of red wine  classybitch wino WoodyWe both assumed Woody was this creep shed been referring to My friend joked he must have had enough cash to sway Carolines decision and over the next few days there were more photos and more hashtags to comeCaroline hadnt called my friend back and not unsually she wasnt returning any of their mothers phone calls either Still her Instagram was active with pictures of two pairs of feet propped up on Carolines coffee table with cozy Woody Another the next day was a picture of a cabin with a long porch surrounded by woods Carolines car was parked next to the cabin and it was tagged cabininthewoods vacay WoodyNothing was too unusual until my friend and I were browsing at the mall and she showed me a picture of Caroline lying on a mattress Her hand was propped under her head her eyes closed and she was wearing a plain white dress that was strangely out of season for Caroline sweetdreams WoodyIts so fucking weird my best friend had said Its like shes going to marry this guy or something And how sleazy is that to just snap a picture of her and put it on her InstagramAt first Id assumed my friend was jealous We were both jealous of Caroline a lot of the time I mean shed gotten to go to NYC she was gorgeous and my best friends parents were practically paying for her to live in her apartmentThe following week there were countless calls being made to Carolines phone My friend had pointed out how odd Carolines new guy was and her mom went into fullpanic mode This time however Caroline didnt even reply in texts It was like this guy was brainwashing her Maybe hed convinced her to cut ties with her family She hadnt updated her Facebook in a while eitherA couple of days went by without any word when there was another picture This time it was of wooden beams a concrete wall and stacked boxes WoodyIs she moving in with him My friend wonderedThen another the same day This time the picture was of the same mattress as before but it was in a corner on the floor Next to the mattress was an iron spike that had been lodged into the cement and around it was latched a thick chain The chain was pulled taut out of the picture WoodyThis sort of outoftheordinary situation when reading it in this context seems like a cause for alarm At the time it was definitely alarming but didnt seem like enough to report to my friends mom People were still liking these photos That last one had at least something likes before my friend even showed meOver the next few days the pictures continued but nothing stuck out until the one of a stove with a pan that had two eggs frying in it and two mugs of coffee on the counter next to it Behind the cups there was a bottle of chloroform WoodyWe told Carolines mom and then the police There was a huge debacle and the cops telling them there was nothing they could do about it These photos didnt prove a single thing They were obscure and more than likely a ploy for attention Besides the office said  people liked itMy friends family packed up a few bags and bought plane tickets If anything Caroline would have a big surprise when she got home that eveningThat day I kept up with Carolines Instagram account The final photo before I got a call from my friend was of two pairs of feet sidebyside One pair was shackled at the ankles the other in shiny brown loafers The shackled feet were bare and pale and bruised and the toenails were painted a hot pink cozy love WoodyThe call that night was unsettling My friend was tearful and told me that Carolines apartment was unlocked when they got there The inside was trashed and there was spoiling food in the garbage with flies everywhere and dishes piled She said it was like Caroline hadnt been home in weeksTheir family went to the police in NYC and filed a missing persons report a week ago Their father got himself a hotel room and both my friend and her mom came back I havent seen either of them and the whole family has been trying to deal with this privately but all of Carolines friends on Facebook have been leaving concerned messages and everyday

yurglar,6,10,1r6zsn,23,Under the BedIm writing this because I simply cannot sleep and theres something I really need to tell someone and I find this reddit to be a good place to do so It is something that is not what youd consider in the domain of classical horror stories like zombies or ghosts It is not because it was and Im afraid still is real It is so real that it happened  years ago when I was only  on a cold morning of December As you can see not the night of st October Just the placid boring morning of th December I was in bed and I knew my parents were already out they liked going on morning jogs together It was a Sunday and my head was throbbing I have frequent migraines and that th December migraine was particularly bad So there I was feeling shitty and thinking about lunch when I moved and my bed creaked The house was old like proper old and we had just moved in in this regard that part of my life did sound like the beginning of a cliché horror story I thought it was just temporary anyway once dad left his job we would leave to CaliforniaWhen I was a kid I had this habit of putting a pillow over my face when I had a migraine normally one of those useless small pillows always hanging around They were always cold and the cold felt good on my forehead and cheeks It might sound a bit stupid to you but to me it felt good for a few seconds On th December I did this and suddenly I could not remove the pillowI tried to remove it with all my strength and whoever whatever was pushing down gave in It was more or less the strength of a skinny teenager I started panicking scared my legs twisting and my heartbeat shooting through the roof I didnt even wonder what was happening I managed to catch a breath and then it happened all of a sudden I heard the light switch of my room go out and the blinds closing violently and the pressure on the pillow suddenly increased Twice then tenfold It was no longer the strength of a human being but something else I felt my mind slowdown from the lack of oxygen and I stopped fighting I felt a strange calm wash over me Whatever was killing me was impossible to fight it was like there was a ton of stone over that pillow I saw a light my vision going white and then tunneling and I heard whispers I was dying I felt scared then I put my hands over the pillow but there was nothing there and I only felt the hairs of my arms standing up My hands were not smashed as I expected My young brain could not make sense of it but I remember being scared really scared Thats when I heard a barkMy dog Thor had heard me twist and struggle in bed and had come to my lucky rescue The pressure immediately disappeared the blinds opened and the light turned on and thats when I felt it sliding over my right arm like a hand caressing it but a dead hand callous and cold hand and I felt it whatever it was turning and hiding under the bed like a snake hiding under a rock Thor kept barking madly teeth showing and ears back He was a German shepherd huge for the standards Then he neared my bed looked under my bed growling and then stopped He sniffed once then twice looked again under the bed and then climbed on top of the bed and licked my face where I laid regaining my breath and control over my limbs which had gone a bit numb I remember hugging Thor and almost cryingI told it to my parents but they did not believe me they thought it was the migraines and started talking about a psychologist or psychiatrist and bad grades at school I remember being angry with their reaction but over time it faded It took some time for me to sleep again and Thor always slept in my room sometimes even with me but there were never any more issues I never even remembered it from time to time it was just a scary traumatic memory my brain just erased For  years I slept over that memory over whatever was under my bedWe moved out a month ago after  years to a new modern house in California where my bed doesnt even have space under it and I love it My dad sold the house to this young couple who were his friends who didnt have much money but loved the retro feeling of the house Back then I didnt even remember that scary event  years agoThats when as I was laying on my new bed yesterday I remembered along with all my morning nightmare details  years ago my dad complaining the other day at dinner table how John and Mary the young couple havent phoned or said anything about the house since they started living thereI went to get Thor in my bedroom I cant stop thinking about it and I hope they are alright,Under the Bed,33
SwordOfCielmor,1,6,1qv4w6,22,As a kid I wasnt allowed any video games My parents were firmly of the theyll rot your brain and make you a serial killer camp and nothing could convince them otherwise We had a computer though and I was allowed more or less unlimited internet use I quickly became hooked on browser games you know the kind amateur games made in Flash or Java Id scour various sites for them quickly building a large collection of favoritesI cant remember the name of the site I found Sword of Cielmor on The main page had a light purple background and there were two columns with descriptions and thumbnails of the most popular games Basically it was every Flash game site ever Most of the games were pretty generic there were Tetris and Snake clones and a few platformers and rhythm games My favorite section of the site though was its collection of pseudoRPGs Most were fairly simple and extremely short each game was one chapter and despite promises of updates I never saw any series go higher than four of these chaptersId played through all the games in that section and was about to move onto a new site when I checked on a whim to see if any new games had been added I didnt really expect to find anything updates were rare but it was my lucky day three new games had been added One was a puzzle game similar to Minesweeper one was a trivia game with only twenty or so questions and the last was Sword of CielmorIt was a fairly typical turnbased RPG set in a fantasy world You could choose from several characters I cant remember all of them but I do recall a knight a mage and a healer I picked the knight like I always did and began my adventure to obtain the mythical Sword of Cielmor and rescue the princess who had been kidnapped by an evil overlord who had previously usurped the throneMy adventure started uneventfully I traveled through a cave and then a labyrinthlike forest killing various monsters before night fell That was an interesting mechanic the game had after a certain amount of time passed day would turn to night and your character would pull out a tent and go to sleep The screen would go black and white text would give a recap of what youd done that day It was a neat feature but a little annoying because the days werent all that long and I had no problem remembering what Id doneThe following day I emerged from the forest and began traveling across a field that was said to lead to my next location a town After killing a few more monsters a soldier employed by the evil overlord appeared It wasnt an especially difficult battle The soldier was defeated his sprite vanished and I continued to go on my way until night fellThis time instead of the typical You made it through the forestdefeated ten monsters text the game began to tell me about the soldier Id killed Apparently he had two children and a wife He hadnt wanted to become a soldier but there werent many opportunities in the small village hed come from He was scared every day he was sent out to patrol and he had no clue that the king was evil In his last moments before Id skewered him with my sword hed thought about how it had all been pointless that his children would grow up without a father that there would be no money to pay for food or rentAnd then the text shifted to the wife and children and how they would eventually be left on the streets The mother would die first of an unexplained sickness It would come quickly for her but the starvation of the children would be long slow drawn out their last moments would be spent wondering whyThere was a quick flicker and I saw the sprite of the soldier a few pixels of red on his chest representing blood alongside a female sprite and two smaller ones flash across the screen before fading into nothingnessAnd then suddenly it was day again and I was back on the fieldI remember being disturbed but not disturbed enough to stop playing Honestly but I was a little impressed These games had never been known for their stirring stories or sense of realism and the fact that the games creator had gone the extra mile to make it a little more well for lack of a better word meaningful made me want to keep playing even if I did think perhaps hed laid it on a bit thickThe game continued I reached the town stocked up on magical potions and equipment and headed west toward the castle where the princess and the mythical Sword of Cielmor was being held On my way I came across two more soldiers and defeated both of them When night fell once more I was a bit apprehensive but morbidly curious at what the game would have to tell me about their livesThis time the game went into even more detail its been years but I still remember it vividly It told me how one of the soldiers had cried when he realized he was dying that he realized hed accomplished nothing to be proud of in his life that he wouldnt be remembered at all I remember reading that his father never forgave himself for being the one to push him to become a soldier that for every day of the rest of his life he walked across the field his son had died on wondering if there was an afterlife wishing it had been him insteadOnce more the image of the fallen soldiers flickered across the screen but this time the graphics were slightly better not at all realistic but less blocky and amateurish than the previous spritesBy this point I didnt want to keep playing but well I wasnt about to stop I needed to know what would happen I couldnt look away Several more days passed as my journey continued and the stories of the soldiers of the rogue bandits of the mercenaries I killed grew longer and longer I read a description of a daughter growing up without her father and how one day she saw a man in a crowd that looked so much like him that for a momentShed gone home and simply cried wishing she could turn back time wishing she had known in advance wishing she could have changed thingsThe graphics were getting better and better but only during these sequences only when I was learning about the people Id killed and their loved ones I wasnt only seeing their corpses now I was seeing quick glimpses of their lives before they died I saw the soldier with his father the father beaming with pride at his newly adult child I saw the children who would later go hungry running through the back alleyways of a town playing tag I saw the daughter who would later long for her father taking him for granted too busy thinking of her own futureThere were witches whod spent their final moments in a numb state of disbelief that this was it that it was over There were warriors who prayed for the first time since they were young And there were families left behind or in some cases no one no one who would ever remember theyd even existedTheir faces which had originally been nothing but flesh colored pixels were becoming more and more detailed Rudimentary facial features appeared and as the graphics improved they became more and more lifelike Each person had their own traits quirks one mage had a slightly lopsided grin a soldier had a mole just below his left eye that vanished when he smiled And before they vanished into the darkness it was always the same their eyes would widen slightly and theyd realize what was about to happen Then the screen would cut to their corpses each time more real than the last and a new day would beginI found the Sword of Cielmor I rescued the princess I completed the journey bit victory music played as the sprite of a princess kissed my heros cheek and thanked him for his bravery The music swelled to its peak the screen faded to black and the game ended or at least I thought it did As I moved the mouse over the back button the game faded back in to the hero sitting in a chair in an empty room completely alone The princess was nowhere to be seen It was just the hero the Sword of Cielmor at his feet silent unmoving The music stopped and after nearly a minute passed I was certain that the game had frozenBut no it was fading to the people Id killed and their families one last time only this time it looked so real that I could have sworn I was looking at photographs of dismembered men and women There was an image of a man bent over another staring at his mutilated body both faces blank and uncomprehending The two children who would later starve to death sat side by side on the street their bodies emaciated the younger one confused while the older one tried her hardest to protect her little brother clearly frightened herself It all looked so real to this day Im not sure if I was looking at actual photographs I dont want to believe they wereI closed the browser window and left the room I went outside I tried to forget what Id seen Over the next few days I managed to half convince myself that it had been a dream or a hallucination until finally I couldnt take it anymore and went back to the site Nothing had changed It was the same website with the same light purple background and the same two columns of games But now there were only two new games instead of three the Minesweeper clone and the trivia game remained but Sword of Cielmor was goneOver the years Ive tried to find it again but no one has ever heard of it Maybe I did hallucinate it But either way I cant stop thinking about the people of the game and of the photographs I keep trying to tell myself that it was someone with a sick sense of humors idea of playing a joke I keep trying to tell myself the the photographs were fake or staged I didnt do anything wrong I didnt kill anyone All I did was play a simple poorly made browser gameAnd yet I still feel guilty,Sword of Cielmor,28
Chenigin,7,9,1r6b7r,21,When I was ten my parents divorced Soon after I moved into an old house in Orange County CA with my mother and stepfather This house had a nice floor plan but needed major work With all the remodeling being done to the house it was not uncommon for my step father to walk around at night to check up on and see how the house was holding up One night I was laying in bed when I heard heavy footsteps outside my bedroom window My room was located at the side of the house Me being young and naïve I automatically thought it was my step dad I heard the footsteps walk into the garage and enter the house via the garage door I knew this was the time to go to the restroom because well their was an adult and he could protect me from my fears of the dark When I heard the footsteps walk past my door I slowly opened my door and called out my step fathers name At the same time I stuck my head out my door and saw the back of a boot I never saw before turn the hallway corner This made me reconsider how safe it was to go take a leak I heard a sound in the kitchen the distinct sound of the drawers opening and a hand shuffling through its contents After what seemed like an eternity I decided to call out to my stepfather again this time slowly creeping out of my room so I can get to the corner of the hallway As soon as I started to edge forward I heard the heavy footsteps make a b line straight for the front door I started to pick up my pace so I could get a good view of who it could be When I got to where I could get a good view of the door I saw something I would never forget The door slammed shut and the lock turn to the lock position As if someone had the key and was locking it from the outside By then my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I ran to the door to see if I could see who was in our house When I opened the door I saw nothing No sight of someone running away no evidence of anyone ever being there in the first place Just  year old me standing in the dark Suddenly the fight or flight instinct kicked in again but instead its the opposite instinct fuck Im ten I am by myself in the dark someone just broke into the house I slammed the door shut and ran into my mothers room My stepfather right away called the cops and propped a chair to the front door and the garage door so even if someone had the key they could not open it The cops showed up and didnt find a single thing No footprints nothing My mother turned on me and said it was just my childish imagination making up things I started to doubt myself after the years Chucking it as what my mom said my youthful imagination I am  now I dont sleep walk nor have I ever If it was a dream I never had one like that ever since If anyone has any ideas on what I might of experienced please I am all ears I always wondered what other people would have to say about this Glad to have found Reddit thats for sure ,Still think about this all the time,30

theunlockeddoor,2,7,1r1j47,22,I work at a public library and I really need to write about this  Yeah boring LibrariansBlah I know  This is probably going to be tldr and dull  I know Im supernew to reddit but I really need to get this out of my system and Id feel weird posting about this anywhere else  So mock me for my noobness but I really need to talkAnd aside from sexy librarian sterotypes you ought to know that the people checking books out from behind the desk have to deal with all sorts of people  People checking out books about livestock and winking and grinning at you too much and women tearyeyed avoiding your gaze checking out books about abuse or divorce  Were sort of like bartenders but without the convenience of bouncers  So when I tell you that meeting this one particular guy kept me up at night you ought to know that its not because I have a simple dusty job This is a story about  person I met through my job  Its also a story told to me by that person  When I came in to work one morning my boss was wandering around the workroom looking disgusted  She kept going between the bathroom and her desk trying to work but getting nauseous every so often  Apparently when shed rolled up in the parking lot that morning shed found something on the pavementA wet set of denturesWe all laughed at how weird that was and set the things gingerly on a pad of paper towels in the backroom  No way were we putting a pair of raw dentures in the lost and found tub  We forgot about them before lunchLater that day though this guy came in  I ended up knowing him as Irmas NephewHe limped in and asked if we had any books about dentistry  I told him I didnt know where to find them off the top of my head and proceeded to do a search on the computer  As I typed things in and scanned our holdings he kept staring at me  His eyes seemed too large and white popping out against his skin  He kept chewing his lips and the sides of his cheeks  It was so fierce so intense and obsessive it looked painfulThen he said Teeth  Cmon gimme anything about teeth  How they grow  And trailed offI was rattled but I managed to scribble a number down on a scrap of paper and gesture towards the nonfiction section  He hobbled offTwenty minutes or so later it was the top of the hour and my turn to do a walkabout  Walkabouts are a thing our library system made up to make sure nobody is being harassed or molested out in the stacks  Were supposed to check all the blind spots in the building every half hourSo I was doing my walkabout when I spotted Irmas Nephew sitting on the floor between two rows of books  He glanced up at me stood and as I was moving away caught me  His hand on my wrist made me nervous but I looked back at the circ desk and saw Vikki watching us like a hawk  Somehow this made me brave  He told me he needed my help that these books werent helping  So I asked him what else I might look up for himNo he said I need to talk to you to someone to someone to anyone  My aunt she  And he trailed off eyes buggingSadly money doesnt reach superfar in the library world and I hadnt been trained on how to properly treat a mentally ill patron  As a fail safe I went with gentleness since he had a hard grip on my wristSo I asked him to talk to me looking back over my shoulder at VikkiThis is the best version I can write of the garbled story he told me  I could just say And then he told me a spooky story but that wouldnt explain why Im jumpy I apologize that this is long but Im trying to get this out in an accurate wayIve got an Aunt named Irma and she pretty much raised me  Shes like my mother but shes been gettin on gettin on you know and recently shes been forgetting things  I need these books for her  Shes got a problem  A real strange thing goin onLast summer she got all her teeth pulled  Got dentures instead  And she hated them said they always felt funny in her mouth and I TOLD HER wed go get them refit recast but shed still hate them  Shed just spit them right out onto the carpet and glare at me with her mouthskin all sunkin and puckered up  Im the only one of the family that visited her anymore  So that meant she blamed me  I was the only one around to be hateful to  FuckIn June she started doin this thing where shed say she lost her dentures  Whenever I went over to see her shed lost them and Id scold her because dentures are damn expensive  Pardon me  But shed say its no problem and grin big  Id look all over turn the house upside down and not be able to find them  Shed say Theyll turn up in notime and wave her hand at me like this  The weird thing is that they would  Id come over again and shed have them back in  Clack them at me and laugh  Everytime  Clack clack clack  And laugh  Clack clackShe uh she just kept losing them  I tried talking to her neighbor down the stairs Lucy to try and help her out  Lucy is a nice woman and said shed check on her when she got the chance  And she did good  When I hadnt been able to visit in a few days Id get a text or call from Lucy lettin me know everythings alright with Miss Irma  Only I got into a car wreck  Was laid up in the hospital doped out of my brain on pain killers for whoknowshowlong  Doctor said Id broken my thighbone  I didnt see Miss Irma for a long time  I think I got a call from Lucy at some point but its a foggy  I remember answering and Lucy just murmuring murmuring something I couldnt understand  It must have been the drugs  It must have beenSo eventually Im better and I go over there  I try knocking on Miss Irmas door  She never gave me a key but she always bustled up and let me in  I knocked and knocked and she didnt come so I got nervous you know  I went over to Lucys then to see if she had a backup key or could call the building manager  But I when I knock on her door it just kindawhooshopensI call her name but nothin  So of course I go in cuz maybe they both in trouble  But Lucy is nowhere  Her apartment is just empty  Except just as Im leaving I see something pink on the floorHere the guy paused licking his lips again  It seemed to me he was winding up his courage or working past something particularly horribleIt was teeth maam  Dentures  A top and a bottom both  The top was kinda falling off the bottom was at an angle  Like theyd just been dropped and left  I knew Lucy didnt wear dentures so this scared me a lot because Miss Irma might be wandering around lost with her dementia  Shed started forgetting my name  She could be anywhere doing anything if she was spitting her teeth out againSo I run  Run and find the janitor that sometimes cleaned up the stairwells and he looks at me like Im crazy  He says I thought your gramma moved out last month I say No sir you are mistaken  She cant have gone nowhere  And he says Well I aint seen you nor her in that time  And I argue with him but eventually he comes with me and unlocks the door   Inside Miss Irmas the tv was on but she wasnt in her chair where shed sit for hours and watch tv  I mean shed sat there so much it had left an impression her shape  But that wasnt all she left  She also left her teeth He was giggling a bit hysterically at this pointNo not the ones in Lucys place  These were different  These were more  These were MORE  All over  Pairs and pairs of false teeth were lying all over Miss Irmas apartment  They were on bookshelves and on the kitchen table  The biggest pile was around her chair  I was confused at first  There was no way she could have collected all these teeth by herself  I certainly only bought her the two pairs  She didnt have no friends to bring her sets of teeth teeth teeth teeth teeth  And they were different too  As in some were little  Like tiny white baby teeth just little gappy chips  And others were big and wide and long  And some of the sets I dont know how they could fit in a persons mouth  they were full of fangs and tusks andAnd it makes no sense  I can only come up with one idea  She was on her own for a month except for Lucy  I know Lucy didnt bring her all those teeth  The only thing I can think is that she was growing them back herself  That every time she had lost and found her dentures before shed just thrown them away and grown a new pair in her mouth  Then that set would fall out and shed grow more  And then they must have started growing strange in her mouth  And shes gone off somewhere wandering wandering I cant find her I dont  I need help for herI peeled his hand off and somehow got out of there  I went back and handed him some paper I think had a number for psychiatric help on it  Really I went back to the staff bathroom and sat against the wall for a while breathing and feeling really strange in my stomachWhen I left work I had to pass the set of

BiohazardTyrant,3,6,1r4rao,22,So to begin I was eleven years old I believeMy father had brought me to a friend of his house Or rather farmI was excited because I had befriended the son of my fathers friend for stories sake I will call him James James had a older brother who was a year and a half older so I was eleven James was twelve and his brother thirteen We had all played around the barn and fields plenty of times before This time though it was a celebration of some sort I wish I could remember why but anyway they had been in this house on this farm for about half a year Tonight was the big party as in the most vivid thing I remember about that night The cut off pigs head Literally just cut right off and sitting on a support beam about shoulder high to the adults The body was dangling from a chain for a while until they skewered it onto a metal pole and roasted it whole over a fireI really wish I could remember why they were doing that but sadly I cannot In any case me James and his brother were just running around like we always did like idiots They had all of the farm as a playground and plenty of space to play We began by walking over to the stalls where they kept the horses and cattle The sheds were HUGE and seemed to be endless to a younger kid as myself After about a half an hour of walking through corridors left and right in the dark we started hearing noises but not normal ones Like chains being hit on metal and slammed into the ground then grunts We all took off running following James brother who quickly let out out to the closest exit None of us knew what the sounds were because of the fact the farm had been out of commission for about thirty years Nothing alive should have been in there We quickly made out way back to the farm house the big one where all the adults were partying and tried to talk to them about it but of course they had all had a drink or three and ignored us laughing it off as childish imagination For some reason Some stupid god forsaken reason James said we should go back out and just play in the field where there was a little light away from the adults and we listened Once the three of us were out there it turned into a I dare you to go out in the field gameWe each took turns going farther and farther out into the night Finally we all ended up ignoring the occurrences from earlier and started playing hide and seek Bad idea Very badJames and I were hiding in the tall grass near the side end of the barn and his brother came running out faster than I have ever seen anyone run screaming bloody murder to get away as fast as we could get to the adults James and I ran to him and stopped dead in our tracks quickly seeing why he had been fleeing There we were James his brother and I all standing still like sacks of meat staring to the treeline where we saw it There were three if I remember correctly faces All white and elongated just weirdly shaped about six feet off the ground and then came the true horror the glint off the blades they were holding We all ranFaster and faster we ranI turned around two times and I regret it to this day for the fact they were even closer than I thought blades outstretched trying to mince us up and drag us back into those hellish woods We finally made it to the adults The only thing I remember after that was that damn pig head cut off and just sitting there I could see the spine and every last vein we tried telling the adults but they just laughed None of us left the main barn after that for the rest of nightAbout a week later my friend Chris came over and had the worst part to share with me He had been having these night terrors of these creatures tearing at him and chasing him through his own new homeThen he told me his family had left the farm and moved to the cityThen he told me why He was attackedThen he showed me and lifted his shirt up showing me a scar which I know he did not have before because we used to swim together all the time He never had a mark there a week before But now across his stomach he had a fully healed scar of about ten inches going from left to right like he had been gutted But the scariest fact like I said was that it had not been there one night then he woke up with that kind of scar His family moved because of that that day And never returned to that farmI have long since lost touch with him he became very paranoid after that and I just cant forget thatFigured I would share it with the community I do hope if any of you take anything away from this if you see a creature with a white face long arms and a huge blade by a treeline Run just run And try to forget about it,A tale of a Farm and three young kids,28
buffalowing,6,7,1r337b,22,I probably cant tell a great story but I can tell you what I saw last fall I was outside admiring my garden that runs along the side of the house I froze as soon as I looked towards the front of the house I saw something short maybe  feet walking on two legs It was walking in the direction of my porch or front of the house I thought it was kinda strange since I live out in the suburbs and something like this would easily be noticed by any of my neighbors The funny part is we both made eye contact it noticed that I was looking straight at it As soon as it did it ran away and I ran after it When I turned the corner there was nothing I ran around the whole house just in case it was running circles around my house Nada So yeah I saw that once No biggie since I havent seen it again or it hasnt messed with my garden Here is a small image of the scenario and what I sawhttpimgurcomQarl,Random thing in my front yard,29
DeeDee,3,13,1qx357,21,I met Danny in my senior year of college When I saw him at a crowded boring party it was like a flash went off in my head  He noticed me staring and the most beautiful smile lit his face and he came across the room In that moment was as if everyone else disappeared I think I know you we both said in unison then laughed in embarrassment He took my hand and we left the noisy party without another word  We spent the night sitting on a park bench talking huddled together against the October chill By morning we were in love and by the next evening we were lovers   The year that followed was the most wonderful time of my life The tired old city that I had lived in for almost four years became magical with Danny by my side We played in the autumn leaves and sledded down snowy hills like children We wandered the city in a daze of happiness found out of the way restaurants and odd little shops where we fed each other and bought strange and silly gifts and we became inseparable By spring semester we were living together and when Danny proposed to me on the park bench where we had fallen in love my heart leapt with joy We married the day after graduation and two days after that Danny shipped out to begin his military training I stood beside his mom and cried at his graduation from Officer Candidate School he looked so handsome and brave accepting his commission   We had it all planned he would do his four years in the military and I would find a job in a library somewhere When he got out he would look for a job in his field and we would buy a little house in the suburbs We would have a girl with her daddys eyes and a boy with his mamas smile We would get a dog and name it Rex We would join the PTO and coach soccer and make love every day  All we had to do is wait and our beautiful life together would unfold For now I would stay in our old apartment until his tour of duty in Afghanistan was up then follow him to whatever base he was to be stationed atBut it didnt work out that way They said that they sent Danny home early  I couldnt quite understand what they were saying through the buzzing and they wouldnt let me talk to him His mom and dad came to get me and they showed me a box covered in a flag and told me it was him I am not sure why they did that They were always so nice before  They stayed until I screamed at them and made them leaveI never did get the job in a library Instead I spend my time cataloging dusty books for a museum and waiting for Danny to call I think I found a way to help him I found a book that wasnt in the list It is black and made of a strange leather I have been following the directions for months now and I sometimes hear him talking to me at night His voice is strange but it is him I did not like some of the things I had to do sacrificing the strays and the pigeons I used to feed made me cry more than once and at first I wasnt sure that I could do it But tonight was the last time I came home and washed the blood off and put on Dannys favorite dress My nails are painted and I am wearing the perfume he bought me for Valentines Day It is very late but I know he is coming My love I have waited so long for you I think I hear him at the door,Danny,34

gabsgirl,11,5,1qtkjz,21,I was walking around at am one morning because I do that type of thing I was walking and listening to music on my mp player and zoned out I had just been dumped by my girl and was feeling like shit But I was finally on the street heading home I was walking and felt strange a sense of pure fucking dread entered my stomach and made me stop dead in my tracks directly under a street light The headphones were still in my ear and the music was blasting but it seemed like complete silence The street I live on is off of Main street and not a lot of traffic goes on it during the day its a little hidden I was standing by the bridge on this street If I took my headphones out I might have had a warning I felt a tap on my shoulder I turned around to see this girl who looked about my age I was  at the time and she was looking down She had light brown hair and was a little taller than me She wore a red hoodie and a pair of blue jeans so it was nothing out of the ordinary and I instantly felt a little calmer even though the dread still settled in my stomach She was dressed like me not identical but like me So I figured maybe someone had scared her or something with the way she was looking down with her hands in her pockets Can I come home with you I need to use the phone and call my mother She needs to know where I am thats what she said to me and her voice was strong and clear It was weird because she said she needed to use the phone and didnt have one of her ownYou dont have a cell phone I asked she shook her head and said it didnt hold a charge very well and she had discovered it was dead I cant really let you in my house My dad is sleeping and I kind of sleep in the living room right now I said to her This is when I freaked the fuck out she looked up at me and I couldnt even see her eyes It was just black black pupils I stood there frozen eyes locked with hers and finally I turned to run I hate to say it but I just ran I tried to run all the way home but suddenly I felt something hit me on the side of my head and it stunned me and the person was able to pull me to the ground The weight on me wasnt that heavy and the hands were grabbing at my pockets I screamed at the top of my lungs and jumped up I turned to see a shorter man staring at me with normal eyes I just stood there stunned and than I screamed GET OUT OF HERE he turned and ran and I followed him because I could still see the girl in the distance He ran by her with me screaming at her to run and still chasing the man and she jumped out of the way with a terrified screech at the top of her lungsI ran to her thinking nothing of the black eyes or the feeling of dread and helped her up she had fallen She looked at me and her eyes were normal She looked a little dazed and said I need to go It was still in a clear and somewhat angry voice I let her go Are you okay I asked I started to help brush her off but still felt fearful She looked at me and her eyes looked black again I instantly let go of her and stepped backThanks for the help I need to go now she said in that clear and scary tone I backed up a little more and felt fear over take me but the thing is she wasnt even looking at me now Well remember this is all she said She walked away and I just stood there stupidly and watched her fucking leave I walked back home that night my head reeling I dont know what happened to the man who had tackled me and I never saw that girl again I did do some research though and found that there is something called black eyed children the only thing that doesnt match up is this girls eyes went from normal to black it looked like I had just hit my head so maybe I was seeing things She did ask to come to my house but the feeling of dread was a little more calm after that dude tried to mug me I dont know what happened that nightSometimes I look outside at night and see children walking down the street which is odd for this time of night and year Sometimes they look at the house and I have to reassure myself I didnt see black eyes But I dont feel dread so thats a good thing I dont know maybe they just watch maybe Ill let them in if they knockand they are those black eyed children The girl didnt attack me or anything She just walked away ,I have no idea what this was,26
cmd,4,3,1r2xzg,20, unexplainable experiences are not completely abnormal for me Every house or apartment that Ive lived in Ive seen or heard something that would make a lot of people hide under a blanket or leave the house all together The man at my window was one story of mine that never fails to make whoever I tell shudder so I figured Id share it hereIt began when I was  or  years old We lived in an older house but not one that would instantly stand out as creepy or unusual We didnt live in the middle of nowhere but rather on a street lined with houses on both sides of the road It was a fairly quiet neighborhood the kind where the rare car that came down the street would often break up a game of football or hockey that was being played by the kids that inhabited almost every house It wasnt perfect but it was great I was a very happy child One night I was plagued by a very odd yet equally terrifying nightmare I dreamt that I was in my bed in the room that I shared with my older sister I sat up and looked out of the window that was next to my bed which sat in the one corner of my bedroom flush against the wall The window overlooked the back yard and in that yard stood a man He wore a long black coat a widebrimmed black hat that hid his face from me and a black suit On his shoulder there sat a very large black bird with red eyes I stared at him for what seemed like forever before he looked up at my window The only features of his face that I could see were his eyes which were a deep red just like the birds Just as he made eye contact with me the bird left his shoulder and flew straight at my window When the bird got to the point where it would have inevitably smashed through the window and probably eaten me I woke up I was on my side facing my sisters bed that was situated in the exact same position as mine but on the opposite side of the room I stared at her as she slept soundly terrified and unable to go back to sleep I decided that the only way I would get any rest was by looking out my window and proving to myself that the man wasnt really there so I rolled over and sat up My curtains were already pulled to the sides of the window since my bedroom was on the second floor of a house in a decent neighborhood  we didnt really worry about anyone trying to peep on my sister and me The second I looked at the window he was there Even though he was impossibly directly outside my window  close enough that he should have left fog with his breath I still couldnt see any features of the mans face except his blood red eyes I did what many children would do I laid back down and threw my blankets over my head I eventually fell back asleep despite being scared out of my mindThe man visited me several times a month for several years after that always just staring at me through my window during the darkest parts of the night When my sister moved out I started sleeping in her bed  across the room and away from the window I didnt see the man anymore One day I was cleaning my room in preparation for my friend to sleep over that night I knelt on my old bed still there for when we had guests  to clean the window I pulled the curtain aside as a teenager now I valued my privacy and saw a handprint on the glass It was bigger than my own but I didnt think anything of it I had assumed one of my friends had left it there I sprayed the cleaner and wiped it away with the paper towel but the handprint remained A little grossed out I went over it again a little harder to scrub the print away It was still there That was when I realized that despite not seeing him anymore I still received visits from the man with the red eyes The hand print was on the outside of the window,the man at my window,23
quietgrl,5,6,1qvoaz,18,I have been experiencing some strange things for a while including some kind of phantom that haunted my shower Im happy to report that I havent been awaken by the sounds of running water or a man whistling in the bathroom the past few nights Maybe I was just imagining it or dreaming it like my friends and family have been suggestingHowever I get this deep anxious feeling in the pit of my stomach that whatever is happening to me  its not really over and only escalating It feels like things are just getting started in some kind of twisted cosmic joke set at my expense Ever since my last post I had this feeling that the other shoe was about to fall and my instincts seem to be rightLast night I was leaving from my job at the local shopping center and heading for my car in the parking lot when I noticed a man standing by another vehicle two rows away Its not uncommon to see a few latenight shoppers around this time heading home with their last minute items but something about this guy was off He was kind of attractive tall with bronze skin and long dark curly hair not overly thin nor tall Honestly I wouldnt have noticed him if he was within a crowd but the thing that stood out about him was the smile that he gave me His initial response to my eye contact with him was that of a little confusion but then he smiled very brightly a lot satisfied that I had noticed him standing thereIt would have been an innocent kind of situation except his smiled seemed a lot creepy and a bit unnatural The corners of his lips seemed to stretch a little too wide than it should for a human smile his teeth were a lot too white and bright under the dull lighting of the street lamp nearby His huge brown eyes were unblinking still and lifeless and it reminded me of the eyes of a dead fish within a markets display He said nothing to me at all just stared and smiledI didnt want to be rude so I nodded his way in acknowledgment of his smile and then quickly got into my car I didnt make eye contact with him again quickly started my car sped out of the parking lot and on my way home Somehow the whole encounter caused me to feel frighten and I wondered if I was just losing my mind or becoming paranoidWhile driving and switching to the local music station my heart began to slowly return back to its normal pace I had laughed at myself for being so jittery lately and vowed to cut back on my coffee intake from now onAfter ten minutes of driving I pulled my car into the driveway of the house which I am currently staying with my sister and mutual friend I had a few bags within the trunk items that I had bought at the shopping center on my lunch break It wasnt anything special just a few new towels and a couple of boxes of cereal Besides the freaky unexplained happenings I pretty much live a boring and uneventful lifeI grabbed the two small bags from the trunk of my car slammed it shut then took a moment to glance towards the house across from the one Im staying I was hoping to get a glimpse of the handsome neighbor who I sometimes speak with his name is Charlie He wasnt on his front deck as he sometimes was and I could see no lights within the windows of his home Maybe Charlie was still at work or possibly asleep I would have to wait until some other time to chat with himAs I was having this usual and mundane thought I felt as if something was watching me from behind I have a hard time explaining this feeling well so please be patient with me but it was like I felt some kind of presence or heat behind me It was like I could feel a breath on the back of my neck or feel someone moving behind me although my rational mind was pointing out the fact that I didnt hear footsteps on pavement I turned around and gave a startled yelp as I saw the same man from the parking lot standing a few steps away from me He was staring and smiling at meI gulped in a quick and shallow breath regaining my composure and replied to him lightly Im sorry you scared me I didnt hear you walking up behind me The man didnt say anything didnt blink didnt seem to breath He just stood there staring and smiling at me I felt a lot uncomfortable and uneasy about this as the air around us seemed to be a lot too still as if we were standing within some kind of unseen bubble that locked the rest of the world outSir I said trying my best to keep my voice from wavering May I help you Is there something that you want The man didnt reply standing there like an unmoving mannequin staring and smiling Do you live here I asked trying to get some kind of human response In this neighborhood I mean Are you lost He said nothing his cold and lifeless dead eyes locked into a stare that seemed to be looking straight through me  And his smileit was stretched too far for it to be real it almost looked like some kind of creepy Halloween mask My skin crawled and I gave up on being polite I turned without another word and promptly sprinted towards the door of my house Its a good thing that my sister never feels the need to lock the doors in this part of town because I didnt have to fumble with the keys in the door as if I was within some kind of bad horror movie I simply pushed open the door and ran inside quickly slamming the door behind me Once I was on the other side of the door I did lock it dropping my bags on the first stair of the short staircase that lead to the living room aboveI dont know why but curiosity got the better of me and I decided to take a look through the side window of the door Cold dead and fishlike brown eyes stared back at me That unnatural smile stretched even more in a silent chuckle as the man pressed his face just inches away from the glass I screamed and fell backwards falling on my backside with an audible thump on the floor My sister overhead and came running What happened Theres a creepy man outside I shrieked scrambling away from the window He followed me from the parking lot Hes out there and peering into the window My sister rushed to take a look and I reached up tugging at her shirt sleeve No Dont do that Just call the police However she ignored me and looked out there anyway After a short pause she smirked Theres no one out thereI couldnt believe it as I scrambled on all fours towards the window looking out to find that the man wasnt there anymore But my voice wavered as I shook uncontrollably He was there he was right there in the window I saw him Im not crazy and Im not making it up Maybe he left she shrugged her tone unconvinced Maybe he heard us screaming inside and decided to leave before we called the cops Maybe I said unable to stop myself from staring out into the empty pathway for a whileI dont know who that man was or what he wanted Im very scared that he may return and what he may do to me I will no longer take night shifts at work if I can help it And if I have to I will ask my sister to come drive me home from work just in case the man with the creepy smile does return I will also make sure that the doors and windows of the house are locked before I sleep at night Maybe I am going crazy,The Man With The Creepy Smile,24
meltedroad,3,14,1qssb7,17,This happened well over a decade ago when I was still in junior high  My family had moved into a new neighborhood just north of the city  My parents chose that bungalow primarily because of the large lot  Before we moved into the house I recall my parents making remarks about how they wanted my brother and I to be able to have a proper backyardWe moved in on the first of September I was very excited about the move  Since I could remember my brother and I always shared a bedroom with the new house we would finally each get our own space  My parents chose early September to move so the academics of my brother and I wouldnt be affected  especially for my brother as he was just entering high school  At first it was great our backyard was large enough for me to practice my pitching for the upcoming little league season and my brother and I finally got along well  However not long after that I started feeling very uneasy about the house  I would hear noises and creaks  When I first expressed my feelings my parents assured me that there was nothing wrong with the house that it was just the house settling and that I had simply been watching too many scary movies  The kid in me though would not believe my parents and knew something was not right My parents and brothers bedroom were on one side of the hallway my room a converted den was located on the other side  I felt alone being on the other side of the house by myself and slept in my brothers room the week after telling my parents about the noises  My brother was annoyed but accepted me into his room  After that week though I moved back into my room and everything was fine again  Until one night in October when I was woken up by footsteps I could hear the old hardwood floor creaking as the footsteps got closer to my room before finally stopping  I bolted sitting up and stared at the crack under my door  I looked at that door for minutes even though I couldnt see anything under the door  I felt an intense relief when I heard the creaking start again moving away from my door  I am not sure how it mustve been because of how young I was but I managed to almost instantly fall back asleepI mentioned the incident to my brother as we started getting along better than we ever had  He said hes heard the occasional sounds but just like my parents insisted it was just the house settling  He advised me not to bring it up to our parents as my father was getting increasingly agitated with my interest in the paranormalI accepted my brothers recommendation to not tell my parents  but I started believing the house was haunted  I avoided leaving my bedroom after I already turned in I would keep a bottle of water on my nightstand in case I got thirsty but tried my best to not use the bathroom that was down the hall  One particular night on early December I woke up in the middle of the night and knew there was no avoiding the bathroom if I wanted to fall back asleepI had not heard any strange noises recently so I felt brave enough to cross the hallway to the main bathroom  On my way back I saw something on the corner of my eye  Imagine seeing a shadow of your hand cast against a wall but the wall is far away not quite a distinct shadow but more of a subtle shade  We had a night light in the kitchen to make it easier to use the bathroom at night  that light was what was causing the shadow  It wasnt a clearly defined shadow of anything but I knew it was moving because after a few seconds of staring at it it was no longer there  I ran back to my room and hid under the covers until the next morningThe next day after school I headed to a church down the street  My family is Christian but we were not practicing at the time  I asked the priest there for a vail of holy water  Being that I was barely eleven years old the priest was more than suspicious  I lied and said my mother had asked for it  I dont think he believed me but I sprinkled the holy water everywhere  in the living room basement kitchen and all the bedrooms  I read verses from the Bible as I was doing this  I am not sure if what I was doing would work but to my eleven year old mind it was putting me at easeFor a time the noises stopped  Then a few days before Christmas they started again  The creaking noises originated from the other side of the hallway and continued into the living room and all over the house before finally stopping  I was still scared of the noises but managed to fall asleepThe next morning my parents asked me what I did with my present that was under the Christmas tree  I had no idea what they were talking about  They attempted to make me confessAre you telling us that you didnt take the Game Boy Color that was under the tree  They inquiredI didnt know they were getting me this even though I had asked numerous times  My little mind started connecting the dots my brother had express interest in a Game Boy for some time  It was my older brother who was creeping around the house late at night it was him this entire time  There was nothing paranormal going on  my brother took my present  When he woke up later that day I confronted him and tried to fight him but he was four years older than me and easily subdued me  He denied everything I accused him off and when my parents searched his room and found nothing they reluctantly believed him  I was grounded for the next few days until Christmas for starting the fightThe relationship with my brother deteriorated back to where they were before we moved into the house  My parents never gave me a replacement present and I blamed my brother for stealing my present  By late January I had stopped being afraid of any noises that came from the house  As soon as I heard any creaks I would think of my brother and got upset  Eventually when I heard them I just rolled over and went back to sleep  In the last week of January a flu was going around my school and I eventually caught it  I tried to shrug it off but on Thursday I was sent home at lunch and told not to come back until I was properly rested  My brother and I walked to and from school together everyday so I had to drop by my brothers highschool they called him out of his class and I let him know I was going home early and not to wait for me after classWhen I got home I realized that my brother hadnt locked the door  I took a mental note of this  anything to get my brother in trouble  I went to the kitchen threw my bag on the counter and started to pour myself a glass of milk  Looking around the kitchen I noticed it looked different  There was a dirty plate in the sink as well deli meats on the counter  My brother and I were the last to leave the house in the morning  We did not leave it like this  None of my parents cars were in the drivewaySuspecting the worst I took the cordless phone dialed  and ran out my home  I reported a burglar in the house and within a few minutes three cruisers were at my house  The officers searched the bungalow and called my parents  The police then locked down the neighborhood  searching everyone going in or out  Around  pm we were finally allowed back into the house  The police explained to us what happened  Someone had been living in our house for the last few months  They were hiding themselves in the crawlspace under the basement stairs  In the crawlspace they found several magazines packaged food and my missing Game Boy  The police speculate that the individual knew our daily activities and left the house when he thought we were gone  He must have been doing this for a while as he was brazen enough to just leave a mess while he went out  He didnt have a key so the door was left unlocked for him to return later  The police say I was very lucky to not be harmed  If the individual had returned while I was still in the house who knows what couldve happened  I remember my mother hugging me for a very long time my brother even hugged me too  The creaking of the house never returned but we never felt comfortable again in the house and moved out a year later,Why I Cant Be Left Alone Anymore,31
WithoutACompass,6,15,1qyxxt,18,Sent from    at  am November  Youve probably heard millions of versions of stories where the protagonist has the feeling of being watched In fact you may have experienced it yourself And maybe you like me brushed those stories and feelings off I mean get real This is a world of math science and cold hard logic If you were ever watched it was probably a pervert call the cops hell get arrested soon enough Yet the saying that In every story there is a grain of truth persists and because this is a logical world there must be some reason for this So maybe you like me got to digging And by the time you get to that infinitesimal spec youll wish you had listened to the other saying You know that oneIgnorance is bliss Oh and lest I forget the other other sayingCuriosity killed the catNow everyone has their own methods of research but mine began with asking questions to an all powerful entity google I began with myths and legends but I soon progressed to eyewitness accounts There were many fascinating reads but nothing that convinced me Still some of the stories struck a chord within me Tales of the Midnight man Bloody mary and she found her way into my home stirred something in me but I forged onward crushing those feelings of trepidation Sadly those stories were as good as it got for me Soon I lost interest and moved on with my life namely college work Engineering majors arent easy Yesterday my friend came over to my dorm room to work on a programming assignment Of course we ended up procrastinating It began with him showing me a series of youtube videos about creepypasta He insisted on lights off to maximize the impact This of course prompted a brief relapse in which I shared some of my research with him And just like before I soon got bored and so did he I decided to get started on the assignment but he was still not in the mood so he started fiddling with my phone I was finally starting to make some headway in the assignment when he suddenly punches me in the arm and says Hey youve got to see this Its hilarious Naturally I looked over and my friend started cycling through my picturesI dont get it I told him Damn it you really are pretty oblivious huh Youve got a secret admirer You know how in high school you would just happen to show up where your crush was Well look here he replied scrolling back to one of the earlier pictures and pointing to an obscure figure with his or her back turned in the background Jack that is possibly the most retarded thing that has ever come out of your mouth Oh look some random person in the background of your picture She must like you I mimicked him in falsetto as I moved to swipe my phone back Come on get your act together we need to get some work doneNo seriously Look Jack scrolled through several more pictures in my phone and in each one he pointed out the same obscure figure in the background As he progressed I noticed more and more details Black dress long black hair painted black nails several red tattoos And then it hit mejack does it look like shes getting closer in every picture or is that just meUhm yeah youre right Its not much but shes definitely getting closer And hey I think shes starting to turn around too Weird huh I guess shes just shy jack said laughing But I wasnt amused Not in the least bit A chill ran down my spine No need to jump to conclusions I told myself there is a reasonable explanation for thisI swiped the phone from jack and started going through the rest of the pictures as jack looked over my shoulder And to my horror in each picture whoever she was was getting closer and turning more and more of her body to face the camera Dude I guess she most have lost interest Sorry man jack said patting me on the shoulder What in the flying fuck are you talking about jack dont fuck with me Im not in the mood Dont fucking fuck with meJesus Relax man Are you okay What the fuck Did you know her or something Have a crush on her too Im sorry but I mean shes not in the pictures later onShes right there rightthere I scream at him jabbing my finger at her location on the picture And of course the stupid touchscreen takes that as a Oh hey lets move on to the next picture Jacks staring at the picture in confusion wondering if Im high just as I calm down Maybe calm down isnt the right phrase Its more like my brain just shut down Information overload Ive gone deathly silent Because in that next picture I finally see a part of her face  I can see nothing but a glimpse of teeth through her hair  but why the fuck does her smile almostreach her fucking ears Are you really okayman jack asks genuine concern in his voice as he waves his hand in front of my face breaking my trance Theres nothing there Nothing Look again theres nothing thereAnd he was right There was nothing there Nothing at all I felt relieved more relievedthan I hadever felt in my life so relieved that I wanted to cry Alright I think weve stayed up too late Youre tired Im tired lets get some sleep jack says as he climbs off of my loft bed and into the adjacent one recentlyvacated by my room mate who decided to live off campus Yeah youre right I say as I climb out of bed and head to my rooms private bathroom I push the door open feeling for the light switch when I see a pair of eyes staring at me Holy fucking shit I scream backpedalingand crashing intosomething or someoneJesus man What the fuck It was just jack Apparently he had comedown to take a piss too Those eyes were his reflected from the mirror inside Sorry jack I must stillbe tired and seeing things I sayas Iget to my feetand help him upYeah yeah just get on with itwill you Use the damnbathroom so I can go too and then we can sleep So I do I go about my business and he goes about his And miraculously probably because I really was tired as hell I fell asleep And awake an hour later to a bright light My phone I groggily get up and check it Huh no message no call Weird Im about to put it back and go back to sleep when I notice a glow from under the bathroom door Was jack in there I glance to my left And swallow one of those dry swallows where all you swallow is air and your throat is even drier than it was before jack was still in bed So who was inthe bathroom No theres noone in the bathroom jack probably forgot to turnoff the lights before With that thought in mind I put my head down on my pillow and close myeyes And I immediately hear the creaking of a door Im scared shitless If I had any bodily fluids left in me they would have all come out But Im guess my DNA is more similar to a cat than I thought so I take a peek and there she is standing there only thing visible id a form two eyes and that smile too wide for her face I try to scream for jack to wake up but it comes out as a sort of strangled whisper So I go to my last resort something I havent done since I was a child  I ducked underthe covers Now here I am typing away on my phone telling

JordanThirstExile,6,14,1r857m,17,  It started with the roses Ever since I was a little girl I loved them I loved the scent of them and the colors they came in I loved them so much that my mother had planted a few rose bushes outside our house so when it bloomed I could sit and stare at those beautiful roses They bloomed in shades of white and pink but my favorite rose was red like satin It reminded me of my mother and the way she always drew roses on her letters                                                                                                                                                          Fast forward to the time I was  years old I was never a popular girl by far but I wasnt unknown either I didnt have long blonde hair or blue eyes but I had talent a slim body and an obsession for roses All my friends knew how much I loved them Theyd buy me perfume in a roseshaped bottle or a dress with red roses on them for my birthday  I made the best out of what I could in high school being a short brown haired greeneyed girl      It was the day before homecoming when the boy Id secretly been in love with asked me to the dance with a white rose I swooned and he took me to the dance the next night I of course in a rose dress and him in matching colors He had brought me a white rose corsage to match my dress We danced all night and we continued to date until high school ended After our senior year we went our separate ways and stopped talking But this didnt bother me I hadnt time to waste when I was busy with my roses        In college I had been taking Art classes in my third semester when I got a call one evening informing me that my mother had pasted away in the hospital The following Tuesday we attended her funeral My father had picked out the colors We buried my loving mother in pink roses because she was a former cancer survivor and we were blessed to have her as long as we didFor the months following my mothers death I became deeply depressed The only thing that eased the pain from losing my mother were the roses When they bloomed in the spring my sprits suddenly lifted The roses were my life and I dont know what Id do without them           years go by and I ended up meeting a nice guy who joined my ecology class His name was Dylan and we immediately hit it off He gave me everything a girl couldve ever wanted and treated me like a princess I loved him more than anything in the world We talked about moving in together and buying a house after college We talked about getting married and having a daughter named Rose for my love of roses His handsome blonde hair and chiseled feature would make a beautiful baby         We went through college and eventually graduated together and got married We lived in a small townhouse in Vermont for a long time after that After trying many times to have the baby I so desperately wanted the doctor came to tell that I was infertile Dylan tried to tell me we could always adopt always have a child if I wanted but I didnt It wasnt fair If I couldnt have a child that was my own flesh blood how would she share the love of roses like my mother did with me          Again for a long time I became mute I could not eat or sleep Dylan became very distant and we hardly spoke Everything we had was gone Nothing made me happy anymore Nothing would until I had a baby rose I would look out at our garden and wait for them to bloom but even then the roses did not make me happy It was the next winter before I found out I knew something had gone wrong because all of the roses had turned over black instead of falling off and dying Dylan had come home late that night and seemed very stressed I decided that night while he slept Id go through his phone          He had  missed calls and a text from a girl named Lisa The text readYou HAVE to stay home tonight She wont stop crying unless youre here Lisa         Who wouldnt stop crying Did someone care that much about my dear Dylan to cry when hes not there I remember him saying he worked at the office with a girl named Lisa so I decided to send her a text replying Get her to stop crying I cant be that important          After that I waited for a reply for several minutes before I got a reply backOf course youre important to her love Youre her daddy And she needs you here Just take off work this one nightWORK SHE though HE was at WORK He was supposed to be at work all day And WHOS daddy was she talking about          I carefully went through his address book in his phone and found her home address I silently walked downstairs and out the door grabbing a hoe from the garden before leaving in the carI knew the black roses meant something was wrong          I returned a few hours later with his baby in our car I left her there while I waited behind the house About an hour later I see Dylan walk out the front door to leave when he suddenly stops when he sees the child in the car with the windows up He screams ALLISON          Is THAT the things name So it IS his At this point I was furious          As he went to unlock the door to retrieve the child I pulled him backwards so he fell into the garden I picked up the hoe and shouted ALL I WANTED WERE THE RED ROSESThe hoe dug into his head once and I felt all the love Id ever had for him release into the small tiny bits of pieces that were once my loving husband When I was all through I tossed his body into the cellar along with his companions          At least now the black roses are blood red once again         A beautiful thing the roses are          Little rose lives with me now and she has just enrolled in preschool She loves the roses as much as I do but her favorite ones are the dead petals So pretty she said Even after theyre dead          I always agree with her on that Sometimes she asks where daddy is and I must tell her Simple Prim Rose ask the petals,It Ended With Roses,31
schizoidvoid,10,6,1r45ql,17,Part  Manifestationshttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrxtthesilverladypartmanifestations For several years now Ive had this story inside me like lead shot in my gut Ive considered telling it hundreds of times over but the sheer magnitude of it has always stopped me With six months of therapy under my belt I figure its time I know now that I wont be free of this thing until I write it out Settle in because I cant tell this story in ten thousand characters or less Ill be lucky to get through it in twice or three times that Its hard enough to sum up everyday life and this story is anything butI had a recurring dream when I was really little I would wake up in the dream and standing beside my bed was the most beautiful lady I had ever seen Long straight hair and long flowing gown both of the purest silver like captured moonlight She would smile at me so sincerely so lovingly as she sat down beside me and began to speakThe words were comforting like a lullaby but I couldnt understand them Though she spoke quietly her voice seemed to echo through the room through the universe backwards and forwards in time begging to be understood by my adolescent brainI always tried to stay in the dream as long as I could but eventually I would drift back off to sleep in the dream and wake up to my mom gently rousing me for breakfastMy mom died when I was seven and the dreams stopped Well I prefer to say she died She was murdered I hate that word Its so cold it falls off the tongue like shards of glassMy mom was a health nut protein shakes weight lifting yoga the whole lot Above all she loved to jog We had several acres of untamed land around the house She always woke me up about an hour before dad went to work so she could go take a fortyminute run through the forest and along the creek it befell dad to make me breakfast and get me ready for schoolThey found her by the lake south of the house And hanging from the old weeping willow in the middle of the pasture And scattered across the countryside in a tenmile radius around the house  but that was mostly after the funeral All told the casket had about twothirds of a person inside when we finally buried her They never found her headWe used to be a close family  me my sister my mom and dad  Losing mom and losing her the way we did splintered us Dad lost himself in his advertising job My sister turned inward and fell into drugs and alcohol when the kids our age figured out how to get ahold of it Besides his job dads other mission was to keep his girls safe from all harm and he took that one even more seriously Leanna got it a little easier since she was four years older I was taken out of school Dad hired a tutor to homeschool me I wasnt allowed out after dark I wasnt allowed out without supervision Unless I was being taken to town for some reason I wasnt allowed to range out of eyesight or earshot of the houseI started writing obsessively Mom taught me how to keep a journal as soon as I could hold a crayon I still have my very first one the pages are filled with scribbles in different colors and some pages are nearly colored solid I guess I thought that good writing should fill as much of the page as possible I remember how unabashedly delighted mom was to see every single entry I guess writing is my way of honoring her memoryI took moms death hard but it was a long while before I really understood what it meant that mom was killed Dad told me that a very bad man had taken my mom from us that she was dead that shed never come back All things considered he handled that conversation pretty well Nothing could have softened the blow though My mommy was gone I loved her and wanted her but Id never see her again She was dead and death meant people were gone forever We werent a religious household so at that young age I was coming to grips with the fact that mom didnt exist anymore There was a hole in my world It was like that feeling when you go to grab something like a can of Coke without looking at it and you end up swiping at the air because that can wasnt where you expected it to beI healed in time For several years I was just chugging along going through the motions numb to the outside world Closing myself off was easy the outside world mainly consisted of our house and the clearing around it My dad was mostly an authoritarian figure when he was home always vigilant but never available My sister babysat me when dad was gone though she usually left me entirely to my own devices She was homeschooled too but she could drive sometimes she would simply leave me at the house and go off to do Big People stuff That Big People stuff as Ive written consisted mainly of shooting up with her friends or scoring more dopeShe had been chasing her high for ten years straight when I turned eighteen Leanna had been living with her junkie boyfriend for a couple years She was never able to hold down a job for very long so she would spread her legs for a dealer until he let her move in That was how she kept up her habit When that didnt work out shed beg dad for more money and find another dealer to fuckIt was a miserable shady life for her and she would have kept going until it killed her And it didMy dad got the call at four in the morning on a Tuesday I remember waking up blearyeyed to see him looking like death warmed over I had only seen that tortured look on his face once before and I shot straight up wide awake when I saw it that nightLeanna I saidHe nodded My heart sank into my stomach and stopped beating She was living in the city a fortyminute drive away A long miserable fortyminute drive away Neither dad nor I spoke a word He sat stoically knuckles white on the wheel crying silently I might as well have been dead myself I stared at my lap taking in nothing thinking nothing feeling nothing Where my heart had been was a gaping holeDad led me by the hand into the funeral home and sat me down in a chair where I waited motionlessly as he went to identify the body I heard his wracking sobs as he came back to get me some time later I reflexively turned towards the sound The funeral director and another man were practically holding him upright as he stumbled across the lobby They took me up and walked us to a private area with a couple of couches where we both collapsedI sat on the couch mindlessly pulling at my hair gazing at my father as he poured out his grief He had always been a reserved man but the dam had finally broken We had no family but ourselves Mom had grown up in a foster home and had no love for the people she called her fake parents My biological grandma had a stroke and passed in her sleep My grandpa followed not long after as old widowers are wont to do I never knew either of them If we had any extended family we never knew themI halfnoticed the little hank of hair tangled around my hand I hadnt felt it when I ripped it outDad cried for a long time eventually slumping sideways into his couch When his voice was gone and his sobs came without tears he stood up He seemed to be carrying the weight of a thousand suns on his shoulders At his slight nod in my direction I stood up myself and we walked together to the car He pulled out a rumpled piece of paper and his phone and dialed a number We were at a motel fifteen minutes later We went to sleep in our clothesThe next few days were a blur There were arrangements to be made and that was dads job I went to town and bought us clothes and toiletries to keep us going while we stayed at the motelThe funeral was a small affair back home We laid her to rest in the plot next to moms Dad and I were the only mourners A minister said some words we each tossed a handful of dirt on the grave and it was over It was overWe stepped through the doorway and into our home Quiet pervaded the empty space the sort of quiet only found indoors Clocks ticking a gentle hum from our air conditioner our breathing and the stecatto hitches as one or the other of us suppressed a sobWe stood alone in an empty house our bodies kept upright through some force of habit or instinct in the absence of warm blood flowing through our veins My sister had imparted some vitality into this place unbeknownst to us even after our mothers murder As our Leanna died so died the house I might have turned to see the land itself had withered without so much as a shrugDad pulled the door shut and the click of its latch impossibly loud against the quiet signaled the start of our new life or merely the end of the oldI glanced at the clock almost noon The gears in my brain began turning cast about for something to fill the time until bed and found nothing It then latched on to the only activity left and my feet carried me to the stairs with sliding steps They balked briefly as if puzzled by a reason to lift off the ground more than half an inch and then continued A minute later I fell backwards collapsing onto my purple comforter My toes brushed the carpet from time to time but that didnt matter Nothing did Apathy sang me a lullaby and the world faded awayMy staggered footsteps echoed through the tunnel meshing with the steadfast crashing of many feet behind me Searing hot agony blazed through my side I had to keep running I had to reach the end before I snapped upright eyes unfocused drenched in sweat I bent forward reflexively and threw up bile into my lap I sobbed and choked on my own vomit I coughed until my throat was raw until the vessels in my eyes popped and then collapsed sidewaysGood morning worldPart

all this started I wasnt afraid for myself  Lexi was hanging from the tower just like Kelly was two nights ago  She was wearing the same black tank top and underwear she had on when I left her back in the pit and I could tell from the mascara marks streaming down her cheeks she was cryingDavid  Help me she screamed  I got up from the bench and surveyed my surroundings  It appeared to be just us  for the moment anyway  I was also wearing the same clothes I had on in the pit the same clothes Id purposely gone to bed in  I began to run as fast as I could towards her  At first I rapidly closed the gap  I was only about twenty yards away now and could see the panic on her face  However with each step I took the gravel I was running thru seemed to get thicker and thicker  My feet started sinking into the ground deeper and deeper  Each time I stuck my foot in the gravel it became harder and harder to pull out  I began to feel drained it felt like Id been running all night  Finally about twenty feet from the tower I couldnt take another step  I collapsed to my hands and knee in complete exhaustion my right leg still stuck in the earthDavid help me  I cant move my arms  Im scared David For the first time in the short time Id known Lexi she sounded like a little girl  Her tough facade was completely gone replaced by the terrified little child in front of me now  Im stuck Lexi  I cant move I answered back  She began openly crying  Im scared David  You have to help me I was at a loss  I wanted to help I wanted to get up  but Id never been so tired in my life  I could barely keep my head up  Then in the stillness of the night the silence was broken  Off to my right I became aware of a familiar sound a sound that in that moment I couldnt quite place  A rhythmic metallic squeaking noise that I knew I should recognize  Lexis eyes met mine and without exchanging words we both knew things were about to get a lot worse  As she turned her head to her left  her expression change from fearful dread to sheer unadulterated horror  I could feel her scream reverberate all over my body  I turned to look  it was Kelly  She was sitting in the middle swing of the swing set about thirty feet away  Both her arms were wrapped around the chains that connected to either side of the seat with her hands resting in her lap  The open wound from her chin to her waist was clearly visible and fresh blood covered the front of her body  Her head rested against the chain to her right blankly starring straight ahead  There was such sadness in her eyes  The terrible image of Kelly momentarily blinded me from what was going on  Kelly was moving backwards in the swing back to something behind her  it was the little blackhaired girl  When Kelly swung to where she was the little girl gently pushed her forward again much like a mother would a really small child  carefully forward as not to push the child out of the swing  Lexi was screaming and crying like a little baby now  God no please god no she sobbed  Turning back to me Please help me David I dont want to die  Oh my god no please noThe helplessness I felt with Kelly washed all over me again  Gathering all the strength I could muster I tried again to pull my leg out of the gravel  It barely moved an inch  Looking back towards the swings again the little girl had moved next Kelly  Reaching out she grabbed the chain of the swing stopping it on the next pass  The little girl her hair covering most of her face bent down next to Kelly  She lovingly brushed Kellys hair off her face and then kissed her on the forehead   Kelly never even blinkedThen the little girl started to walk towards the tower  Lexi screamed louder No  God no  DAVID  Please help me Lexi was fighting now her arms and legs kicking against the chains the clatter almost drowning out her screams   The little blackhaired girl was almost there now an evil smile noticeable thru the long strands of hair dangling in front of her face  As if accepting her fate Lexi stopped kicking and screaming  I could only hear her faintly sobbing shaking like someone stuck outside in a freezing rainstorm without a jacket  My heart was breaking I couldnt believe this was going to happen again  Id failed miserably  and somebody else was going to suffer for my mistakes  The blackhaired girl was directly in front of Lexi now with her back to me  When Lexi made eye contact with her her eyes widened and she let out another scream as all the color drained from her face  I dont know what she saw  I dont want to know what she sawI couldnt let this happen  I had to make it stop  If this was a dream I needed to wake up  and wake up now  I started pinching the back of my hand as hard as I could  Nothing  I slapped my face again nothing  Dropping my head I couldnt bear to watch anymore  Then I saw it the outline of my pocket knife in my pants pocket  As quick as humanly possible I dug it out and opened the blade  If this didnt wake me up I didnt know what would  Looking back at the tower I could see the pale arm of the little girl extending up towards Lexi  If I was going to do this it had to be now  Taking the knife I jabbed the blade into my thigh a couple inches above my knee  When I did the blackhaired girl snapped her head back towards me  Before I closed my eyes in pain I could see the anger in her face her eyes glowing redThe pain was immense  I let out a loud cry and jerked upright in bed  Id gone to sleep with the light on so right away I could see the little pocket knife sticking up out of my leg  Holy Shit I said aloud  Reflexes took over  I instantly yanked the knife out and tossed it to the floor  When I did blood poured from the wound and down to my sheets  I had to stop the bleeding I thought to myself so I grabbed my leg and began to apply pressure with my palm  Looking around I saw some dirty shirts lying on the floor  Rolling out of bed I grabbed the nearest one and clamped it down on the cut and limped my way towards the bathroom down the hall  My brother was already standing in the doorway of his room as I passed  Dude what the hell did you do I ignored him as I continued  In the bathroom I grabbed a hand towel from the rack wet it and replaced the shirt Id been using  Moms gonna be pissed dude thats one of the good ones he said referring to the flowered covered towel I was using to soak up the blood  I gave him a what do I care look and proceeded to dig thru the cabinets looking for something to clean the wound  My mother being the typical hypochondriac nurse had plenty of choices available  I grabbed something I couldnt pronounce and poured it on my leg  That didnt help the pain one bit   Seriously David what did you do  That looks terrible  My mind was only now beginning the catch up with events I had to come up with something quick  Um I guess I fell asleep with my knife in my bed  I must have rolled over on it Ok that sounded lame even to me  Holy crap  How far did it go in he asked  I dont know half inch  Maybe more I replied  Looking at his watch Its almost seven Mom should be home any minute  Dude I think youre gonna need stitches  Stitches  I think if you asked any twelve year old kid what fear number one would be that would be it  Before this week I wouldve agreed  By the time my mother got home most of the bleeding had stopped  Unfortunately my brother was right and mom didnt even get a chance to change clothes before heading with me right back to work       Lying on the hospital gurney in a curtained off section of the hospital ER I was finally able to think about the situation  Sure I was able to get myself out of the dream but I still wasnt certain how Lexi had fared  Remembering how angry the little blackhaired girl looked my guess would be that itd worked  Hopefully I was right  Most of the time at the ER was a blur  I think I dosed off a couple times but I couldnt be sure  I only vaguely remember my moms lecture on knife safety while getting the stitches but I distinctly remember the shot to deaden the pain  and the other one for tetanus I got before leaving  That one hurt the most Mom had to help me up the carport steps and onto the living room couch  It was still late Saturday morning so she turned on cartoons Bugs Bunny was just ending and Scooby Doo was coming on  They ruined that show when they added Scrappy I thought to myself but since this was before the days of remote controls and a hundred different choices I had to suffer thru it  If Id have known Emmas phone number I could have called and asked her how things were going  I could have discreetly asked enough about Lexi to maybe figure out if she was ok  But I didnt know the number and there was no way Mom was going to let me out of the house today  I was stuck without an answer for nowMom sat in the chair across from me for about an hour  She pretended to be watching TV but I think she was just so tired she was zoning out  Finally she got up  What do you want for lunch she asked heading for the Kitchen  But before I could answer there was a light knock at the carport door   If thats Greg youre not going anywhere I heard Mom say as she made her way to the door  From where I sat in the living room I had no view of the carport entry only the section of the kitchen furthest from that door  Our house was pretty small though so I could hear everything clearly Hello maam you must be Davids mom  How are you  It was a girl  Yes I am  Im fine how are you my mother answered  Im good maam thank you  Im a friend of Davids my names Lexi  I was wondering if he was home  Relief overwhelmed me she was ok  As quick as the feeling of relief came it was gone  Oh no I thought to myself  Just the appearance of Lexi would get me grounded for the rest of the summer  Yes hes home but hes had a little accident  I dont think hes up to coming outside today  Then what she said next completely floored me  Hes inside watching TV would you like to come in and say hello  Shes letting Lexi inside the house  Lexi  On her best day she looked like the spawn of Satan I could only imagine what she looked like todayThank you Mrs Anderson Id love too then you could hear the screen door open and Lexi step into the house  Lexi you said  You must be new to the neighborhood I dont recall seeing you around before  she replied Yes maam we moved in just last weekend  Is David ok  Oh sure  Hes fine Ill let him tell you all about it Mom said as they stepped into viewI couldnt believe my eyes  The girl standing in the entryway to the living room was NOT the Lexi I knew  She was wearing a pink and white tiedyed tshirt with jean shorts that were rolled up just over the knee  The heavy mascara and black nail polish were gone and her hair was pulled back into a single pony tail behind her head  she was even wearing a gold cross necklace around her neck  But the biggest outward change to me wasnt any of those things it was her smile  There was a genuine warmth behind her eyes that wasnt there beforeHey David what happened to you she asked  My mother was behind her and couldnt see her face when she shot me a quick knowing look before feigning ignorance  Oh nothing really  Pretty stupid actually I guess I rolled over onto my pocket knife while I was sleeping last night I said  Ouch Lexi replied That must have hurt like a um really really bad  Please have a seat and make yourself at home Lexi  Anything I can get for you Mom asked  No thank you Mrs Anderson Im ok she answered heading for the chair across from me Mom had sat previously  Ok then Ill be in the kitchen if you change your mind and with that left the roomKnowing my mom could hear Lexi continued on sounding as nonchalant as she could yet with an extremely serious look on her face Funny thing when I turned the corner onto your street it looked like there was a police car in your driveway  It kinda scared me a bit  A police car my mother asked from the other room  Yes maam but it turned out it was at your neighbors house not here  Mom was instantly in the entryway Lexi swiftly changing her serious glare back to one of indifference  Theres a police car next door she asked again with a deep look of concern on her face  Yes maam its still there right now Lexi said  Im sorry youll have to excuse me  David Ill get your lunch in a second  I need to check on Ms Elliott  She still hadnt had a chance to change out of her nurse uniform from the previous night but was out the door in a matter of secondsWhen she was sure Mom was gone Lexi stood up and walked over to the edge of the couch  She just looked at me for a moment before dropping to her knees and wrapping her arms around my stomach burying her face into my chest  I laid there with my arms in the air not exactly knowing what to do with them  That was until I could feel her tears soak into my shirt  She was cryingI awkwardly put my arms around her shoulders and she stayed like that for at least a minute before she finally spoke  I thought you were dead  She paused I was so scared and crying so hard all I could see was the flash of the knife when you stabbed yourself  I couldnt tell where then I was back in my room  Rising up she quickly wiped the tears from her eyes without looking at me and then rested her hands on her lap  Then when I saw the police car I lost itI sat on the curb next to the school for I dont know fifteen minutes maybe  just looking at that tower thing  I couldnt believe it  I finally got up the nerve to come the rest of the way I had to see what was going on  When I figured out it was Kellys house well Well you know  She paused again to wipe her face  Still looking down she said Thank you nobodys ever well just thanksI was stunned  Let me get this right youre thanking me I asked  Lexi this whole thing is MY fault  If it wasnt for me none of this would be happening  She hesitated for a second then continued I know I get that  but Im not a very good person and Ive been nothing but mean to you  You didnt have to do what you did you didnt have to stop it  you werent in any danger  I cant say I would have done the same thing for you if the situation was different  Thats allBesides its not all your fault she continued  If Id of left you alone from the beginning I wouldnt be involved either  You warned me but I wouldnt listen  I shouldnt have been hell bent on messing with you so its not ALL your faultI laid there for a moment just looking at her she looked so different  Nice shirt I said trying to lighten the mood  I barely got the words out before she punched me in the shoulder  Ouch I snapped trying to act like it didnt hurt as bad as it really did  Be nice she said  I took these from Emma  I heard you telling her about your mom that day at our house  I was upstairs eavesdropping  I knew I wouldnt get passed the front door looking like I did I did this for you so dont give me shit about it  I laughed  Well you certainly pulled it off  I like the necklace  nice touch  She laughed I stole it from Emma too ironic huh  Lexi stopped smiling and got serious again  So now whatLooking at Lexi I didnt have any answers  I dont know I said lets talk about last night,Dreamescape,28

warasd,2,5,1qvhaq,16,Those words still plague my brain I wouldve never thought that something like this would happen so close to me Jack was lying on the floor in a pool of his own blood not quite dead but close to it I was the last one he saw And I was the only one who heard those words slip out of his cold bluish lipsLets go back to the start it was a Friday night me and my best buddy Jack decided to go have some fun and maybe pick up some ladies at our local bar After we had a few drinks a cute girl with light blonde hair walked into the bar me being more interested in brunettes decided to let Jack pick her up So I said to Jack check your six o clock so Jack turned around and looked at the girl then turned back to me and said how should we play this Me and Jack liked to stretch the truth a bit when it came to picking up ladies so I said to him Were business partners We coown a sports clothing company So Jack agreed and we walked over towards the girl Little did I know that was the biggest mistake of my life We started out by introducing ourselves ya know all the usual stuff Her name was Rebecca but she said people called her whisper because she could hear spirits talking We found this quite peculiar but went with it because she was a solid  It got pretty late Jack and whisper seemed to be getting to know each other quite well so he decided to take her home We were all pretty drunk so I decided to crash at Jacks place because it was much closer to the bar so the cab would cost less Good thing I did otherwise no one wouldve been there to witness what happened The cab pulled up to Jacks place and we all went inside I fell asleep on the couch while Jack and whisper retired to Jacks room I woke up about  minutes later to a ungodly scream and I brushed it off because who knows maybe the girl gets loud during the act HUGE mistake  minutes later I still hadnt fallen back asleep I then heard another scream followed by a huge crash So I rushed into Jacks room and I kid you not the bed was lifted about  fucking feet off of the ground Jack was clinging to the headboard facing the end of the bed and whisper was yelling into the air She yelled Put the fucking bed down right now dad as soon as she said that the bed crashed back down to the ground The air felt eerily quiet Then whisper shouted we have to get out of here now so we all ran at the door which then slammed shut in my face and jammed It wouldnt open I tried kicking it open but that didnt work We were trapped Jack then got flung against the wall and started grabbing at his neck as if he was being choked he started spitting up blood everywhere He then fell to the ground I ran over to him and asked him if he was okay he was on the edge of death I heard something behind me so I briefly turned around to find that whisper was gone it was just me and Jack in the room He gestured for me to come closer he them whispered those words He said I can see my mom up there shes smiling at me Tell my dad shes doing fine and that well be waiting for him Jack then diedI will never forget those words ,Were waiting,21
Kaghiti,4,10,1qtux0,18,My dreams have always been somewhat odd I dream about death distortion and decisions Maybe its because my life just isnt going the way it was meant to or something odd like that but enough of the explanation and onto my dreams Last week Tuesday I believe I had a dream in which I was at school everything was normal and nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary That WAS true until the person I hated with a burning passion walked over to me and straight out punched me in the face The world became static and blur mixed with the noise of my classmates declaring a fight by going ooooh After regaining my vision I was no longer in the classroom but somewhere else The ground was rough and scratched my skin as I got up Sand I thought No thats too hard to be sand I was a bit stupid thinking it was sand although in reality it was a cave but the texture of the stone felt sandlike I looked around but saw nothing until I looked a bit farther in front of me A red light faint but noticeable from a distance It seemed as if the dream was planned out for me and beckoning me to walk over to the light I did so with caution When I got about  or  feet within the light I saw something no someone Glowing a now bright red in the darkness was a person no wrong again it was a demon Slowly turning its head towards me it said two simple words that woke me from my slumber EAT THEM,Dreams,28
Myzrath,5,6,1r5zd8,15,I came from a universe where things twisted and changed at the mercy of my infinite will But here everything was the same Every day I awoke encased in meat trapped in the same skin Id loathed for so long I interacted with the same people I hated and wondered why I couldnt have been born across the ocean My will and infinite vision was no use here No matter how vivid my dreams were they were meaningless and intangible I spend endless nights staring at the mist and midnight skies longing to revert to my true form I dreamed of another existence that was so real so overpowering that it choked out this disappointing joke  you call reality Things are woven into the fabric of your world that you will never see or comprehend And I longed to see them againI came from a place where I never had to question sanity because there was no such thing There was only the boundless infinity of thoughts I was nothing yet I was everything I had no body and I had no pain For vast uncounted ages I soared through the bleak darkness of space savoring the isolation and the pain it brought My soul was seared by the fire at the hearts of stars and my dreams were inspired by black holes sucking entire galaxies into oblivion I wandered for eternity but suddenly it was overAnd I awoke in this prison of meat wondering why the stars were so far away I wondered why I had these new emotions like hatred and longing I was jealous of the other meat puppets for having better skins to walk around in Or for living in a nicer house or fucking a better looking slab of meat Slowly I began to forget everything And only in dreams can I remember true freedom the boundless infinity where I once roamed as a collection of particles calls to me and soon I will returnI came from a dimension where my dreams desires and fears were nonexistent I had no one to envy no one to despise I was a subatomic particle with the fury of a dying star and now Im trapped inside a walking corpse waiting to dieI am not a human being This is just a dream and soon I will awake,Arcturus,21
TheBlackApostle,2,5,1qzc5p,15,Like many people growing up in rural Alabama I was just above the poverity line but that was fine because everyone else was the same way Money was never an issue if someone couldnt afford something they worked for the owner until theyd made enough money to buy it But I suppose Im rambling about sonething that has nothing to do with the story at handLike every rural town we had our fair share of legends and when everyone knew everyones business those legends expanded every year My experience with Black Warrior River a murky creek that runs into the Alabama River was woven into our towns tapestry only a few years ago It was winter midDecember and in the prime of hunting season when I decided to take a brief vacation along Black Warriors muddy banksThe Indians who lived there told stories like youd expect the sort with maneating fish and vengeful spirits but I never paid any mind to them Winter was a nice enough time and Black Warrior was a nice enough creek so I felt reasonably safe sleeping in a tent miles from the nearest house Still like any hunter I was packing and made sure to have enough orange clothing to avoid an unfortunate accidentIt was the third morning that Rocky walked into my little campsite and I would be lying if I said I didnt welcome the company Rocky was some kind of mongrel dog an attractive sort of mutt that was the favorite dog of many a country boy and unlike most of his kind he had a collar denoting his name Yo dawg I said when I first saw him in my usual greeting to stray dogs I didnt expect an answer and didnt receive one but that suited me just fineHe was a good boy the sort to follow any human who felt like leading him around the sort who was owned by neighborhoods instead of families Lets go see what trouble we can stir up boy I said uncasing my rifle as I did every morning because Id always been told cold air could warp a scopes settings Rocky just cocked his head and barked but followed like Id spoken his languageWe hiked for what must have been three hours by the sun which meant it should have been about seven in the morning given that wed left with the sunrise I wasnt surprised to hear a couple gunshots around me most of which were the sort of caliber hunters liked to use Rocky didnt mind so I suppose I didnt either Hunters were normal for December so were bloodstains and bulletholes in trees Leaving slaughtered deer lying around wasnt and God help me but seeing what soemone did to that poor animal stirred more than anger in meIm not exactly averse to blood and gore but something about the way this deer was strung up irked me and Im not too proud to admit that I was a little scared It was a buck easily over two hundred pounds and hung from a water oak by its own innards not that much of it was in the tree Fur meat and bits of bone were scattered in a twentyyard radius from the tree which grew alone in a clearign slightly larger than the gore field I didnt like it and neither did Rocky who had raised the scruff of his neck and growled at the corpse Lets move on boySo we walked and noticed the only sound around us was our footsteps which wasnt unusual for winter but there should have been a gunshot here and there Instead we had dead silence and I distincly remember thinking those very words Bears maybe mountain lions werent unheard of but they werent exactly common so I was hesitant to believe one of them did the poor buck in Despite the cold I held my  with a steadiness I more expected from a statue and looked around fast enoguh to cover everything Rocky couldntWe found a local landmark a house carved into a cliff built by the federal government for a surveyor during the eighteen hundreds and decided to stop for a brief rest it being about noon then To this day I regret going in there maybe more than I regret anything Ive ever done before or since but my gut said everything was okay so I didnt pay Rockys nervousness any mind As I stepped inside because the house lacked doors and windows by which I mean added structures as it obviously had to have the holes for them to qualify as a house in my book I noticed a few chunks were broken off the doorway coming from the inside and I could only tell by looking at the breakageI was spooked Ill admit but I was also tired cold and hungry enough to not care In case you didnt know December in Alabama can get pretty cold especially on the assend of the mountains like Black Warrior was I didnt smell it until I was right on it but I suspect Rocky knew while we were still outside and I nearly slipped on a dark puddle halffrozen in the morning chill Like many men of the rural persuasion I recognized blood when I saw itA tangled mess of meat rested at the back of the house at the beginning of the blood trail At first I didnt know what it was but the torn bits of cloth and scattered brass casings told me it was another person one who had been attacked by something A Glock rested next to the body which I assume was male but there wasnt much to go on at the time Scared backed away and tripped on a little composition notebookIt was a cheap thing probably bought from Walmart and had a few scattered words here and there but it was mostly full of drawings Figuring there was no sense in leaving and possibly running into whatever had caught this guy I sat my ass down and flipped through and dont think my cell phone had any reception or I would have had the game warden down there faster than I could shit myselfApparently Clark the dead guy was studying Native American culture at UAB and found out about my towns legends from a friend of his whod once lived in the area I say once because I knew the man in general had been the local pastor and had died four years prior Black Warrior was apparently the site of a massacre when Jackson was president where soldiers had killed the indegenous people when they refused to relocateThe legend goes that they guarded the people of the valley from He Who Hungers a spirit that supposedly drove men to killed their families and friends before fleeing into the woods and becoming a monster that was neither man nor animal Personally I figured the guy was mistaken because it sounded like a wendigo and we were a ways away from any Inuit tribes to put it lightlyRocky had gone outside to piss or whatever it is dogs do when they  leave humans alone I heard him yelp then nothing I looked outside and realized Id been reading for the better part of an hours so I decided to forget about getting back to camp and get to my truck near the road Rocky I yelled hoping to get him to follow me if only to spare him the fate that befell the buck and Clark There was a rustling that soundign like something running to me but it stopped just beyond the scrub about thirty feet ahead of meI pointed my rifle at the bush and called for him again Whatever it was it was a bit bigger than Rocky and a bit bigger than me so I did the only sensible thing and shot it It howled like something out of a nightmare and bolted away shrieking at the top of its lungs I sprinted as fast as I could and I couldnt care less about where I went as long as it wasnt where that thing wentI ran for hell I dont kniw how long but I finally reached the highway I barely had time to jump in truck before that thing came back and ran across the road on two legs It yelled at me again something like what I imagine hell sounds like the screaming of a thousand tortured souls I drove off then and didnt stop until I was at a gas station a few miles from my house too scared to go home i case that thing followed me but I was being silly then  i knowIf youre looking for resolution dont I went to the police and reported it but they never found any evidence of Clark or the dead deer I checked with a relative of mine who works at UAB and found put Clark was indeed a real person who attended UAB and went missing a few months before I still live in the area but havent gone hunting in years Rocky is still around but hes on three legs these days Things havent changed much but every now and then I flip through Clarks notebook when Rocky stops by for a visit and readIt gets my mind off the screaming that comes from Black Warrior during the winter,Black Warrior River,20
Dusteratops,5,0,1r8rf4,19,It was a long day of work and my face was covered in oil and grease of all sorts I suppose I looked like a coal miner or a hobo as I walked down the road It was evening so the crowd wasnt too large There were groups of ladies making their way home and spouting the latest gossip There were solitary people making their way with their head down and their ears plugged in There was a peculiar man walking adjacent to me with the strangest clothes and a mullet He wore a robe with a sweater tied around his waste Then there was Rachel ahead in the distance She was my exgirlfriend who didnt know how to cope with seeing me so it always turned out extremely awkward I immediately turned around and talked to the first man I could start a conversation with who just happened to be the man in the robe HeyHeyWhats up Just walking around So you like to read He spoke in the thickest accent and I couldnt figure out exactly what is wasI was carrying a book and I do like to read I suppose so I want to be a writer I replied and then we jumped into the thickest conversation about all of our favorite books and the way the world works He was able to question all of my ideas and had a detailed answer for each and every one of my questions Its safe to say I learned a lot from him When Rachel walked by she simply waved and smiled I nodded back but I couldnt help but notice that she felt like something was funny It must have been the dirtiness of my face though this weird secret humor just continued to resonate off the face of every passerby It was unsettlingMid conversation he asked me what my name was without even breaking from the previous sentence I told him my name and reached out my hand to shake He left me hanging and slammed his palm into his chest and proudly proclaimed I am Moko Then we jumped right back into our conversation which went on for quite some time The sky became dark and we were the only people in the road I asked him where he was from and he never told me A large chunk of our conversation was about sanity and the works of the insane He seemed to know everything about them and it was unsettling the way his knowing black eyes drilled into my soul Yet I learned and thought and learned some more He pulled out a napkin and refused the pen that I offered him He wrote down my number after searching for his marker for about a minute He promised to give me a call when he got home for he did not have a cellular Then we went our separate ways Oddly though he went back the way he came There were two girls laughing when we split apart and I figured it was because of the thick accent my new friend had when he yelled his farewell He has a funny accent doesnt he I asked the two girlsThey responded by looking at each other and laughing to some secret joke then one of them said Who doesYou know that man with the mullet I was just talking to they gave each other another look but it was without humor The skin on my neck began to stand on end They walked awayI know he has a loud voice I know they heard and saw him leave I know I am not crazy I know My phone rang I answeredHey Brian its Moko I was thinking Id come visit you this Christmas See you then,An interesting conversation,19
funnyguy,2,5,1r3dcj,13,When I was younger may family moved around a lot  One of the places that we lived in was a town in New Jersey  We were only there for about  year but the events that occurred will leave a lasting mark on me for a life time  In order to protect the identity of people names will be changedDuring the summer when I was around the age of  my family moved to New Jersey  Upon moving I quickly befriended my neighbor James  James and I began hanging out a lot and soon he started introducing me to some of his friends  I soon became friends with these people and joined their little friend group of   Pretty soon school started up again and I began meeting fellow class mates  I made a few new friends but I mostly stuck with James and those peopleOne day during school I left class to go to the bathroom  Upon entering I noticed that someone had clogged the sink with paper towels and turned on the water  Luckily I got there before the water started flooding over so I turned it off cleaned up the sink and went about with my business  When I got back to class I told Henry one of the people in my friend group about what someone had did  He began to chuckle and told me I was funny  I asked what he meant and he turned to me looking confused  He asked Wait you dont know  I said I didnt know what he was talking about and he told me he would explain after schoolAt the end of the day I went to go meet Henry so that he could explain to me what he was talking about  I walked outside and saw James Henry and Tim the other member of the group waiting for me  I asked what was going on and they said they would explain  They told me that about  years after the school was built before any of us were born a boy had been killed in the bathroom that I had used earlier  They told me that he was being bullied and the bullies thought it would be funny to give the kid a swirly a swirly is where you hang a kid upside down put his head into the toilet and then flush it  Any way what the bullies did not expect to happen was the kid to drown  The bullies thought he was just being a pussy so they left him on the ground  The body was later discovered later in the day when another kid went to use the bathroom and saw that he was not breathing  The bullies got into some huge shit and were expelled and got into some trouble with the law  After that there had been strange occurrences of toilets or sicks being clogged strange noises being heard toilets flushing on their own or even for some people seeing a little boy soaking wet standing in the middle of the bathroom  The school had been putting it off as tricksters trying to scare younger kids but people honestly believed what they saw  At the end of the story I told my friends that they were bull shitting me but when they kept trying to convince me so I got frustrated and went homeThe next day in the school the guys were still on me about the whole murdered kid and how he haunts the bathroom  I didnt believe a word of it and started to get really mad at them  We got into a fight and I didnt speak with any of them for a while  About a month after our fight Henry left to go use the bathroom  He was gone for  minutes and the teacher asked me to go check up on him  I agreed and left go see what was wrong  I walked into the bathroom and saw no sign of Henry but only a small puddle of water on the ground  I figured that this was just some elaborate trick that the guys had set up to try and scare me  I started saying out loud Really funny Henry but you can come out now cause what ever youre trying to do is not working  Thats when I heard a slight whimper coming from one of the stalls  I opened it to find Henry curled up in a ball on the ground soaking wet  I knelt down and started shaking him and yelling for him to get up but all he did was lay there whimpering and slightly rocking back and forthI ran to go get a teacher and then brought her back to the bathroom  When we arrived Henry was no longer curled up in a ball but now standing up in front of one the mirrors just staring into it  The teacher ran over and asked what was wrong but he just stood there staring  She started to pull him away and he look at her and said NoI need to stayhe told me to staythat im going to join him  The teacher asked who told him to stay and then after another second of silence Henry burst into tears and said The boythe boy tolled me  For about the next week Henry did not show up in school and James Tim and I got worried so we went to visit him at home  When we got there his mother answered the door and when we asked how he was she said that all he does is stay up in his room and when ever they asked him to leave his face changed and he said he was to afraid  We went up to see him and when we got up there all he did was look up at us and then look back down at the floor  We asked how he was doing and he didnt answer  After a few minutes of silence Tim blurted out So what happened Henry  James and both gave him a nasty look and he just shrugged  Henry looked up at us and said that he saw him  We asked what he was talking about and he said he saw the boy  That they had stared at each other for about  minutes before the boy started walking towards him saying that he had to stay with him and join him  Henry started to back away but that only angered the boy as he lunged at Henry  Henry said that he was all of the sudden drowning in the toilet and he heard his name called and so he sat up and then collapsed to the floor  I then entered the stall and tried to get him and the rest we already knew  We all sat there in silence before with out a word got up and leftHenry stopped coming to school and after a few months we heard that he had moved away  We stopped talking about him because we refused to believe what he had told us  As the school year came to a close my parents informed me that we were moving again  I was upset because I would be leaving my friends but also slightly relived  I stayed in touch with James and Tim but over the years we grew apart and the whole long distance thing stopped working  The last I had spoke to them they said that they hadnt seen or spoke to Henry since that day we all went to see him  I hadnt seen Henry either but to be fare I was purposely trying to avoid him  I grew up and one day while reading the paper I saw a story about a man who had drowned in his own home  His name was Henry Goldmen  I figured that this couldnt be the Henry that I knew so long ago  But there is still apart of me that wonders that maybe Henry was telling the truth and maybe what ever tried to kill him the first time waited years before trying again but this time it succeeded  ,The little boy in the bathroom,18

thenightblogger,4,5,1qqmjy,14,The previous installments can be found herehttpalbrunoblogspotcomthenightbloggerstoriesarehtmlJuly nd At two am the home security system at  Dallas Street went mad the shrill beeps of the smoke detector the piercing wail of the burglar alarm and flat chirp of the carbon dioxide alert rising up at once in a mad chorus The noise sent Bobby Dooley tumbling out of bed his head aching and his heart trying to tear its way from his chest Not a good way for a man his age and weight to be awoken He blundered around in the dark trying to find the wall pad that would disable the noise but just as he got his bearings in the darkened room the television blared to life Blinded he misstepped and cracked his toe on the corner of his dresser The sound of his agonized cursing set the dog barking downstairsAnd that was a real problem because Bobby Dooley didnt have a dogHe grabbed the phone with one hand and a golf club with the other When he dialed  he got a message that the number was not in service The barking was getting louder Longnailed paws clicked on the stairs How was there a dog in the house Had one of the doors been left open and some stray wandered inside Had some petloving thug decided to bring Rover along while doing a home invasionThe barks dwindled to a long ugly growl A low canine shadow stretched across the floor Bobby dropped the phone and gripped the five iron with both hands The dog entered the roomThe animal was like something out of a veterinarians nightmare Longbodied but shortlegged with eyes the color of milk and teeth the color of rotten wood It had no fur just leprous exposed skin that crawled with bloated parasites When it saw Bobby its growl took on a leering quality Its tail began to wag and with each wag it sprayed rivulets of shit along the walls The ID tag on its collar was large and instead of a name it had an engraving of a cruellooking owlI cant be sure but I like to imagine Bobby thought something along the lines of No Fucking Way before he brought the golf club down hard onto the dog splitting its skull with a sound that reminded him of an overfull garbage bag splitting openOnce he was sure the animal was dead Bobby ran past it and headed for the stairs Whatever was happening around here hed feel safer dealing with it from a distance All his family pictures had been turned upside down Now he was panicked and sad this was a five bedroom house but he lived here alone The Marines had taught Bobby Dooley that respect was more important than love but his wife and children never quite understood the lessonThings were even louder on the first floor the blender was running the microwave was beeping the dishwasher door was open and water was gurgling out He grabbed his car keys and turned to go but then he saw the TV was on in the parlor The sight of it stopped Bobby in his tracks because somehow his copy of the Kim Kardashian sex tape was playing but impossibly at the same time so was the Barney the Dinosaur DVD he kept on hand for when his grandkids came to visit Old Barney was really giving it to Kim thrust after joyful purplehued thrustA growl startled Bobby The dog came bounding down the stairs brains and loose teeth spilling from its head Bobby screamed and ran slamming the door closed behind him His heart was pounding in his chest his vision was marked with white dotsBobby got into his sports car The dog came crashing through the front window of the house Just like I would weeks later Bobby gunned the engine and screeched out of his drivewayThe dog gave chase but quickly began to lag behindThe neighborhood of Tates Corners was quiet and dark Bobby hoped someone would see him and do something but everyone was probably in bed He glanced into his rearview mirror to see that he had lost his pursuerHe must have wondered if he was going crazy he had to think that the strain of the Homeowners Association the constant arguments and court orders had driven him mad Hed let dealing with Tom Palmer consume his time and money was his sanity next He decided to keep driving until he got to his exwifes house What would he say then He didnt knowThe sports car turned onto the ramp that led to the overpass that connected with the Northway The hammering in his chest started to fadeThat was when the dog in the back seat started barking Bobby Dooley swerved in panic and went right off the side of the overpassYou might dismiss the fact that a trailer towing a heavy duty construction shredder had stalled out directly below the overpass as mere coincidence You might even suggest the way the shredder turned itself on at the moment Bobby Dooleys sports car landed in it as a mechanical failure But how dear reader how would you explain the dog collar the police found mixed in with the tatters of metal and fleshTHE NIGHT BLOGGER A Season In Hell Episode Thirteen The Devils PlatformhttpalbrunoblogspotcomthenightbloggerstoriesarehtmlbyAl Bruno IIII know what youre thinking Youre thinking Foster how could you know all that What you just read was a combination of witness interviews traffic camera images police and accident reports footage stolen from Brian Dooleys own security system and in some cases complete and utter bullshitThe thing is Brian Dooleys death wasnt the only one in Tates Corners there had been all kinds of crazy deaths all accidents all gruesome and in every case a dog collar was found near the body A dog collar with an owl engraved on it There was one more coincidence tying all these deaths together all the victims had been members of the local Homeowners AssociationHow could I resist a story like thatIt didnt take much digging for me to find out that the five fatalities of Tate Corners had all come into conflict with one man Tom Palmer More research led to some even more troubling conclusions apparently Mr Palmer had been seen in the company of one Ashley Fowler she of the red hair and mens suits I only know Ms Fowler by reputation and the reputation is that shes beautiful rich and she thinks shes the DevilAround  at night I was sitting in my car about a block from the Palmer residence I was eating a kind of trail mix that had far too much candy in it to pass for healthy and waiting for Jasper Moradi to show up I know getting him involved breaks my number one rule of preternatural investigation but he asks all the damn time and truthfully I still feel guilty about punching him in the mouth Yes it was years ago and yes he had tried to kiss me but thats no excuseSo anyway I sent Jasper to Hobby Lobby to pick up some insurance for tonight but he was either taking his time or my debit card was maxed out It was around about the time I was debating wasting gas and battery power so I could listen to the radio when a knock at the window startled meTom Palmer was there dressed in sweats and smiling pleasantly He wore glasses and his hair was pulled back into an anemic looking ponytail Mr Foster he said through the window I think we should talkSheepishly I got out of my car and followed him What else could I doHis house was a generic two story job with a big picture window in the front the colors were tasteful and subdued the landscaping was meticulous It was the kind of place I was sure I would ever be able to afford As he opened the door to lead me inside I saw he had something in his right hand It was an empty dog collarDid your pooch get away I askedHe smiled thinly Please do come inThe inside of his house was as tasteful as the outside Tom Palmer had no wife or kids that meant the place was quiet That also meant no witnesses if things got out of hand He gave me a full tour of the place showing me every room and every toy he had Then he brought me into his study it had lots of books a kickass sound system and autographed pictures of celebrities hanging on every wall He threw the collar aside and sat down behind his wide oak desk He gestured for me to sit down in the comfortable looking seat in front of it We looked at each other for a moment then I started talking I guess you know Im something of a freelance reporterI know what you are he repliedMetroland has asked me to do an article on the pros and cons of Homeowners Associations I explained and yours has been in the news a lot these daysThose incidents have been blown out of proportion by a scandal hungry media he saidAre you saying you didnt fine Bobby Dooley multiple times for having a Marine Corps sticker on his carHe bristled That wasnt an ordinary sticker It took up the entire rear window and as per the HOA bylaws it constituted an advertisementI shrugged That seems kind of nitpickyWhats the point of rules if theyre not enforcedThen of course there was the incident with Amanda WardHer lawn statuary was in violation of the bylaws he threw up his hands I dont see whats so difficult to understand about thisI replied According to her she was singled out because her statuary was of a religious natureShe had a martyr complex Tom Palmer seemed to enjoy putting a particular emphasis on the word had They were still trying to find out how she got caught in the gears of the pin reset machine of the Playdium Bowling CenterYou couldnt have been happy that she and Bobby Dooley were trying to unseat you from your position as leader of the HOAI would have abided by the vote of the committee but it didnt come to that did it He smirkedI smirked back There are Or should I say were people that accused you of pushing an agendaMy only interest is in making Tates Corners a thriving progressive communityI thought the only thing Homeowners Associations were for was keeping the property values upI think the two go hand in hand and I am of the belief that glorifying postmodern Dominionist attitudes and the military industrial complex encourage attitudes and behaviors that attract the wrong elements Even a lowly homeowners association can be a platform for change He stood up and crossed the room There was a tall oak armoire against the left wall But enough chit chat lets talk about you Mr Foster Lets talk about your futureAccording to my High School guidance councilor I dont have much of oneHe opened the doors of the armoire to reveal a little altar the centerpiece of which was a bronze statue of a cruel looking owl This he began is MolechOK I got to my feet already making calculations about my chances to make a run for the door I guess that answers some suspicions of mineAnd we shall carry Molech our king he picked a dagger up off the altar cut his palms and let the blood drip scorned by Solomon bringer of the fortune and wisdom Sacred Molech Amen Amen AmenWhy I paused letting all this sink in Why are you doing all this for control of a local Homeowners AssociationIf I change the reactionary attitudes of a single neighborhood I might in turn change the world he held up his bloodied hands Molech is a means to and end for me A means for a better more progressive communityArent you worried about Hell Crimson wetness was beading up on the carpet DamnationI dont believe in all that claptrap he said Im an atheistThen how can you reconcile any of this with your beliefsMolech is just another kind of life form an alien intellect communicating and influencing humanity from afar Tom Palmer smiled hes not some devil out of a childrens storyNow I was almost feeling sorry for him How can you be sureBecause Molech told me soSuddenly I didnt feel sorry for him anymoreDo you believe in anything Mr Foster He said Are you willing to forgo the joys of the here and now on the off chance there might be an afterlifeAll I could do was shrug Im not sure what I believe these daysEver since I learned you were poking around I did some investigations of my ownOhThe vorvolaka has marked you Its only a matter of time now I can help you he gestured to the altar splattering more blood we can help youVorvolaka You cant imagine how much I hate that ridiculous and terrible word I felt a momentary twinge of temptation and let it pass Can I think about itTom Palmer sighed heavily I can tell youve already thought about it Do you know what you are Mr FosterWhat I was was out of there I went barreling down the hallway I wasnt surprised to find the scurvyridden ruin of a dog waiting for me in the foyer Old texts like the Constantinople Document called these things barghests It was blocking my way to the door so I ran into the parlor It snapped at me tearing at the back of my jacket I threw myself out the picture windowI hit the ground hard broken glass landing all around me on the meticulous lawn As I tried to raise myself up I heard Jasper Moradi shouting my nameThe barghest leapt out the gaping window He would have landed right on me if not for Jasper pulling me roughly out of the way I felt some part of my arm come loose with a pop but didnt care All I cared about was him getting me behind the line of statues before the monster could get meYes statues Lawn statues to be precise All the while I had been inside Tom Palmers house Jasper had been placing over three dozen statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary in a circle around it in a display Im sure the late Amanda Ward would have approved ofAnd now I was outside that circle and the barghest was inside it The creature paced back and forth on the front lawn but kept well away from the cheap plaster effigiesIts real Jasper said with a kind of wonder Its really realI replied I think you really dislocated my shoulderThen Tom Palmer was striding out the front door the dagger was in his hand and there was no doubt in my mind that he meant to use it Oh you have got to be kidding me Is this what you believe That God and the angels are going to come down protect youJasper started manhandling me into the street where his car was double parked but he shouldnt have botheredIt all came down to a paving stone just a single loose paving stone Tom Palmers toe caught the edge of it and he landed right on his faceAnd his knifeKarmas a bitch I said to no one in particular Thats what I believethere you have it The Police found no sign of the Devil dog just an empty leash The crazy deaths stopped with Tom Palmer and the Tates Corners Homeowners Association voted to disband shortly afterwards Did Tom Palmer find oblivion or Hell waiting for him when he died Your guess is as good as mine all I can say is that in this humble bloggers opinion he sold his soul very cheaplyHopefully if and when the vorvolaka comes I wont make the same mistakeTo Be Continued,The Devils

REALreptus,4,13,1r8gsb,11,I was about  living in CA at the time and like any other  year old kid I was best friends with the boy that lived down the street We often spent the night at each others houses but when we spent the night over at his house I would always try to get him to agree for us to sleep out in his huge treehouse we would stay up till dawn eating candy chips and playing playstation until our eyeballs hurt I always asked him if we could sleep outside because the first and only time we ever slept in his house I saw this ghost The ghost himself was a tall man wearing a black coat with a big black hat that sort of looked that that cool hat that Hugh Jackman wears in Van Helsing and he didnt have a solid or not solid form I know that sounds weird but it was like he was there but wasnt at the same time I guess the best way I could describe it would be like really thick black static in the shape of a really tall dude wearing a cloak and hat Well my best friends little sister would always talk about this guy in the hat I think the exact way that she referred to him was The guy in the hat but we were to busy doing our own thing to ever listen to her to us she was just my friends annoying little sister that wanted to follow us around and do what we were doing Well that night while we were playing video games I glanced down his hallway and at the very end of it there was the man in the hat but I had only glanced and when I did a double take he was gone so I just ignored it That sort of glance and disappear thing happened like  more times before we went to bed Now what happened next is what made me never want to spend the night in his house again We fell asleep just fine no nightmares no spooky visions before closing our eyes but around am no not exactly am I was young and scared and didnt look at the time so Im just guessing it was around am every single radio in his house turned on at the same time and at full volume and it wasnt music or even just static that played it was this really deep and low pitch rumble that came out at full blast It didnt say anything I dont even know if it was a voice or anything all I remember is that it scared the living shit out of me His mom got up and shut off all the radios and yelled at us cause she thought we did it as a joke or something and wouldnt listen to us when we said were where both sleeping when it happend My family moved away about  months or so after this and I havent heard from my friend since I dont know anything about the house or the land or if there was a murder there or whatever its just something that happened to me as a kid and something Ill never forget,I was about  when this happend at a friends house,24

schizoidvoid,5,9,1r72xt,10,The introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroductionThe vomit had soaked through the covers moistened my legs and cooled by the time I decided to move The clock read Too Early I had slept for nearly sixteen hours Whatever Once my mouth was rinsed and the bedding had been bundled up and tossed in the laundry room I padded into the main living room to watch infomercialsDad was up at six I didnt notice him until he slumped back into the couch beside me He was the first to speakMorning he said quietlyMm I agreedHow long have you been upSince fourI came in to check on you several times Looked like you were having nightmaresYeahYou were crying Tossing and turning I tried to wake you up He pulled up the sleeve of his robe to show me some scratches You uh thought I was a bad guyMy eyes misted up as I drew my knees up to my chest Words began to spill out Im sorry Dad cut me off Shh Its fine I know you didnt mean itHis voice was so gentle The authoritarian figure that had watched over me with a stern gaze was gone The fierce strength behind his eyes was broken and this man had no fire left All at once the protectve shell of numbness cracked and shattered I wanted my daddy Without a word I crawled over and laid my head on his shoulder Two weeks ago this act would have been inconceivable Two weeks ago Leanna was alive Some shred of rational thought in the back of my head noted with muted shock that the roles we had played every day were nothing more than an artificial construct an act we played out every dayDad wrapped me up in his arms and we cried together until I lost track of time altogether Inevitably the tears stopped flowing though neither of us made a move away from the other for another hour Who was left to prop the two of us up but each other We sat watching infomercials one after the other neither of us really caring for anything but the hypnotic power of the glowing screenMy stomach growled I remembered that I hadnt eaten In the same breath I realized that my head was pounding I clutched at my stomachEggs okay my dad murmuredI nodded still bent overDad lifted his arm from my shoulders and stood up In the span of that motion the weight fell on his shoulders again and he walked slowly to the kitchenI scarfed down the eggs unceremoniously and thanked my dad After that I retired to my room and spent most of the day at my writing desk staring at a blank sheet of paper I took regular breaks to stare out the window at the trees waving in the windEventually the sun sank below the treeline and I began nodding As I did my heart skipped a beat Would I wake up tomorrow tangled in the sheets fearing that unknown terror at my heelsIn the end I told myself that it was irrelevant Sleep is inevitable I still couldnt shake the feeling of impending doom that I might face that terror again As I slipped under the covers I cast about in my mind looking for anything to ease my fear A memory came of a lady in silver The dream I had when I was little Suddenly I missed that lady I couldnt recall her face but the feeling she brought with her was clear as day when I thought about it She made me feel safe protected warmTears leaked from between my closed eyelids I missed my mom I missed my sister I wished I could dream of that lady just one more time Nothing was more important I dwelt on her memory and the aching desire for that little bit of relief spread through my body until I craved her like a starving girl that smelled pizzaI fell asleep thinking of nothing else And then I woke upShe was standing at the edge of my bed and she was beautiful an angel wrought in the finest purest of silver And I didt hurt I stared at her and she was beautiful and she returned my gaze a quizzical look on her perfect face And she was beautiful Her hair and gown flowed behind her in slow motion defying gravity She opened her mouth as if to speak then closed it and paused and lowered her gaze Her eyes drifted back up to me and Can you see me Her voice was the choir of heaven the sweet whispers of a thousand mothers cooing at their newborn children It echoed through time and space it echoed within my mind and my heart lifted up higher higher until the echoes died away I found myself smiling tears of joy misting my vision blurring it into a shine of silver against the darkness of my roomI could only nodYou can understand me Her accent was stilted as though she was deaf I got the feeling that speech was mostly unnecessary for herI collapsed as the sorrows heartbreaks and betrayals of my past bled from my soul all at once A moment later I was at peace I sat up in a fluid motion turning to the silver lady before meYes I was hoping Id dream of you Im so glad youre hereThis is no dreamI laughed How could this be anything elseI do not know But I promise No dreamI considered this for a time while the lady waited motionless save for her gown and hair Some part of me knew that nothing this apparition would tell me would ever be a lie Nevertheless  Alright Ill just stay up all night then That should make it pretty obvious I grew serious Will you stay with me Can anybody else see youYou called me Not sure how Usually death calls me But no one will die here I dont understand You know death You should not see me nowMy jaw would have been hanging open except I seemed incapable of registering surprise that could overpower the warmth radiating from the ethereal lady in front of me As it was I responded Hmm a sound less consideration than contentedness Well what are you I said after a lengthy pause She responded with a pause of her own dropping her gaze and softly stroking her chin And then I felt a whisper in my mind the gentlest touch of wind as something made its way inside Her eyes lit up and I felt her happiness She could communicate without speaking I suddenly knew and this way was much faster more precise I tried to think back at her and she didnt respond A look of confusion passed across my face and then I understood that Id have to project myself back for twoway communication Telepathy wasnt nearly overpowering as the sound of her voice or maybe I didnt have anything left inside me to soothe and fix I realized that I had a thousand questions and we began to converse to an observer it would appear as though I was having half a phone conversation I can only summarize our exchangeShe didnt seem to know what or who she was She had no name She simply popped into existence one dayWhats your earliest memoryDarkskinned brutish people in caves A woman being raped while her child watched A fleeting moment blurred before her world became darkness a state she termed sleepHoly shitShe came and went and sometimes she was in many places at once Rarely she was everywhere The last time that happened she described lots of people starving or shooting at each other Patches on shirts and overcoats triangles and stars The holocaust She was everywhere thenHoly shitMy jaw was in fact hanging open now You were everywhere In the entire universeNo not the entire universe Just the earthThe oceans too All the landNo Only where there were peopleWhy do I feel so much better when youre aroundShe shrugged lines of sadness creasing her face like cracks in polished diamond The tragedy of her expression threatened to break my heart as though I was watching a snake eat a kitten Suddenly I saw myself as a child myself and my mother I knew this to be the last time I would see my mom alive The silver lady was embracing her weeping tears like liquid pearl I could see a swirling darkness surrounding the two of them there but not there The more closely I examined the miasma with this second sight the more sinister it became I began to see through it as though it was a portal to another dimension of gnashing swirling teeth and rotting flesh I felt a cold alien intelligence invade my mind and then I was a bug under a microscope My mind was aflame with pain and disgust pushing through the dull opiate warmth of the ladys protection The demonic thing was plotting yearning and I could taste its desire with my own tongue My vision began to fade to black and I was immersed in inky singleminded hatred of unfathomable depth Time lost its meaning and then I was back in my room unsure if a second had passed or a centuryThe lady nodded filling my mind with her own and I understood I had seen the hunger in the world a faceless timeless entity whose only purpose is to consume and destroy And before me stood the force of lightDawn broke through my windowThe introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroduction,The Silver Lady Part   Manifestations,19
nisyldaed,9,7,1r6mcx,11,Someone once said The greatest strengt is to know your weaknesses Luckily I found that out quite Early You might say that Ive been blessed with a keen perception so I always tended to grasp certain concepts and situations quicker than the peope around me which quickly lead me to thinking that I was somehow superior to othersLetting these thoughts and thus my hubris overtake me  that was and still is my greatest weakness but ironically the very cause of my Pride allowed me to realise this very thing so whether its a blessing or a curse might be your own perspectiveMy story begins with something that should have been a regular day at my university you know attending courses not paying attention browsing the internet on your phone etcI cant really get into detail here because my memorIes of what happened are really blurry but I remember a loud crack a bang and loud rumbling The next Thing I know is waking up in the local hospitalFrom what Ive been told the corridor I walked through that day collapsed without any reason and buried  students beneath it I was the only survivorNOw that event didnt really help with the aforementioned pride quite the contrary  I convinced myself that somehow I subconsciously saved myself from the collapsing ceiling and that my surival once again showed that I was better than the others wo diedOnce I fully realized what I just thought I couldnt help but feel disgusted by myself but this was only the beginning of my descentOf course I went back to university after a fEw days since I only had some bruises and a boken finger and thats when the prideful Thoughts became more frequently and more aggressive Word of my survival got around pretty quickly since its a small university so everyone I knew and some people I didnt know came up to me and talked like I was some kind of miracle survivor or in some cases even a hero And needless to say I absolutely loved that I also began to notice that I began to be more condescending towards other people Sure Ive always had my share of disrespectful thoughts about some persons but ever since the accident I sometimes said things aloud and I Always hit them where it hurt it was pathetic to watchAfter a few weeks things started to go bacK to normal people wouldnt talk to me that much anymore and this bothered me to no end They wernt giving me attention anymore Had they forgotten what I waS Had they forgotten that I WAS SUPERIORIt couldnt go on like this they needed to be reMinded reminded of the greatness that was mE no IS MERemember the quote from the beginning I think its bullshit Because one of the greatest strengths is actually to be a good liar And what a great liar I am  Ive been lying to you all the timeThey still havent figured out that I blew up the corridor Still dont know that I indeed survived the collapsing corridor by an accurate calculation And next time Ill be showing them my true greatness it will be a lasting reminder,Pride,18
Bodysseus,7,12,1qt0vq,12,Part httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqyfqicanturninvisiblepartI was completely surrounded  or more police and SWAT team members aiming their weapons at me waiting for me to drop the revolver I let out a long sigh knowing that whatever road this was going to go down it was finally over No one else had to get hurtI SAID DROP THE GUN OR WE WILL SHOOTTheir lights still blinding me I thought about making a run for it but they would shoot me as soon as I took a step After I shot Rose and she was nowhere to be found I started to think that maybe this was all in my head Maybe I was just going insane and something triggered me to go on a killing spree and have some kind of made up justification for it thinking that I could turn invisible and force people to kill themselvesI hear them shifting closer They probably thought that I was a psycho and I was just going to start shooting like I was suicidalThats when it occurred to meI have never thought about suicide before The act of killing was one thing but taking your own life was something that I felt was more cowardly and weak Ive also never had a reason to kill myself until now If I was insane I could end it There wouldnt be anymore people dying at my own hands There wouldnt be anymore of me left to take control of or take into captivity Everything would just go away and that idea seemed more suitable than living in a padded room and taking crazy pills for the rest of my life Also I could see Alice and John again Explain to them what was going on before they had left this world I wasnt sure if there was a heaven or a God at this point I figured if there was a God he must be super pissed off at me for something The only way to find out was to take the easy way out and just end it allBoth my hands were in the air as the police were waiting for me to drop my weapon I brought my right hand slowly down towards my head while closing my eyes Finger on the trigger I was ready to take my own lifeDONT DO IT WE CAN HELP YOUI heard one of the men yell out to me pleading me to think about what I was about to do He doesnt know what I have been through He doesnt know that I have already thought about what I was going to do and it was only for the best for everyoneA million thoughts went through my head I squeezed the trigger slowly and it felt like years were passing by The years were actually memories of my entire life Its funny because everyone always says that your whole life flashes before your eyes right before you die How would any of them know that its true if theyre already dead I see visions of my mother how sweet she looks with her long brown hair and the little smile she always had on her face I see my brother as were playing in the backyard where the pool used to be like we did when we were younger I wonder what he would think of me at this moment My father appears telling me how weak I am for letting things come to this He always wanted me to be a strong man and keep my head straight Then I see Alice All the times we were running late for a dinner reservation only to have our table taken by someone else and wed have to pick up a pizza and watch movies in our apartment instead How she would spend most of her time cleaning and scrubbing the kitchen and the bathroom because she wanted everything to be squeaky clean I remember the times when I would be cramming for an exam and she would always come sit on my lap and help me take my mind off of all the bullshit In my moments of clarity Rose appears I see her smiling that evil deceitful smile that she always wore Then it all goes black And it stays blackHey pal were closing up Time to go homeI open my eyes and I see a man standing there He was nudging my shoulder trying to get me to move Immediately I knew where I was I was at the bar sitting in the same booth that I was sitting when I had first met Rose Was I asleep the whole time I picked my head up and looked around The bar was dark and empty The stools and chairs were all flipped upside down and placed on the bar and tablesCome on man I let you sleep off the alcohol while I closed up shop now its time for you to goIt was the bartender The one who ignored me when I asked him for a drink I needed to be sure that this was all a dream and Rose wasnt playing a sick joke on me or I wasnt really deadHey man what day is todaySeriously Its Thursday Did someone drug you or somethingNo no I dont think so Was there a red headed woman sitting here at all tonightHe gave me the most confused look like I had completely lost my mindNo man It was just you You came in ordered a drink left it at the bar and came back here and passed out You sure you didnt drink anything before you came here Someone could have drugged you This is a college town that type of shit happens all the timeNo red headed woman meant that I actually had never met Rose It also meant that I dreamed the entire thing and I wasnt actually going insane None of it actually happened I never turned invisible I never killed anyone the police were never trying to find me I never killed myself There was only one thing that I needed to do to make sure that it wasnt real and that it was all just an extremely vivid dream I needed to make sure Alice was still aliveI got up and headed for the door Right before I pushed it open I turned to the bartender who was still standing there watching me For shits and giggles I snapped my fingers and looked at him His eyes got a little wide and he continued to stare in my direction I got worried thinking that if I could still turn invisible then all of it was realCan you see meHe still stared in my direction for a good  secondsYes I can still see you man Get the fuck out of my barA sigh of relief and I was out the door with a smile on my face I never thought I would see the day that I would be so happy about waking up from a dream Usually I never want to wake up but this time was different This wasnt a dream It was a fucking nightmareI walked at a quick pace from the bar towards Alices house Along the way I thought about how great everything was I appreciated things a lot more For once in my life I was more than thankful to be alive I was given something that most people dont get a second chanceI arrived at Alices house and the whole place was quiet No party no loud noises no music It felt a little awkward being there since we had just broken up and I assumed the last person she wanted to see was me I knocked on the door anyways I knew it was super late but as long as I knew she was ok I would take the lashing that she would give me The door opens and there she was As beautiful as when I had last seen herBo What are you doing here Its  in the morningI know Im really sorry This is going to sound weird but I just needed to make sure that you were ok I had a really bad feeling about tonightShe rubbed her eyes a bit and looked up at me Then she smiled and it made me feel at easeTo be honest I have been thinking about you all night Im actually really happy you showed up here Do you want to come inside and talkIt felt so good to hear her say that Not only was she still alive but she was willing to work things out to let me back in her life I didnt care what it was that she wanted me to change about myself After I had watched her die I was willing to do anything to keep her close and never lose her againWe walked into her living room and sat on the couch I chuckled to myself a little remembering the two girls that were sitting there in my dream that I dumped a beer on We sat there and looked at each other with smiles on our faces I think we both felt the same way about how we regret letting things go sour with our relationship After a few small conversations about our nights Alice gets up and heads for the kitchen to make us some hot cocoa I lean back on the couch and stare into space as I become more and more thankful with how things are turning out A quick gaze around the room and something catches my eye Instantly it stopped my heart On the mantle next to the television on the other side of the room was a napkin folded into a rose I got up from the couch walked directly to it and picked it up It was exactly like the rose that was on my dashboard in my dreamHey Alice Where did you get this rose napkin fromShe calls from the kitchen as I hear her preparing our hot chocolateOh yeah that things cool huh My sister made it for me before she passed away a few years agoAs quickly as I had gotten that nervous feeling it all went away when she told me that it was her sisters who had died I put it back down on the mantle and sat back down on the couchThats pretty neat that she was able to do thatShe walks back into the living room and sits down next to me handing me a warm coffee cup with hot chocolate in itYeah she was pretty talented at a lot of things You would have loved her Her name was Rose,I Can Turn Invisible Final

TheOthersAreComing,8,7,1qsvy3,12,   Ever since I was a child living in my familys house Ive seen them The skeletal hands reaching out of my closet somehow so visible in the darkness And the voices whispering telling me to come with them Promising the fear would stop if I just went with them At first it would all go away if I turned on the lights and I could convince myself it was somehow my imagination But they didnt like that They started laughing at me whenever I would turn on the lights to try to get them to leave Its so humiliating when they laugh at me   The voices got so much louder My parents didnt believe me until I started waking them up in the middle of the night with my screaming The Others were still there when my parents came into my room How did they not see them My parents gave me pills and told me they were for my schizophrenia I stopped taking my pills because it made the Others laugh at me Its so humiliating when they laugh at me   Im always exhausted and I was then too but the Others always tell me I dont need to sleep They tell me if I come with them itll be so much better than sleep Thats the one thing I never did for them But I always listen to them because theyre the only ones who believe me   I guess I got older I dont really notice time passing Time is meaningless Everything is meaningless except the Others Youll learn that They taught me that They taught me so much They tell me theyll teach me more when I go with them I moved out of my familys house but of course the Others moved with me to my new closet Im with them now Youll be with them soon too  See I went with them finally I waited till night and until the hands and voices came Then I opened the closet doors and stepped inside There are so many of them Its such an honor to be one of them Being there is everything they told me it would be And they never laugh at me It used to be so humiliating when they would do that Now I laugh with them We are laughing now because now that youve read this well be in your closet next,The Others,19
Dectrek,12,10,1qqf0w,11,Im bipolar No really Ive been diagnosed by a doctor and show all the symptoms that any bipolar person would show I have highs and lows which I switch into over periods of time and act accordingly to the descriptions of each During my highs thousands of ideas rush through my head most of which are projects that I will begin to work on seconds after I thought of them Some I dont finish because I will think of something new and abandon whatever I was just doing while others I finish but have no use for them I get little sleep during these periods of time and I will talk really fast crack jokes constantly and be extremely friendly to everyone I meet Then there are my lows During my lows I become Depressed Tired and a bit bitter Ill sleep for hours on end I could sleep for a week and still be tired when Im on my low I become mean and antisocial sometimes Ill even lose friends that I made during a high or destroy a project that I had made while on a high I begin to think Im worthless and have thoughts of suicideBut there is always one friend who stays with me no matter what mood Im in a friend who tells me that Im not worthless a friend who stops any suicide attempts a friend who is there for me a friend who would do anything for me no matter how extreme a friend whos name is Dan I met Dan at a selfhelp group for those with mental illnesses As soon as I meet him he was almost as nice as the people who ran the meeting but he was realistic We became good friends and I asked what mental illness he had He was a schizophrenic Occasionally he would hear a voice in his head or see something that wasnt there and trip on nothing but it wasnt really bad In fact it was a bit funny and tended to make me feel a bit better when on a low even though I felt cruel for laughing at him but he usually just smiled and carried onI felt like I owed him something for being such a good friend so I invited him up to my cottage in Wisconsin We would only go up for a weekend and when I asked Dan if he could go he said yes We drove up in high spirits My spirit probably a little higher and began to unpack As we unpacked I noticed that Dan hadnt brought any medication I asked him where his medication was and he said I guess I left it at home well thats too badDont you need the medication so you dont have an attack I askedMy condition is minor I can go one little weekend without it and be fine Dan answered I was a bit unsure but decided that he probably knew more about his condition then I did and that I should forget about it We spent the day going into town and going to bars but it eventually got dark and was time to go home This is when I sunk into a low I noticed it when I became drowsy and lethargic Dan was just going to have to put up with my depression for a little whileWhen we got home we were setting up mattress in the main room because I was having work done on in the bedrooms Dan was talking about how his son was doing in little league when he abruptly stopped He stared at the corner of the room which was emptyWhat are you looking at I suspiciously askedWhat ohnothing I just thought I saw someone in the corner He replied as he came out of his transfixed state I became a little suspicious but assumed it was an attackI was sleeping when it first happened Dans screams woke me up and I looked at his thrashing body under the sheets He was screaming Hes got me and Someone help me I woke him up and he was in frantic state He told me a man had come into his bed and tried to suffocate him He described the man as having one eye and an empty bleeding socket The mans face was pale and dirty and he had a crocked nose A fedora covered his messy black hair and he was wearing a trench coat At this time I had no patience for I was well into one of my lows and I told him to go back to bed I reminded him that it was probably just an attack but he pleaded that it was real and that he even felt the blood drip onto his face I told him there was no blood on his face and that he should go back to sleepThe second attack was worse than the first When I heard the screams I tried to ignore them because I was tired but then he started to choke himself I stopped him and asked him what he thought he was doing He came back He nervously said He tried to choking meYou were choking yourself I angrily yelled Now calm down There is no man no one tried to choke you and I need some sleepI was furious with him but mostly because I was in a low Looking back at the experience I feel bad but it was part of my condition I couldnt help myself and thats all in the past nowWhen the last attack came I was too late I woke up to find that he had choked himself to death I looked at him and began to sob Why hadnt I tried to calm him down more Why didnt I sit up with him until he felt better Why did I invite him on this stupid trip These were all questions that ran through my head as I drove to the hospitalNow you may be wondering why I told you this Was it so that I could bum you out or was it to help me get over this tragic event that recently happened to me Actually its neither The real reason I told you this story was because of what happened back at Dans hometown The body had been transferred to there and they brought me in to figure out what had happenedI told the doctor at the hospital up in Wisconsin I said Dan choked himself to death in the middle of the nightBut why would he do such a thing the doctor questioned as if this question had been bothering him for a whileBecause he has schizophrenia I told him He thought someone was choking him so he panicked Dan doesnt have schizophrenia the doctor said as he looked at Dans files Theres nothing in here about him having any mental illness of any sortI was confused at first but then everything began to click Dan was a friend who would do anything for me no matter how extreme Dan was almost as nice as the people who ran the meeting as if he did run the meeting Dan always smiled when I laughed at him for tripping on nothing as if he didnt care because they were meant to make me laugh Dan always stopped my suicide attempts was always there for me as

IntricateVenom,8,4,1r2dyl,12,Ive known that I have had this ability since I was six Actually it all started when I was sixI can see spirits I see them sometimes like normal people but they have a sort of glimmer to them In all of my encounters I have never been to speak to one but they dont need to their expressions tell me all I need to knowAs I said this all started at the age of six My mother and I moved into an old house that was built in the s There was another house next to it that was a complete mirror image of the one I lived in The history was that the houses were built by two twins One twin was a good man while the other had a sadistic side He was a murderer and he alone had killed around  people in his house which was the one I lived next to To this day around  people have been murdered in that houseAnyway one night I was in my room staring at the ceiling I have insomnia so its quite hard for me to sleep when suddenly I got this immense feeling of anger and fury However the feeling wasnt coming from my house or even from myself but the house next door I got out of bed and looked out the window and I will never forget what I sawStaring out of the window across from me was a man who had to be in his late s His face was contorted into a meanful scowl He was wearing old tattered clothes He was staring right at me right into my very soul Then almost instantly he vanished I started to cry really loud and eventually my mom came running in I told her what had happened but she didnt really believe meFast forward to  Ive been seeing spirits all the time but only when Im tuned in This is the best way I can describe it Its almost like tuning a radio to the right channel Ive found that once I tune in I can see spirits in all kinds of forms and shapes However one night when I was  I found that i can see more than spiritsWhen I was  my friend and I were big into the paranormal and we liked to go to graveyards and such to see what we can find On this day we decided to go to one of the most haunted graveyards in our state  Dice Roads Cemetary There have been lots of people encountering things there so we decided to go Apon arriving there I become overwelmed with a sense of dread sorrow anger sadness and everything inbetween Besides that it looked pretty normal We did some walking some voice recording normal shit and finally we were standing outside the car talking when it happened It was around  in the morning when I saw a shadow move I clicked on the flashlight and moved it over to that spot yet nothing was there I decided at this point to tune in and see what I could find When I was certain I was tuned in I opened my eyes and immediately wished I hadnt In the graveyard floating were a pair of blood red eyes and they were staring right at me They were full of hatred scorn and just pure evil Time seemed to have stopped and I just kept staring at those eyes I couldnt look away Then all of a sudden they rushed forward with lighning speed out of the graveyard and directly through me What happened next is a bit fuzzy I remember feeling all sorts of emotions and having many intricate thoughts Then everything goes black The next thing I know I awake to find my friend knelt down next to me shaking me He said that I had uttered one word before i fell DestroyThe entire ride back i was physically sick to the stomach and had a massive headacheIve never gone back to that place and never will Im  now and Ive gotten a lot better at controlling what I see These are only two of the many stories I have to share but I felt these were thew most important I just wish that I could forget some of the things Ive seen I also hope others are like me and see where Im coming from Im going to keep working on it and use this ability to possibly help othersw in the future ,My Ability,16
lionelflores,4,3,1qzwqw,11,Before I go on with the story I want to say that I was raised from a culture where Brujaria witchcraft kind of and superstition is big  But I do not consider my experiences that happened to be linked to that  Toward the latter part of the story I was working on a research paper that had research on La Santa Muerte  This happened a few years back  at the University of Houston  It was my first year attending the college and I had moved into brand new lofts that had just opened on campus  Toward the middle of my first semester I had woke up one day with scratches  I noticed the scratches when I was taking a shower  The water would sting once it hit them  They were in sets of s  One set was on the right side of my body I did not think too much of them though  Later on that day my buddy had called me to hang out  He lived a couple of floors down from me so we were talking at the lounge  He randomly mentioned that he had woken up with scratches as well  It was a weird coincidence but we did not take it too serious at the time  School and life got really busy and it was not until another semester that we were able to hang out again  A day before he had called me to hang out though I had again awaken with scratches  They were sets of  scratches around my body  One set under my left eye one set on my right side of my body and  sets on the left side of my body  I had noticed the same way I noticed my first scratches  The water had stung while in the shower  I had not mentioned the scratches to my friend the day we hung out  There was a distinct scratch on his neck when I saw him  I asked him about it and he said that he had woken up with it  He said that it was bleeding a little bit also when he woke up  I told him about the scratches that I woke up with a day prior and we were in shock it seemed like too much of a coincidence but we could not think of anything that could have caused this  I had moved out the the following semester to another complex the one I had moved into was previously a hospital and the basement still had some of the original tile  I was not aware of this when I signed the lease but nothing weird happened the  years I was living there  My old neighbor of which I was good friends with at the time and knew the story had called my one night to come over quickly  When I got there she had shown me scratches that she had awaken with  They were sets of s and had kind of made an upside down triangle on her back  I stayed there a while with her and her roommate to talk but could never piece together the puzzle  I am living somewhere else now in Houston  I have experienced a couple of things in the townhouse I live in now not scratch related  My buddy has contacted me a few times to hang out  And once because he had again awaken with scratches but this time it was just him  I am not sure what how the scratches got there or why they happened to us  I think about it a lot,Night Scratches,14
koolgirl,1,12,1qxq3p,10,So this is a kinda follow up story to thishttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqufptheshadowyfigureinthefield involving more shadows The last story was when I was around  years old and this one is from earlier this year These shadows have popped up throughout my life mostly at my grandparents property Sometimes they carried messages strong emotions and once or twice auditory and visual hallucinations Yes I have gone to psychics and spiritual people for explanations and their answer is that my spirit or variations of my spirit was inhumanly strong and I had connections to the spirit world underworld whatever or whatever you want to call the place dead people go However Ive learned to just accept it and whenever a shadow moves in the distance and a strong wave of emotion rolls over to just hold my breath and wait for it to be over I know I said I was going to tell the story of the abandoned house next door but this one is more scary and had more of a impact on me and I thought youd enjoy it more  Now onto the story it was a cold fall day and I was wearing my long jacket that went to my ankles I was quietly deciding what I wanted in a corner store Its very hard to pick between brands of chocolate bars Anyway I felt the hairs on the back of my neck raise as they do when a experience is about to happen I looked to my right and a small shadow about the size of a  or  year old boy is standing there This is one of the very few that have happened in public He then points at the female clerk behind the counter and says Thats my mommy Then a stream of images flood my mind A necklace with a key that has a heart on it A boys room with cars scattered around it A little boy watching TV while playing with some toys Children running around at recess Finally a image of a bald man appears My chest tightens and it gets tougher and tougher to breath To stop myself from panicking I remind myself that it will go away and that its only the product of my mind It releases and I take a deep breath The boys shadow shifts and he says Daddy took that all away from me Hes a bad bad man He then shifts again and points towards the clerk Go say hi to mommy for me She is very sad  I walk over and put my chocolate bar and bags of milk on the counter As she rings them up I politely ask if she lost a son Her hazel eyes fill with rage and she growls Yea What about it I didnt want to have to explain all of my gifts right then so I gestured towards the shadowy boy and say Well he is right here Her facial expression told me not to go any further In fact every bone in my body told me not to start the conversation in the first place I quietly ask if it had anything to do with a bald man and suffocation At this point Ive already paid and she leans on the counter and saysI dont believe you I need actual proof The boy shifts and says Tell her about the necklace Its in her right pocket I do as he says and tell her about the necklace and that its in her right pocket The boy quickly tells me that her name is Clara Her beautiful name matches her body Very petite with long untied black hair hazel eyes and a tan skin colour Im almost the exact opposite with long brown hair dark blue eyes and a tall body build She slowly reaches into her pocket and I notice the scabs on her wrist Too straight to be accidental They cut all the across her wrist and go all the way down her arm She pulls out the necklace and places it on the counter Thats when I look at her face and see her eyes are light and almost jolly with a wide grin spread on her face  At first I thought she was relieved to know that her son is happy Then her eyes turned dark and I could tell shes already formed a plan that does not involve the keeping of my life I instinctively take a couple steps back and the boy moves in front of the counter Claras head snaps forward and she pulls out a bloody swiss army knife The boy asks Mommy why Why didnt you stop him Please stop hurting yourself because I love you At the time the words didnt really sink in but later that night I had to drink some alcohol to try and wash the words from my memory I still have nightmares A wave of helplessness washes over me encases me like a coffin I push the emotion aside and say in a strong voice Clara stop Your son needs you to stop it right now Her eyes peek out from the cloud of black hair I told her word for word what the little boy told me  She never did cut into her wrists that day I wouldnt call myself a hero for it but rather the little boy for telling me to get her help She was already getting treated for depression and whatnot but I encouraged her to get more help The moment after I told her what her son told me she dropped the blade and cried She ended up calling her friend to take her to her therapist and I never left until she was safely in the car We still keep in touch in case she ever needs to talk to her son however I couldnt guarantee that her son would come every time She is doing a lot better today  I had a lot of alcohol that night,The Shadow Boy,22
Ladyrosalie,5,6,1qv5id,10,Now this is a second hand story but one that always chills me It happened to my mother and shes telling me this as I type But first a little backgroundMy mother had been an LVN for a long long time Before I was born she worked at an old hospital At the time it was known as Bathenia It was owned by Catholic nuns until about the late s or early s when the city bought it and changed it to united regional The whole place was spooky according to my mom but there was one night shed never forget The second floor was the worst of the whole hospital Since it was the ICU many people died in that wing the one I was working in Odd things always happened There was an elevator that would go up and down and open on all the floors even though no one was in them And I remember matinence would turn them off at night to keep down the noise Sure they had a key you could turn but the elevators were never on when they did this That became common place though At the end of the wing it was L shaped was rooms we almost never used They would be used for storage Everything in that room was turned off We had finished our rounds when I saw a shadow figure go from one room to the other I shivered and stared It didnt happen again but I knew no one would be down there They shouldnt be anyway My coworker hadnt seen it but I nudged her Did you see thatNo What is it She whispered I saw someone You know we have to check it out I said My coworker shook her head No way Nancy She said staring at the spot like I wasFor a moment everything was silent Nothing moved or anything Suddenly the shadow crossed again but this time my coworker saw it She gasped and we argued about going Chris we have to go check it out We have to I said determined I was not going to let an intruder in on my watch We go down there together and nothing was there No one I should say Nothing was disturbed and I was beginning to think that I was imagining things when suddenly the tv turned on in the other room We ran in and the tv turned off and on and off again Chris unplugged it but once again it turned on as well a s the light to the room We stared as a shadow ran past us into the other room The call light blinked on the other room and I went in and turned it off Leave now I ordered It got quiet again and everything turned off We went back to work though we were shaken up Hours passed and eventually we recovered I have no idea what was going on and it never happened again after that not that I know of,The Shadow,16
bebadhavefun,2,4,1r3ema,9,Hey guys well Im a new user but Ive been reading NoSleep for about a year now though I never felt like sharing my supernatural experiences until now In time Ill post more but I feel the need to start with something that brings tears to my eyes to this dayIt was mid and I was on my winter break my mother was working her night shift and I was alone in the house with my little brother who was  years old at the time At around  AM I started to feel sleepy so I turned off the computer and headed to the bathroom to grab some toilet paper in case my flu got worse during the night As soon as I get to the bathroom I notice two things The first outside it was raining incredibly hard and the second the dog had followed me to the bathroom and was whining softly while he waited for me to come out Being a recently adopted dog Weve had him for a week or so back then I didnt think much of it Maybe hes afraid of the rain I thought as I headed out and closed the doorThat was when I saw it A couple of meters to my left through the half open door that leads to the garden something that made me question my sanity It was acreature I guess Taller than the door frame covered in thick light brown hair that walked in two feet I saw it for a split second before it hid behind the wall I thought I was hallucinating even though Ive never been skeptical so my first impulse was to open the door to see what the hell was that It was the moment my dog got in the way between me and the door shaking whining and showing his teeth at me to keep me away As I said we hadnt had Morrison for too long and I didnt want to get bitten so I backed off to the kitchen trying to wrap my head around what was going on Suddenly the sound of scratching on the walls made me jump It seemed to come from everywhere and Morrison started barking at this I made him shut up and in desperation I grabbed the biggest knife I found in a drawer and stayed there in the middle of the kitchen shaking because of the cold and the situation I wasThe scratching faded in the rain and for a moment I thought everything was alright That until the door swung open and slammed back shut making me jump and run to get the hell out of there and lock myself in my brothers room with the dog still holding the knife tightly I remember hearing soft bangs on the door outside that started to get louder and louder each time and I just covered my ears praying to anyone who could hear me for it to stop But it didntWhen it became too much for me I gained enough courage to go outside and put a couple of chairs against the door just in case When I came back inside leaving every light in the house on a few minutes passed by before I heard a loud bang outside the room I knew that whatever it was was trying to get inside so I opened the bedroom door and looked down the hallway The chairs I had put against the door were knocked down and the door was wide open I could only shake my head in disbelief as I came back to sit on the edge of my brothers bed holding the knife that seemed to be useless by thenI dont know at which point I fell asleep but my mother woke me up at around  in the morning and asked why wasnt I in my room and what was all the mess with the chairs in the hallway I told her she didnt believe me and Im pretty sure Ill never know what the hell was that thingPS Sorry about any mistakes on the writing of this story english is not my first language ,Ill never know,13
TreasureHouseofDoom,14,48,1r396v,9,Channeling Aunt Lucias strength and wit remarkable as both had always been I felt myself fortified for what lay ahead but that didnt mean I was completely unafraid  Fear and anxiety are nearly interchangeable in certain situations and shedding them completely is not always the wisest approach  Composure maintained I dealt now with redirecting the bases of these emotions into something productive and controllable  I remembered my mothers fearlessness the way she seized every opportunity to create and do good the inner power she exuded This I channeled too  Sisters in unison one living and one passed on to strengthen me I was sure I carried now a shield of sorts  Across the miles as if she knew the battle I faced I could almost hear my mother say Keep your head up Julianne  Stay focused  Do good work  This was her mantra and as far as I knew it had never failed herLaughter rose from the study again and I was about to step through the door open myself to the onslaught when I caught the fragrance of chocolate on the air warm wafts from just beyond the door from the foyer to the hall  I heard the voices of children conversation and giggling just beyond that too  Instinct told me this is where I was needed most  Dulcie wanted me to follow her into the study and in her realm there was no telling what might happen but Marys presence was just ahead of me and it was possible I would have the opportunity to observe more of the events that had led to terrible schism between friendsDoors shut and power out the hall was dark and the musty odor of rooms not allowed to breathe hung in the air  I tried but couldnt recall if I had smelled this odor the night before  The chill and dank fragrance felt captive too as if I were stepping into some forgotten time and place  It was completely possible that I was that I had discovered some portal that Mary had provided one  Passing doors I heard the sounds of the once living in other spaces the turn of a music box in a nursery the zip and knock of a trestlepowered sewing machine probably a Singer like the one my mother used as a plant stand at home the coos of a baby and the lullaby her Mama sang  These memories vital and vibrant empowered me too  There was good energy about this place and I allowed it to circulate now through me  Three doors I passed to either side and I was just about to open the door to the kitchen when a fourth door to the right opened slightly  Through the slim space provided I heard the singsong voice of Dulcie coy and friendly beckon Wont you come play with us Julianne In the background the festive tones of a calliope rose and fell and I found myself reminded suddenly of a wonderful memory from my childhood  My siblings and I had been treated to a day at the North Carolina State Fair where my mother had introduced us to a man she knew from antiques auctions  Hed shown us the most glorious old calliope and hed had a real pet monkey named Clayton the Scoundrel  These are the old tricks of angry spirits to tease some memory out of us exploit and make it vile distract good people from good works  I knew this but I longed too for simpler days days when my sister brothers and I were among familiar people in a familiar place days when we were too young and innocent to recognize the darkness in others  Julianne familiar voice from the kitchen prevailed and as I reached for the cool brass doorknob I knew immediately whom I would find on the other side  Aunt Lucia tears stung my eyes but joy filled my heart  Three years she had been gone on the other side only her voice to guide me so much more than most others ever had again of a loved one but now she stood in front of me poised pretty powerful  Emanating from her in golden beams was the very energy she had radiated in life How can this beAunt Lucias smile was warm invitation into the kitchen  Forgive me but I worried you wouldnt get the fudge just right And she laughed at me as others of our family often did  I was neither a baker nor a cook but she is a Kook my sister might have saidThese young ladies have just introduced me to Vassar fudge And now I saw Mary at the island in Seths ultra swank kitchen measuring out white sugar  Across from her stood Dulcie her expression perplexedMiss Lucia wouldnt it all be better with more sugar and perhaps a little more cream she asked but Aunt Lucia only laughed sweetlyWell Sweet Dulcie she began as if she had known Dulcie Moseley for years why dont you tell me  Isnt it a Moseley who sent this recipe to you from Vassar and didnt she help to invent this sweet confection Aunt Lucia had such a way with children always  Never ask a yes or no question she had often told me Always engage a child  If necessary be wrong so that they may be right I remembered this as she winked at me over Dulcies golden headWell no Maam My Aunt Mae did send this but she isnt a Moseley shes a Baker on my mothers side and she and Mary burst into laughter as if her aunts being a Baker who sends fudge recipes was just about the funniest thing theyd ever heardOr she could be a Boiler or a Cook Mary giggled  I watched in some awe as the two girls exchanged looks of pure love deep respect and as my Aunt mitigated whatever memory might endanger this momentary union Now she turned to me expression earnest voice so soft I practically had to read her lips to understand her words Mary is a pip and an angel but theres deep sorrow about her and Dulcie really is a sweet girl good and kind but the anger that rages in her spirit is pure fire You must handle this all very carefully cautiously and you mustnt lose either your temper or your controlThis was the way of the women in my family  Always theyd presume that the younger women were ready for anything too that we could accomplish anything we set our minds to that our minds over mattersathand would sufficeHow did I get myself into this mess I said out loud and Aunt Lucia raised finely sculpted eyebrows as if to ask You mean you dont know and suddenly I was reminded of the walk through the cemetery the prank gone too far the Ouija board Id promised my mother Id never usedHow you came to be in the middle of this is no longer the issue What matters is how you plan to get yourself out And her insistence that I must disengage myself only after my promise to Mary was satisfied was implicit  There really was no other way  Now she only mouthed without even a hint of whisper Dont bring home any hitchhikers and I understood her warning  There are people who live their lives under the shadows of dark sad spirits hitchhikers who will never find their paths home To be under such shadow would be detriment not only to me but also to anyone who loved meBut what do I do I asked Aunt Lucia  And perhaps some answer would have come if only I had been strong enough to hold this lively memory open longer  Instead I felt the collapse of these exhausted spirits in front of me and in moments the vision in the kitchen they had never known had faded  Only red and black trim against the swank white and stainless of the kitchen Seths mother had designed remained or so I thought at first but as I investigated more closely I found the buttery print of a childs right hand smudged where Dulcie had stood only moments before Moving closer to it I thought about tearing a paper towel from the roll that stood upright just beside the sink to press it down for some evidence of this impossible reality when suddenly it combusted to tiny flames and the sizzle against the stainless island carried the salty tingle of tearsThe nature of my gift is such that I cannot press spirits to reveal themselves and even if I could I dont believe I ever would  Instinct dictates that as little engagement as possible is always the best mode and its a rule by which I live my life whenever possible  But I knew Id have to take a more proactive stance to accomplish what we allMary Dulcie and Ineeded and for that Id have to examine the house I thought back to the night before almost literally decades ago considering the journey along which these girls had brought me and the things Seth had told me about the house  I knew for instance that his father had discovered a secret compartment in the study that old photos and tintypes had been stored in the tin handkerchief box found in the wardrobe that stood in his parents room that the hall was part of an elaborate addition to join the kitchen to the rest of the house and that the Ouija board was strictly taboo in the Jefferies household just as it would have been in mine I knew too that the kitchen was not built in  when the house had been and that the original kitchen must have stood just past the rock wall in the farthest portion of the back yard  I did not however know where the Ouija board had come from originally and now I wondered if it had been in the house when the Jefferies had moved in or if it had come into the house with themId have to go to the study to begin my investigation  The notion sickened and worried me but I gathered myself for the inevitable  My mother had long taught me that the most direct way to gain protection from spirits that might harm you was to go to the Big Guy himself  Some might laugh at this but faith was and still is much more than a crutch for me and anyone who believes in the fires of Hell must embrace the comforts of Heaven too  Opening the door to the study I pushed it open so that the door knob bounced lightly against a chair just to the left of it  Colder air pushed into the space right in front of me and I shivered as if I were outside in a snowstorm  Dulcie was here now I knew and she had been waiting for me  Our Father who art in Heaven I began voice bold and strong Hallowed be Thy name The chandelier above the Dr Jefferies broad mahoghany desk swayed slightly at first and then began to spin from the center reminding me of the whirlaround at the park Thy Kingdom Come Thy will be done And now Dulcie laughed with much more depth than a child might have cold echo of the anger that was eating away her soul interrupted to say Im not the Devil Julianne Im only a little girl afterallAnd I strengthened myself for the tantrum I felt welling in her On Earth as it is in HeavenLook at me Julianne And it was all I could do to not make direct eye contact with her but I did see that she was as pretty in what came close to flesh as she had been in the picture innocent and sweet looking and completely mesmerizing in her charming presentation If I had not known what I did if I could not recognize the hate that burned her from the inside out I would have reached to hold her stroked her golden ringlets played dolls or drawn with her just as I would have my own little sister but there was no denying the tenacious embers of her eyes even as I avoided contact with themGive us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us And now her laughter was maniacal sad and laughing all at the same timeForgive us our trespasses she mocked and who is the trespasser here The question hovered between us and then seemed to take on an energy all its own as the accessories on Dr Jefferies desk and the loose items throughout the room rose and began to spin as if convection of Dulcies anger moved themLead us not into Temptation I continued spirit emboldened with every word of the prayer I had known by heart ever since I had been a toddler but deliver us from EvilAnd Dulcies angry laughter swelled to a cackle that rattled the house but then it fell too as the little girl so consumed by anger became increasingly exhausted as I continued for Thine is the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory Forever and Ever AmenI knew the entities that had exploited Dulcies sorrow and loneliness were not dormant and would not give up so easily  Stronger now I added Dear Heavenly Father Give me strength for the challenges I face and cast all unkind mischievous or evil spirits from my presence  Wrap me in your loving arms to protect and fortify me  I ask these things in your name AmenAnd now the room became silent its energy subdued and the objects that had spun around me lowered then settled in relative proximity to where they had been to start  I breathed deep solace and was happy to find new warmth about the room and to detect the spicy scent of candles burned perhaps days ago in the air  For the time being this was a study almost like any other  Now I set my task to discovering its every secret free from interruption for awhileThank you for reading each of these parts that explain an amazing event in my life If you havent been following please find other portions at these

TreasureHouseofDoom,21,77,1qs12z,9,Turning  to walk away Mary headed toward the creek through the thin wooded border between Seths house and his neighbors a rather standard s American Dream home  Just past that the stretch of land that had once been a pecan orchard on a broad plantation was now acres of baseball fields and clear cut park bordered by pretty trails of cedars along ancient fence lines some trunks scarred by  barbed wired fetters others proving Life finds its way as they had declared themselves to swallow the barbed wire as they grewMary stopped by the creek  I wondered if she saw it only as it had been or if she saw the rock pile fountain constructed in the s the bandstand gazebo the red fade painted trestle to our right  Almost as soon as this curiosity formed in my mind all these elements faded then evaporated to the background and we were again stepping into Marys world  Tree growth became denser and the clear cut field across the creek was a pecan tree studded pasture remnants of the plantationStaring at the reflection cast by trees across the creek Mary mused Mama says  Good enough for the kingdom of Heaven but aint good enough to share a table or even a wagon  She turned to me took my hand But me and Sweet Dulcie figure were just about sisters on account of we got the same birthdayDecember th Her pearly smile caught a glare from the mid morning lightWhat year was that Beth asked  She and Seth had followed but until now I hadnt even heard them breatheMary laughed We are  you figure it out Her childlike mischief prolonged mystery gathering the information we needed to help and to satisfy our own curiosity wasnt going to be easyRight here they dipped me in Mary brought her hands to her face gentle stroke against her cheeks and down her neck water in her memory washing baby sins away eyes shut and smile broad and now she raised her hands to the sky arms spread Hallelujah We sang And she held that position that memory for a long moment before she dropped her arms to rest at her sides And then they pulled me right out of it Now Mary collapsed to her bottom legs turned to her left at the cool damp bank  Falling to my knees to hold and comfort her I watched in gaping sorrow as the reflection on the water gave way to reveal a heartbreak picture of Mary lying face up beneath the surface her eyes and mouth wide with shock her body drowned Her head against my shoulder I asked Mary do you understand what it means to be dead She turned to me  Sometimes I reckon  I know what it means to be me  Dead is when I cant find my parents nor my friend and I never got no one until I got you at least not for long She smiled sadly now But youll stay with me wont you  Now I shivered  Of course I wanted to promise to be whatever she needed but I had been warned many times about the dangers of making such promises to spirits especially precocious childrenIm here now but my biggest concern is helping you find your way home The ghastly image in the water rippled beneath the tiny body of a boatman bug whose rowing swim broke the surface  Pay attention to every detail I told myselfHow did you end up in the water I asked Mary and now I felt the gush and soak of her dripping dress the puddle her head made as if I had just lifted her from the creek in which she had once been born again and eventually diedOh Mama Mary exclaimed happily Me and Sweet Dulcie was just playing Warnt no harm  We aint seen each other in so long  and in an instant Mary and I watched passively  as her mother now held her wet lifeless body where Id imagine I had salty tears meeting drowning soak Marys body limp fall back as her mothers tensed and released in bodyaching sobs  And there stood Dulcie across the creek face peeking around the trunk of a cedar hand concealing smile breaking to giggles Mary stepped to the edge clay meeting water Sweet Dulcie She waved but I reached to press her hand down  Tell me about this day  The day you drownedMary stared now at Dulcie golden shimmer around the girl across the creek  She sees me dont she It was only partly a question  And when I saw her the first time after shed gone away my Mama told me I was crazy that I was letting guilt eat my senses away but I knew I hadNow Beth and Seth came closer to us Beth reaching to touch Mary contact that couldnt be made and Seth watching Dulcie curiously and cautiously  Dulcie smiled put her hands to her knees and threw her head back  There was no doubt that she was aware of us or at least of Mary and her expression was neither friendly nor truly happy  Why would your mother have thought you were crazy Where had she gone Seth asked precisely what I wonderedAnd now Mary clutched her stomach in pain That was a very bad day and I knew betterI told Mama I did but she said that accidents happen without the plans thats what makes them accidents and I felt what Mary remembered her mothers arms around her little girl on a very sad dayThin glimpse of what anger lay between these two little girls had come but I needed more and they did tooI like fudgethick with cocoa and dry not gooey and you gotta boil that in the pot the cream and cocoa and water and butter til the water rolls with the heat and a spoonful dropped into it makes a ball without you having to shape it  Mary walked back now following a little woods trail that no longer existed in my present day life Along the way she picked wild flowerssunchoke asters white daisies most would have considered weeds  Coming to a fork along the trail she chose the thinner one that rose up a hill to the left  Four great iron posts cornered a lot of about a quarter of an acre Joined by segments of iron fencing that came to about my hip these surrounded a cluster of graves dating back to the days when Alabama had not yet become a state  From where I stood I could read quiet clearly Jobias Schraeder Husband and Father He made his way in the World And now he makes his way to Heaven and the date of his death was in the year  two years before Alabamas statehood had been recognizedYoure buried here Beth asked Mary but I answeredNo Marys buried in the old city cemetery isnt that right And Mary nodded forlornly Yall passed through the other day and I thought to myself That one there has the Shineshell see me  Every now and again someone passes through who sees me or at least notices me somehow  Her eyes apologetic and pleading Mary continued You dont know what it feels to never be seenAnd she was right but maybe I could imagine it base that on my personal sense of always being on the peripheryIm glad you saw me too Mary I told her but I need you to tell me what were doing hereThe folks from the Big House Mr and Mrs Mosely his parents and Sweet Dulcie theys all buried here  Its the family spot  Mary walked through the gate headed straight to the center and there were five graves of varied ages  A monument rising to the sky read MOSELEY and to either side was a  husband and wife set bearing the family name  And between one set of those the one to the right was a small stone with roses and a harp etched into it  This stone was of Sylacauga marble stark white with ribbons of gray to black Dulcine Octavia Moseley Beloved Daughter Taken to Be Among the Angels On the nd Day of October Mary placed the flowers atop the grave whispered some hope or prayer knelt  She cleared leaves and grass from the base piling it to the left but now a cold breeze scattered them against the stone  This cemetery did not bring me the comfort that many others had  The sense of trauma and losswas palpable  I think its time you told us how Dulcie diedPart  on Monday Thank you for reading each of these parts that explain an amazing event in my life If you havent been following please

AfterYourHeart,0,9,1r7cv5,7,This is an update from herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrpodeadendsOk I have a little bit of time Im not sure when theyll be back so I have to be carefulThat day the day Pugsley died Joe and I talked about it after Sophia had gone to bed He swore he didnt leave the window open He always had an encyclopedic memory remembering the tiniest little things about just about everything so I believed him I know I didnt open the window I also know that when I left to pick up Sophia I had to undeadbolt the front door Joe quickly went down to check the back door Also locked We decided to just drop it and we went to sleep If I remember correctly I didnt sleep well that nightI wish Joe would come visit me They said I could have visitors occasionally if I was well behaved It sure does get lonely in here I mean there are others but man do they have issues Id rather just keep to myself At least I have my art They even let me try to sell it well rather they let an art gallery try to sell them and occasionally someone buys one I plan on putting these letters in the back of one whenever this is finished Hey Maybe thats how youre reading this If so thank you for buying my art I hope you enjoy itI remember the day I painted my daughters eighth birthday portrait I had never tried such a thing before but she was so beautiful that I had to at least try Her hair was blonde and getting quite long She liked to straighten it She had the look that screamed head cheerleader queen bee but I always hoped she grow up to be a scientist or an engineer She was so smart With her smile she could get away with murder She was missing a few teeth at the time and a few more were still growing back That just made her even cuter Looking at her was like looking into the heart of your childhood She always made me feel young I loved going on adventures with herThe day I painted her I needed her to sit still for a while and I wanted to try and make it fun for her I wanted to paint her smiling not bored out of her mind The first step was music She loved music and she loved to sing She was pretty good at it too Then I came up with a great idea I got her her own easel canvas and paints and figured we could paint together Id help her figure out what she wanted to paint and get her started and then Idl paint herJust thinking about that day helps me almost remember what its like to be happy We had so much fun We listened to music sang and danced a bit painted she decided to paint me back and talked about just about everything She told me all about her new school and the friends she was making She was such a people person People were drawn to her and always wanted to be around her Looking at her it astounded me how quickly she was growing When did she get so tallAt the end of the day we did our reveal I showed her my painting and she showed me hers I have to admit I was pretty impressed by hers Looks like artist could be added to the list of things she could be when she grew up We decided wed hang them together in the hallway once they had dried I wasnt quite ready for the day to be over so after we cleaned up I took her out to eatJoe got home after Sophias bedtime I proudly took him to the spare room to show off our paintings I turned on the light and Joe laughed I screamed I explained to Joe that I didnt do this That when Sophia and I had gone to dinner it was just a normal portrait That someone else mustve come in and painted over the original painting altering it He stood silently staring at me for a moment Like he was trying to figure out if this was some kind of weird prank He then kissed me on the forehead told me we would figure this out later and went to watch a movie After he walked away I turned back to look at the paintingWhoever had done it had blackened out her eyes They had also paled her skin and given her deep circles under her eyes It reminded me of a picture I had seen when I looked up blackeyed kids I made the mistake of looking it up at work and the picture had stunned me so badly that I immediately drew all the blinds and curtains in the place and covered all the windows I am usually not that much of a chicken but for some reason that picture had a serious effect on me and now there I was staring at my daughter turned into a blackeyed kid I quickly destroyed the painting I never showed it to Sophia She had been so excited to see a painting of herself The next few days were her scheduled days to stay at her dads so I decided to try to repaint it The duplicate was pretty good Not quite as good as the original but it was pretty closeThe next morning I went to check on the duplicate and it had been ripped to shreds I showed Joe but he shook it off This time he was convinced that it was some kind of joke He swore he wasnt falling for it Then he went off to work I sat and cried for a while burned the painting and tried one last time This time I hid the painting and this time the painting stayed safeOk Its almost meds time I better hide this again I hate the meds they give me They make me feel so weird I dont even know what day it is anymore,Dead Ends,16
hornetandthefly,1,9,1r1jea,8,I had two glasses of wine while my clothes were in the drier and fell asleep on the couch around eleven I woke up at threethirty with all the lights on it was raining out I love falling asleep to the rain I tried to drift back to sleep despite feeling completely awake I never felt the sleep pass over me but eventually I began dreaming In my dream I was giving my manager a ride home It was dark and quiet in the city and I was jokingly pretending to be asleep while I was driving I had my head leaning back on the head rest and my bottom jaw was slack so my mouth was open But then I felt that I was stuck that way So he started nudging my right shoulder to make me wake up I felt panic in my dream Thats when I came out of that dream and back into my living room where I was asleep on the couch My mouth still agape my eyes still closed I was short of breath That is when I realized that I still felt the nudging sensation Now however it was coming from behind the couch cushion against my right shoulder I could feel and hear the cushion pushing me back and forth on my couch It then felt like I was fully awake and the nudging stopped for a second I took a second to let myself feel afraid The nudging began again but now there was an orchestra of movements all around on my couch The cushions under my feet were being pulled upward in short little beats and the left side of my pillow was doing the same thing I felt and heard the blanket next to my right ear moving like it was trying to tickle my face and ear I allowed these hallucinations to feel real and as soon as I gave in to their reality I felt the sides of my pillow begin to curl up and over my face My heart began racing my breaths were shallow and I still was unable to move or wake myself up The pressure of the pillow on my face increased until it felt like I couldnt breath I was sinking into my couch the pressure was on my entire body now I knew I had let my fear fuel this hallucination for too long I took a giant gasp of air and woke up I didnt know how to prove to myself that I was truly awake so I stayed sitting upright with the lights on and opted out of sleep for the night ,My dreams wont let me sleep,17
OldRockingChair,11,3,1qw6z7,7,You know how it is when youve been living with something for so long you dont even know its abnormal for other people It was like that for me All along Ive had memories of sensations I wasnt doing Like Id be sitting at my desk then I can suddenly taste a certain flavor of chips that I havent had for a long time or a drink Sometimes I smell things that arent there like paint or candles And there are times when I feel pain where theres no one touching me at all Just the other day I tasted beer I havent had beer in a long while and certainly not at ten in the morning in my office cubicle It was very weird It went on for a while and the memory was strong you know like Im really tasting it at that moment I was so intrigued that I tried to research if there was a possible name for this but nothing came up Apparently a person can have olfactory memorieslike a smell triggers a memory but thats the closest Ive gotten to finding actual facts about this Ive not even encountered any scientific facts about a taste memory Normally I can remember the things I ate but that only applies for recent foods and none of my own memories are as strong as the random taste smell memories And when I feel pain it comes at a place Im not straining like Id be sitting perfectly still and Id feel a dull stab of pain on my thigh or between my ribs Sometimes its so intense that I had to stop moving for a few seconds I feel like a damn receptor Its as if somewhere out there someone is eating the foods I taste being exposed the scents I smell and feeling the cause of the pain I have  Im not sure if theres any other explanation ,Memory,10
WajaWabit,2,4,1qu5mb,9,I am not a superstitious person by any stretch of the imagination but this happened to me last night and I swear every word of it is trueI was having a nightmare  In my dream I was walking along a street in my city when a passingby stranger asked me a question  I didnt quite understand what he said so I approached him  But soon as I was an arms reach from him he stuck me with a needle and injected me with something making me pass out  Still in my dream I regained consciousness in a dungeon in hell surrounded by supernatural demons and horrors  I was stretched out on a torture rack while they flayed my skin to prepare my soul for sacrifice to the devil  There is no escape the demons told me as they laughed There is no escape  I screamed and pulled on my chains to escape but my futile efforts were only met with cackling laughterDingdong  I awoke to the sound of my doorbell ringing  Not in the dream  In reality  At  in the morning still dark as night in my apartment  Horrified I thought this couldnt possibly be the case  I live alone and Im certainly not expecting somebody this late on a Saturday night  this early on a Sunday morning  But the doorbell rang again dingdong  I grabbed my flashlight bolted out of bed and went to the front door to investigate  No one was there  Not a soul on my porch  It was still dark outside and the street was deserted  I looked through the large glass window of the front door but every bone in my body was screaming at me to not open that door  So behind the door I stayed  I stood there for several minutes wondering what the hell just transpired looking out onto my empty porch through the window  It was raining slightly cold and generally unpleasant out certainly not the weather nor time for dingdong ditching  Besides theres no way they ran away that fast right  Maybe my doorbell was malfunctioning  But it only rang those two times  Oh well I thought and I walked back up the stairs and into my apartmentAs soon as I closed my apartment door behind me the door bell rang again  Dingdong dingdong dingdong  Three times in rapid succession as if someone were desperately trying to get me to come downstairs  I raced back downstairs again in a panic thinking what the hell is going on  Within  seconds I was back at the front door of my building again looking at a completely silent and empty porch  Oh fuck this I thought and went back upstairs and switched off my doorbell ringerIt was difficult to fall asleep again,Demons and Doorbells,13
Lnzy,6,5,1r8uds,11,I transferred to the south dorms at the beginning of the semester and there I met my new roommate Kaylee I knew Kaylee purely by reputation as being violent and weird and into the occult So as I entered the room for the first time I was fully expecting to see a girl dressed in black with indiscriminate piercings across her bodynot the bubbly pink blonde happily thumbing through a Psychology text Kaylee was nothing like the person people made her out to be and I began to wonder just who did she piss off for that rumor mill to get so much steamWell Kaylee said lowly I have trouble keeping roommates Ive had a lot of them Youre the seventhWhy Do you snore I laughed still not convinced Kayle was anything more than a normal girlKaylee smiled thinly but it was clear that she had a hard time making light of it No I dont snore I have epilepsy It runs in my family actuallyOh wellthat sucksYeah my Aunt and Great Grandma both had it Granny had a seizure in her sleep and accidentally strangled herself with her sheets and my Aunt died when she was a little girlAlmost afraid to ask I opened her mouth HowShe was at the kitchen table and started having a seizure She stabbed herself in the heart with her dinner knifeKaylee kept her seizures at bay with medication and restraints on her bedpost They were nylon and Velcro straps that looped around her wrists and ankles while she slept so she would not hurt herself in her sleep should she have an epileptic seizure The first time I witness one was the fourth week of classes It lasted only a second but was incredibly violent One night as we studied in our room Kaylee abruptly slammed her wrists on the table with a shriek and flung herself back out of her chair I flew to her side but the seizure was already over Kaylee waved off the offer of a trip to the infirmary and settled for a dose of medication and a long swig of seltzer waterI have my medication she said breathlessly And that was that Over the course of the next few weeks the seizures grew in duration and intensity After a trip to the ER her medication was increased and Kayle was left in a drug induced haze Whenever she said anything it was unintelligible and garbled I knew her grades were sufferingBeing unable to help my roommate I was left to wallow in indecisiveness for a long time The more I tried to help it seemed the more Kaylee came to resent me And so I simply stopped After a seizure I simply went back to my own devices I stopped caring about the thundering jerks of her bedposts at nightIt was the night before midterm and I decided to take my books to the common room to study with the others girls from my biology class As I gathered my things I glanced over at Kaylee who was pulling up the sleeves of her nightgown and crawling into bed looking more haggard and thinly present than ever A spark of concern burned at me and I paused at the doorAre you sure youre alright Can I get you anythingKaylees absent looking gaze abruptly sharpened and she spit back at me No I dont need anything from you Just go already And turn the damn light off The spark of concern had been doused with a five gallon drum of water So curling my nose in offense I left the room but not before pointedly flicking the light switch off and slamming the doorIt was well past AM when I realized I had forgot my notes on biological systems in the room So I excused myself and made my way back upstairs I paused at the room door hearing a muffled ruckus from behind the wood slab Carefully I creaked the door open and the full noise of the disturbance hit my earsThump thump thump creeeeek thump thumpgaspAnother seizure I instinctively reached for the light switch but my finger paused on the acrylic plate Kaylees words coming back to me with sharp clarity I considered myself a good person with good intentions and Kaylees attitude had put me off in a bad way So I wrinkled my noise in disgust and hurried into the dark room fumbling around until I hit the desk The sound of Kaylee convulsing and pulling at the nylon straps behind me became white noise I blindly swept up all my notebooks and texts into my arms and quickly left the room The last sound I heard was a deep gargling intake of breath and a weak cough Then silence I closed the door with a soft schnk and was goneI awoke the next morning with my face planted firmly in the folds of Shakespeares Hamlet With several hours left before my first midterm exam I left my books where they lay and made my way back up to my room to take a shower and change my old wrinkled clothes As I opened the door I smelled the metallic bite in the air and gagged on a lung full of it My sleep filled eyes gazed towards Kaylees side of the room and all breathe in me left and the tips of my fingers buzzed The walls had been washed in blood red sticky streams of it It was splattered in streaks across the mirror and the desk all of Kaylees books KayleeKaylee lay still in her bed nightgown soaked in red Her arms and ankles still firmly strapped in their nylon restraints Her head tilted back revealing the gaping hole that had been ripped into her neck cords and all matter of things spilling out onto her chestI gasped for breath choking again on the foul air and my legs gave out from under me Falling over myself as I stumbled into the room I uselessly called for Kaylee reaching out as if to touch her A single red dot appeared on my outstretched hand and I looked up Written on the ceiling in Kaylees blood was a message that read Arent you glad you didnt turn on the light,Dont Turn On The Light,16
blkmagick,2,2,1r8old,10,My father was in the military which meant that we moved around a lot as I was growing up One of the places we moved to was Pensacola FL We moved there right before th grade started for me and we lived in military housing so we got to live in a two story house for the very first time I was excited I got my own room and my own bathroom right across the hallway Things were great until after a year of living in the house when things started to get strange I was home alone talking to my boyfriend on the phone when I heard a large crash in the kitchen I slowly walk in to see what happened and one of the cabinet doors were wide open and bowls were all over the floor I quickly pick up the bowls and put them away freaking out I was in there just five minutes earlier and everything was closed there was no way for the cabinet to open on its own I ran up to my room and locked my door until my family came home When they returned they asked why bowls were all over the floor in the kitchen A week after that incident I woke up suddenly out of a deep sleep gasping for breath I looked at my doorway and I see a girl standing there She was wearing an old white nightgown stained with blood and she had long black hair Her throat was slit and hastily stitched up along with her lips being stitched together Her eyes were gouged and missing and her hands were chopped off Thinking it was just my imagination I closed my eyes and reopened them only to see she had moved closer With each blink the closer she would get so I threw the covers over my head and prayed that she didnt touch me I ended up falling asleep and awoke in the morning with her nowhere to be found Over the next year she would appear every other week just watching me I got used to it eventually because I thought it was just a chronic bad dream and she didnt do anything to hurt me It wasnt until after we moved to back to Michigan did I get really scared My sister and I were talking and sharing stories about our house in Florida and she told me something troubling She mentioned that if she had to use the restroom in the middle of the night she would always use my parents bathroom in their room instead of the one across my bedroom I asked her why and her response wasBecause I would always see a girl in white standing outside of your door and it scared meKnowing that I wasnt the only one that saw her terrified me because I knew it wasnt just a dream I still wonder if she appears for the new family thats in the house and who she is and what happened to her I have to say though Im just glad to be out of that house,The Girl in White,12

NightOfTheLlamas,4,7,1r6rmn,7,There are few things that drive me mad I dont even understand why they get me so worked up in the first place Im not OCD or anything of the sort Its just that I cant stand things such as the sliding door when it is open It should be closed at all times The door is just a small problem compared to my shower It drips At first I could turn the shower handle and the dripping would come to an end It was inconvenient at times because I would stop whatever I was doing to shut up the drip drip drip Sometimes my food would burn slightly or I would miss a phone call cause I was busy pushing around the handle to end the sound I really dont mind though because it ended that cursed dripping and thats all that really matters to me It got worse When I turned the handle to end the sounds it would start up again randomly later I would be watching Netflix or reading a good book when I hear drip drip drip It doesnt ever end All through the day the shower leaks water out in a steady rhythmic beat It drives me crazy After a week or so I couldnt handle the sounds anymore I couldnt handle the drip drip drip I bought a new shower head thinking that would solve the problem After setting it up I blew out a breath of relief The dripping would finally end now I ate dinner that night happy I closed the open sliding door before settling myself on the couch with my laptop I was on Netflix and about half way through my show I heard something Drip drip drip Covering my ears with my hands didnt stop the sounds from making their way to my brain I could still hear it I tried everything I could think of I called the plumber but that did nothing I wrapped a rag around the shower head That worked until the rag started to drip from all of its water build up I also took the rag and placed it at the bottom of the shower hoping that it would mute the dripping sounds This worked yet it didnt I could no longer hear the dripping but I could feel the drops of water slamming against the rag In the end I just spent as little time in my own home as I could There was no way to be bothered by the shower if I wasnt even inside of the house This worked until I had to go home and try to sleep Which ended up with me not getting a wink of sleep I would stare up at the ceiling with my eyes unblinking just listening to the shower leak I would pray in my head that this torture would end somehow  I stopped sleeping in my home I hated going to that place Whenever my feet hit the floorboards of that house it was as if at that moment the shower started to leak again I slept at a friends house She never asked questions as to why I wished to stay with her That was something I was dearly grateful forIt has been a few weeks since I started to live here I havent felt this much peace in a while I was heading to the kitchen for a glass of water It was almost midnight and the sky was pitch black As I walk down the halls towards the kitchen I freeze To my left was the bathroom door Through the wood I could hear a soft drip drip drip ,Drip Drip Drip,14

darkdreamers,0,6,1r4n8q,7,Remember the old days where we used MSN as a form of communication It was pretty sweet We could give dancing emoticons of someones ass and they cant do shit about itSo back then when they just installed this new voice note feature I was hooked You record a few seconds of you talking send and the other person can listen and reply the same way So one day I was doing this with my friend just voicenoting back and forth We didnt think twice about using an actual telephone because holy shit voice notes What a time to be aliveSo I was replying to his voice note and sent it After sending it though I always press play to listen back to my own note but this time there was nothing there I paused pressed play again nothing Quiet As if I recorded a normal room Then I heard a humming not a machine hum but a womans hum I was around  or so at the time and my voice still resembled that of a  yearold girl But this voice was older and it was humming a song really slowly Really creepily as if she was right next to me as I hit the record button previously I paused it and ran out of the fucking roomUp until today I still dont know what that was I quit the chat and refused to do voice notes ever again The fuck was that ,Voice notesbut not my voice,13
AfterYourHeart,2,5,1r1po8,7,You ever have one of those days one that changes your life so drastically that looking back you cant help but wonder where youd be if it never happened I know I have I also know that without that day I would never be here I apologize if this is a little blurred They only let me have soft writing utensils No pens No pencils So Im writing this in artists charcoal I dont know why they think Im so dangerous I swear Ive never hurt anyone in my life nor would I Thats why Im writing this Im hoping that if I write it all down someone anyone will read it and understand my side of the story The biggest problem there is that not even I understand my side of the story Everything is so messed up in my head events are out of order somethings are blurry others are just plain missing Who knows maybe Im just writing this all down to help myself understand but where do I even begin Well I supposed I already mentioned the day everything changed so I may as well start thereSadly for a day that sent my life into a quick downward spiral to hell I dont really remember much about it Not the date Not the weather I could barely tell you the month I can tell you this It was night well I guess it could have been really early morning I was working third shift at the time and I know I was at work I was cleaning I was cleaning the bathrooms more specifically I had just gotten done with the upstairs bathroom and was getting ready to clean the downstairs bathroomBefore I go on I should mention that at the time I was working in a foster home for teens with mental and physical disabilities Since I mainly worked nights my main tasks were light housework some dinner prep for the next day and mainly stay awake and make sure nothing happened to the boys during the night It was a pretty easy job as there were only two boys at the time one  and one  who for the most part slept through the night Anyway where was I Oh  yes That night I had finished cleaning the upstairs bathroom and was about to go clean the downstairs bathroom when I noticed the light in the garage was on Thats weird I knew when I got there at the beginning of my shift that I walked up the driveway and as it was already dark out I would have noticed if it were on and it would have bugged me until I turned it off Im a stickler for not leaving the lights on I know that I was deep in thought as I walked up Maybe I was so distracted that I didnt notice I have been known to wander off in my own little world from time to time Then again maybe my boss left it on after I had already gotten thereI decided that I better go check it out After all protector to the boys was also part of my job and the phone was on the way to the door I grabbed the phone dialed  and put my finger on talk ready to push it if something went wrong Since its a landline if I do call and cant talk heaven forbid dispatch will still be able to know the address and send a car out to check I crept slowly to the garage door Ill admit I was terrified I probably should have called anyway just to be on the safe side I made it to the garage slowly opened the door and peeked my head out Empty I gasped as I released the breath I didnt know I was holding Still holding the phone just in case I checked the back garage door Locked I let out a small chuckle as I started to relax and I headed back into the house making sure to lock the garage door and turn off the light on my way back inCrap I noticed when I walked back in that in my stupid terror I had left the bathroom light on Sigh At least I could use the exercise I joked with myself on the way back down the hall I think I was still feeling really foolish for how worked up I let myself get When I turned into the bathroom a scream of terror got trapped in my throat so hard that I passed outI came to on the bathroom floor I was a little achey in a few spots but considering how hard I mustve fallen on bare tile it could have been way worse Lucky for me my head landed on the bath rug next to the shower although there was a bit of a ringing sound in my ears It either went away or I got used to it quickly  because after a moment I didnt even notice it I slowly got up and checked out what startled me into fainting for the first time in my life The mirror had writing on it I looked closer The writing was orange Orange marker Washable Weird Why would someone choose orange marker That just seems like an usual choice I mean I know there were markers in the linen closet next to the bathroom but who would look in a linen closet for writing utensils I mean its just not what I would expect writing on the mirror to be written withWow I cant believe I can get so sidetracked even at a time like this Focus Mirror Orange marker weird Writing Maybe one of the boys did it Well of the two only one of them was verbal and literate His bedroom was just down the hall The other boy had his room in the basement It was a fully finished basement that was remodeled specifically for him He had pretty severe Autism and didnt speak or write I checked my phone Not that much time had passed while I was on the floor I decided to go down the hall and check to see if Gabe was still awake I knew that if he had written it hed be giggling in his room waiting for a reactionI opened his door and turned on his light He was sound asleep Even though he was faceup he didnt even flinch when I turned on the overhead light Now trust me as the person who took care of him most nights and got him up and ready for school in the morning I could tell when he was faking sleep I also knew in general how long it took him to fall asleep There was no way he wrote thatI walked back to the bathroom After looking again I couldnt help but think it couldnt have been Gabe His hand writing is atrocious The handwriting on the mirror was fairly neat feminine almost and slightly familiar Again I couldnt help but shake off a weird feeling and again I should have called  I guess I didnt want to be the one that had to call the cops while working which I found stupidly embarrassing So after a quick yet terrifying search of the house revealed no one else and all the doors and windows locked I cleaned off the mirror first reading it one last timeMary had a little lamb little lamb little lambMary had a little lamb and she threw it out the windowThe window the second story windowI couldnt help but say it in the singsongy way that my grandpa had originally taught it to me It was a silly twist you could put on the right part of any nursery rhyme to make it even sillier He taught it to my sisters cousins and I to keep us entertained on long car rides Sometimes wed pass it along to any friends who happened to have come with although we quit doing it by time I was  or  so I dont think I was friends with anyone any longer that would have learned the song with usI watched TV in the living room for the rest of that shift trying to distract myself It didnt work at all and I jumped out of my skin at every noise When my boss got there I blamed illness on my incomplete chore list She believed me as I had never before not finished them and she wished me better as I hurried offWhen I got home I curled up with my fiance and somehow managed sleep Then again I always felt safe in his arms When he got up to leave he quietly kissed me goodbye As he slipped out the door I slipped back to sleepI remember I woke up before my alarm For some reason I was cold I peeked one eye open and noticed Pugsley was gone Oh well He sleeps when daddy sleeps I cant expect him to sleep when I sleep too I also noticed that Joe had left the window open again Man I hate it when he does that Now I get to lay here and debate whether or not its worth getting up and closing the window before my alarm goes off I decide quickly that if I close the window now I can still jump back in bed and snooze for a little bit longer before the alarm but when I got to the window sleep was the last thing on my mindThere on the sidewalk below was Pugsley The dog Joe Sophia my daughter and I had gotten together upon getting this new apartment Joe had been so happy about having our bedroom on the second story As I looked down many thoughts flooded my head One more than the rest the window the window the second story windowI put the dog in a small box then double bagged the box with plastic bags and put it in the garage freezer After all I still had to pick up Sophia from school I would try to figure out what to tell Joe and Sophia on the way thereTheyre coming Crap Theyre coming to check on me I have to hide this I dont want them to find it If Im never able to continue just know one thing I AM NOT CRAZYUpdateI was able to get out at least one more entry herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrcvdeadends,Dead Ends,12
sangarji,1,3,1r1huu,8,I bought a camera last week and snapped pictures of my four year old daughter I was excited about showing her those pictures as that would be the first time she would be seeing herself in a photographWhen I laid the photos in front of her she held them in her tiny beautiful hands and looked at me with a hint of confusionWho is this DaddyIts you of course my darling Dont you seeNo Its not meOf course it is Its my beautiful little angelBut daddy I dont look like this in glass  She calls the mirror a glass  I have blue eyes This girl has black eyes I have a mole on the cheek And my hair is black This girl has brown hair This is not me She was not lying I know her play face She was being earnest And she was describing Sarah my little sister who had suffocated to death in the attic  years agoWhile playing hide and seek with me When she was four years oldWe dont have any pictures of Sarah and there is no way my daughter wouldve known how she looked UnlessRight now I see my daughter standing in front of the mirror and talking to her reflection in her sweet voice I dont have the guts to see what she sees in the mirror Im scared For her For myself,The Reflection,11
WELVAERT,5,7,1r17ja,9,EDIT Some spelling mistakesHey guys Im going to tell three real and inexplicable occurrences that have happened to me so far in my short life Still a teenager These occurrences involve a sound or a sight being there that wasnt really thereI cant really explain anything that has happened here but I would like to share Here it isThe first time this had happened to me I was very young around  years old I was a confident little fellow and after a day of playing with my brother and such I decided to sleep in my sleeping bag on the rd floor of my dads house aloneSo as I am about ready to start dreaming with the moon out far and it being past my bedtime I suddenly hear a man whisper to meThe first time I had no idea what it said completely unclear So I freeze in pure horror until again he whispers to meIt still didnt say anything understandable but at this point I was calling out for help from anyone in the form of some weird exhale of a loud shriek That is really the best way to describe what I was doing I was afraid if I called Dad it would know I was trying to get away and it would hurt meSo then it whispers to me a little louder Noo no its okay shh shh as I scream for my dad as I remain frozen still from fear of moving a muscleMoments later my Dad rushes in to comfort me as there was nothing there I tell him what I heard and even having it being the breakfast table conversation the next morning my Dad was sure it was just my silly little childs mind playing gamesI slept in his bed that night I knew what happened was real it was so vivid and I still remember it all of these years laterThat was my first time experiencing something so inexpiable and supernatural the second time was during the middle of last SummerSo me being a stupid little fellow me and a friend of mine decided to stay up for  entire days straightIt was terrible in the first day we could barley keep our eyes open But coffee and monster pulled us through until the  hours were near overNearing the end  as we are in the last hours of sleeplessness I had walked in to my room and closed the door to do something that I dont recall It may have been to change clothesAs Im changing I started to hear the moaning and groaning of a person outside my windowI took a good look outside and saw no source of sound It didnt get louder when I had opened the window eitherI had then started to hear my shower turn on but when I opened my door to try and confirm someone was showering the noise stopped I had opened and closed my door a few times and the noise stopped and started along with the doorSo I finished whatever I was doing went in to the hallway and told my friend what happened  and that it was time to sleep I was exhausted and confused as hell maybe too tired to completely understand the fear I maybe should have been condoning But who knowsSo now comes for the most real and recent occurrence this only happened  weeks agoSo it was a Monday night with school being off for Tuesday I managed to get my dad to drop me off to meet up with some girl to meet up with Around  at night when he dropped me offThe night played through and it was eventually time for me to go Around midnight when I left  But luckily for me my ride fell asleep on me Mom  More of my fault for staying with her so lateSo I didnt want to make her parents take me home or make this anyone elses problem other than mine So me being very tired thought Eh Ill just walk it wont take THAT longSo I started off on my little long as fuck  adventure I walked and walked and about  minutes in around  AM Im walking by an elementary school in my neighborhoodEveryone I have told this to has not believed me So if you want to talk shit in the comments please dont waste your own timeThere was a leaf bag at the end of the street that connects with an intersection but I swear to my life the leaf bag had limbs was moving and was on a bikeI stared directly at it for moments at a time and it continued to ride the bike It rode the bike moving its limbs but it was not going anywhereSo I just kept walking Now pretty freaked out I start seeing black figures fly across my field of visionI just fucking ran because of that past the elementary school until I came across a giant parking lot for the church nearbySo I took a breath for a moment or two then I saw someone maybe  feet away It was a pretty normal sized person but it was wearing a full black coat I could see nothing but black on itThat just horrified me I ran even more because of the adrenaline rush seeing that thing gave me When I stopped running I could feel my pulse beat like drums It was so irregular and strange it would thump a few times stop for a few seconds and thump a few times again I never saw that someone againI was very close to home at this moment so I finished my  hour walk that lasted from AMAM within the next  minutes or so The moment I finally made it home was amazingI cant say I know what was going on that night or any of those times But I can ensure to you that these things all really happened I just cant explain how,It has happened  times,16
Cremewagon,1,4,1r15us,9,Im  years old and I have been suffering from chronic sleep paralysis for about  years now  I figured this would be a good place to recount some of the experiences Ive hadChicago   I was living with my girlfriend in a very tiny basement apartment  The apartment was dirty and had low ceilings  In our bedroom we had a bed and what was probably meant to be a closet in the corner of the room only there was no door on it and no light fixture  This corner of the room was always dark  My sleep paralysis dreams have always been vivid in the extreme  Every detail is captured exactly how it would be as if I was awake  It truly is impossible to tell the difference My first incident at the apartment was one night when I fell asleep to my girlfriend watching Bridezillas in the other room  I could see the light from the TV flashing under the doorway and hear the audio  Something was very wrong  I could sense a presence and I knew it was in the dark closetcorner of my room  It had not revealed itself but it was there  There is no fight or flight response in my very worst experiences  It is just distilled terror  I cannot move cannot breathe cannot scream  Thats when it comes out of the corner  It moves very quickly  Skittering almost  I can see flashes of pale skin and long dark hair  It is on the bed in seconds I can feel the weight of it tugging on the covers  Then it is on top of me  I cannot breathe and I am face to face with something so evil that it is seared into my memory  It is a woman only she has a tiny face her eyes are lambent green and she has draped her hair over me trapping me right next to her face  I can feel tiny puffs of stale breath on my cheek and the weight becomes unbearable  I scream and wake up  This happened a few times always the same woman  Sometimes she would crawl out of the corner and across the ceiling before dropping onto my bed  Sometimes she would just morph out of the shadows and appear on me  This happened numerous times at this location and then she just stopped showing up  After a year we moved to a slightly larger apartment a few blocks away from the Belmont stop  Sleep paralysis was very rare for me at this point  We had lived at this place for about two months when I had another episodeSecond Incident  I had just finished watching The Pixar Story on Netflix and had paused it on the credits and fell asleep with the lamp on beside me  I had fallen asleep on my recliner so I was sitting up which is strange because all of my other experiences I had been on my backWhen I wake up I see a massive being sitting next to me  To put him into scale I am sitting in the recliner and he is sitting on the ground  The top of his head is level with my chin  This would put him around  feet tall standing up  Not only that but there was an aura of power that was palpable and just emanated from it  Heit is resting there it is the color of black marble  I can see beads of perspiration on the skin  Whatever it is it is absurdly muscled and well defined  Every possible muscle is nearly bursting out of the black marble flesh  I can see the jugular vein in its neck beating with the pulse black blood pumping through the spiderweb of veins under its skin  I know now that it is a male  His eyes are closed but I know they are completely yellow if they were to open  I know that if I wake him I will die  I sit there and watch him he does nothing but breathe in and out as the perspiration rolls off his body  This goes on for fifteen minutes or soWhen I woke up from this one I had a deep sense that I had encountered something from another realm  That is really the only way to describe it  It was too real  Nothing in my room had changed The Pixar Story was still paused and my lamp was still on  But the presence of whatever I had just seen lingered for a long time  Another interesting thing about this one that sticks out  Ive never seen him again  He just showed up once  Which I thought was odd because something as vivid and unique as this entity seems like a perfect thing for the mind to hold onto and conjure up again  But its been close to four years now and I have not seen him a second time  I hope he never comes back honestlyThird Incident  And now my last one  This one happened three days ago  I live in an apartment in Licoln NE now and this is the first time it has happened here  I was laying on my side when I woke up for some reason my phone was on and the clock is showing  am  I live in the basement unit and there are orange sodium lights that shine into my room through the blinds  One of the blinds is slightly lifted because my roommate set her coffee there while she crocheted a scarf earlier  Her knitting stuff is still on the chair  At this point I start panicking because I cannot move and I know what is happening  There is a tapping on the window  Really quick light taps followed by some scratching  Like a cat is trying to get inside  The orange lights start casting some strange shadows on the floor and I can see something moving outside the window  It is moving with intelligence trying to figure out a way in  There are tiny puffs of humidity on the window too so I know something is breathing on it  At this point Im seriously trying to wake up because this is going to get very bad  It moves over to the far right part of the window and starts tapping and scratching again  Then it unlatches the window and opens it  A frail looking arm slips in  The skin is either dark dark green or black and slimy  The rest of it slips and it looks strangely catlike only minus the fur and it glistens in the orange of the sodium lamps  It just kind of sits there and stares at me with large pure black eyes  Then it runs at me only it moves without grace like stop motion gone wrong  I manage to turn my head and scream  When I wake up I am moaning quietly  What bothered me about this one though is that my phone was on and showing  am when I woke up  My phone had no reason to be on the only thing I can figure is that I bumped into it during the episode  So yup those are my stories and yes having these experiences have made it difficult to fall asleep some nights  Ive got a lot more of these experiences and Ill probably share them later but this is enough for now,I suffer from chronic sleep paralysis,13

,0,5,1qyqag,7,I was in a dark place I was  lonely tired of going to school and even more tired of having to follow the route my father laid out for me If I knew better Id have stuck to the path Id have gone to college that year Anyways it only took a sudden and intense realization to convince me I wanted a calm sure and safe lifeI had saved a few thousand dollars over my high school life I told my psychiatrist father I was going to travel the US and meet people and find myself He told me that he would wait here for me he was supportive and I left that night with a backpack and mind filled with new hope I hitchhiked for a few months from the west to the east coast I met new people like I hoped and met a girl names Karen Karen was like me and unlike me she left her home in Nevada to find herself also but she was very dismissive of authority I could tell she came from a rough background Nevertheless I fell in love with Karen We ended up making in to West Virginia I wasnt used to the cold coming from California but we weathered through and our common interest in the great outdoors brought us to the forests of Appalachia  We slept in a makeshift tent we made and traversed deeper into the forest together we felt safe and I became lost in her beauty Of course we didnt shower often and when we did we had to huddle for warmth after the cold river bath but I didnt mind Against my wishes we left the trails and traveled into the untouched wilderness we even saw a few old camps what looked to be moonshine stills I often woke up to the sound of birds chirping and the rushing of the river we followed deeper into the wilderness That morning however was silent and Karen was nowhere to be found my money was gone and so was most of my food all that was left was my ID and some clothes Our camp  looked like a bear had gone through it and the space blanket we used to sleep under was shredded everywhere I was freaked out and even more so that the scattered gear was leading in a general direction I followed the trail of detritus gathering my food and water my money and even Karens belongings I thought she had made out with my stuff and ran off leaving me in the wilderness but now it seemed like she was taken against her own will Well I followed the trail to a clearing surrounded by a rusted holed fence that looked about fifty years old The clearing was probably a hundred meters in diameter No roads led to it and in the middle of the clearing was a concrete cube with a rusty and half open metal door The gray cube was cracked with rebar sticking out and covered in ivy For a few minutes in contemplated leaving I had the items I needed to leave with my wits and my health but without my dignity I didnt think I loved her enough to go into the door let alone go farther into what I assumed was darkness I tested my flashlight and opened the door Immediately the smell of mold and basement was overwhelming I didnt think I could handle it so I wrapped a tshirt around my nose and mouth I looked around and into a concrete room about the size of a waiting room and a hallway leading to rock and cave I traveled further down the cave and it dripped with moisture and the walls were fungal I saw blood on the walls and a handprint that was recent and bloody Karens size I ran out of the cave I swore I heard the sounds of screaming as I ran out but it might have been mine I left the concrete rooms and closed the door I ran out of the forest taking catnaps where I could and called my father I couldnt be happier to use a payphone and I was flown home dirt and sores and all I cried in my fathers shoulders finally unnumb from the events that played out the day before I realized I didnt want adventure I didnt want excitement I never old anyone about what happened I went to college went to med school and became a surgeon I still have nightmares to this day Karen I assume survives only in my memories Theres one thing I saw though that will stay to me it will probably be my last memory before I die thats the creature I saw looking me dead in the eyes as I glanced from Karens bloody handprint to the dark path ahead Pale firmly attached to the ceiling of the cave with white eyes and black teeth shiny with sweat and glaring A primal beast it brought out primal fear within me and I ran the fastest I had I dont regret my cowardice I would probably be dead or worse if I went deeper into the cave ,My Dark Past In A Darker Cave,12

creativedoo,1,6,1qvngm,7,My reflection didnt start talking to me until one night as I was finishing up some research paper for English As I typed away I heard a barely audible sound of somebody hitting their knuckles on a glass surface I turned away from my unfinished paper and looked towards where I thought it might have come from The living room outside my bedroom was empty last time I remembered I lived in this apartment by myself After a few seconds of hearing nothing but the hum of my laptop and the sound of my own heartbeat I dismissed the noise and turned back to my paperAn hour into my homework I heard again a distinct sound of something tapping on glass Annoyed I get up and walk out of my room and into the living roomAlright I think to myself What the hell is that soundI heard it again as I scanned the surroundings checking the coffee table to see if anything had fallen off The air in the living room was still and the ceiling fan was turned off so it wasnt the wind moving things around As I looked around my attention was caught on my reflection in a large mirror that covered about a quarter of my living room wall There was a man standing there however as I stared at him for a long time I saw his arm rise up and fall on the mirror The noise made me jump The mans lips quivered his chest heaving as though trying hard to contain his emotions As I stared the mans lips movedGet me out He cried I want my body back I want my life He stopped to take a deep breathPlease for Gods sake let me out His body shook as he spoke staring directly at meI walked towards the mirror close enough to now see trails of wet lines running down his cheeks His brown curly hair was a mess in contrast to mine which I had combed this morning before heading to college I stared at his white tears stained tshirt which unlike mine looked as though it was never washed My lips widened to a grin This customer is very satisfied with his stay unfortunately No trade backs I said before making my way back to hi I mean my room And keep the tapping down Im inviting yo sorry my girlfriend over Wouldnt want to scare her away now would you  ,The Reflection,13
Chibler,5,1,1qve4k,6,Hunters say that there are two main causes for accidents in the field Stupidity and not wearing enough blaze But Ill tell you what all the blaze orange in the world couldnt have saved Mick a Cornell graduate expert marksman and my best friend Sometimes when I look back I think stupidity would have saved meI used to love the fall the leaves changed the weather mercifully became pleasantly brisk and provided relief from the sweltering Midwest summers Autumn meant bonfires and apple cider Beer and highschool football games from a school we had long since left behind In a sense we all felt young again We got rid of business clothes said fuck it to having a clean car tried to meld ourselves into the outdoors and tuned the radio to a country station Every fall weekend it was like this except for one special week which was the best of all Deer season We all took our vacations that week On Friday night before the season opened at sunrise we would all load up into the trucks and drive out to our buddy Chucks farm out in the country Prime buck territory with no one around It used to be a big ordeal but over the years the numbers had dwindled Pointers wife wouldnt let him go because I was there she thought I was trying to steal him It was sad the way she kept his balls in a vice And then there was Ricky he had a bad back Marty Joey Huston all the guys just kind of dwindled away That left me and Mick Chucks brother Damion was MIA and Chuck had to be away on business but was kind enough to let us use his land still So there we were Mick and I we had been best friends since kindergarten when he stood up on the bus an announced Im gonna marry Lauren Hoff I cried to my mom as soon as I got home my life was ruined She responded by setting up a play date we were friends for life after that We grew up together I told him when his girlfriends were being bitches he beat the shit out of a guy who hit me We took care of each other sometimes I think back and wish we had gotten married maybe this wouldnt have happened thenWe had cracked the first beer the second we were out of the truck that was about  AM on Friday I dont know how young we thought we were The whole night was pretty calm Finnally we decided to liven it up and go explore the hay loft we used to jump out of as kids We went into the barn and breathed in the musty smell of hay and old wood It was calming and pleasant We hung around in the stable for a while until Mick suddenly started running toward the ladder to the hay loft It was a foot race and one I couldnt miss I took off after him and started clambering up the ladder I was half way up when I realized that Mick had stopped Whoa creepy he said What I was dying to know what he was seeing Looks like Chucks got a squatter Mick said We went up and poked around nothing too sinister just some old beer cans and food wrappers with a makeshift bed of straw Homeless baby Jesus in the manger Mick quipped I socked his arm playfully We cleaned up the garbage and got out of there not worried at all things like this werent uncommon in the rural area It was getting cold out so we went back to the newer tin barn we were staying in We fired up Chucks wood burning furnace and settled in The place looked like a thin shack from the outside but inside it was decked out TV DVD player a small kitchen and even a real toilet So we spent most of that night hanging out in the shed talking and watching a movie or two We were a little drunk so when Mick asked me Why didnt we ever date I wasnt able to respond with anything witty or quick or even minority socially acceptable I just tried to get a few extra moments to think by chugging my beer which I needed up spilling down my front Youre cute when you do that he said and started to lean in BANG BANG BANG Somthing was beating on the outside of the shed behind us We both froze and slowly turned toward the rear wall when it happened again BANG BANG this time Mick let out a nervous giggle before we both jumped up simultaneously to grab our rifles The thing kept banging on the shed We didnt need to speak to communicate we both knew the building was secure we would just stay in here until the banging went away and come out in the morning We turned the TV down so no one could hear itAfter a few minutes the banging stopped We started to calm down but we kept our firearms loaded We eventually dozed off around  only to be rudely awoken by my alarm at  It was time to go out and get in The stands Walking to the stands was a mess they were deep in the woods but it was worth it to be able to hunt in such pristine wilderness our stands were about a mile apart but for the first five we walked together I wish we had owned an ATV but we were all purists at that time and we thought that was cheating Around mile three Mick suddenly stopped He paused and picked up his foot and looked at the bottom Son of a bitch he said looking at the mass of grey fur and entrails adhered to his boot by the aid of coagulated blood Looks like theres bobcats out I said as I looked at the mass of dead coyote on his boot treads The rest of the walk as uneventful I got to my stand saw Mick off and wished him luck I kept my eyes peeled for a couple hours before my eyelids began to droop I was almost at the point of dozing off when I was startled by a gunshot ringing in the distance Mick must have bagged one we wer pe the only ones out there Then again three successive shots Thats when I knew somthing was wrong Part two

httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqcrthedisappearanceofjoshuaauburnpartPart  June  Friday nightMy memories of what happened after getting caught in the avalanche are blurry at best I slipped in and out of consciousness multiple times When I was conscious I was only vaguely aware of what was going on around me I was unable to process things logically so the few memories I do have are nonsensical Over time however things became more and more clear I became aware that I was lying down with my leg propped upward supported by something I became aware of shapes moving in and out of my vision and I could hear voices over me saying things I couldnt completely understandI dont know how long I was in that state passing from unconsciousness to semiconsciousness All I know is that after a while once things became clear again I found myself lying in a hospital bed with my left leg set in a cast and held above my head There was a very dim light coming through the window which indicated that it was late I tried to prop myself up to see my surroundings better but was met with a sharp pain in my ribs I winced and slowly lowered myself back onto the bed when I heard a voice come from the side of the roomYou took a lot of damage from that fall You should probably rest a bit before you try to move aroundI turned my head toward the direction of the voice I saw a man standing a ways from my bed looking at me in concern He was tall and black with short black hair and a goatee He wore black clothing with a white clerical collar around his neck There must have still been some painkillers in my system as I needed to look at him for a long while before I could recognize the manMichael I askedHe smiled and walked up closer to my bed I see youre more or less normal again You were really out of it for a while there Every once in a while youd wake up and start muttering gibberish before you passed out again Honestly I was worried that you might have hit your head on the way downI imagine that those were just the effects of whatever drugs they put me on I responded How did I survive that fallAfter the mountain stopped shaking and the snow had settled I called the ambulance and told them to meet us at the base of the mountain I used the mountain climbing equipment you had me pack to climb off the trail and get you I pulled you back up to the trail and then carried you down to themI see I said I suppose I owe you a thank you then Well Im glad you feel that way because I have a few questions Id like answered he responded Such as I askedHe sighed Where to begin He stayed silent for a long time before saying Lets start simple You told me that religious artifacts repel entities in whatever form theyve taken And yet in that cavern the man simply swatted yours out of your hand Why is thatAhthat I responded That was a tactical error on my part Remember how I told you that the entity was controlling the mountain not the man Akhetamet was speaking through the man but was not actually possessing him The man was probably being influenced by Akhetamet in the same way that Pastor Richard was but he seemed to have a more significant connection to Akhetamet than Richard So when I held up the vial of holy water I was holding it up in front of a regular man not in front of the entity which is why it had no effectSo the man was acting of his own freewill Michael askedTo an extent yes I imagine that Akhetamet was giving him orders but he was not being made to follow them I was not fighting the entity in that cavern just a man that the entity was influencing Which reminds me were either of the other men foundPastor Michael shook his head gravely I told the authorities that there were two other men up there somewhere but as far as Im aware theyve yet to be found I imagine they were lost in the avalanche I see I said It is a shame that we couldnt save them They may have been acting somewhat of their own accord but in the end they were only pawns There was a long silence after that before I asked Is there anything else that you want explainedOh Im just getting started he replied Why didnt he kill us in that cave I mean he waited until after we were done with the exorcism to start the avalanche If he could have done that the entire time why wait until thenI think the most likely reason is that he had not taken us as a serious threat Doing what he did must have taken an incredibly large amount of energy He wouldnt have wanted to waste that much energy if he thought he could kill us just as easily by throwing his follower at us Or perhaps he had some ulterior motive I can only guess at his reasoningPride before a fall he muttered to himself There was another shorter silence before Michael asked Who is HEI responded with complete honesty I have absolutely no ideaYou said youd heard of HIM before Michael askedOnly once Another entity had mentioned HIM  many years back If I had to guess I would say that HE is simply another entity One whom the other entities hold in high regard Almost like their own Messiah But other than that I can conclude nothingAnd do you think that Akhetamets threat is something we should take seriously That HE really is coming  I dont know but from what Ive heard the entities certainly seem to think that HE is coming Whether HE is a real threat or not I do not know I will have to report this incident to my agency If there is any genuine threat we will look into itI could tell that he was dissatisfied with that answer but he seemed to understand that this was the best answer he was going to get He leaned back against the wall to my right side What exactly is your agency he asked Do you all work for the governmentMy branch of the agency works with the United States government We provide protection from entities and in turn the United States government offers us its support when it is needed We are however an international group with no ties to any one government  Having full governmental support is useful when we need to keep certain matters under the rug Or when I need to bully uncooperative police officers into assisting meIf what youre saying is true then why dont more people know about this Why isnt this information about entities public he askedMy agency is of the opinion that any information involving the existence of entities should be kept on a needtoknow basis I personally believe that we should make our information public but I do not rank high enough for my opinion to be worth anythingThis is a lot to take in he said Although I suppose that based off of everything Ive seen I cant really doubt your wordTheres something else you should be aware of I said You also are not at liberty to share this information with anyone Im going to have to report to my agency that youre aware of the reality of entities now Because of that theyre going to be watching you carefully If you say the wrong thing to the wrong person Im afraid you may face someconsequences I do apologizeMichael sighed and glanced out the window It was dark now and was probably very late He looked at his watch and then he began putting on his coat The doctors say that if you think you feel well enough you can leave tomorrow afternoonTomorrow Theres nothing more they need to do I askedThey said that the injuries werent as bad as they could have been and apparently the procedures for patching you up were simple enough If you want I can come by when they release you and drive you back to your motel Ill take your offer Except for one thing dont take me to the motel I would like you to drive me to the bus stationWhat Youre leaving already he askedMy job here is done I have no further reason to delay Plus the sooner I report to the council about HIM the sooner they can begin looking into itMichael nodded If you say so Ill stop by the motel tomorrow morning and gather your stuff for youThat would be very helpful Thank youWithout any further words Michael walked out the door and leftI woke up early the next morning The suns morning rays were shining through my window illuminating the room with their dull light I tried to sit up before remembering that my leg was still propped up above my head Realizing that the endeavor would be fruitless I again laid my head down on my bed I had not been awake for two minutes before a nurse walked into my roomMr Sloan you have a visitor I informed them that it was early and that you might not be awake but if you feel up to it I can show them inIts alright with me I responded curious as to who would be visiting me at this hour Michael would be coming later so it seemed unlikely that it would be him When the nurse went to open the door I was surprised to see Nancy walk into the roomWhy Mr Sloan Youre quite a wreck I had heard that you were hurt but I hadnt expected you to be in this bad of a condition Are you feeling okay She seemed different For the first time since I had arrived her hair was clean and neatly combed There were no longer heavy bags under her eyes and from what I could tell her eyes were no longer red from her constant crying But there was something else about her still She no longer looked as fragile as she had before In all of my previous conversations with her she looked as if the wrong word could cause her to burst into hysterics Now though that aspect of frailty was nowhere to be seen Yes Im feeling fine Nancy I respondedIm very glad I heard about the avalanche last night and I came as soon as I could Is there anything I can do for you she askedNo I should be alright I respondedThere was a brief silence before she asked hesitantly What were you and Pastor Michael doing up on that mountain anyway I knew from the way she asked that she partially expected the answer I was going to give herWe were looking for JoshuaOh I see she said She hesitated again before asking Andand did you find anythingIn my line of work I have had to tell many people too many people that their loved ones had died It is not something you can ever get used to and it is not something that ever becomes easier I knew that now was the time to tell her but the words caught in my throat I had already caused her so much pain led her on to believe that Joshua was still alive and now I had to take all the hopes I had given her and crush them I had not said anything yet I couldnt bring myself to There was a brief silence before Nancy finally said Please Mr Sloan Im ready Hes dead Nancy Joshua Auburn is deadI turned away from her then I expected sobs the same hysterical weeping I had heard from her before Instead I heard a voiceIts notits not your fault Mr Sloan Sometimessometimes things like this justhappen and theres Her voice broke as she said this last part Theres just nothing you can do about it It was at that moment that she wept She covered her mouth with her hand and quietly sobbed at my bedsideHow long she remained there I do not know After a time though the tears stopped She sniffed a few times and pulled out a tissue to wipe her eyes I turned to face her then Her mascara had run down her face and her eyes were red but there was something in her face now that I hadnt seen beforeWhen I looked into her eyes I saw pain grief sorrow but I also saw courage I have seen many families who have had to deal with the loss of a loved one but have never experienced such tragedy myself I have always assumed that accepting something like that understanding that you would have to live the rest of your life without that person and then doing so is an act that requires the utmost courage It was that courage that I saw in Nancys eyes nowIt was then that I discovered the other part of Akhetamets influence The part I had not considered before Perhaps he was right when he said that people had made their own idols but he had made it impossible to let go of those idols When Akhetamet had been in power Nancy would never have been able to accept Joshuas death She would never have been able to live her own life without him But now she could move onDo you honestly believe that your actions will make a difference if they succeed Akhetamet had askedAs I looked up at Nancy finally able to truly accept her loved ones death and finally able to move on I knew that I truly had made a difference in at least one persons life And in the end isnt that enoughShe stood up after that and apologized for taking up my time We exchanged a few more words before she started heading for the door Before she left she turned and looked at me one last time Mr SloanI looked up at herThank you For everythingWithout another word she walked out the door and closed it behind herShortly after Nancys departure the nurses began preparing me for my departure I put on the clothes I had worn yesterday and was given crutches to use for getting out the door Just as he had promised Michael was waiting outside in his car I thanked the nurses and the doctors for their services and made my way outBy the time we reached the station we had not said a single word to each other I got out of the car and he carried my luggage for me to the bus We said our goodbyes to each other but before I left there was one more thing to doI handed him an envelope and told him to take it to the police station for meWhats inside he askedIts simply a statement by my agency stating that Joshua Auburn and Pastor Richard Smith are to be considered dead and there is to be no further investigation into their disappearancesThe full support of the United States government comes in handy now and then doesnt it he askedYou have no ideaI boarded the bus with my luggage and took a seat near the back The bus left the station after a few more minutes I spent most of the trip thinking about one thing that Akhetamet had saidHE is going to rise and tear this world apart We are all going to cross from our hellish world and kill every living thing that walks in this worthless universe until there is nothing left aliveAs a field worker my job is generally to react to supernatural scenarios When entities cross over it is my job to deal with them But the problem that often arises is that by the time I can react somebody will have gotten hurt In this case it was Joshua Auburn and countless others who had suffered because of my agencys reaction time But now we knew of the threat beforehand Now we knew that something was coming and we could act to stop it before it arrived As the bus drove away from the small town one thought crossed through my mindThe time for reacting was over Now the hunt had begunThis is the final part of The Disappearance of Joshua Auburn I tried to explain everything as best I could but if there is something that I mentioned in this account that any of you still have questions on please ask me in the comments I would be more than willing to answer them to the best of my abilities,The Disappearance of Joshua Auburn Part ,19
DistortedColours,7,8,1qt656,7,Alright Ive never used this thing before Hell I made an account just to share this with you guys Lets hop right into it I started to date this girl named Eowyn Im a total Lord Of The Rings fan of course So her name was the first thing that caught my attention Now her appearance Was interesting She looked like a walking doll of sorts Pale skin long almost unnaturally black hair with bangs that cut just right above her eyes Small lips She always wore bright red lipstick so she looked like she was pouting  of the time Eowyn had a dainty figure I guess we could call it Everything about her was petite Now her eyes They were beautiful but terrifying Those things are gonna haunt my dreams for the rest of my life She had large almond shaped eyes topped of with thick eyelashes One eye was impossibly blue The other Grey Almost silver This story of what happened is going to seem rushed I know it is But guys Im seriously terrified I need your help Eowyn Damn She was the definition of perfect Absolutely adorable Or so I thought Let me catch you up I met her at some cheap wannabe Starbucks here in my hometown I go in there every day before work and order the exact same thing New girl Now I live in a pretty small town I think it wouldve been pretty safe to say I knew everybodys name And if someone moved in news wouldve spread around pretty fast That smirk she gave me when I stuttered with my usuallyautomatic order Damn it I wish I wouldnt have become so used to it I got my drink though And headed to work I didnt get anything important done and bossman was pissed What can I say I was smittenThe story is pretty boring for a little while I go back use my smooth words and pick up Eowyns number Cool We texted for a little while and started dating Everything was normal right It was a month or so when I asked her to move her stuff to my place She refused my help when I offered She wouldnt even tell me her address I thought it was odd but hell This girl was perfect Who was I to question it As a male living off of minimum wage in his midtwenties I was not the one to be turning away girls She had a few things She brought in maybe three boxes All with clothes Well With the exception of one It was a medium sized velvet box with a lock on it I havent seen a key for it And right now I dont know if I want to know whats inside  We lived happily for a little while I got a promotion and was making more money To celebrate I took Eowyn out for a little something special I bought her the nicest engagement ring I could afford with an emerald on the center She wasnt a girl for diamonds And she loved anything green Anyways I took her out to dinner then outside of the coffee shop which we met at I did the whole romantic Look over there  got down on one knee and proposed She said yes And what happened then isnt something Id like to share with reddit Thats bedroom businessNow were at three months in Everything was going great Right here is when I began something I should never have done I was thinking too much And I noticed something This girl had no imperfections At all From her flawless skin to her personality She never got mad Ive never seen her mad The more I thought about it the crazier it drove me Her perfection was beginning to terrify me Ive spent too much time thinking about it and I began to try to push my limits with her Drinking more often staying out later talking about my exes Nothing seemed to phase her Hell She spoiled me when I had terrible hangovers and worked extra hours and over her weekends to make up for the money I was losing by staying home Despite her working more she continued to seem so full of energy As I think back on it I dont think Ive ever seen her sleep Even when we lay down to go to sleep at night together Im always the first asleep Maybe she just fell asleep after I did and woke up before me I dont know Now were at a week ago It was around midnight I think I was sitting at the dining room table with a cold glass of beer Eowyn was at work on a night she was supposed to have stayed home I couldnt stop thinking about her The more and more I thought about it The less she seemed human to me At first I passed it off as reading too many scary stories I snapped I felt something inside finally break And Im beginning to think it was my sanity When youre going crazy you can feel it I knew what I had to do when she lay down for bed that night I waited I stayed up and waited She came home around three when her shift ended AM I think was the exact time I made the biggest mistake of my life I thought it was about time to find out for sure if she was humanI grabbed the biggest most sharp knife I could find in our kitchen and snuck into our bedroom She looked asleep I gently crawled onto our bed and found myself staring at her face The moonlight flooding in from the open window was enough to light up her face She seemed to glow I grinned like a madman This is the part I grew to regret I raised the knife above my head both hands clasped around the handle as I plunged it into her chest Her eyes shot open Her gaze flickered between curiosity and betrayal before rolling into the back of her head showing only the whites Blood spurted out instantly a red stream of it pouring out of her chest and over her dress I was sure to have hit her heart at least three times I rose the knife and plunged again and again and again countless times I plunged the knife into her chest I laughed like a mad man the whole time as blood spurted from her lifeless body I stopped for just a moment looking at her blood soaked dress I smiled I felt like I had overcome something that had been weighing me down I leaned down placing a kiss on her still warm lips I lay the knife down on our nightstand before lowering myself onto the bed falling asleep next to herI could finally be normal againDamn I could not have been anymore wrongI woke up around ten in the morning to the smell of breakfast Remembering what I had done the previous night I shot up staring at the space next to me where Eowyns body should have been The only thing in her spot were the bloody sheets I jumped out of bed and ran into the kitchen I stood there dumbfounded Eowyn was at the stove functioning perfectly making breakfast just as she usually does I flinched as she went to turn around expecting multiple gashes in her chest There were no marks there As if shed never been hurt She smiled at me holding out a plate of food I stared at her not sure what to do I waited just a moment before reaching out and taking the plate I ate my food hesitantly not being able to tear my gaze away from her chest Not because Im a pervert but because there should be cuts there We went about our day as normal As normal as I could considering she should be deadI lay down that night with her by my side I was terrified to be by her but grateful at the same time I fell asleep quickly I was rudely awaken some time in the middle of the night by a nasty crack noise that echoed in the room I groaned and rolled over checking the time by habit I watched the clock turn to  I rolled back over moving my arm to wrap around Eowyn to hopefully get back to sleep My heart starting racing immediately when I realized she wasnt there By instinct I turned my gaze to the door of our bedroom which was cracked open for some reason The hallway light was on which was abnormal because Eowyn liked to sleep in the house as dark as we could get it I squinted seeing my fiances figure in the doorway It reeked of dried blood and rot I suppressed a gag as I pretended to be asleep She was wearing the same gown as the night I tried to kill her Even in the small amount of light I could see her torn dress and the gashes in her chest I slowly brought my hand over to our nightstand only rubbing my fingers against the drying blood where the knife had been I looked from my hand to her noticing her small hands were wielding the weapon She just stayed in that position and I watched her silently I mustve passed out because the next thing I knew is it was around eleven in the morning the sun was out and the smell had disappeared I jumped out of bed and looked out the window Our car was gone I looked on the nightstand and picked up a neatly folded letter It was just like her to leave me notes when she had to run unexpected errands I didnt know what I was supposed to do I couldnt call the cops Either I would get sent to jail for attempted murder or I would get sent to a nuthouse I fucked around on the internet all day that day and went to sleep before she came home I woke up at the same time I did the night before to the same noise I instantly knew what had to be happening The smell of rust and rot were stronger than they were before I looked at the door to our room it was closed this time I let out a breath of relief too soon Then something told me to turn my gaze toward our closet The light was on illuminating the room Eowyn stood there her head cocked to the side at impossible angles She had a sinister grin on her face I was happy to see that her hair was covering her face I didnt want to look at those eyes Her dress seemed to be stained with fresh blood and the red liquid was dripping off of the knife on to the floor Something about this told me this blood was not her own I was terrified but paralyzed with that fear Just like what happened before I passed out eventually has she had not moved from her spot She was gone that morning too I picked up the paper that day reading that my exthe one I talked about most frequently had been murdered in her sleep around AM that night Something inside of me told me I knew who did thisNow were at yesterday night I lay down as usual I woke up again but the smell was unbearably strong My stomach churned I instantly realized that my bedroom door and my closet door were both open and both lights were on I slowly turned my head to the side the best I could trying to seem like I were still asleep My eyes trailed down to the foot of my bed and what I saw I bit back a scream There was Eowyn Something about the moonlight from the window reflecting off of her skin made her face seem eerily beautiful What I saw is something I will never forget Eowyn was there knife in one hand leaning over the edge of our bed just slightly Her head was cocked to the other side a proud grin on her face She looked like a child who had just won something at the fair In her other hand she held up the head of my ex Pure terror seemed to be frozen on Samanthas face Where her head should have been connected to her neck blood was dripping from the inside onto the covers Needless to say I didnt sleep that night I know I didnt I blinked And Eowyn was gone And the smell had faded into something much more dull I didnt move from my spot until the sun had come up I looked on the nightstand to see that Eowyn left me another note telling me work had called her in and she wouldnt be home until very late tonight I jumped up and ran into the bathroom puking numerous times Right after I threw our sheets in our cheap washer and got online Im flinching at every noise the house makes I dont know what to do Im at a loss reddit Please help me,Dolly Girl I need your help reddit,15

Bakaflocka,1,5,1qyq9p,4,Before I begin I want to make it a point that this is my first time posting in Nosleep I have been an avid lurker and strive to write half as well as the majority of you so I apologize for runon sentences  any grammatical errors and mistakes typos  This is unintentionally very long and I will try to defuse any confusion with horizontal breaks as I am not very format savvy I have had a few paranormal instances but this one is a mixture of paranormal and just creepycreepycreepy I dont know how else to explain it so Ill start with my story    I have never been fond of moving though I doubt anyone ever truly is   Still getting a new place meant the next step for my boyfriend and I in our then three year relationship and I should have been happier or at least a bit more enthusiastic about the situation but we were constantly together anyways so perhaps I didnt consider it a huge deal in the first place And while I despised the thought of moving and having to buy any additional furniture I was looking forward to the househunting process    We met Jenny a midfortysomethingyearold  woman who had been in the realestate business for as long as she could remember in the middle of November  there were leaves sprinkled in the front lawns of all the potential residents that never seemed to meet any of our requirements By this point the thrill of househunting  was starting to fade away from my short list of interests and lose all its fun in the process Admittedly this was also around the time that my boyfriend and I began to argue near constantly  usually hed leave in a huff up until then I was only twenty and living with my parents and I started to doubt even wanting to move in with him We couldnt even agree on a place together how was this ever going to work Apparently I was too picky and unrealistic but then again hes always been the sort of guy that doesnt heed warnings or care all too much about the  aesthetics of things I guess most guys are like that though  so when we found  he had already settled and I was less than content      was small and blue two things which I dislike as is but immediately came to despise because of the combination Aside from being aesthetically displeasing it looked worn down and isolated The house itself was built fairly recently or at least it was recent enough according to my boyfriend and located at the corner of a narrow street that seemed to wind down a small hill and lead to a series of speed humps before it was met by a stop sign and a few other homes that were maybe about seventy feet away The area was quiet but showed a slight resemblance to the neighborhood in Halloween There was one tree inconveniently placed right besides the garageless driveway so you had to be super careful not to open your car door too far or else youd have to pay out the ass for vehicle damages on your insurance     Now the layout of the house was pretty odd and overwhelming in itself overwhelming in the sense that once you opened the front door you were greeted by an individualonly  hallway that took a  sharp right turn to the master bedroom which had a large window facing the frontyard cold hardwood floors and blue painted walls There was a bathroom connected to the back of the master bedroom and it was the only newly renovated  part of the structure  the reason behind this would be soon revealed months later by  our realtor Jenny It looked as if a bathtub had been there once before  but had been removed in the reconstruction replaced by a glasspanel shower Jenny looked down at the file and s blueprints rubbing her chin with her freehand and stifling an hardly audible Hm in a tone I found quite suspicious At this point I was ready to leave completely unsold by everything I had seen so far and finding myself very cold despite the three layers and University hoodie I had thrown on to protect myself against the strong winds but I couldnt tame my curiosity so I spoke up and asked her what she had been so suddenly vocal about There wasnt always marble in this bathroom So I thought you said the bathroom was redone my boyfriend seemed to read my mind and speak up this time beating me to the punch I didnt really find anything odd about Jennys point from her comment giving a roll of my shoulders as I listened to my heeled boots clank against the floor I like the marble Its probably the only thing I like about this place I was clearly agitated and not very amused and when Im hungry theres no taming the beast  It showed in my tone My boyfriend was quick to snap back We havent even seen all of it yet The tension in the air was rising and Jenny had probably picked up on that and how restless I was getting so before my boyfriend and I could begin arguing right  in front of her she led us out of the master bedroom and back into that onepersonatatime hallway where we followed her down another sharp turn this time it was to the left five feet away from the master bedroom onto the kitchen The kitchen was blue and where the paint didnt cover the walls mirrors did Big Blue Nation yall I chirped clearly amused by my own idiotic joke its a saying that my universitys rival loves to throw around constantly    Wow Bakaflocka my boyfriend  stifled a chuckle but not before scoping out the room It was tiny like the rest of the house and there was a bar that was just big enough for two chairs The appliances were up to date but I was getting really tired of all the blue Jenny must have too because she led us back down the hall  there were three doors remaining one that opened to an airplanesized bathroom one to a closet where the owners or guests could hang up their coats and another that looked like a closet but took you down to the basement The basement was essentially the living room since the first floor only offered the master bedroom master bath kitchen guest bathroom and closet Here is where things become very fuzzy First I remember the ceiling of the living room was very low and there was only one switch  there was no lighting but rather a plug where they had put a lamp And again the walls were blue I wanted to puke Either the previous owners thought the color was really calming or they decorated every room with Wildcats gear Only a small sofa and big screen TV was required to fill up the entire room in the limited space in the basement I remember I had a hard time breathing and could hear every little sound in the houseWhat caught my attention next is what I hated the most about that place The stairs that led to the basement were steep and narrow and I had to wait a few minutes before following my boyfriend and our realtor down or else my sense of claustrophobia would kick in  once at the bottom of the stairs we found ourselves in another hallway though this one was wide enough so that my boyfriend and I could stand by one another and it led either straight ahead or immediately to the left where the living room was Straight ahead was the unfinished parts of the basement Now Im sure you all know what unfinished basements look like but if you dont let me be the first to tell you that they are most always really creepy Hell my finished basement at my parents creeped me out and it was really  nice There was no switch to flip on any lights but there were two porcelain sockets with pullstrings one as soon as you walked in and one in the far back that Jenny tested neither turned on Does anyone have a flashlight shed ask quizzically and while I didnt have a flashlight per se I was quick to yank out my Samsung Galaxy and tap my flashlight app on Immediately I saw something that I wish I never had Unlike every other room in the house  the walls were stone but there was red A lot of red mixed with orange and yellow and black At one point there was green and that was alright  but the red There was so much almost as much as all the blue they had on the walls I held my phone over my head and made my way down the room There were drawings Doodles from what appeared to be a child anywhere between the ages of  to  But the more I scoped down the room the more the images in the drawings became increasingly darker the only green there was was used for your generic field of grass There were butterflies and smiling faces underneath a very bright yellow sun with sunglasses on Like a chain of events or a series of comics the images changed The sun in the next image had no sunglasses but a content look on its face It started off pretty happy Then the sun had wide eyes outlined in black with  red veins like he had been up all night and was waiting for the moon to cover his shift and let him rest Eventually his eyes were outlined and filled with black Inevitably the sun became entirely black in itself Then there were figures Creepy figures in black who wore red clothes But they werent clothes They were blood Someone was really high my boyfriend seemed unphased but I was petrified There were a few  poems about love and some were of course expectantly depressing I saw something that creeped me out more than the rest Wash away the blues Dont you know everyone looks better in red And there was an handprint smeared in a very odd shade of crimsonI swallowed hard looking at my boyfriend who had been standing besides me at this point Again he didnt look very bothered The odd thing was Jenny never made it past the entrance of the unfinished basement standing by the washing machine and dryer These will be here she pointed out before I stopped dead in my tracks There had only been the three of us but I heard a knock on the door No one spoke up There was another knock Still nothing Whos at the door I finally asked turning to the others but they both gave me a look like We didnt hear anything I was starting to lose my fucking mind so instead I opted for I guess weve covered everythingAfter we made our way back upstairs my boyfriend decided to check out the master bedroom one more time I told him I would warm up the car and wait there to which he  hesitantly agreed to I knew he was going to ask if I wanted to check it out one more time before making my decision but my decision on that place was already made up I hugged Jenny goodbye and offered my thanks watching her pull out of the driveway so we wouldnt be blocked and go on her way there was a lockbox on the door so we didnt need to worry about locking up after ourselves she already did so I saw the lights turn on into the master bedroom and while it was hard to see because of the obscured vision of that inconveniently planted tree I figured it was my boyfriend looking out the large window and waving at me God hes such a nerd I thought to myself as I waved back with a cheesy grin Afterwards I beckoned him to come on out so we could leave and sighed in relief as he dropped the blinds and shut off the light FINALLY I assumed hed come right out  it  took no more than a minute to go from the master bedroom to the front door but five minutes had already passed I finally decided to call him something didnt feel right it felt like the phone was beeping forever before he answered Where are you Im starving I was fighting back my urge to yell I thought I heard you walking around upstairs so I called you to come back down and check this out but you never did He was at the passenger door and I grunted I didnt come back inside I thought I told you to come on out when you opened the blinds and waved at me I huffed I didnt open the blinds and wave at you I felt my stomach drop like I was coming out of my seat on Space Mountain in Disney World WhatThe phone rang just as I turned my head over my shoulder to pull out of the driveway it was starting to rain and my eyesight isnt as acute as I would like it to be during bad weather What is it now I muttered looking to my boyfriend as he picked up I saw his lips mouth Jennys name and then a look of pure horror come over his facials It was a short conversation but I remember itching for him to end it sooner so I could turn on the radio and listen to some music to calm my nerves about the weird chain of events Apparently the bathroom was renovated because the previous owner committed suicide They were a schizophrenic patient and lived by themselves All of this was too much I dont want to talk about it I immediately blurted I feel sick and I just want to listen to music and drive I cant believe he didnt lecture me for going so fast on the road but I literally felt like pulling over every five seconds to vomit I remember telling him to touch the knob to the radio and turn it on and he blindly agreed knowing just how upset I had been Music is a remedy to some right The radio gave off an odd static sound before blaring Im Blue by Eiffel In short Looking to purchase a house together with my boyfriend While Im picky hes not Hes sold on a tiny and ugly blue house All the walls are blue except for the ones in the unfinished basement there are very weird doodles from an adult  images ranging from PG to completely deranged Hear knocks and someone else in the house ,I have always hated blue,9

snerualtrepelol,9,17,1qw83e,7,This story takes place over some period of timeIt starts when i was about  years old im  now The whole family was gathered at my grandparents place My grandfather who was a policeman in the Netherlands and a loving grandfather and husband liked to go to the Indonesian islands He had many friends there The one day we were gathered at his house he told us he had gotten a knife Or rather some kind of ceremonial dagger named a Keris This is a special kind of knife it is said that a spirit lives in every one of these knives and they can be either good or bad spirits My grandfather told us that when he died the knife had to go back to the man that he got it from because it belonged to that Indonesian mans familyTwentytwo years later my grandfather died We made plans for going to Indonesia to bring back the knife The family couldnt come to an agreement of who would go and how so no plans were made in the end The knife ended up in a box in a closet at my parents house and was forgottenI lived together with my girlfriend at the time My mom called me told me that there was strange stuff happening in the house Clocks stopped working the alarm clocks of my parents were set to different times one small clock that never worked started working all of a sudden All the usual paranormal stuff I come from a police family my dad is a high ranking dude with the police as well as is my brother and my sister so we are very sceptic about all the paranormal stuffUntil my mom woke up one night from the sound of a piece of paper being wrapped to a ball asif someone wanted to throw it in a bin She listened but there was no other sound and she went back to sleepThe next day she opened her closet and was shocked to see that all her clothes that were on coathangers had been moved to the sides Only one jacket that was on a hanger was turned to face my mom and there was a wrinkled piece of paper on the clotheshanger that wasnt there before She recognised it it was an A size piece of paper with a certain smell that would repel moths she had put some of these papers between the clothes in the closetBut not on this jacket And she had not wrinkled itWhen she told me this story on the phone she told me that she wanted to get a houseclearer A person who cleans the house of all the spirits that might be there But i have a friend i will use the name Margaret for her who is very sensitive and can communicate with spirits I said maybe we should get her into the house first to see who or what the spirit is My mom agreedMargaret came by a couple of days later She felt a weird presence but couldnt quite put her finger on it she couldnt identify it Then i remembered the knife It had been in a box in the same closet I got the knife from the box and handed it to her She strongly felt the energy that came from the knife But there was also another energy in the house and connected to the knife Maybe it was my grandfather who wanted to let us know that we had to get the knife back to where it belongedShe told us the person who gave the knife to my grandfather did not have long to live I thought this was a cliché thing to say sceptic as i was Ofcourse i did not say that out loud I did question out loud though because the person who gave my grandfather the knife was around  years old We had read correspondence between him and my grandfather so we knew a little bit about himAll in all we decided that we shoud at least send this man in Indonesia a letter telling about the passing of my grandfather and to ask about the knifeTwo weeks later we got a reply He thanked us for sending the letter and was sad that my grandfather died He told us that my grandfather did not get the knife from him but from his grandfather And that he was extra sad because the day he got our letter his grandfather died This was a strange coincidence to me He also said that the knife was a gift and you should not give back gifts Unless we really wanted to But the knife was ours The spirit inside the knife was a good oneI decided to keep the knife Not in a box but on a small altar in my sleeping room The hauntings in the house of my parents have stopped after thisThen the strange stuff with the knife happened The altar was on a side of my room behind my bed so it was a part where i never walked or whatever So i couldnt have knocked it or touched it whatever Very often when i would enter my room the knife would be in a different position on the altar Sometimes i could even see the former place where it had been in the small layer of dust that was on the altar It even stood upright against the wall one timeNow i have moved and have deciced to hang the knife on the wall It hangs there with other knives It has not moved since But i know for sure that i will never put it back in to a box This knife will be part of the rest of my life and is part of our family history My mom keeps the wrinkled piece of paper as evidence or just as a reminder,The Grandfather Knife that braught a haunting to our house,24
EngulfedByDarkness,10,5,1qviq3,4,  One day my brother came home and began to tell me of his crazy night He said that he had fiddled with a Ouija Board I told him to tell me more and this is what happened Him and his buddies went down to the graveyard and contacted spirits for an innocent conversation One of his friends began to panic after getting some morbid responses and suggested the group go somewhere else   The others agreed and got into my brothers car and drove off The group pulled up at a stop sign the cars headlights glared upon two figures sitting on the curb of the sidewalk One was a boy and one was a girl both appeared to be very pale with a blank facial expression They cocked their heads up and stared directly at my brother and his friends Everyone froze and didnt say a word some even looked over at each other to see if they could see what the other was seeing   After a good wait at the stop sign my brother sped off and they all talked about what they had saw After hearing this story from my brother I became very interested in the fact of contacting spirits through the Ouija Board The following day my brother promised to show me it and how it works After the day of school went by I came home and did my homework as usualthe day went by pretty quickly and before I knew it it was  AM   My brother texted me and we had our rendezvous downstairs We took the board out of its case and sat it down on the floor The Planchette sat on top of the board Its rubber stoppers held it firmly against its surface With a courageous tone I asked a question Is anyone there  We both waited a couple seconds and got no reply He gave it a go and asked Is there anyone there who would like to make contact with us After about  minutes of waiting we got no answer I thought it was a hoax but he suggested we try it in a different room We walked back upstairs and tried the board in his room same scenario played out and after about  minutes we received no reply  At this point I knew it was all smoke and mirrors but he suggested we try it in my room and if we got no reply we could call it quits We both sat on my bed with the board on our knees I asked a question Is there anyone here with us In about  minutes we got a reply saying Yes I immediately said to my brother that he was moving it His finger tips were barely touching the planchette and I was completely in awe I could not believe it we were actually talking to something that was along the Astral Plane   Most of the spirits we talked to that night could never say their name Wed usually get responses such as myjda or nonojh We had no idea what these names meant so we assumed they were just confused or had a lack of energy communicating with us We called it a night and my mind was awake and full of wonder My chest was tight from the whole experience and I felt as if I had a presence with me I blamed it on anxiety and went to bed  I awoke at  AM for another day of school and the tightness was gone On the bus I immediately told both of my friends about the experience and how incredible it was My one friend Tyler was somewhat intrigued but wanted to see it to believe it My other friend Sam wanted nothing to do with it At the end of the day I asked Sam and Tyler if they wanted to come over so I could show them the board both of them agreed and came over around  PM  We all sat on my bed and I put the board between me and Tylers knees Sam only wanted to watch due to the fact she thought something would follow her In simpler terms she was afraid We began to move the planchette in a circular motion to make a portal I then asked the question Is anyone here with us After asking if anyone was there we got an immediate response saying Yes We asked extremely personal questions such as Do you know youre dead Are you an evil spirit Can you touch my arm  Of course at this time I never knew that asking these questions could be taken as either a threat or open a gateway from their world into ours Thankfully the spirit said No to all three questions and we ended the session Sam spouted out You guys are moving it I decided to up the ante Why dont you try it then See for yourself She took me up on my offer and I sat the board on our laps we both put our hands on the planchette and as usual we began to make a circle to open the portal Once again I asked the general question Is there anyone here with us  I made sure my fingertips were light on the Planchette doing this let the spirit put more energy into it thus showing Sam it couldnt of been me As expected we got an immediate response of Yes We asked questions about ourselves such as our sexual orientations and how many dates weve had The spirits answers were dead on accurate and it really shut us up We asked for a name but the spirit seemed to be shy and refused to tell us   I asked if we could just call the spirit Buddy and it replied Yes Little did we know is that this spirit was a one of a kind After chatting with the spirit for over an hour we figured out she was an angel named Caroline She promised to watch over us and protect us from evil spirits She proved she was an angel due to the fact I asked if she was able to make it very sunny outside moments after requesting it shined a warm sunny ray through my window  It was one of the best experiences Ive ever had in my entire life At the very end of the session Sam was still on edge about if it was real or not So she told me to ask Whats her name Referring to Sam Without hesitation it immediately spelled out SAM The look on her face was mortified   Caroline said goodbye and we ended the session After that I havent touched it since and I honestly dont intend to I promised Caroline wed talk to her from time to time and she promised she would always be available to talk Ive had many encounters with evil spirits when using the board in some occasions I would have to flip the board Strange occurrences also happen throughout my house within different time durations  Today I was in the shower and I heard a loud bang on the door this was about  hours ago I hopped out of the shower and checked if anyone was there as usual no one I will continue to update everyone on the strange occurrences         Also if you want to use the Ouija Board do not be afraid too It is very safe just make sure you read up on it first before doing so Never challenge the spirits and always ask before each session that you wish to communicate with good spirits and good spirits only This is a TRUE story and I hope you all enjoyed My First Ouija Board Experience,My Ouija Board Experience,9
MissGhost,2,9,1quu66,7,Wales is known to be a strange country and having grown up there I can vouch for that When I was  the village where I grew up was still pretty isolatedthe access wasnt as good as it is today and as a result it was  a pretty tight community Everyone knew everyone and their businessif you didnt speak Welsh then youd get ignored in the pub I was seeing a guy whose Dad ran the local taxi firmless of a taxi firm and more of a one man band He had a car and if you needed to get somewhere he was who you called Anywaymy boyfriend was called Rhys and he had this older brother Tomasnow everything Rhys was Tomas wasnt Rhys was a great rugby playerTomas was a lumbering foolRhys was bright and Tomas wasnot slow but definitely nowhere near as intelligent Both of them were of good Welsh stock which means big and dark and basicTomas had a bad habit of playing too rough because he hadnt the social skills of his brother hed plunge in and just maul people He threw me in a hedge once with no warning We were walking back from the pub late one night a gang of us all fooling about and he just picked me up and launched me into this hedgerowI still have a tiny chip on my tooth today Rhys was protective of him though and while he did have words with him for that he never really got angryit was all a bit close to the edge though Anywayone night in late summer wed all been hanging around at The Castlewhich was quite literally a castlebut ruined It was where we went when nights were warm enough wed hang around have beers and just talk and fool about There wasnt much of the castle left really just the shell of it but it was a cool place to be and wed talk about the battles that must have gone on there and the history of the place There were  of us there this night Rhys me Tomas and this streak of a lad called Mike it was getting towards midnight and wed all been drinking The night air had cooled down and the wooded area surrounding us was starting to look even blacker than usual to me I had a feelingominous Perhaps it was due to Rhyss behaviour he was acting up a lotshowing off and being generally unpredictablehe and Tomas were also very drunk which annoyed me a bit as Rhys wasnt properly on the ball then as far as Tomass behaviour went AnywayI was starting to make noises about going home when Rhys decided to scale one of these crumbling walls which made up the shell of the castle Of course almost at the top he fell off and we could see right off that he was hurt He couldnt walk and someone had to go for help None of us had mobile phones back thenit wasnt the norm and Mike was drunk and whinging and wouldnt walk down the laneI was properly annoyed by then and wanted to get away from the lot of them so I said Id go on my own and get the taxi driving dad I set off feeling a little angry and a bit scared for Rhyshalf way down the lane that ran down the hill away from the castle I heard thudding heavy footsteps It was I already knew Tomas I was immediately on high alert not only because I didnt trust him as far as I could throw him and always avoided being alone with him but also because he was a genuinely scary lad He caught up with me and I always remember what he said Rhys sent me and it came over as a pathetic childish lieI knew Rhys would do no such thingso I felt even worse about it because it was like he knew I was scared of him and this was his clumsy attempt to set my mind at rest We walked along through this dark lane in silence for a few minutes my heart was going like crazy the whole time just waiting for what he would do I didnt have to wait long because he suddenly clapped this big ham of a hand on my face and sort of dragged me towards him It was truly terrifying and made worse by the fact that I couldnt see whereabouts we were exactly I couldnt seem to make a noise above a squeak and all the time this big ape is trying to get a hold of me and pull me down to the ground We were there in this terrible sort of silent grapple when the light changedmy first thought was that it was a torch but it wasnt the right light for a torchand there about fifty feet away from us and visible through the trees was a glowing manthats all I can say it was It was the shape and size of a man with no real features to itthe ends of the limbs were rounded off and there was a head but no features It glowed in the same way the moon doeswhite Heor itwas standing poised as if he was about to run AT ushis arms were in that runners pose I screamed and Tomas dropped me and ran off down the lane As I looked the figure also ranat lightening speed in the direction wed come from I ran too thenback to the village and to Rhys and Tomass Dads cottage I never told Rhys what Tomas did Looking back I came very close to being hurt that night and I shrugged it offpartly because of the thing we saw and partly because I was  and resilient I split with Rhys thoughI didnt want to hang around with him since his weird brother was part of the package I have never heard of anyone else seeing the figure we saw and always wondered what it was Did it come to protect me or was it something that was simply there when we were,Strange Happening in a Welsh Village,16
zmbsttck,1,5,1qsxin,6,I had a neighbor when I lived in Louisiana an old sweet lady who lived alone in a toolarge tooold house next door She was a nice woman always told me that I reminded her of herself when she was young She used to give me those gross dry mints that are too large too chalky to really be thought of as candy She was so nice and a bit of a lush had a martini everyday that kind of woman She would throw lavish parties during the holidays and invite the whole neighborhood I think it was because she was lonely her husband had been dead many many years Well before I was born or moved the house next door As I got older the parties became less frequent less attended and she spent most of her days alone at home It wasnt until hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana that I stepped a foot in her house again She was older frailer I was a freshman in highschool She was so scared recovering from hip surgery alone in the big empty house She told me I could pick any room upstairs and sleep she couldnt climb the stairs anymore and hadnt been up there in a long time The second floor was a time capsule probably unchanged from when her kids had moved out and moved on beds carefully made and their belongings on the shelves Dolls bears books I picked the master bedroom to spend the night wouldnt you Biggest bed bookshelf chock full of books and magazines It was around midnight when I finally fell asleep wind and rain wreaking havoc outside but the lights were still on I dont really know what woke me up maybe it was the storm maybe it was the power going out It was dark dark enough to know that even if I had tried the lights it would have been fruitless It was annoying but it wasnt the first hurricane Id been through the drill was pretty standard I had the flashlight I had the candles Better to burn the candles first always better to save the batteries I stumbled around looking for the matches in the unfamiliar bedroom I remember it being warm Everyone ran their air conditioners  before a hurricane it got hot so quickly It was getting humid fast It was like that with the big storms I was groping through the dark finally finding the matches and candles lighting the wick regretting that the heat from the flame would doubtlessly raise the temperature in the room significantly I went back to bed tossing and turning I woke up and it was still dark it couldnt have been more than an hour or so since I had last been up It was different it was cold I was excited maybe the power was back on I reached for the lamp but no light turned on I realized then that it was still dark too dark for the power to be back on Why was it cold It was actually freezing I looked out the window to see if the streetlights were on It was then I heard the thump I knew my elderly neighbor couldnt climb the stairs bum hip and all Maybe a raccoon had gotten in Animals find wierd hiding spots in hurricanes thats probably what woke me The candle was out but I had the flashlight I turned it on but no light Just a dim flicker and then darkness The thump came again and the cold was starting to make me shiver The sound was repeating a constant thump now Getting closer It occured to me that if my neighbor was hurt or had fallen in the dark she might need help and I jumped out of the bed to run downstairs Some people talk about the feeling you get when you know youre being watched the hairs on the back of your neck stand up you get goosebumps on your arms I didnt experience that I just felt that I should look at the window There was just enough light from the moon to see something and what I saw has changed my life Was it a man I dont know Was it a ghost I would have told you not to be ridiculous What I do know was that something stood there Something was standing next to the bed and something was watching me I dont remember being so frightened before then and I cant remember ever having run so fast I was out of the room and down the stairs before I had time to make a sound jumping the last few Not knowing how but being certain that if I turned around it would be behind me At the bottom I turned glancing up the stairs It was there standing on the landing No sound no movement Lightening flashed from the storm Just enough to see It was wearing a shirt A red plaid shirt Why why why why No one was supposed to be in the house just me and the old lady Just us no nurse no people and certainly no one in a red plaid shirt I remember throwing up in my mouth Now that I was downstairs I could hear my neighbor snoring Sound asleep in a drunken martini stupor When I looked back up the stairs the shape was gone It was gone I slept on the couch for the rest of the night I never mentioned the incident to anyone even now that Im grown It wasnt even the last time I saw a man in a red plaid shirt I saw him on my porch outside my living room in my backyard when I was in the pool He was always gone when I went to look for him It wasnt until years later after my neighbor died that my mom told me that her husband had died in that creepy old house He had fallen off the roof of the house next door my house He died shortly after The house is gone now torn down A new house is there now Im married and have a son I dont even live in Louisiana anymore Still when Im home for the holidays I get a feeling the kind you get when you know if you turn around someone will be staring Sometimes theres a man in a red plaid shirt Sometimes hes on the porch Sometimes hes in the yard Hes always staring though When I go and look hes always gone Ill be in Louisiana this week and I know that someone will be watching me What does he want Why does he stare And why doesnt he have a face,Neighbors,11
BrainChicken,2,8,1qscvx,6,I dont know what to think anymore  I cant tell if Ive gone mad or if there really is a supernatural force at work here  I guess it all started with this dream This damn dream has been running my life for a month now Im afraid to go to sleep because I already know what Im going to see Im walking down the street with a girl She doesnt look familiar but somehow I know her Were walking down a street Ive been on before Maybe Or maybe its just starting to seem like I have from the amount of times Ive seen it at night Were laughing and having fun But then the darkness started creeping up from behind us I dont know how I know its there but we both turn around Its like the kind of pitch black you see if you close your eyes in your closet in the middle of the night Justnothing It stops about  feet from us and a figure emerges It kind of looked like a dog but it wasntsolid Im not sure how to explain this Its kind of like the dog wasnt a solid thing but more like smoke  He lunges at me but dissipates before making it to my face I hear a voice say Youre mine and then I wake upThis alone wouldnt be so bad Except now Ive started seeing this dog outside my dreams as well I was going to the petrol station today after work when I saw the dog in the window of the store Obviously I decided I would get petrol elsewhere  When I got home I turned the tv on as per the usual and saw that the petrol station was robbed  people were injured and the thief stole a car I couldnt believe it And I honestly cant tell if this thing is protecting me or wanting me for itself ,The Dog from the Shadows,14
kailey,0,1,1r8ylh,5,So about a year and a half ago my family moved into an old farm house that was built near the end of the s My whole family absolutely hated it there but I was oddly drawn to it and loved it I have no idea why On the first night we stayed there my best friend stayed the night with me because the first night is always creepy no matter what Now supernatural things were drawn to my best friend She could sense them and they always came to her Once she stepped foot in that house she wanted to leave But of course she refrained from telling me until after I moved out She also didnt tell me about what happened while I was asleep Before we went to bed we decided to watch a movie Then we just left it on the main menu and went to bed I guess around  AM she woke up to a bang in my room From where she couldnt exactly tell But it was definitely my room Then the tv went out to that gray and black fuzz and really loud for about  seconds then went back to the main menu She said she was shaking from fear She refused to come over anytime I invited her after thatAgain she didnt tell me about any feelings or anything until after I moved outIve always been interested with the supernatural but nothing of the sort is drawn to me Im kind of happy about that kind of sad But I mustve been the most interesting for whatever was in that house because it was drawn to me and it made it clearThis house had two bedrooms upstairs two bedrooms downstairs It also had a living room that was recently built onto it so it had separate air condition and furnaceIt was midwinter and the furnace on the original part of the house wouldnt work At all We got it checked out probably  or  times and they couldnt figure out why it wasnt working My sister and I had the rooms upstairs but she couldnt handle the cold so she ended up sleeping in the living room with the separate furnace so I was alone on that floor Around the second week we were there I was getting into bed with my  blankets and multiple pants and sweatshirts because of how freezing it was when suddenly I heard a huge BANG on my door This freaked me out so I just grabbed my bible and prayed for whatever it was to go away until I felt better Then it started happening every single night when I got into bed Eventually it didnt bother me Like whatever was out there was just wishing me goodnight or somethingIn my room I had a guitar and keyboard One night around  I woke up to the sound my guitar strumming Assuming it had fallen over I got up to pick it up then when I got there it was still exactly where I left it Confused and a little freaked out I just decided to go back to bed Then the next night I woke up to light I sat up and saw my keyboard lighting up like it was being played Then I got even more freaked outThe bangs along with this demon ghost thing playing with my instruments happened almost every nightDuring the four months I lived in the house I went into a depression Which is really only weird because I never have before or after I didnt do anything I slept all day I didnt eat I was mean to everyone I really hated myself and I contemplated suicide Also I had a migraine Not multiple migraines A migraine that literally never went away the entire time I lived there I tried multiple different prescribed medicines and all of them just made it worseThe weird thing is practically the day I moved out it all stopped I wasnt depressed anymore My migraine went away I was just happy againAfter realizing the coincidence I looked up some stuff knowing that there was something in that house Depression can be form of possession Not as bad as all the stuff you see in movies with them becoming demons and doing back bends and crap But Im positive that whatever was in there attached itself to me And by the way it made me feel it seems like it wanted me to hurt myself This story might not send chills down your spin like some others do but I cant even think about it without being terrified And the weird part is I have to pass that house everyday and Im still drawn to it It feels like home ,It feels like home,6
TheeMikeG,2,1,1r8w1k,5,Let me introduce myself My name is Mike Gordan and I exorcise demons for a living Yeah work is hard to find but I get by I was born into a normal loving family but everyone kind of went their separate ways a while ago I have an older brother who joined the military and my mother and father are both pilots so they obviously travel a lot After I graduated highschool and was in college for a few years I tried my hand at law But after I failed the LSAT I got pretty down and didnt know what I wanted to do with my life I dropped out of school and found myself struggling to get a job and even more so struggling to pay rent Then I found Jesus And by that I mean I was dumpster diving and found a KJV little orange bible inbetween a moldy sandwhich and a spent tube of toothpaste When I got to the part about the end of the world and that  stuff I got interested really interested Id go to the library and do hours upon hours of research I learned about the Devils crossroads and the Grimorium Verum and the Lesser Key of Solomon and demonic sigils and how to summong them I watched all eight seasons of Supernatural in two months and got a license online to be a priest With my trusty orange bible in my pocket I scowered Craigslist for people who needed savingAt first all I found were people that wanted their homes blessed their babies baptised or someone to perform a homosexual marriage But I had a wealth of knowledge of demons and I wanted to do something a lot more meaningful Then I found her Her post was desperate She claimed to be waking up with bruises and in different rooms or even places than where she had fallen asleep I messaged her explaining that I was a priest who specialized in demon removal and that I would be happy to exorcise her home For a modest fee of course She replied immediately that she would pay me whatever I wanted she just wanted to get rid of whatever was doing this to her When I got to her house I didnt notice anything out of the ordinary No weird smeel no demonic symbols or texts nothing And the girl looked fine aside from some minor scratches and bruises But she cried and cried and begged me to help her It was pretty awkward because Id never done this before but I played confidence and expertise I had her sit down in one of her wooden kitchen chairs and I bound her arms and legs to it I took out my bible and began to read from a page I randomly flipped to All nations whom You have made Shall come and worship before You O Lord And shall glorify Your name For You are great and do wondrous things You alone are GodAnd then she started to scream Not a normal scream though a deep dark sounding scream I dropped the bible Mustering up my strength confident in my knowledge I snapped out of my state of shock and fiddled in my deep pocket for the plastic bottle of holy water I had purchsed online I splashed some on her face and was horrified Her face sizzled and burned Im talking like third degree And that smell my God that smell like sulfur By now she was thrashing wildly in the chair I bent down and quickly retrieved the bible then started againAnd He changes the times and the seasons He removes kings and raises up kings He gives wisdom to the wise And knowledge to those who have understanding He reveals deep and secret things He knows what is in the darkness And light dwells with Him By now shit was falling off shelves furniture was sliding around the whole shabang It was awesome In my element now and comfortable I improvisedJesus I ask that you cast out any and all evil spirits in around or attached to this woman Lord  sanctify this follower of your word and help me to command all demons to leave at once I bless this woman and damn you back to hell Then she vomited and passed out Everything stopped moving and all was quiet When she woke up she had no memory of what had happened but said she felt much better The color returned to her face and I knew it was gone After I untied her she went to her purse and handed me a blank checkSince that day Ive been performing exorcisms and Ive done so many that things have slowed down almost entirely I havent had a job in months and rent is getting hard to pay again So I used my knowledge to make a deal where everyone wins Ive actually got a new customer right now Shes struggling against the straps but its useless Once I put the demon in her shell pay me anything to take it out Message me if you need help ,Will Perform Exorcisms  Low Rates,6
dwsrf,1,3,1r8d9t,6,I was reading posts today and was reminded of something that happened to me when I was a kid  It was an average summer day and I was somewhere in my mid to low teens couldnt drive yet  Since it was summertime school was out and like most kids I spent it with friends doing whatever seemed like a good idea at the time  Usually we would go play in the woods or ride our bikes around  That day I decided to call up one of my friends and see if he wanted to hang out  So I picked up the phone and to my astonishment the line was dead  I didnt think much of it because I figured maybe they were working on the lines around my house or something  His house wasnt very far from mine only a mile or two so I decided to just ride my bike over and see himWhen leaving my house the first thing that surprised me was that I didnt see any people or cars around  It was summer in a residential neighborhood so there should have been kids out playing and people going about their daily lives  Again it seemed like a coincidence  As I was riding I remember thinking it was eerily quiet  There was no wind that day which is odd enough in and of itself but the air seemed almost stagnantBeing a kid it didnt seem like much of a problem and at the time it just seemed like a small thing  What I remember most now is that not only were there no people going about their daily business but there was not a single sound from nature  I could hear my bike tires on the road and the sound of the crank and my own breathing but there were no other sounds  No birds no dogs no chirping or buzzing of insectsI got to my friends house and knocked on the door Nothing  I knocked again  NothingThat was just plain odd  He had several other siblings and even though his parents worked I remember thinking that there should have been at least one of them there  At that point I decided that something was definitely off  I rode my bike back to my house as quickly as I could and went up to my room and shut the door  Several hours later my sister came home from work and I went down to talk to her  She asked how my day was and I couldnt bring myself to tell her about the strange events of the afternoon because I figured that it must have all been a coincidence and I was reading too much into it  I went outside and everything seemed normal  Wind blowing kids playing dogs barking  To this day I never figured out what was going on but it was like someone turned a switch and turned off everything but me and then flipped it back and everything was back to normal  Never though much about it until I started reading nosleep  Maybe someone else has an idea of what went on,The day with no sounds,9
RayAllenLovecraft,0,5,1r7jhu,4,A rather peculiar incident happened not too long ago on a cold rainy night  It was a little past  am when I left my friends house  Its a old Victorian house in a once thriving town  As I was driving down the empty road I saw a taxi cab in a left turn lane  I was able to see its lights from about a mile away  The green glow shined through the mist and created this aura on the surprisingly empty street  This is not uncommon in a large town such as this but the thing that puzzled me is where it was turning into  The taxi was turning into a mental institution for the criminally insane  This event happened to startle me because it was so early in the morning  I continued to drive home wondering why someone was being released so early  The next day I went to school  My school is only a stones throw away from the mental hospital  As I walked out of my last class I saw a familiar glow  It was that green taxi again  I didnt think much of it being a college I see taxis picking up people all the time  As I hiked across the parking lot and got into my car I noticed it was still there  I didnt really pay much attention to it because classes can run pretty late maybe someone was taking there time walking through the campus  As I tore out of the parking lot I noticed it wasnt there  Maybe the driver got pissed and left  I met up with some friends from class at a Mexican restaurant down the street  As we were waiting for our food I told them about the coincidence that happened the night before and what just happened in the parking lot  My friend whose family had lived in the area for a long time told me more about the mental institution  He told me about how they once tested drugs on the patients and preformed lobotomies up until the s  The room was dead silent  Luckily our food came out shortly after the disturbing conversation  When we finished eating we talked more about it  I was becoming obsessed with it  Why was it there so late Who where they picking up  Was it the same taxi Our conversation was cut short when the bill came to the table  We were too busy counting our singles and change we are college students to be talking about the mental hospital  We stepped outside and had a cigarette before we would part ways  We were standing in a empty parking lot at around  pm when we noticed something out of the ordinary  We saw the green taxi picking someone up at the restaurant across the street  It was just parked there  We abruptly said goodbye and got into our cars  I drove home without stopping  The next night at dinner I told my parents what has been going on  They didnt believe that a green taxi has been following me around  Days and days passed and I continued to see the taxi again  I was getting really paranoid  I started to take days off of school to avoid seeing it  My parents were deeply concerned with my behavior and suggested that I see a psychologist  I mustered up the courage and drove there myself after all I am a college student  I couldnt concentrate on the road  I was afraid that I would see it again  I was so bent out of shape I accidentally ran through a red light while making a right turn  I heard somebody laying on their horn  I was shocked to see who I pulled out in front of  It was the green taxi  I raced to the psychologist  I ran as fast as I could into the office  The councilor was frightened by my actions  She took me into her office to hide me from the other patients  I told her everything She was gravely concerned with my state  She suggested that I be admitted  My heart dropped I started to break out in a cold sweat  She left the room to make a phone call  I assumed that she was notifying my parents that I was being taken in  She talked to me for a few more minutes until she got a call  Once she hung up she told me my ride was here  I was puzzled  She walked me out of the building and told me she called a cab  I froze  I looked out the glass doors and saw the green taxi parked in front of the exit  I broke out into a violent fit thrashing and resisting  I was not getting in there  Two security guards restrained me and started to drag me in the cab  We were driving down the same street that I first saw it on  We got into the left turn lane and entered through the opened gates  I gotta cut this short  My computer time is up  The hospital only gives you an hour a day I hope you enjoyed the story  Take care,The Green Taxi,9

Darrenshan,1,1,1r0xps,5,I ran through the cornfield I wanted to get out of there before the storm reached the field I had just gotten into my truck when I remembered I had left the hose hooked up to the irrigator I got out and ran the wind was picking up and the sky was becoming dark I had just reached the hose and was about to turn off the water when I noticed something move out of the corner of my eye I quickly turned to look at whatever was there but all I could see was the wind violently shaking the cornstalks I shrugged and disconnected the hose I was right about to return to my truck when I noticed something The sky was now pitch black The only things I had to light my path were the tiny flashlight on my truck keys and the occasional lightning strike I ran in the direction I thought my truck was in I stopped running when I realized that thanks to the dark I was completely lost in the field I noticed a dark shape sticking out of the corn in front of me I stuck out my hands and slowly walked toward it It felt like it was made out of metal so I turned on my flashlight to get a better view What I saw made my blood run cold The huge object that was buried in the dirt was my truck It looked like it had been torn apart and thrown Who the hell I said looking at the destroyed vehicle Suddenly I heard a voice whisper in my ear Dont you mean WHAT the hell I jumped at the sound of the voice I turned around and shined the flashlight in the direction the voice came from but nothing was there Who ARE YOU I screamed YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY I stood waiting for an anwser when the flashlight went out then some unseen foe with tremendous strength wrenched it from my hand I took off running into the rows of corn the storm had picked up and I was being drenched with the now falling rain I ran until I slammed into a wooden object in front of me I dropped to the ground the pain in my nose and the warm and sticky feeling in my mouth told me my nose was broken I looked up at what I had hit a flash of lightning revealed that I was staring at a cross It was made out of crude wood and was held together using an old crumbling rope I slumped to my knees and stared at the sky my eyes burning from the rain God What is doing this I received no replyI looked around wildly and shouted Where are you What do you want I shuddered as a familier voice whispered back YOUSuddenly I was picked up and thrown into the cross It snapped as I barrled into it I rolled into a nearby row of corn and stood up My leg was in horrible pain Lightning flashed again and I saw the splintered remains of the cross sticking out of my leg I limped as fast as I could my leg was killing me I felt something quickly aproaching my back I told myself Dont look back just keep running I burst out of the field and dropped to the ground I ran my hands along the ground and was overjoyed to feel asphalt I stood up and limped down the road The clouds parted above me and the moon shined down on the field I came to an awful realization Although I could see the corn whipping back and forth I couldnt hear any wind A dark large mass burst out the the field and landed on the road The clouds covered the moon again as the creature unfolded to show its decrepid features It was completly covered in a black whispy cloth that was torn and reaked of decay It had two red glowing eyes burning in the center of its dark face I turned and tried to run but I dropped The creature took massive strides toward me It was at least eight feet tall and I noticed it wore a hood I got up and sprinted down the road pain ruptured from my leg but I ignored it I ran inside a barn and locked the door I sat on a stack of hay bails and listened I heard silence Then as if it were a faint whisper I heard my name being called outside the barn Cameron Cameron I covered my ears I saw the door fly open but nothing entered the barn I slowly took my hands away from my ears tears rolled down my face I lost all control and yelled Why did you leave All the hairs on the back of my neck stood up as something right behind me whispered I didnt,The Storm,6
TreasureHouseofDoom,14,67,1r01v0,2,Mary waited caught her breath mulled over the facts  Such a little girl who had been through too much she may have seen it all as if it had only happened moments ago or she may have felt the distance well over a century had made to fact and memorySweet Dulcie was a nice girl the lil golden angel Mama called her and she liked sweets too Marys eyes twinkled as she remembered her friend but almost as quickly they grew dark troubled pensive  And when she started wanting something well she usually got it on account of she was a lady of the house  Mary looked from grave to grave  Mister Moseley was hardly ever around but Mrs Moseley was a force to reckon with nice too but high and mighty  She left that day with my Mama and Big Roy her driver  They took the hay wagon to the store  And that meant theyd be gone a long whileIn the distance we heard the hitching of a wagon the call of a man robust and thenas if she were right here with usthe insistent tone of a cultured southern lady Mary Rose  Sweet Dulcie may stay here if you will keep watch over her  She mustnt go to the creek its much too dangerous when no one can hear your shouts  Stay by or in  the house  No mischief And I felt rather than heard what Marys Mama thought Who is here to watch my baby girlMary smiled memories  We played marbles these ones my Daddy made with clay from the creek and now she presented balls of red clay as if shed had them all the time palm up then turned her hand to push them into mine  But Sweet Dulcie well she wanted some other distractionMary Rose lets be the grown ups  Im the Lady and youre my GirlAnd Sweet Dulcie stepped from Marys memories straight into the scene  Standing at the foot of her own grave she didnt turn to see her name in stone Sweet Dulcie stepped toward Mary held her hands out childlike facsimile of a saint beatific expression and approachability  Mary took her hands her joy spreading from this contact along her arms to her face until Marys smile beamed with the same golden luster Then Marys right hand clasping Sweet Dulcies left the two girls turned to run from the cemetery down the hill and along the path againFor just a moment my living friends and I watched in some confusion  Beth was the first to speak I dont get it Julianne  Are they friends or enemiesMind still turning through the details I did the best I could with the information I had In Marys heart she and Dulcie have always been friends I began as Seth took the initiative to follow the girls down the path but it certainly doesnt seem the same to Dulcie  Theres real animosity in her spirit  Last night and when she watched from across the creekSeth breathed deeply Two things First I think the paths turned cold Second I wonder if the Dulcie we just witnessed isnt just a projection of Marys memories Looking past Seth who was two or three yards ahead and then around us I saw that he was right  Coming through the brush and privet shielding the trail we discovered a softball game in full swing at the second field   Girls in still bright clean uniformssome burgundy and some sky bluecheered their teammates on kept their field positions warmed up their batting arms  A girl at the plate focused all her energy on the bat zoomed in to watch the ball  Thin tendrils of light rose from her head and chest she was doing what she loved  Reading auras isnt something I do for fun or can even control but I realized long ago that people who speak or act passionately often have actual halos or even rays about them  Perhaps Id become lost in this thought because now Beth nudge me along  She and Seth were exhausted  More than just assessing this from how they looked I could feel it  Theyd been up all night watching me and now too theyd spent their morning in circumstances completely outside their realm of contemplation  hours agoSeth took a seat on the merrygoround a few yards left of the field fence  A citymade wooden plank sign next to it read WhirlARound I wondered if that was attempt at rising above the norm fancifying as some folks said down here or if it was a brand name  Maybe a brand forty years ago Seth responded its been here decades  Ive seen it in pics taken from the back of the house as the land was cleared to widen the parkI didnt mention what seemed obvious to me but watched him instead  Seth looked down at his hands clasped then rubbed them together against Fall chill I think Ive always been able to do it Or well I always thought I could do it but then Id convince myself it was just my imagination he turned back to smile at me but you think real loud  His smile was broad by reflex but then he and it grew shy  And yes Ive heard some things that may be better left private but it wasnt on purpose  I cant control it reallyMy expression was slack resolved guarded but inside I was both excited and enlightened  It was no wonder I was so drawn to him  Seth began again Some of those private thoughts Im really glad to know He would have kept talking but my kiss to his cheek halted himI guess you didnt see that coming And I slipped from the bleachers to the ground little scrape to my back as I did but no matter and traipsed over to Beth  Throwing my arms around her shoulders from the back I hugged her tightly  Im only pretending to watch the game I totally saw that and was afraid of what you might do next  Beths deadpan made me laugh  As practiced as she was with boys that kiss to Seths cheek was the farthest Id ever gone  Totally first base well for you  Pace yourself Beth added trying not to laugh  But it wasnt bad adviceI had a way of becoming consumed by new thingsAnd now we gathered ourselves Beth and I walking handinhand back to where Seth sat facing his house and then the three of us together  It occurred to me that Beths parents must be worried sick  Oh manBeth what about your folksI called them last night told them youd ODd on sugar and spice and everything nice Cute Another goodygoody joke  Mom totally believed me  She thinks you were drunk Nursing a hang over now  I ran with it And now I laughed fairly hard  A rumor or two not that Beths mother would pass them could only help my street cred  I wouldnt worry much about that I have a feeling folks are talking about what happened last night already  Seth pointed toward the street just past his house  A police car was parked on the curb and Chief Hillard ambled up the front walk  A deep sigh coursing through us all collection we made our way to meet himChief Hillard was at the front door when we came around  Why there you busy kids are I would have expected you to sleep in after such a riotous nightSeth spoke first Im not sure what youre talking about he began but Chief Hillard cut him off shortlyListen Sethbelieve me it doesnt thrill me to be the one to have to talk to your father about this but you might as well know weve got three girls crying their eyes out because they think theyve had a death threat five kids down at the station giving us all the names and people all over the town whod like to see you hanging by the toilet paper you trailedSeth lowered his eyes resignation filling his expression  Ill need you and Beth to come with me as soon as I speak to your parentsNow Beth and Seth looked surprised  Chief Hillard I should come too I said embarrassedly  The Chief regarded me only a moment before he began laughing  You can come down if you want but it isnt necessary I know very well that you wouldnt be involved in anything like this  It was my idea I said to his deeper laughter  There was no convincing him and I wondered if no one had turned my name in with the others   Shawn Cornetts parents were the first to call and he gave us the lot of you ChiefHillard was speaking to Seth again Ive got  names Shawn  Wed gotten his house pretty good while he led the rolling at the covered bridgeTurning to Beth sheepishly I was glad when she reached to hug my neck  Dont worry Julianne  Youll pay your dues  Why dont you call our parents for us  Her smile was impish but I knew she must be deeply troubled to imagine their reactions  The mix of punishment with disappointment was a foregone conclusion and Beth hated to disappoint her parents  Buy Marsha some Kleenex and hand Kyle my car keys  Well be bussing or hoofing it to school for awhile But dont tell them youre guilty  I might be able to speak to one friend for the rest of senior year if they keep their PollyAnna view of youSeth was explaining to Chief Hillard that his folks were away for the weekend when I put my hand to his elbow  Its okay Julianne He turned to me his expression tense but not unkind We had a good time at others expenseswell all pay our dues somehow  It had crossed my mind to wonder what my dues might be after all was said and done if I was the only person not brought into the station  I couldnt quite understand why no one had given me up but I was sure they would all be angry with me You hold the fort down  Call my folks if you dont mind  The numbers by the phone in the foyer And now he turned to Chief Hillard Are we being arrested SirAnd the Chief laughed hard  I could have you all on theft and  criminal mischief or destruction of public property or a few other vandalism charges but Im hoping we can take care of this through some friendly mediation  If I had to arrest every kid whod rolled a house last night they might as well close the middle and high schools for a weekSeth kissed my cheek as they turned to leave and Beth nudged with her elbow From now on Im calling yall Bonnie and Clyde and I cringed Id seen the movie with Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway when I was a kid and I still hadnt gotten over the trauma of their big death sceneNow I had Seths house to myself for awhile but I couldnt stay long  Once news of our transgressions traveled through the town my parents would call Beths to fetch me and I didnt expect theyd be pleased to find I had spent the night someplace for which I didnt have permission a boys house no less  Taking the receiver from the hook I steeled myself to call the Drs Jefferies but suddenly I was reminded that alone in this house was only a matter of illusion  The phone buzzed pure energy and I feltrather than sawthe danger it represented  Always sensitive to electricity in the air I was overwhelmed by sense that everything electrical surged in the house I heard the boom and sizzle of a transformer bursting outside and then the lights went out  In many houses an electrical outage at noon wouldnt have been a big deal but I knew heavy drapes in all the windows would block the light fairly well and the only light to the foyer came through geometric panels of stained glassmostly amber purple and crimsonthat created a design in the heavy oak front door  I hadnt examined the image carefully before but now as light through the panes projected dancing stereoscope around me  I realized the glass depicted a raging fire  A shiver rose through me just as a scream came from some place in the back yard  I was about to step out the front to run around to the back when laughter from the study interrupted me  Julianne Mary Roses new friend dont you want to play with us Im the lady of the house and shes the girl and you can be the voice trailed off but I heard breath at the door imagined her fingers reaching for the knob and now she screamed pitifully the doctorThere are moments in our lives when we are too afraid to move orat leastdreams would lead us to believe such is true I braced myself for that fear fought the impulse to cower in a corner reminded myself of the promise I had made Mary And I felt Aunt Lucias presence heard her sweet voice reassure The truest power is in life  She will not prevail so long as you maintain your strengthIn all the years since Aunt Lucia had passed I had never been glad that she was no longer among the living but now I realized blessings in that Her voice this spiritual presence had guided me well so far Thank you for reading each of these parts that explain an amazing event in my life If you havent been following please find other portions at

Jaysta,0,1,1qxwez,4,I was  and I was a complete moron Let me just clear that up right now My friends were just as bad and that is why we decided that breaking into an abandoned rest home would be the coolest shit ever We planned our little venture for the following Friday night We picked up some flashlights a cheap camera etc in preparation for our night Ill just skip to Friday night to save myself some timeAlright so Friday night came and my friends and I hopped into my car  of us in all We arrived at the rest home which was on the outskirts of my small town in about  minutes We got out our gear and approached the front door To our utter surprise it was unlocked I was somewhat disappointed as I wanted the satisfaction of actually breaking in to something Nonetheless we forged ahead pulling out our flashlights to fend off the darkness We walked around joking around with each other about ghosts demon old people and the like It was relatively uneventful so uneventful in fact that I put the camera back in my bag We continued to walk around until we were about to quit due to boredom Sure there was obscene graffiti on the walls to admire but that only entertains a teenager for so long Right as we approached the front door to leave I took a glance down one of the three hallways that stretched away from the entrance A light A light was faintly coming from around the corner of the hallway I stopped dead in my tracks I grabbed one of my friends shoulder and pointed He looked over and lost the color in his face The three of us warily approached the corner two of us in the front one watching the rear We neared the corner and the light flicked off I let out a short scream My friends snickered and although my first instinct was to run I decided that I needed to prove my manliness and round that damn corner I slowly approached with my friends trailing behind I jumped around the corner and pointed my flashlight with a yell but my voice was cut off in my throat Maybe  or  feet down the hallway a wheelchair was moving in the opposite direction of my group My friends came around to see what had frightened me and they stopped cold The wheelchair stopped I shuddered Slowly it turned around to face my flashlight which I was holding with wobbly hands Then to my complete dismay it slowly began coming back towards us What the fuck is that one of my friends whispered I had no reply I had a sudden realization and fumbled with my bag while my friends kept their flashlights trained on the slowly approaching wheelchair I pulled out the camera and hit record Insert tape Shit Of course in my infinite teenage wisdom I hadnt even checked to see if the camera had any tape when I bought it at a thrift store My anger combined with my fear and I hurled the camera down the hallway at the wheelchair which was now maybe  feet away The camera flew over it and was swallowed up by the darkness behind the wheelchair It stopped The wheelchair stopped My friends and I watched in paralyzed fear Then all of a sudden as if whatever had been pushing it began running it began to approach us incredibly quickly We all let out screams and took off for the door I grabbed for the handle but it wouldnt budge I looked over to the corner we had just came around and saw the wheelchair round it maybe  feet away I screamed and threw all my weight into the door sending it crashing open My friends and I ran in terror We flew into my car and I jumbled with the keys before finally managing to ignite the engine I floored it as my friends waited for the wheelchair to roll out of the swinging door It never did,Rest Home,5
becomingthem,0,3,1qvppy,3,When I was a little girl about  or  I had these nightmares  They werent your average childhood nightmares theyre almost unexplainable  It was like I was in a world in which everything was bigger than me and could crush me with the slightest amount of effort  The details are foggy now but I will never forget waking up crying and still feeling that strange ache in my stomach  I am now almost  and I havent felt that gut wrenching feeling until recentlyI went on with my life after those years as if it was nothing and put it off as silly nightmares from watching too many horror films Yes I was watching horror movies at age   I have always believed in the paranormal but I never thought I would witness it for myself  Ive been reading rnosleep for almost two years now because I have a fascination with supernatural things of all kinds  I almost regret getting so involved with itTwo weeks ago I had another nightmare  I was stuck in a small room with tile covering every inch of the walls floor and even ceiling  I was trying to find a door when I saw a silhouette of something standing behind my own  I starred for a while before I turned around to find nothing  Just then I looked up and realized there was a shower head It almost immediately turned on and I thought I saw something on the ceiling just above it  I closed my eyes in reaction to the water  I rubbed them until I got a rushed feeling that I needed to look up at whatever I thought I saw  In fear I opened them and looked up to feel the weight of the ceiling crashing down on me  I woke up soaking wet with that familiar feeling  My stomach felt like it was being pushed on from the inside  I instantly checked the ceiling to be sure that I was back in reality  But there was nothing there  I felt the weight lift off of meI had almost forgotten about that nightmare that is until I was in my shower last night rinsing my face when I felt the sudden urge to get my eyes open to check on what was behind me  Just so you know in my shower I have a mirror on the wall facing the shower head for when Im taking my makeup off and such  I was facing the wall the shower head was on  I thought about it and then opened my eyes to see a dark shadow that wasnt my own  I turned around and saw nothing not even in the mirror  I would be relieved but my own reflection wasnt even there  I decided to wash my hair so I could get out of there because I was starting to feel insane  I leaned back into the water to rinse when the water got cold  I continued rinsing when soap ran down my forehead and into my eyes  I opened my eyes stupid thing to do when you have soap in your eyes and in my mirror I saw this thing behind me  It was very tall and dark from what I could tell I felt my heart drop  I reluctantly started to fall fainting from the fear and hit the bathroom floor  As I regained my consciousness I felt that familiar strange feeling in my stomach I closed my eyes and I heard a distorted voice  It told me We have always been hereon the inside,On the Inside,6
YesFoodOfCourse,1,0,1qvo34,4,A few years back I used to live with my father stepmum and  of my now  brothers At the time my little brother had been   It was my stepmothers birthday March rd She had been very interested in ghosts and ghost hunting ever since I showed her a popular show that we all know and loveFor her birthday my dad and myself had pitched in money to buy her a proper ghost hunting kit Camera cases ranged thermometers the works Little did we know that it would come back to bite us in the ass More so me than anyone elseSome time later my father thought it would be a great idea to test out the gear in his bedroom that in turn was shared by his wife and my little brother We sat there for about an hour asking questions but got no response We quit after the hour was up and decided that there were no spirits in the houseFast forward about a month and I had got home from a loooong day at school I was tired and home alone I kept hearing noises around the house but being tired and paranoid I figured my mind was playing tricks on me I finished my chores and decided to lay down to take a cat nap Tossing and turning I could not find a comfortable place no matter what position I was in And thats when I felt it An extremely cold almost icelike hand slither around my waist I didnt move I didnt do anything except wish that it would go away But it didnt the grip around me only tightened At this point I did try to get up but I was held in place by this arm After struggling for a minute or so I gave up and just decided to sleep Which I didI woke up a few hours later to the grip no longer pinning me to my bed and my father was home from work along with my stepmum and my little brother Greeting him with a hug as I always do he didnt seem right He wasnt as focused didnt want to eat and refused to come out of my fathers bedroom We turned on Toy Story and let him watch it as it is his favourite movie and also mine I left the room and began to eat dinner with my family My little brother began giggling uncontrollably Hes watched this movie countless times before and never laughed like that I checked on him and saw him just staring at the ceiling laughing his little ass off I shrugged an left the room to return to my food when his giggling became louder so loud I couldnt hear my father complaining about his day at workAt this point my father was irritated and told my little brother to hush for a little while His giggling dispersed for about  minutes before it once again startedMy dad also noticed that my brother was off and as a joke he thought he might catch what was making my brother laugh He set up the audio recorder and left We ate dinner and then stopped the recorderWe reviewed the audio and didnt hear anything we were about to give up Then we heard it I dont know if you guys ever watched Toy Story but there is a certain part when Buzz a toy got stolen and is now being forced to a tea party with the neighbors daughter Th young girl on the movie said More tea Mrs NezbithRight after was a deep husky voice that of a male in his early s whisperedShh darling They might hear us again Then the constant giggling stopped the movie continuing on We listened to the movie over and over again hearing no male voice We were freaked out I did the dishes and we all went to bed At exactly  AM my little brother woke up screaming kicking crying We thought it was a nightmare I calmed him down and laid him back downThe next night it happened again Exactly  AM This happened consecutively for about a month before my father called in a priest to bless the house Im not a religious person in fact I am an Atheist But I was all for it It never happened again the midnight screaming or the gigglingI now live with my grandmother as her husband recently died and she cannot pay the bills alone My mother also lives here helping out as well A few nights ago she rang me from the porch panickingAre you in your roomYesAre you sureIm pretty sure Im in my bedI just saw a shadow in the hallwayI hung up and grabbed my hunters knife and inspected the hallway Nothing was there and I figured she was just seeing thingsIt was  PM and my grandmother was getting for work She works rd shift so it starts at  AM We were standing in the kitchen talking about what we would have for dinner tomorrow when there was a bang from the hallway We both walked to see what it was and all of the papers towels and such were strewn about off of the desk in the hallway My heart started pounding She didnt know about the shadows and I didnt plan on telling herWe have three cats so she blamed it on them I agreed my stomach settling for the time being She went to go get a shower when it hit me All three cats were outside They like playing outside at night so we let them out To get my mind off the incident in the hallway I went to get a shower I stripped down looking in the mirror and saw a single scratch going along the length of my side All of my cats are declawed so it couldnt have been them Im scared I hopped in the shower washed my hair and body faster than a teenage boys first time having sexI got dressed in my pajamas after drying my hair and went to bed I was curled up watching a few video on my phone my mind focused on that Suddenly I felt a certain icy hand creep up my back and onto my waist sending a stinging feeling through the scratch Im not alone He never leftIve been followed ,Followed,4
TheRealestNinja,0,1,1qt5u3,4,Theres an overgrown meadow near my house Its about where my bus stop used to be before I changed schoolsRight there an old mailbox stands crooked next to rigid concrete steps The steps lead to nothing My folks tell me there was not one but two abandoned houses beside each other One burned down in the middle of the night long before we moved thereThe other just collapsed to the ground one day probably from the termites The city sent some workers to clean up the wreckNothing remains but those steps When I was younger wed stand there and throw FrisbeeOne day my cousin had a heck of an arm and he showed off The disc sailed through the air into a grove at the end of the meadow scaring off some Canadian geeseHed grabbed the last errant one so it was my turn However he decided he was done for the day so he went back to my house and walked insideA bit annoyed I still went for my Frisbee Looking around the immediate trees and bushes I didnt see it I didnt want to walk too deep into the woods lest I find a copperhead But ever so faint I started to hear this splashing noise I followed the tall grass down a hill toward some white pines  Ducking through the briers and branches I surpassed the thicketThere was a small creek no wider than a yard Fallen limbs loomed in its reflection For some reason the water had a frothy amber tintAs I approached the bank there was a picnic blanket with a blue lunch box I opened it but was immediately repulsed by the smell Two moldy sandwiches were in it I tossed the box down Clang I walked closer to the creek Just next to the surface was a large boulderScrawled on it was one wordAMELIAThe letters were a bit faded No doubt many rains had washed over themBehind me up the hill I heard some rustling Thinking it was more geese I started back Next to the grass made out of pine cones was an arrow pointed back the way I came My Frisbee was laid beside it,An errant throw,5

GonePostalNarwhal,0,4,1r6nbm,5,I believe in the paranormal but Ive never actually witnessed anything until a few days ago Ive lived in my house for almost  years Its a new build Its never felt haunted or scary Its always felt empty or normal until about two days ago My fiancé and I went to bed as usual In the morning my dog always wakes me up around  When I first woke I assumed my dog was the reason but no I could still feel her at my feet When I went to open my eyes and glance down A tall human figure outlined in gold was reaching out to me The inside was ripple and distorted everything behind it I slammed my eyes shut pulled the covers over my head and rolled over to be closer to my fiancé All I could think was please let it leave and dont touch me Eventually I drifted off again My dog never woke me up that morning which I thought was oddEver since then Ive felt like theres been something in my house I could use some help figuring out what it is and if its harmful and how I got here,A Ghost Maybe,9
Allycat,2,5,1r67oh,2,Have you ever ran into those type of people that just fucking grate you the wrong way the arrogant ones who get away with tons of shit and know they can get away with it  Not the instances where you rise above it and claim your stake but the more helpless casesYou just want karma to intervene and give that little prick whats coming to themEnergy work is something that Ive been doing for over half my life and there are ways to speed karma up on certain individuals who you feel have done grievous injustices to yourself and others  There are definitely other ways to handle things of course but Id rather not have to kill people  There are important lessons to be learned of karma and the desire to do harm to others  Theres a creed out there stating that whatever energy you put out into the world you will get the same energy back threefoldThe first time I used energy against a person was when I was   I did a stupid harmless love spell to get a crush of mine on a date  He did agree on the date but of course he got back with his ex  Total energy backfireThe second time I used energy against a person was a year later as a sophomore  There was a really cute upperclassman I talked to all the time  He told me that his long term relationship was crumbling and he just didnt feel it anymoreHis girl at the time was a likeable person but she had an air of snottery about her I found irritating  One day she walked by me while I was at my locker and I threw my energy at her aggressively  I didnt wish anything specifically but the following Monday she walked into school with a broken leg in full cast  Holy fucking shitNow this may be just me but I felt horrible about it  And I got hurt too in return that same day in gym class  I didnt break anything but it was an embarrassing situation since the cute upperclassman happened to share that classAt this point I stopped using my energy against people  I can do without the concequences Until recently of course  I happened to stumble across a jerkass individual who was offensive in so many ways it made my blood boil  I dont use my energy against people anymore so I did the next best thing  I invoked the power of karma on their assI collected the energy around me and made a silent plea to karma to give this asshole the karma coming to them  I made the same plea another  times or so for good measure  And karma answered in the form of physical pain against the offenderFml what a frightening gift to have  At first I gave in to karma and did nothing but eventually I made another plea to karma that this person has had their karmic obligation fulfilled and to cease all further efforts with a polite thank youThe pain did subside but gradual and slowlyNow Im not going to say that this will work for all of you and Im sure it wont have much affect on situations much bigger than yourself but I know that theres got to be some redditors out there that have done similar things,Karma can be purposful Can you use it,7

Darrenshan,0,7,1r3u6m,3,I walked up to the old elementry school with caution It hadnt been used in years and the gym had parts of a tree growing through the planks and an entire section of it had to be torn down for having asbestos in the walls I got to the entrance and what do ya know It was locked I cursed and kicked the door I was supposed to be able to get in so I could do my project for history class I was to one of the oldest buildings and town and right a report on it so I thought it would be cool to get first hand experience inside the building I had even told the groundskeeper I was going to visit the school But alas the door was locked I was right about to leave when I noticed something shining in the grass Being curious I walked over and picked it up It was an old key Could it really I asked myself turning towards the door I walked up and stuck the key in and IT WORKED Excited about my new found courage I ran into the building The old concession stand for the gym was the first sight to greet me Its old countertops covered in ancient dust I pushed open the doors and entered the gym Holes were broken in the wooden planks of the court where a tree had pushed through I pulled out my camera and snapped a few pictures As I looked over the newly taken photos I noticed what looked like a person standing on the stage in the background Hello I asked hoping that whoever I had seen was kind enough to respond I got no reply and decided to take a closer look at the picture Must be the light I told myself shrugging away the fear of whomever I had seen Then I came to realize that there were no lights on I decided to correct this error and walked to the back of the gym I flipped the lightswitch and the lights burst into life The gym became so bright that I had to cover my eyes I walked into the middle of the gym I was about to snap some more pictures with the flash off when the lights cut out Stupid old fuse I said walking up to the switch I flipped it off and on again the lights came back on and I walked to the middle of the gym again Then the lights turned off again What the hell I asked walking up to the switch My jaw dropped when I noticed that the switch was missing All that was left was torn wires and twisted metal I ran for the front door but it was sealed shut I pulled the key out of my pocket and stuck it in the door I yelped as the key turned red hot in my hand like a live coal I dropped it as the metal liquified into a puddle on the floor Just then the lights in the gym came on again I walked out onto the court and what I saw made me shiver Something had left footprints in the dust They looked like a cross between a skeletal foot and hooves I gasped and ran to the exit at the back of the gym I opened the door and ran down a corridor to the door to the outside I tried the handle but it was locked I cursed and shook the handle in anger when I heard something and fell silent Something was coming down the corridor It moved on heavy feet making clicking noises with each slow step It made shallow breaths almost as if it was struggling to breath I covered my nose as the scent of rotting flesh hit me I stared down at a puddle on the floor and got a veiw of the creature It was wrapped in a red cloak with tears in the seams and stains all over it Its face was the skull of a cow and it had long arms that touched the floor the claws on its hands scraping the floor as it walked I flew into a panic i kicked at the door until the lock broke I burst into the night and ran until I was numb then I blacked outTen weeks later the building was torn down Some workers reported that they had found a basement littered with human remains Then the story was never talked about again We have a new town history project I think this time Ill stay away from the old church I hear theyre having problems with the lights,The Old Elementry School,10
xDrAlpakax,0,4,1r3mwk,5,If it were any other day I wouldve just walked by completely unaware and uncaring of what would happen if I approached this what I percieved as a man The simple chain of events that occured that day were miniscule and unnoticeable to the naked eye but differentiated the outcome of my life If you can call this life its a prison My personal holocaust Hell Whatever you call it can not be descriptive enough to effectively describe the torture inflicted every dayLet me start by saying I was just a normal kid from the suburbs Imagine a white kid and you had me  years old  pounds  need I get more descriptive I was unnoticeable from the crowd of what seems like millions of other identities that were more important more athletic and more human Not that Im some alien in disguise thats not what this story is about Im just saying that well I didnt play nice with others Id always get into fights at school and in trouble at home But I had a single core group of friends that I could rely on Andy Sam and Marcus That just happens to be where the real story begins when all of us planned a trip up to a cemetery a few miles up the road from my house that had an infamous reputation around my neighborhood Legend had it that there were a few unmarked graves placed in rediculous formations that no one could identify No one knew if they were human corpses or not So I guess thats why we were going up there to solve the mystery solve the puzzle Why and what were these graves When did they get there We left on Friday evening and started walking north to the graveyard The walk there involved the normal teenager conversations youd expect from a couple of rejected kids with no one else to talk to No weird signs chills premonitions nothing Just like we were walking to school Completely normal Normal tell me again what that is I havent caught a glimpse of normal in years Help meWe were nearly there and of course Andy has to stop to piss Like we didnt just leave the house an hour ago Why couldnt you hold it damn it Andy there was probably a public bathroom near the cemetery we were ALMOST THERE As he walked to the woods the rest of us realized that we could see the cemetery from where we were so we yelled at him and told him to catch up to us when he was done As we approached the gates some ravens flew away Actually they didnt fly away necessarily They flew towards us like we werent as dangerous as what lied ahead of us Of course none of us thought anything of it they were just startled birds right Maybe they were I dont know anymore For all I know we all imagined it An illusion created by some other being form your guess is as good as mine We entered the cemetery and walked through the aisles internally mourning for their familys losses Not that we knew the people six feet deep or anything but it was weird its like I was dealing with the deal of a family member or close friend they werent my emotions to bear but they were given to me regardless After we seperately collected ourselves we made our way the the main attraction per say  It was a giant stone monument in the middle of the open area we were stading in It was an angel that was kneeling over a grave and quite honestly it was creepy  We walked up to it and inspected it Its faded color rain stained tears on its face and sheer size were intimidating to say the least but we set up our stuff in front of it because there were no other places to stay After we got done we decided to look for the unmarked graves we walked all this way for We went left first and planned on walking counter clockwisr around the entire place until we found it Left Why left every choice was the wrong choice why not right We started walking past countless graves and once we were walking for a good  minutes and couldnt find anything I felt a hand on my shoulder I looked at Sam and Marcus and they had the same ghostly shocked face as I did They both felt it too We all whipped around to find a man in normal black clothing jeans a black tshirt and jacket and a black hat We came to the conclusion that he was an undertaker or groundskeeper or something and we calmed down a bitWhat do you kids think youre doing said the manSam replied I err we apologize sir We were just looking around to find some weird stuff I guessWell you shouldnt be here youre not safe at night No one is I think well be fine theres just a bunch of dead people Whats the worst that could happen Sam saidYoure looking for the unmarked graves arent youI said How did you knowFollow meWe all thought this guy was weird but weird at most He was scrawny and greasy Not the kind of person you would normally carry a conversation on with But we were all curious and had no idea where we were going At that point something came to my mind wheres Andy I told the man that we had to wait for my friend but he said that he found him earlier and he was taking us to him so we can regroup We hadnt seen him walk back in but we followed nonetheless  He led us to a secluded spot in the woods where we couldnt see the rest of the graves where I surprisingly saw Andy standing unharmed it seemed As we approached him he murmured something which was undecypherable from the distance we were We stepped closer sensing a disturbance as if we were being pushed back mentally but physically we were moving forward like a magnet We got closer and closer and realized that his feet werent feet anymore They were what can only be described as roots binding him to the earth and not letting go His eyes had turned to complete blackness reflecting the darkness that now described his soul There was nothing we could do we tried and tried to get him out of the ground but we couldnt do anything  He was rooted too deep What happened to him We turned around to get help from the groundskeeper but he was gone Andy started to make noises from behind us we thought it was Andy We turned around there was nothing I mean nothing Arid dry barren ground in the dark night Andy was gone the trees were gone graves everything Just nothing I turned to find Sam and Marcus and they were gone Just me alone I began to walk to find some sort of shelter or safehaven or some sort to get out of this place My shoes began to fall apart about an hour into the journey forcing me to take them off and walk barefooted I then walked for a few more hours on my raw bloody feet just hoping for water even a drop So thirsty but I found nothing The last thing I remember from the desert was laying on the earth praying to whoever to get me out  Then I passed out I have no idea how long I was unconcious but I woke up in a small grey room that had a single window on one of the walls I mustered up all the strength that I had to somehow crawl over to it I had will to find out where I was and I did I looked through the window and there was me On a medical table Tubes running from my arms some red some clear some green All alone in this cold metallic room A man walked into the room from a deadbolted door on the right side of the room It was the same man I had seen in the cemetery He walked up to my body and started inspecting me from head to toe looking for something I dont know what After he finished his search he looked up and turned around And stared at me Through the window I am real You will never be again This is the reality and you are trapped inside of your own mind able to go wherever you wish do whatever you want But you will only feel when or what I allow you to Your flesh is mine If I prick out your eyes I may still allow you to see But you will feel the empty cringing pain constantly If I cut off your leg you can still walk But you have to deal with the torture Forever Until I end your pathetic little life which is what it has always been Pathetic  You should thank me actually for now Ive given your life some purpose You serve me nowAnd this is when I looked back at when I was at the cemetery Me Marcus and Sam This man touched us on our shoulders we had all the opportunity to get away but we didnt  And by the way how many arms do YOU have Two Or three,My New Beginning,9

LittleMM,0,8,1r2ocz,2,This story happened when I was in collegeMy school is in another town so I had to live in student suites by myselfMy family is not rich and since I have a mild heart defect I always feel weak and dont have enough energy to take a job after class So in order to release at least some of my parents financial burden even though Im a girl I always chose the cheapest dorms to live inIve been living in four different dorms during my college days all very old and small one of them might even be actually haunted but this story is not about any of them at least not fully related Its about something elseOn my way to school theres a juice stand I always stopped by and buy a big cup of freshly squeezed juice after class Oh I forgot to mention I went to night school and school ends at  pmSince I buy juice from them almost every day even on my off days I became quite familiar with the owner and will chitchat with him while hes making juice for meOne day when I was waiting for my juice as usual I noticed that theres something on the ground at the corner of the road not very far from the juice standIts a glass milk bottle with one single yellow flower in it A fivepetal flower with a very short stem and no leavesI was curious and asked the juice stand owner  Did someone died there He answered  I had the same question but not that I know of Since its not such an unusual thing I didnt give it too much thoughtBut after about two weeks I started to notice something oddThe milk bottle was still there and the flower kept staying freshBut theres not even water in the bottle It should dry out pretty quick without waterI took a closer look and confirmed that the flower is not an artificial oneThat means someones been changing the flowers frequently if not dailyI got more curious and asked the juice stand owner if he saw anyone came to change the flowers his answer was noIts actually quite sad to really think of it Its probably someone very dear to the person who brought the flowers that accidentally died there Maybe by a car crash or maybe even a murderI talked about these wild assumptions carelessly and then I said goodbye to the owner with my fresh juice in hand I went back to the dorm my room is the first one on second floor when I was stepping upstairs I could hear two girls chatting and giggling theyre my classmates we took different classes so we didnt meet at school today we were supposed to watch horror video in my dorm today and I totally forgot about it When I reached the second floor I saw them standing in front of my door The guy living next to me saw them at the entrance and let them in They love watching horror videos at my place because the creepy environment offers an extra  ambience We were just talking about how creepy your dorm is  one of them said with a cheerful tongue Even this hallway seems haunted why is it so dim  Added by the other Thanks guys for trashing my lair for me like its not a dump already I smiledThen we watched the video together its overall just another eventless nightThe next day after school when I went for my daily juice to my surprise I found that the bottle of yellow flower was gone It was still there on my way to school Did you see who took the flower  I asked the owner Thats odd I didnt notice that its gone  He answeredI couldnt stop thinking about the yellow flowers on my way back to the dorm I couldnt explain why I was so obsessed by it I was so curious about the mysterious person who brought the flowers and why nobody ever saw himher even when obviously the flowers have been changed so frequently I was walking carelessly with my mind wandering somewhere else and the next moment a scene stroke meThe yellow flower Its there Near the entrance of the parkSomeone moved it there but whyIts not likely that someone died there too is itIts been curiouser and curiouser but I couldnt think of it anymoreThe midterm is approaching and Im only half way doneCant waste my parents money for a bad exam result Yes some of my classes still give exams Thinking of it I walked faster across the parkTheres no one in the part except me and the street lights are so dim they seemed dimmer than usual One street light flashed when I walked pass it I swore towards it  Great now even youre trying to scare me you asshole Then I turned back to the roadThats when I noticed something near the bench about  feet ahead of me suddenly I felt a chill down to the bone the bottle of yellow flower why is it thereDid someone put a bunch of flowers here and there on random spots OrI had to find out so I backtracked to the park entrance no flower there that one was gone So what does it mean Someones moving the bottle around for what And most of all how did I miss himher Theres only one way in this small parkIts not like I could do anything about it so I eventually carried onThis time the same bottle of flower appeared again in front of the convenient store right across the street of my dormPeople were passing by  no one seemed to care and I thought  Why should I  Its obviously none of my businessSo I entered the dorm building and went upstairs but started to think how the bottle of flower seemed to  followed  me the chills came back I almost reached the second floor but I froze at the staircase My body went all stiff I couldnt move my pupils probably dilated like a panicking catIts thereThe bottle of yellow flower sitting there in front of my doorA hundred thoughts flashed by  maybe someones playing a prank on me maybe its a joke but its not funny and by Whom and How I dont wanna know anymore Im moving out of this place I know its nothing to do with my dorm my dorm is fine its not haunted its not the issue but whatever Before I realized I already ran out of the dorm building and was on the way to my friends house and I didnt even remember how I got downstairsI couldnt stop mumbling to myselfI dont know if its a prank or not I dont care I know theres nothing wrong with my dorm its the cheapest but nothings wrong with it and what kind of sicko would do such thing to me Who would it be Who could have knownIts not possible cause I was pretty sure the dorm was empty that day its Saturday and everyone else went home except me That cat it was an accident I didnt mean it but its not possible No one could ever know I dont care Im moving out right away Im moving out tomorrowAnd I did,The Yellow Flowers,10
Motleigh,1,6,1r09ur,2,I was about  or  living in a ranch style house in Southern California when I had one of the creepiest experiences of my life I was sleeping in my bedroom with the door slightly ajar My bed was tucked into one corner of the room The head of the bed was against the same wall as my closet door The closet door was a large sliding mirror The door to my bedroom which was an average door was at the end of my bed When entering the bedroom one would have to walk past the end of the bedSome time in the night I woke up I dont know why I woke up and I dont remember anything in particular waking me The room was lit enough for me to see my bedroom door swing open about a foot I did not see a person open the door I did notice something crawl around the end of the bed and crawl up the side of the bed towards the head of the bedMy first thought was that a dog was coming in but when the thing reached the closet and slid open the closet door I was certain it was not a dog My best description of what I saw is a person crawling on all fours I saw a dark silhouette from the corner of my eye crawl past where I was laying in bed After the closet door slid open the mysterious being crawled into the closet and closed the closet door behind itself I was so terrified that I could not move I laid frozen from fear on my back in my bed until I feel asleep I was too scared to move or scream I was awake for about an hour unable to move before I dozed offThe next morning I woke up slightly confused but I immediately slid open the closet door I was not as afraid because the sun was shining outside and I felt that if it were going to harm me it would have done it already Inside the closet was my usual mess of clothes piled up on the floor There was no monster or animal in there anymore I did forget to check under the bed though,Scared Stiff,8
oliviaclaire,0,4,1r09ds,4,I apologize in advance for the length of this postThe clock read  Not unusual for me to be up this late I sat in my bed watching television and reading my usual horror novels I like many of you are quite into horror and the paranormal I began to feel hungry so I sat down my book and began to descend down the stairs to the kitchen I reached the kitchen and began to search for food I felt quite uneasy with my back turned to the rest of the room The feeling of someone watching me soon became overpowering and I had to turn around Thats when I heard it Tap Tap Tap It sounded like a finger tapping ever so lightly against the window in my kitchen I was frozen at the sound Though it was a light noise compared to the deafening silence of the night it might as well have been the loudest noise in the world I shifted my glance to the window only to find Nothing I brushed it off and returned to my bedroom As the night continued to drag on I felt a growing unease in the pit of my stomach Like something wasnt just right I noticed my phone was dying and reached for the charger plugged into the outlet next to my bed I then heard something that chilled me to the very bone Laughter Very quiet Very faint But there none the less I leaped from my bed and ran downstairs I reached the living room and turned on the television struggling to catch my breath and regain rational thought It could have been anything right Eventually I let the sound of the television push the experience to the back of my mind Then it came again Tap Tap Tap Louder this time I was stricken with panic I refused to let myself look at the window Just ignore it and it will go awayTap Tap TapIgnore itTapTapTapThis went on for  minutes at least It began to drive me crazy The tapping became incessant I then did something I havent done since I was a child Retreated to my mothers room I walked in with tears of complete and utter terror streaming down my face Reluctantly even though not much of an explanation was given she allowed me to stay the night in her room I climbed into the bed and began to let sleep take me I felt safer in the comfort of my mothers room Then just as my eyes began to feel too heavy to keep open I heard it once again Closer this timeTapTapTap ,Tap Tap Tap,8
LittleMM,6,12,1qzq8k,3,Hi everyone Im from Taiwan and Im new to this community I want to share with you a small event that happened to me just a few days agoSome might say its not scary at all but since its  real and it really is kind of odd at least to me  I decided to share it with you anywaySo here it isI was surfing the internet trying to find some information as reference for a game Im making one thing leads to another somehow I ended up on a topic  School ShootingI have an impression in mind that these incidents happened a lot the last few years mostly in the US but I know very little about them because theyre mostly only short news on TV  I live in Taiwan I decided to find out a little more thinking there could be interesting stuff I can put into my game so I looked it up on WikiI found a list of the incidents there information of Name Location Date etcThen something caught my eyes I noticed that there are two incidents took place in FinlandSince I always have the best impression for this country maybe even a little overrated it surprised me that anyone who lives there could commit such crime  Guess shit happens EVERYWHERE after all lol It also mentioned how one of the killers uploaded a Youtube video predicting the crime hes about to commit the day afterBeing curious I decided to take a look at that video Surprised that its still on the website shouldnt they take it downAnyway I tuned in and its about to start but suddenly a thought crossed my mind  Should I really watch this  because theres no doubt that it contains some evil intention in it do I really want to get in touch with that Its just a thought within a second and I quickly decided to close the tab I placed the cursor on the  cross  but before I had the chance to close it the screen flashed and turned dark all of a suddenMy computer just rebooted itselfI hopped up a little from my chair literally  jump scared  thinking about how my computer NEVER EVER rebooted itself like this before not once and Ive had it for a long timeSo what happenedI dont know maybe theres a virus attached to that video and my antivirus program shut the system down to protect it  I dont even know if it works this way I have no idea lol Or maybe my computer is just so loyal to me it protects me from anything evil lolI would probably never know the reason but Im quite sure about one thing  Id never try to get contact with an evil mind EVER AGAINIf you have read this far thank you for bearing with me my nonperfect EnglishI wish you all well and safe ,It scared the hell out of my PC,15
willbo,2,4,1qvttm,3,First post My memoryhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqixjfdemonicglassheadI have heard the advice in the comments of my first post and I simply dont know exactly what to do except avoid the head I wish I could throw it in a fucking volcano I will update this file every once in a while and post the document when I have gotten rid of the head or written enough This is mondayThis is Tuesday I approached the head to take some pictures They turned out alright but wont upload to my computer It says they are corrupted I will try to find another way to photograph it The head stayed still todayThis is Wednesday I picked the head up I could feel electricity and heard the buzz of static I put the head down I thought I saw it move and I stared for  minutes It shifted once and I instantly felt sick I ran upstairs to my room but could feel something ominous following me I think its still hereThis is Wednesday nightthursday morning around  am I woke up about an hour ago with sleep paralysis There was something in my bed with me Although thats just the usual sleep paralysis symptom it seemed different this time I could move again after  minutes or soWhat I think woke me up were the knocks on my wall in clusters of  They happen sometimes and I wasnt usually scared until tonight when I realized they may be linked to the head in some way The knocks persisted after I got up so I put on some Jefferson Airplane That always calms me down There were strange noises at my window I am not sleeping until the sun risesThis is Thursday I have not slept I have not gone downstairs But I will soon I am hungry The sun is up and I feel less creeped out anyways I have to pass the head when I go down there I am scared out of my mind about what Im about to do but Ive got to try somethingI brought it into my basement and put it near my water heater The electricity tickled my hands as I carried it even though I used oven mitts I brought a clove of garlic with me and placed the head over it thats supposed to weaken demons I guess When I put the garlic in it I immediately heard a crackle and saw sparks shoot to the metal of my water heater Then the room started to smell REALLY bad like sulfur I heard a high pitched hiss almost a scream Sparks hit the garlic I dont really know how to describe what happened next The garlic was just gone The smell stopped The hissing stopped All of this happened in a split second I had half expected nothing to happen and was so startled that I ran into the wall The panic that had overcome me had also apparently rendered me retarded I hit my face hard against brick blood splattering everywhere My fucking nose is broken now I went upstairs after that leaving a trail of blood and presumably fearpiss I feel like Im shivering and Im filled with adrenaline Im crying in a manly way I need a to lie down Ill try and do something to break Glasshead tomorrowThis is Friday I am blank I think its shock It has been a long day I woke up and realized my bed smelled like garlic The clove was under my pillow soaked in my own blood I freaked out and went to the basement with a hefty crowbar All of my bloodstains were gone except for a circle of blood where the rim of the head had previously rested It looked like a vampire had forgotten to use a coaster I think the head collected my blood inside of it somehow That seems impossible So is teleporting garlic And teleporting glass demon headsI drifted through my day in fear of the head showing up It finally did around I have a  week old kitten named Indie I love Indie more than anything I walked into my room and Indie was on the table barely moving suffocating inside the glass head I was consumed with rage and disgust at the evil thing I brought Indie to safety and threw the head out of my third story window I never heard it hit the ground Luckily indie is fine On the other hand I dont know when the head will show up again and now I know that it wants to hurt the things I loveThis is late friday night I heard my windows all smash at once right after I closed my eyes to go to sleep I panicked and hid under my covers like most of you would totally do I finally got up after convincing myself to not be such a pussy I checked and my windows were somehow fine But I really know that I heard it A cacophonous crash glass flying everywhere tinkling to the ground in my room But nothing to show One of my storm windows is missing however I am going back to sleep as the only other strange thing happening is the knocking on my ceilingThis is Saturday morning I went out to check where I threw the glass head and found my storm window shattered on the ground with a few drops of blood Hopefully my blood My father yelled at me for breaking the window and told me to try my best to fix it I never tell my dad about the head or anything because I dont like to see him look scared So I just went in the carriage house garage I guess Hasnt been used for carriages for almost  years and went to work piecing it back together It wasnt too badly shattered just a few pieces But when I put them all back in place there was a piece missing The empty space formed a very specific looking shape like an X or a cross That creeped my outThis is Sunday Nothing has happened today I hope to god this is over I will post this soon psI fear that I may encounter Glasshead in the future as it doesnt seem to stay broken Does anyone know a sure way to destroy something like this Or just to make it feel a LOT of pain It hurt my cat I want Glasshead to suffer,Glasshead This is my week,7
MischievousPasta,0,5,1qvcx1,2,I just cant anymore I am nothing I am too far gone My crude goodbye was interrupted by the hitch in my breath from the building pressure in my index fingerOne more squeeze and youre free You can even be romantic and shoot your poor broken heart you pathetic piece of shit BlastThere is only black not just closing your eyes and having a little bit of light peeking through your thin delicate eyelids but pure darkness Just darkness Hours and hours of darkness My body was just numb and it really wasnt bad You may think it was just terrifying being like that but oddly enough I enjoyed my time being dead Time is hard to understand when you dont see the sun rise and set or a conveniently placed clock that was in your room is not in your sight So those hours become days and eventually it felt like a century of just floating there in darkness until I felt a thump My whole body felt like it had fallen out of the sky and landed on the ground strange though there were bars surrounding the sides of my body Then my back was raised and I was propped up Very uncomfortably of courseWhat the hell is going onI could never forget that feeling my eyelids opening I was blinded White light seeped into my eyes and eventually into the back of my head There was this woman who stood in front of me My body was still positioned awkwardly but I could only see her She was beautiful everything about her really She had that strange super light brown hair that seemed blonde that I was cursed with It didnt really fit me well so I always dyed it Her eyes were muddy brown and showed a griefstricken face Her petite mouth showed a scar on her bottom lip that her lipstick failed to cover upWho are youThat isnt what matters right now but listen to me you have to pull throughWhat are you talking aListen god damnit wake up you dont want to do thisDo what I was getting angry getting screamed at by this bitchDieI cant really describe what happened next but I felt my body everysingleinch I was shaking and literally flailing things I didnt even think was possible I was soon gasping it felt like I was drowning Soon I felt air sweep into meLight even brighter than before Everything was blurry there was beepingChristI saw my disgusting step mother sobbing in the most ridiculous and fake way Bitch never gave me a break about my grades my shitty friends my drinking pretty much everything I did There were three doctors standing over me one holding a defibrillator the other putting pressure on my bottom ribWow I fucking missed I need to fix my shotThe last doctor was trying to calm down that piece of shit woman who actually didnt give a damn about me I chose a good time to try to off myself my dad was out of town on business I would hate to see him in the ambulance with usThe bullet just skimmed passed the liver She has lost a lot of blood but if she gets a transfusion in time we can probably stitch her up and fix up the internal bleeding as well She is a very lucky girl Mrs Scott never seen any attempted suicide like thisThank you doctor She is blessed to have you guys helping herIf I could just vomit right now I would fed up with all of her shitThen it hit me I looked at the gurnee and I was propped up just like before I grabbed the stainless steel plate next to me and held it up to my face My reflection spoke for itself Damn I was a mess I saw blood running down my bottom lip I had to askHow did I cut my lipThe doctor holding gauze on my wound looked at me with the most hilariously confused face everThere is a giant bleeding wound in your gut and you are worried about your lipI know what happened to my gut but I dont know what happened to my lipWell if you must  know you were a pain to get on the gurnee because your lip was caught on a nail that kept the floor boards in your room still I dont mean to ruin your night but it may leave a scar So will your stomach but that doesnt matter right Oh and I wiped a bit of your lipstick off there when ripping it off the nail Its a very nice color Its sexy on you He smiled and rubbed my leg with his free handDamn I like this guy there is just something about sarcastic assholes that just get me But what haunts me to this day is was that woman I met me,Ive Seen Death,7

psychopathicrhino,1,4,1qun8p,3,I woke up Saturday morning to the sun hitting my face through the blinds like I always do on the weekends I moved down in my bed to get my eyes out of the sun and reached for my cell phone It was  AM and there was only one text message from my cell phone company informing me that all my data and minutes had been used up Perfect My family has an everything shared plan and I knew that it was my mom and brother that used everything up I went to browse reddit when I remembered an email last week from my dorm managers saying they were working on the WiFi this weekend Guess I wasnt using my phone at all then After a disgruntled sigh I rolled out of bed and grabbed my towel I usually grab my clothes for the day so I can get dressed in the bathroom but this weekend my roommate had gone home so I took the opportunity of freedom and didnt bother After I showered I walked into my dorm and got dressed The time was  which was odd One of my suitemates the people my roommate and I share a bathroom with always comes back from working out at  and takes a shower immediately and if its being used he knocks and demands that you hurry up Every single morning Hes kind of a dick Anyway I just assumed he had slept in or took a longer work out even if it was out of his characterMy stomach started churning with hunger so I grabbed my wallet and decided to head down to the cafeteria and grab a breakfast burrito before starting on writing my music I consider myself an amateur composer for symphonic bands and I was working on a piece As I walked down the hall of my dorm I noticed that it was completely silent and not a single person was in sight It was an ominous feeling at first but then I recalled that it was the first weekend that we didnt have a home football game so everyone was probably just visiting their families Nothing out of the ordinary But when I arrived at the cafeteria there was absolutely no one I guess everyone really did leave for the weekend I thought to myself Our dorm had a new automated food dispensing system so I wasnt surprised that there were no workers either They were only there if the computer or conveyor belt crashedI got my breakfast burrito and a pint of whole milk and began to walk back to my dorm room My appetite was killing me so I opened up the burrito and took a bite on my way back Just my luck The school was too cheap to cook fresh meal all the time so I was used to leftover food but this tasted like it had sat out all night without being reheated at all That seemed low even for them I decided to cut my losses and toss the burrito and just eat some of the oatmeal I had in my room I walked up the stairs to the th floor and I looked out the window that oversees the entire campus When I looked out my stomach dropped into my feet Where were the guardsWhere were the guardsI should explain Our school has a military program similar to ROTC and its a big part of our school In the center of campus we have a statue that holds the heart of our school All through the school year two cadets from the military program are always guarding the statue from vandals Always They rotate frequently but there are always guards there Always Where were the guardsMy heart began to race as I started running to my room I dont know what I would do once I got there but I felt like I needed to be there As I turned the corner I stared down the hall and I saw a man He was a short man maybe  for some reason I couldnt make out any other features almost like they were always changing He was wearing a black suit and stood at the end of the hall Whistling He was whistling my piece that I was composing except in a really flat and eerie key I panicked and shouted Who are you Where is everyone He grinned and started laughing hysterically and looked me in the eyes Gone He stated with a hellish smile And he began to laugh again This time harder and raspier I ran into my room and locked myself in That was last Saturday I still remain in my room Ive run out of water but I still have enough food for a week so I dont know how much longer I can live I found a WiFi router somewhere in the dorm so I am able to get on the internet to post this to try to find an explanation Not for me but for the world Ive tried contacting friends near my school to come help even though they have never heard of the school and think Im crazy A few have come to help but after they message me that they are here I never hear from them again I looked on news sites trying to see if anyone has noticed anything strange I was reported missing but it appears that my university and anyone who was here just never existed to the outside world All day and all night I hear the man whistling and laughing  And whenever I look through my peephole I see his face smiling and looking into the innards of my eyes,Dorm Life,7
AzraelsRose,1,1,1qt4fa,4,Just a normal day Just like any other   I had a nice breakfast just like every other day Nothing special I let my dog out after I fed him so that he could do his business just like I always do I waited for the  Oclock bus at the shitty bus stop near my house The gum under the seat stirs a certain paranoia in my mind everyday that Ill find myself with someones chewing residue on my ass   When I finally got to school I found myself bored as usual Were reading The Giver in English which seems rather like an eighth grade project Anyway just a normal school day Nothing special not even a single new announcement on the PA   At least It was normal Everything happened in the blink of an eye Like lightning thundering booms filled the halls Nobody moved the whole cafeteria went silent Nobody knew what to do Fear swelled in my chest a horrible gutwrenching fear I didnt recognize these noises but the screams from outside were clear as day Hot tears filled my eyes   In a horrid flash of thunderous clashing we all realized the morbid reality of the situation Any curiosity we had was quickly put to rest as bullets shattered the internallywired windows on the doors of the cafeteria Glass flew across the closest rows slicing the poor victims in range Some dropped unmoving to the ground Bullets and glass ripped at any exposed flesh it could find freeing the warm blood from the suffering persons in the immediate range    At least their pain ended quickly The friends surrounding had to watch as they were coated in a thick film of the red unforgiving liquid which once held the life of those they loved The suffered expressions on their faces screamed silently but spoke much louder than their deafening cries   Youd think we would have run to the doors to escape from the madness inside Maybe it could have been like a movie where the guys teamwork to save the day Instead warm tears tickled our cheeks and debilitated our eye sight   We all sat quietly in shock unsure of what to do Sharp foot steps echoed through the dead air I waited for something to direct me I wanted to see some kind of authority figure enter and tell us everything will be okay I wished desperately to be able to blindly follow something and succumb to the beautiful lies of safety   Instead I greeted by a terribly placid face of the twisted and broken man who reaped the souls of the newly deceased before me A serious yet indifferent face worn by someone who I recognized as the football teams former patsy I saw him being beaten yesterday on the hood of a car I saw him most days in period  I even saw him in period four yesterday but he left and didnt come back  There seemed to be something different a certain hate filled his glossy eyes Not particularly new just intense Those hateful eyes swept across the room followed by the muzzle of his machine pistol until he found the senior football teams captain   He commanded him to get on his knees look at the ground and beg for forgiveness When hed heard enough he planted a single unforgiving piece of lead in his skull He didnt seem to feel anything He killed as casually as one might spread peanut butter over their bread   He calmly walked over the bodies his shoes making sickening noises in the blood He resembled someone who might break at any minute we were in the eye of the storm The lethally calming silence was broken only by the grotesque sloshing of the scarlet pool   He sat on a table drawing a snub nosed pistol and started reading to himself He occasionally looked up if someone made a noise If they didnt find silence immediately they lost their life It became apparent that if we broke silence if we took took away the quiet he took away our lives   I noticed how he seemed to be armed to the teeth with ammo and weapons He had one fragmentation grenade as well seemingly home made I cant help but think that one is scarier than multiple All I knew is that one group was going to die and it could include me Then again perhaps it wouldnt be I who accepted the bittersweet embrace of the ferry man of the dead There was no way of telling   We sat for around forty minutes before anything happened I wonder if he simply enjoyed having something else bend to his will for once instead of the other way around He must have planned everything out very well for I assumed he hit the office first Taking out communication would certainly help but surely someone would make it there to call for help   When the sirens started wailing he took great pleasure in offing someone to the beat of the wail Casually changing the magazine of his gun he chose different targets Chests knees shins shoulders whatever was exposed that could cause intense pain   He suddenly stopped moving beside a popular groups table a group of the easy girls and horny stupid guys Moving his muzzle from person to person until he found a pregnant girl Lacking any remorse he promptly shot her in the stomach Her blood covered the floor as well as her fragmented organs Hell it could have been bits of her fucking baby Nothing was left intact just bits and pieces Its amazing how much blood our bodies hold  More echoing footsteps filled the hallways Christ seemed like years since Id last heard that A good number of body armor clad police officers stormed into the giant coffin they pointed their weapons at the twisted man who stood among the crowd He calmy placed his weapons on the table hid his hands behind and moved towards the  center of the room The police told him to bring his hands up and he did So why was he wearing such a mischievous smile    As soon as I noticed the pin around his middle finger I pulled the nearest person in front of me So unfortunate that it happened to be my dearest friend Andrew The explosion killed anyone in the immediate range and the shrapnel eviscerated many of the unfortunate surrounding Too bad Andrew had to be one of them how could I be so selfish They found this note on the killer One day I will make everyone pay for what they did mocking me day after day and making my life a living HELL their screams will fill these empty halls along with the sound of gunfire and my name will become a household name just like Eric and Dylan I will finally be known for something I WILL have a purpose I wont just be that awkward kid who you mock anymore I will die with a smile on my face knowing I will be remembered My name will be burned into the hearts of those who hear my story They will remember me Richard DePute   If only someone had just taken the time to care for this guy Hell I could have been there for him a simple friend might have prevented this horrid event The only thing that will be burned into our hearts is the grotesque sound of the dying the earsplitting screams and the memories of the ones weve lost ,A Purpose,5

Bluefalcon,3,1,1qsg2b,4,My reoccurring figure started when I was three I had a mom that would always tuck me in One night I woke up amp found myself under my bed Three year old me thought nothing of it amp got back in my bed Ever since then I would see black hands coming up from my bed Always felt like I was being chased when I walked out of my room to go to the kitchen So not creepy stuff Just a lot of nightmares Creepy and dark nightmares Again nothing special about my story yet It all changed though when I hit my freshman year of high school The dream was seventh grade me on my bed talking to a black smoke on my ceiling What do we do now All of a sudden there was a force holding my down I couldnt breathe These big yellow eyes not talking yellow iris was all I could see and the most demonic voice Ive ever heard what needed to be did is done I was fighting to breathe amp just kept staring into its eyes Finally woke up and was stiff amp in a cold sweat That night was the start of my sleep paralysis Every nightmare was me being attacked And it was the same black figure Except it got bigger amp bigger Stronger too One dream when it attacked meit was HUGE and I actually heard it growl as it lashed at me Recently my dream was a man and his two dogs He was talking to me and then he stopped and said oh oh oh no And then it went dark Him amp the dogs closed their eyes They didnt want to see what was behind me I kept asking What What My heart pounded asking himReason why Im telling you all this is because I want opinions People say its just sleep paralysis and some people say I may have a demon Or its symbolism But this thing has tormented my head This thing has also tried to rape me woke up scared and found my hands covering my crotch remember feeling like I was being violated before I woke up And the fact it gets bigger stronger amp more violent is what is worrying me  Still dont know what needed to be did Scary thing isas a child I named it shadow Black shadowy figure with yellow eyes Any ideas,What needed to be did is done,5
Myzrath,0,2,1r8qvh,2,And as a childs eyes are burnt out from staring into the sun I too was blinded When I saw your flesh for the first time my brain salivated the pus of psychosis I craved your taste  your blood but most of all your life If only we could be alone forever with nothing but the chains of my insanity to bind us to our own personal hell I would shackle you with my adoration my obsession my eternal desire to eat you alive You belong to me forever You live and will eventually die to bleed for me You gutted me alive scraped out my insides with bestial lust There is nothing left inside me but the desire to eat you piece by piece I will be whole again once Ive consumed your flesh  as you have consumed my mind,My Stomach is Growling,4

ggtheblock,0,4,1r7a0r,3,Oh the things I wish I could say the words that I wish I could let loose upon the world that only her judgements have stopped To release the pressure of the truth and to ease the pain of silence would be such a wonderful colorful picture full of red and chaos The ones who hold such composure to the point of silence are often the truly volatile Holding and waiting for a moment that no one ever expects not even themselves Who could ever predict what that straw looks like Worlds will hear what I have to say so many stars snuffed out when Thay finger twitches How many faces will I tell How many voices will I bring into silences of their own One metallic word at a time each echoing for years to follow each bringing a deafening silence among their trees I will not touch one of my own for when I am done with my story I want them to hear my silence as I am berated with tardy words I want to hear their hearts break as loud as the thunderous explosion from the end of my pens My only hope is that you are not one of the strangers that I tell my story to,Silence,7
ChainerSummons,0,6,1r79o3,2,First allow me to assure you that I am certain of my sanity and of my cognitive abilities My name is Zachary WilhelmMy logic whether it is flawed or otherwise leads me to believe that each person knows fear Viewing these fears in those I observe shows that it is safe to say that each person has rooted elemental fearsMore accurately we are afraid of the unknown within the dark or more commonly the uncertainty of the future or that of death and what lies beyondIt is said by some that at one point such irrational fear was more than a leftover disposition from the dawn of mankind I believe that this collection of fears served our ancestors well and that they continue to serve usI assure you this phobia is not some obsolete racial trigger We need this now as much as everThere are some of us maybe even a few of you reading this who are aware of the presence of the unseen Aware that existence continues in darkness and that it is possible for that existence to expand beyond our initial perception Maybe like me you feel a pressure in your head and hear a light squeaking ring just barely audible to you whispering that the world has changed around you Others I have met and spoken to say that their first sign of these dangers is a smell of ozone as if a massive electrical charge had been displaced nearby rending the airI would speculate that we all feel these things from time to time in some form or another but that it does not register on our conscious level For those of us that have this sense that unease may be keeping us intact and connected to the world we know Ask yourself how it is possible in such a modern age of technology and advancement to simply disappear when we interact with so many people on a daily basis Every day more people just seem to cease to be Sure some Hell Ill be generous MOST of the missing are eventually found either dead alive or however they may be found Well give it a nice big optimistic percentage of  These pretenses seem solid even hopeful Four of five isnt bad at all rightWhat about the other one in five who blinks out of existence never to return Every town has that One in five disappearance that is just gone simply gone Its as if the mist just swallowed them right up isnt itThis is just so That is exactly what is happening All these obscuring veils appear naturally throughout the world with no exception Every continent nation town village And they are created under predictable and natural conditions Certainly there is no harm in the morning mists but have you ever seen fog when the air was too dry and cool to hold it aloft and reason dictates it should simply not be Within these otherworldly variations of nature the world around you may slip away and everything outside your vision ceases to be Sound and light fall away and you stand utterly isolated in your waning bubble of perception You may have felt this as I have I would prefer to think we all have but may have suppressed our  fearful sensesThese veils are like the curtains of a stage heavy and thick and not meant to be crossed by us the audience Behind them lies the workings of our world and what may lie further beyond them still into the epitome of our concept of the unknown or unknowable ,Of Things to Come,8
TheInnocentOne,1,2,1r61y4,2,The man would always be in the same corner He stood there in the shadows whispering my name His body was indistinguishable almost like a black cloud The shadow was rigid and sharp His face was cleardark and menacing He spoke to me so clear with an evil grin but didnt have a mouth He wore a hat that made me believe he was old He would wake me up at night His voice so deep I questioned my imagination Is this real  He told me that I should come with him but I never knew where I cried when I knew he was there Sometimes I tried to pretend I didnt notice He would crawl into my bed leaving me gasping for air Then I got too old I should be happy hes gone but I feel alone The fright that once consumed me now makes me feel hollow inside,The Man in my room,4

dylanr,7,2,1r10o8,3,This all happened about  or  years ago I was probably around  years old This was when I still somewhat believed in Santa Clause Im not saying I believed it but I didnt not believe in him either I think I liked the idea of Santa Clause more than the fact that some guy came into my house in the middle of the night  I grew up in a pretty cool family They wanted my brother and I to stay innocent as long as they could so they always told us they believed in all that stuff as well Anyway every Christmas Eve we went outside and looked up into the sky to see if we could see Santa We usually saw nothing but this one Christmas was different We had been outside for about ten minutes seeing nothing but stars We were getting ready to go inside when I noticed something It seemed like nothing at first but then I noticed it was moving It looked like an illuminated line flying in a zig zag pattern through the night sky At the time I figured it was proof that Santa was real But now that Im older Im starting to wonder what the actual fuck that was Do shooting stars move in a zig zag pattern Ill never know Thought people here could tell me what it is,What was it,5

sneakyazn,0,3,1qw31c,2,Hey guys dunno how to start this so here goesIm a data tech that works for Optus and i do occasional out of hours call out work where i go to Telstra exchanges and swap faulty dslam cards So these exchanges are unmanned and everywhere but there are a few that just give me the creeps like the one in the city on Pier st So one night i get a call out to this particular exchange Its massive something like  storys high and unmannedI go out there park my caddy in the laneway its only got one entrance and stretches for like  metres get my backpack and equipment and enter the buildingSomewhat like Get Smart i swipe a card and several doors open giving me access obviously not on a grand scale as get smart but you get the idea i sign into the register and swipe myself through the ground floor lift doors and push the button for the lift to level As im waiting for the lift i call up nmcdsl NOC fault teams just to let em know im on site and one of the testers answers he says hi and i reply hey whats up howve yah been All happy chappy likeIm in the lift and just got to lvl  doors open up and basically as you exit the lifts you enter a massive square lobby about  metres wide and something like  metres long Double doors on the left side for another room and double doors at the other end of the lobby down a long hallway that spans mtrs wide and is about  mtrs long Its pitch black and hard to see a thing and all ive got is lighting from my itorch app whilst still on the phone with headphones in one eari walk to the light switches at the back of the lobby just before the hallwaycorridor i flick em on and nothing so i flick em off an on again in quick succession like id get some sort of different result Still nothing and i think nothing of it but feeling a little weary i tell the tester ill head to lvl  and check that end out first before going back to lvl I go to lvl  check out some equipment took about min and everything seems to be legit so unfortunately i had to head back up to lvl  and so I get into the lift and head for lvl  As the door opens up to the lobby i notice immediately that the lights are on and im like telling the tester everything thats happened thus far Of course hes pissing himself laughing while im just well pissing myselfBeing cautious i look around the lobby nobody in sightok i think to myself i should be right i cautiously walk to the light switch at the back of the lobby flicking them off and on again oh yeah now you work Making light of what i see i laugh it off with the tester on the phone and make way to the double doors at the end of the hallway So im walking and having a yarn with this guy on the phone when im almost at the end of the hallway Swipe card in one hand and ready to buzz in through the doors when for some unknown weird reason call it intuition i felt like someone was staring at me from behind I Spin around on my heel only to stare at this black face staring right back at me it was from the left side of the entrance of the hallway my heart jumps into my Throat and im thinking holy crapbasketsSo as i stare at this black face staring back at me it pokes further out from the side of the hallway revealing a green collar and only then did i realize i was holding my breathI take another breath and this guy walk out into the hallway seeing as he was a normal guy i relaxed and laugh and said to him man you scarred the bajeebus outa me He replies so did you and im like how and he says he heard weird voices outa no where and doors opening and closing and lights flickering and stuff and that when he came to look that no one was thereI said to him i thought he was a ghost He laughed and he said i may not be one but im sure there are some around i hear things and just talk aloud Just to be sure i asked if there was anyone else in here however he said that i was the only person here i dunno if he was pulling my leg but that left me thinking uughhh yeahh ok im gonna do my work he mentioned he was finished and parted waysI swapped the dslam card and everything was up and running after something like  min deciding itd be an idea to empty my bowls i went took a dumpAs i exit the toilets on level  i notice the lights were all off i wasnt even in the toilets for that long it was a power s and i had left all the lights on and i knew the other dude was long gone by now Thinking on one hand man should have bailed rather then going to the toilet but at the same time im glad i did because id have soiled myself by now I grabbed my bag and swiftly got to the elevator an pressed the buttonWith my Back to the elevator watching everything about me senses all keen I get in the lift and get to the ground floor signed out headed for the caddy in the ally way and bailed like no tomorrowDriving home i was constantly thinking about what happened and i remember that when i got to site that the place was empty no other cars nothing I also remember that this guy had nothing with him who goes to an exchange without any tools or equipment at this time of day Or at least leave whilst holding them on his person I then remember that i was the only one that had signed into that log book during those hoursI dunno what to speculate here but im just thinking that aint normalI just know i get the tingles up my neck when i go into places like that and i hope i wont have to go back any time soon at something like am,Telstra Exchanges  SFW,5

PapaFedorasSnowden,3,1,1qu464,2,All I altered was mine and my neighbours name here is the story of how I stopped being a skepticAnd there I was with my routine mocking of horror movies watching them for comedy This week was different rain poured down from the heavens flooding the streets the winds blew swiftly like a falcon diving from amidst the clouds to catch its prey All lights were out on that cold night the coldest of my South Brazilian winter the glowing blaze from the stone fireplace was the only source of warmth in the whole house and the last breath of modernity available my laptop was used solely for the movie It was funny being the skeptic I am seeing all those daemons the actors eyes wide open shivering not of cold as I was but of pure ghastlinessthe sheer thought of that being real gave me the chucklesbut I will say it it doesnt anymoreI must remark that I was alone mum was at her boyfriends younger brother at his friends they had no prospect of coming back until noon of the following day which for a teenager meant freedom Everything was quiet except for the odd plank gritting contracting and expanding from the contact of the cold winter air and the warmth of a fire tiny sparks threatening to burn everything down but cowering whenever the chance to  spread a fire was had A sound could be heard coming from the large wooden door at the front of the brick covered house we inhabited it was our new neighbour Mortimer Mort as he insisted I called him was a tall dark almost blue man of Egyptian descent to where could easily confuse him for Anubis however on that gloom all that could be seen from him was his eyes and bright teeth Sorry to bother you but you dont happen to have a candle do you His deep voice scratched my ear His voice matched his body and face perfectly but it made it impossible for him to sound friendly I think I might have one or two I replied reluctant come in while I get it should take just one minute I continued still not sure if that was the case Mort had this thing where hed follow you around and while he barely fit through the door his steps like his breathing were impossible to perceive I went through the living room took a left past my old grandpas clock now marking am followed by a right careful not to hit the chinaware into the kitchen As I always do I reached for the light and when I switched it a strong white light shone in front of me I saw a jackal staring into my eyes and I stared into his those dark eyes whatever went in there never came out it looked like the passageway to another life It cant be that I thought none of this exists I am just tired was my last thought until the shadows took over the light Mortimer stood there while my stupor self watched the dark kitchen blankly I shook my head Im such a clever boy I uttered  while I flipped the switch back off Going further in the kitchen I find the drawer where we stored candles for this typo of occasion I reached for one grabbed it and turned to what appeared to be floating eyes and smile saying here you go wanna light it already  I grabbed a match scratched the box and took it to the wick As soon as the candle was lit I heard a loud crack followed by a scream the man who once stood in front of me was nowhere to be seen I called for him while a ghastly shiver went from the tip of my toes to the last of my hairs Now out of the kitchen I looked at the clock am what had I been doing for so long I thought With my heart up my throat being as silent as possible I creep around the corner I see the same jackal now behind the fire with a grin As the fire fades I see Mort asleep in the couch I go to wake him up but he is not there A tingling sensation climbs my right leg I turn around nothing to be seen The tingle is up my waistline now I am nervous as I had never been looking frantically for a visual cue all dark I decide that I should relight the fire as I walk towards it with candle in hand I trip on a body I get up and kneel by the body upon touching it I realise it is cold I faintFrank Frank wake up A soothing feminine voice could be heard saying as I opened my eyes confused people tell me I was in a coma for  hours that I had hit my head or something I mention Mortimer where is he ouch my head The lady replies I do not know who you are talking about I go on to ask about him I remember everything so lucidly but nobody knows what I am saying They claim to have found me laying on the ground using a street dog Jack as the neighbours called him as a pillow To this date I do not know whether I was hallucinating dreaming or if something paranormal happened and to be honest I am too afraid to find outEDIT Formatting,I still dont know what happened but I am no longer a skeptic,3
LadyDevastation,2,5,1qsg2e,2,I would just like to start this off by letting you know I dont tend to share things too often but this this I couldnt keep to myself Ever since I was little Ive loved anything that was warm to the touch To this day the comfort of a blanket seems as if it can fend off any danger Adult me is well aware my flannel sheets wont vanquish intruders or keep away the things that go bump in the night yet a part of me still clings to the comfort the warmth brings It started about a year ago the nightmares Id wake up in hot sweats with the covers tossed about my queen size bed my only protection twisted up around me instead of on me Whenever I woke up I could never remember my dream merely the mixture of terror and helplessness that came with waking up Only nightmares could make my stomach churn in such a manner They came suddenly lacking a reason but seeking a place in my dull life Being a young woman in the working world gave me very little time to build an interesting life around the mountains of work I was always assigned Theyd wake me up and the warmth would lull me back to sleep they werent too troubling in the beginning Until one day I realized I hadnt truly slept in a very long while Falling asleep was never a problem it was staying asleep The nightmares were stealing away my slumber I was a wreck at work my career was suffering and I couldnt let that happen So I started to see a therapist after Id worn out all my at home options Trust me a therapist was my last possible option I wasnt one to talk about my feelings after all The first session was a bit awkward my therapist was a woman in her fifties speckled greys that were obviously left there to give you the impression she was a wise woman The muted colors and odd paintings didnt add to the negative attitude I had going into it She asked the stereotypical questions until time was up Week after week I skidded around the real problem the nightmares the feelings Id wake up to Until finally I couldnt avoid it I wanted it fixed I just wasnt sure sharing would help Anyways I finally fessed up to the woman Something in her face seemed to change like things finally clicked She started these exercises sometimes shed have me close my eyes and imagine things Or try deep breathing techniques to get my heart rate down when I did wake up After that she really started to focus on the nightmares Since I couldnt remember a damn thing about them we started slow She had had me close my eyes hands resting on my neatly crossed legs She talked to me slipping me into a state close to sleep Asking me to let my mind lead me She started to have me describe what I sawMistake This was the first mistakeHowever I followed her direction and slowly began to describe the darkness around me That sort of darkness that feels like it could last forever but a part of you knows it wont The kind youre not sure is hiding the danger from you or hiding you from it Still the uneasiness sets in and all you can do is wait for the light So I described the thickening darkness and uneasiness that seemed to consume me Thats when she reminded me to focus on what I could see not what I was feelingSo I stopped and took in a slow breath before continuing Darkness describing every inch of it Black Solid Slowly it faded and I was staring myself in the face Pale blue eyes holding a surprised expression glistening back at me in the mirror that sat in the all consuming darkness I noticed my neatly placed dark locks and normally ivory skin before even getting the the grotesque creature that hung at my shoulderBehind my fairly average image stood a female like creature I described her to my therapist in great detail assuming this image was one of my imaginations own design No part of me alarmed by the odd image that seemed to have been haunting meMistake number two So we ended the session and I left with the knowledge that perhaps my past was haunting me or at least thats what my therapist told me That night I pulled myself under my cover comforted by its warmth in hope that I wouldnt wake up But I did I woke up in hot sweats as usual the feelings all the same only I remembered and the memory terrified me Night after night I remembered and night after night I kept myself from the peaceful sleep I used to knowFor weeks it consumed me the image of the woman haunting me Until one night one night where I found sleep Or so I thought The morning light was close to breaking the dark morning but I was up It was odd I hadnt remembered my alarm jolting my slim body awake yet I was up I drudged past my bed foggy vision leading me to my bathroom I stopped and yawned before my eyes met the image that I refused to believe belonged to me No longer standing over my shoulder but staring in me face was the woman that had haunted me Matted dark locks that slid over myits shoulder cold soulless eyes that lacked the emotion my eyes always held But the skin was the worse pale as moonlight and splattered with blood I knew didnt belong to meIt was then I broke into tears my nightmare had no longer stayed covered by slumber but had crawled its way into my real life The dark desires I thought that lived in my head had become my reality Staring at me was the proof hands dripping with the blood of another It covered most of my body warm and sticky to the touch as my salty tears mixed with the deep color that stained my cheeksThe disappointment was worse than I had remembered waking up to I was staring at the face of a murderer and one who truly enjoyed The image had belonged to me there wasnt a doubt in my mind With each blink the memories flooded me overwhelmed me The screaming pierced my ears through the silence of my bathroom I cringed as I remembered the face of my less than qualified boss begging as my hands slid the knife through her still beating chest The mist across my shirt suggested she had pleaded long after her lungs had flooded with the liquid that was meant to course through her body Why her Why not someone without a husband or two gifted children I had chosen to kill someone who I knew would be missed it wasnt enough to take a life I had to ruin some too That twisted mindset crept back as the memories had begun to haunt meRemorse that was the feeling I was missing While I felt disappointed I wasnt convinced it was for my actions or for my lack of inventiveness Months of planning in the night had erupted into merely one pool of blood on suburban vinyl flooring Those feelings still haunt me even here with my orange clad uniform they consume me Yet I yearn to hear the screams fill my ear I ache to hold that knife in my hand But dont worry here I stay One more heartless soul put away one less person to harm you or your pretty little family They let us use the computers once a week free time Its nice really gives me the chance to warn youDont seek to unlock the monsters let them hide in the dark Because if you let them out you might become the nightmare you fear ,My Own Nightmare,7

JustAnotherLondoner,0,2,1r8zg3,2,Last year my brother Steve fell ill and took himself to hospital He wasnt insanely ill but due to the fact that he kept fainting and falling into things he felt the hospital was the safest place for himself to be After an examination he was told that an ear infection was causing his balance to be off and him to faint They kept him in for observation until he stopped fainting and would be safe at home alone He told me that the first night he couldnt sleep The man in the bed next to him would groan throughout the night in agony He didnt know what was wrong with him but it was too late for a nice chat so he remained silent The second night wasnt much different but Steve managed to sleep for a few hours from about am until around am He hadnt fainted for a while and felt he was getting a lot better hoping that he would be able to go home soonLater that day the man in the bed next to him awoke Hi Im Jim He introduced himself What are you in for My brother explained his ear infection and that he had fainted and fallen into things and asked why Jim was hereWell He began I dont really know I was only in here for a broken leg initially Then I fell ill I think theyre keeping me hereWhat How Steve asked When I was close to recovery I told the nurses that I felt ready to go home Later that night I woke up to see a nurse leaving my bed She didnt see me but I noticed that my leg felt funny I think she did something to it I dont know what but the next day I fell terribly ill with pneumonia This was nearly a week ago and im still here not getting much better Dont tell them when youre ready to go home just go His face was dead serious Steve was a bit worried about Jims story but assumed he was a bit crazy and paranoid about the nurses He ignored Steves advice and told the nurse that he was ready to go home He felt the disappointed gaze of Jim fall upon him as the nurse walked awayWell Good luck Jim sighed I hope they let you out Thanks Steve replied The nurse later returned and confirmed that the doctor would look at his ears the following day That night Steve had another restless night Jim was groaning again but Steve was beginning to grow used to that Suddenly the groaning stopped The silence of the night was instead met with the screams of JimAARGHH STOP GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME DONT YOU DARE PUT THAT NEEDLE NEAR ME FUCK OFF the curtain was closed around him Steve couldnt see what was going on He was too scared to speak The curtain swiped open Steve pretended to be asleep his eyes slightly open He saw a nurse leave Jims bed Jim was laying in his bed holding his legs AAre you okay Steve whispered What the fuck just happened I told you man The nurses are keeping me here They saw that I was getting better again and she just stuck a fucking needle in my leg again Im not getting out of here any time soon Jim replied He revealed his leg to Steve  there was a small hole with blood dripping out of it He had indeed been injected with something Steve laid down in shock Jim decided that now the attack was over it was safe to sleep When Steve awoke the following morning Jim was gone Steve asked a nurse where Jim was and the nurse apologetically replied Mr Morris passed away late last night How could that be He was well enough to hold a conversation with Steve just hours earlier to his apparent death The injection It must have been the injection I visited Steve later that day and he told me of the events He begged me to sign him out and get him home that day He was desperate He was not in safe hands there after all I tried to sign him out but the doctor assured me that it was in the best interest to stay one more night to ensure the infection had completely cleared I reluctantly agreed I visited again the next day and Steve was in a terrible state He was pale his face was sweaty He even had a temperature he was in a much worse state to what I had seen him like the day before The doctor told me it was just a side affect of the medicine they had given him Steve told me otherwise They attacked me Kate Thats the only way i can describe it I was pretending to sleep late last night and a nurse came in She rolled me over and prepared my leg for an injection You know what they do they wipe it with some sort of liquid I startled her when I asked her what she was doing She told me it was just procedure I asked her to stop and said that id rather not have the treatment She got aggressive Called another nurse One held me down while she injected me I screamed but nobody came Now all of a sudden Im ill Im not getting out of here Kate Im going to die in this bed Just like Jim He began rocking back and forth as I tried to comfort him He was soaked with sweat I asked his doctor what was wrong with him and the doctor told me it was pneumonia My heart sunk It was just like Jim Steve was right  he wasnt safe here I needed to get him out Ill be back tomorrow to get you out of here I told Steve They wont let me today and now that they have a clue that I want to get you out theyre all watching me I was almost escorted out when I shouted at the doctor Tomorrow I can do it quietly when im not being watched so closely Steve agreed The following day I returned to the hospital Steve told me the nurse had not returned that night I put him in a wheelchair and took him to the toilets I gave him some clothes that I had collected from his apartment and he changed I asked a nurse to bring me any belongings he had left with the desk stating that he had asked me to take them home for him The nurse agreed and brought me his things without a word We escaped and I took him home Before leaving we slyly stole the sign out clip board and Steve was able to sign it He was legally free Three days later Steve was found dead in his apartment The pneumonia had gotten worse and without treatment took his life He left a note It read I was taken into the hospital with an ear infection I left without said ear infection but with bigger problems I was abused I have made a realization either the secret injections being given are procedures to keep population down or they are ways to make medicine companies money After all they make money through our illness  they dont really want us to recover I would not advise anyone who is not dying to stay in a hospital  definitely not alone There you will never truly be in safe hands,In safe hands,4
ephique,0,1,1r8wrl,2,It was Friday and myself being unemployed at the time was up for something to do You see my girlfriend was invited to a party by her new friends from her dramacrew she recently joined and she wanted me to join her This party took place on the other side of our suburban ruin of a town and it made common sense for her to message me the location whenever she knew the exact address again she didnt know these people that wellAround  pm I left our apartment to head to the party still not knowing the exact location I figured I could at least walk to the busstation that had buses taking me to that part of town Luckily I got a message from one of her new friends on the way there Describing how to get to the destination My girlfriend hadnt paid her phone bill and had to use a friends phone to message me she has done this before She hates her network companyI took the bus taking me as far as I could buswise After that I had to get a taxi the only taxi driver I ended up finding had never driven anyone to that location before apparently Im guessing the dramapeople pretended they had taxis whenever they needed one Good practiceThe taxi driver who I believe was Mexican dropped me off at the address and headed back for the city shortly after I had no idea her friends was throwing a party out in the middle of nowhere and it was getting really chilly so I didnt spend too much time figuring out the mysteries of the universe out there I ran up to the doorMy first impression was that this must have been the most quiet party in the history of parties I heard no music no laughing no tapping Nothing Before I knew it I was banging on that door it had no ringer or anything I had to pound that thing No one openedI felt pretty confused at this point I did still have my phone though Although calling my girlfriend was no use cause I already knew her network always shut off inbound and outbound calls and texts whenever she hadnt paid Out of desperation I phoned her friends number but no one answered I assumed they were partying too hard to hear the phone ringing and I found myself mislead by a tired taxi driver who took me to the wrong house Thats the only explanation that made any sense to me what so everNow I was out of options I couldnt walk back into town cause not only would I not know the exact roads out there but it was also ridiculously freezing outside I tried banging on the door again and again maybe an old couple lived there or something and they would wake up if I hit that door hard enoughI ended up smashing the lever on the door accidentally the door wasnt even locked I looked around to make sure that no one was watching me because I did realize that being desperate or cold wouldnt really vouch well in court I couldnt see anyone so I sneaked into the house Whenever I had made sure no one was in the first room of the house I closed the door behind me Not being sure what I was looking for I walked around aimlessly trying to figure out if anyone was home or not my mind started to wander off into finding explanations I remember one being that they were playing a prank on me which wasnt a bad theory since the door was after all left unlockedI didnt check much of the first level of the house before I started walking up a great set of stairs leading me in a spiral upwards It was very creaky so if anyone was awake in this house theyd easily hear me at this point I figured no one was cause the entire house was dead silent with the exception of the noise I brought into it myselfUpstairs I found a bedroom just across the hall from where the spiral staircase ended It seemed to belong to a girl a small girl It was an empty bed in it and paintings on the walls you know the type kids do in preschool that parents end up pretending are works of genius to make the kid feel better and gain confidence Yeah those kind of paintingsI got shocked by my own textmessage signal that I stupidly left on way too loud it was from an unknown number I was hoping it was my girlfriend or her friend explaining the mixup or something The text saidAlright we are all set I hope you havent fallen asleep my little unemployed darling Make your way to th Radcliffe Street its not too far from the super market by the busstation Oh and this is Jessies phone sorry forgot to pay my fascist phone bill again Sorry that it took me so long to message Love you ,Take Me Out,3

again and she finally told me that i while ago my one of my uncles used to sleep there when he was drunk He was tall man was married and never had any kids of his own One day i still remember hearing that they had found him death in his room He had hanged him self living everyone of his family wondering why he had done it No one knows till now Without knowing me and my brother had called him had

mollyissleeping,6,4,1r5kz2,0,The first time I saw Him I was entering my friends house as He darted quickly in front of me then as silently as He had come disappeared into the garage He was completely black tall and slim and as smooth as death He was at the bottom of the stairs directly in front of me as I entered the house having just taken my friends dog for a quick walk This was around a month ago I call him the Shadow Man and He took  long strides and vanished The dog which is often very yappy ran up the stairs unaware of the other being in the house But the cat was walking beside the Shadow Man and looking up at Him as if he was His follower After the shadow man disappeared the cat rubbed against the garage door and mewed at me questioningly He was as curious as I was I didnt get a bad feeling from this man but it was unexpected I was kind of creeped out so I ran up the stairs I told my friend in all seriousness what I had seen and Im not sure if she believed me I barely believed myself Honestly I thought I had imagined it It was dark I was already scared from being outside at  oclock at night by myself and at first tried to convince myself that I had seen my own shadow But the way it moved the way He moved I couldnt lie to myself I just keep thinking about Him Its hard to forget someone when you see them everywhere you look I see Him in my dads room standing in the corner I see Him disappearing behind the curtain in the living room I see Him staring at the TV in the basement And when I drove by my moms house where I spend half my time He was watching me from the window I cant see His face but I could feel Him watching me He doesnt scare me He gives me a sense of myself in some weird way Im waiting for the moment that He decides to make a real entrance and step fully into my world I dream about Him I need Him,Chasing Shadow Man,4
EyeHuxinfiniteplus,5,0,1r1irm,1,httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsnpkhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsnaxitheworstthingieverheardSo a little over a year ago I posted a couple of different things that happened to me back in  There were a couple of things that happened between here and there that I never got around to posting too Anyway here I am Over a year later in the hopes that someone can help me because something similar has recently happenedSo while the other stories took place in NC this all happened in MD It happened about a week or two before Halloween And all of this was very close together and it all happened at my girlfriends house in Baltimore Arbutus area for the locals Her mom and younger brother have been living with her for almost a year now until her mom can get back on her feet due to some unrelated personal issues Im only bringing this particular thing up in case someone may find it relevant Her brother is  Mom shes over  if not right at  NowAfter dinner one night we were all sitting around the table talking I excused myself to go shower I have to get up at  in the morning and generally just shower the night before work so Im not in a groggy rush So Im in the shower and theyre doing whatever it is they do as far as I know I remember and never will forget probably the feeling of something tap me on the shoulder It didnt necessarily feel like a finger I pushed it out of my head almost immediately thinking I had brushed the wall or a towel or something And that was it That was all that happened in there I got out dried off and put on some clothes and left the bathroom It was quiet in the house No chatter no tv and no video games I just assumed everyone went to bed and headed upstairs to the attic bedroom my girlfriend sleeps in It was dark minus the flickery light that turned out to be a bunch of candles in the middle of the floor My girlfriend and her mother playing with a Ouija board They asked if I wanted to play and I simply refused Part of me wanted to leave because those things make me uncomfortable as it is But I just layed down on the bed and tried to sleep Mostly watching them Mostly feeling uncomfortable whenever one of them giggled about it or laughed and said it was stupid which bothered me quite a bit They were done when after the second or third try mom turned the disc or whatever its called upside down and said she was done They put it away and that was that It dawned on me later that whatever I felt in the shower would have happened about the time they started with their ouija seancesSo a few nights later Im back at her house I havent heard of anything and honestly put the whole thing out of my head That night I woke up at almost the exact same time she did I looked at her while she looked forward to the head of the bed and immediately screamed And not like a jumpy something at the movies jumped out at me scream Pure terror I pulled her close and cradled her and didnt see or notice anything I turned on the light Nothing was there What she described to me was so horrifyingly familiar She said at the head of the bed not  feet away stood a figure Not actually standing though More like bending over and reaching out for her She told me two days later what actually woke her up was she heard something talking in the room that said in a whisper what should we do with her Thats when she looked up and everything happen I did make a mental note that it was after  oclock The only reason I noted it is because after calming her down realizing I had less than an hour until I had to go to work She got up and left when I left The reason I say this one in particular is horrifyingly familiar and wanted me to come to you with this in the hopes someone may be able to help me figure something out is if youll read the story at the top  its almost the same thingNow Im an atheist I havent prayed in years And my girlfriend knows this Im not against it Ill pray along to be respectful if the family is praying at dinner or at a funeral But one night she woke me up shaking Telling me that the room didnt feel right And she was scared She asked me to pray with her Like she wanted me to say a prayer for protection I didnt know how to react but this was extremely out of the ordinary for her So I went with it And after a minute of reaching into the back of my head for things to say she started breathing slower Calmer She let me finish then thanked me and said I think it worked She laid down and eventually we both fell asleepThe only things other than little squeaks and creaks which could honestly just be the house being a house and making house noises was when she was downstairs trying to sleep I guess She didnt sleep in her room for a while unless I was there and as I just recently moved to night shift thats been a lot Anyway she said she heard her brother upstairs leaning in the chair which he does while he plays on his laptop So she sends him a text A simple stop leaning Not a minute later the text comes back and says Im in bedThats all I know or have heard for right now Ive spent fewer nights there since all that happened Her mom burned sage in the room or whatever the cleansing plant is sage right Said some prayers And Im hoping thats it,So this recently started happening again,1

CityofEvil,2,4,1qy5xr,1,Some back story Im  now so this only happened about  years ago circa  around the time I was  and my brother was  so my recollection is hazy and his is nonexistent although he was sleeping during the incident and Ive never inquired During this time we slept in the same room together myself in a separate bed with about ft in between the foot of mine and the foot of his Our beds are pressed against parallel walls with our heads on them We had one window in the room in a niche and the following happened sometime in the very early hours of the morning say am No lights are on and the window cant produce any large shadows onto my bed nor my brothers Anyway on with the story itselfI have always been a pretty heavy sleeper even as a young child I never awoke in the middle of the night for anything short of an explosion I exaggerate maybe a little and I was not prone to night terrors of any short On the contrary I am fairly good at lucid dreams but I digress On this particular night nothing to my knowledge was different I hadnt witnessed or had some traumatising event occur to me I was just sleeping waiting for day to come At some point I cant remember the time but it was pitch outside I woke up to my brother whispering the words   ltMy namegt I hate youWhy this woke me up itself is strange maybe its because I heard my name being called and its instinct I was drowsy didnt look up straight away and said something along the lines ofltMy brothers namegt what did you just sayNo response Did you say you hated meI looked up and at the side of my brothers bed next to his headboard on the wall itself I saw a very dark figure that looked like a short man The room was dark but there was always enough light to vaguely make out the other sibling This was different It was pure black like a room with four walls and no exit As Spongebob would say advanced darknesshttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvXjtkWZuCXo I dont know how it was possible but I could clearly make out his arm and hand outstretched with his fists clenched like he was choking someone I did the cliché kidthing and hid under my covers I counted to some number and emerged He was still there I can clearly very vividly remember choking on my own words I meant to yell Moooommy but what I let out was barely audible I went back under the covers and I can remember shoving myself between my mattress and the wall getting as close to it as possible I eventually fell asleep and in the morning I looked at the spot where it was standing There was nothing there Just air My brother was still asleep the door was still shut no one could have moved something that was there in the time frame I named it The Shadow Thing and still think about it from timetotime but its never happened again so why worry about it rightMy theories What I believe happened was I was young exhausted and imagined it I know you probably think it was a dream but it was so vivid I remember it and I felt it I felt the fear it was definitely real I felt it in the room with me and I definitely heard my brother say that one phrase Im adamantly atheist I dont believe in ghosts spirits messages from the other side and have never had anything like this occur to me before or after,The Shadow Thing,5
Ladyrosalie,0,1,1qy4nl,1,When I was little about thirteen years old or so my grandma came to live with us She slept in the room my sister and I slept in and so we got a bunk bed I slept on top my sister on bottom My grandma slept across the room in her own bedOne night it was winter I woke up suddenly and turned over to look at my grandma It was dark with only a faint light from the hallway yet I could see so clearly Like it was day or something I saw what looked like a shadow enter the room It walked to my grandmas bed which was near the door As it walked closer to the bed it turned from a shadow to a what looked like a mummy figure I not mean bandagesIt looked more burned Its skin if thats what you want to call it was very wrinkled but tight to its body It had no clothes on and was black and various shades of brown It walked with its back bent like an old man But I could sense it wasnt human There was no wayI couldnt look away I just stared as it reached my grandma It stopped and turned to look at me I wanted to scream but I couldnt I felt like I couldnt breathe It didnt have eyes It was black socket like yet it glowed at the same time It opened its mouth also black like nothing was there It let out a croaking noise inhuman sounding I dont even have the right words to describe it I don think there is words to describe itIt took a small step towards me and I passed out I woke up the next morning my grandma was already up and making breakfast I could t eat though not that I usually did anyway I couldnt remember if it was a dream or not Im still not sure what I saw to this day I dont believe it was death My grandma is still very alive and well as is my sister Maybe it was just a dream If not the thing might still be in my house Watching Waiting For what I dont want to know,Maybe it was Just a Dream,2
Zevonni,4,3,1qxe8k,2,I am  years old and I am currently married I was employed and my hours were from  PM until  AM My husbands job was sometime in the morning I cherish my husband and would give him anything he wanted But it has all changed   One day my boss had told me to go home on hour earlier then usual I had left and went straight to my house not wanting to waste a precious moment without my husband I sneaked in through the back of the house to surprise him I know everyone will think of this as silly but I had a scary Halloween costume It took a bit of time to put on but I managed to put it on soundlessly I went up the stairs careful not to make a sound As I walked up I heard this grunting and a sudden  THIS IS MUCH MUCH BETTER Coming from my room I thought it was just my husband watching shows because that what he would do at this time while waiting for me He slept during the day just for me and I knew that But there seemed to be this knot tightening in my stomach I have no idea why that was I went to our room and found that the door was slightly open I looked inside and I saw a women on top of my husband I couldnt believe it From there the knot it my stomach loosened and I knew what I had to do I quickly made my way back down the stairs Knowing that if they heard a sound they would immediately disengage and hide I didnt bother taking care of the small noises I made since they would be too engrossed to notice I grabbed the deadliest knife I could find and went back up From here there would be no point in trying to keep my presence a secret I walked in the room and said  Hello there Mack and who do we have here I hid the knife in my pocket and since they couldnt see it it was better to keep that a secret Why your back an hour early Julianna meet our neighbor Megan Megan meet my wife Juli I couldnt believe my ears Did he just say that was our neighbor I know she wasnt I have been at where my husband works before and saw her there We made small talk and I found out that she lives a whole  miles from us But still I made it sound like I believed him She probably would have forgotten that conversation anyways Hello Julianna and may I ask why you are dressed like that I had just noticed that she was wearing a suit and skirt both black It seemed pretty easy and quick to put on though I was just discussing some work with your husband Juli That did it First she stole my husband from me now she dares try and lie I could not help but take the knife out and start stabbing and stabbing I continued to stab until my heart seemed content and all my anger has been unleashed Curiosity then took the better of me I just had to see what they were actually doing and saw something that made me regret my handiwork I took a look at the tv and it seemed that porn was on I had looked at the wall when peeking in and saw the reflection of the tv on the wall And in fact they were actually doing work today I continued by making them each a grave There was already a large hole that reeked if decomposing flesh I dug up the hole and after giving them both a proper burial left them together in that same huge wall Well then time to look for my th husband,And now hes gone,5

Christianjohnm,1,2,1qtdub,1,This is a collections of sightings of a man who visited our town about a decade ago This man was called Gaabigguwat which in our native language means The Big Haired One This man was said to be a survivalist sent out to live in the woods for a few months near our communityAs a kid I had a lot of friends parents say to stay in at nights and to not go out because of these sightings I didnt really believe them at first I always thought that these were stories they told just to get us kids not to go outEver since I experienced seeing this big haired person Ive collected a bunch of stories of other people seeing this guyMy sighting was when I was  I stayed late over at a friends place when we looked out the window and noticed something rustling through the garbage And my friend lived in the area where this guy was sighted the most We wondered what it was we dont know anyone who couldve been searching that aggressively in the garbage especially at the time of night it wasAnother sighting made big news in our community a few weeks later This family that lived near where my sighting occurred was out of town for a few days and when they returned home there was food and other stuff every where on the kitchen floor They also noticed that something was living beneath their trailer When the cops investigated it there was pots and pans cereal boxes a mat where something was sleeping and fire supplies By this time the person was long gone he probably stayed there for a night or two and leftWhen I told my gfs mother these stories last year she told me a sighting she experienced around the same time my sightings happened My gfs mother lives in the same area where these sightings happened She told me that one day while she was standing outside her place smoking a cigarette she noticed a big bearded white guy in tattered clothes and big rubber boots walking behind the houses and looking into the windows He looked into the window where my gfs little brother was sleeping who was a baby at the time She said she didnt recognize who the guy was Its a small town almost entirely nativesThere are more sightings of this guy but these are the most significant to me Other stories Ive heard was that there was more than one of these guys wandering around our little townIm not sure if this would be related but around the same time my sisters boyfriend brought us out to camp which is an hour away from our community and we went to the near garbage dump and he showed me a bunch of little huts that he found just outside the garbage dump There was three of these little huts almost in the shape of tipis And inside them were little mats big jugs full of dirty water dead crows and squirrels and wood for fire Being there really creeped me out because no one would drink water that dirty or eat those birds the squirrels maybe but not crows Our people tend to eat only certain animalsA big break through in finding out who this person is was just a few years ago when police investigated a cave just a few kilometres out of town The cave looked like someone was trying to build a little shack inside it or something Our local news reporter also visited the site and found a receipt and traced it back to a person in the US The person in the US told him that he was sent out on a survivalist program or somethingWhat bugs me is why this guy was being so creepy and wandering towns at night looking scary and what notSome of the other stories Ive heard of this guy just seemed too unbelievable or just straight up absurd like as if they were made up just to add to the hype If you want to hear them anyway let me know ,GahBigwad  The Big Haired One,3
waitingsilence,0,3,1qqahe,1,The reason we grow out of our childhood innocence and out of our childlike fears is because we eventually realize that reality is much bigger than us Childhood fears are not always based in this reality they are manifested only in the dark corners of our homes and our minds It was this reason the person in our closet or under our bed was there to scare us and only us The figures hidden in the shadows of your basement were only there if your mom or dad werent around Our fears were not objective realities they were figments of our imaginationThe thing I fear now doesnt care if I am around to see it or that I dont have an imagination It exists within and outside of my mind It permeates my reality it leaves its mark everywhere I am It is the darkness in the moment I blink it is the blur in my peripherals the ache behind my tired eyes it is the evil in my homeThere are things Ive seen felt maybe I might have only dreamt of them or imagined their horror in a passing thought These things are real though they create real emotions within me they make me sweat and they deeply disturb my mental state You know that feeling you get when you come across something on the internet so dark that it leaves a lump in your throat for the rest of the day My home is alive with that feelingDeep down I know the lump in my throat is there not because I cant control my emotions but because my emotions are completely justified Whether I am taking a night walk to clear my head or staring at the ceiling above my bed until morning comes this lump feels defensive in its existence as if my body is reacting to something very real and threateningIve had a hard time sleeping recently I can never get comfortable every position feels heavy my body feels like it is under stress and there is a very real pressure in my throat I will often spend nights on the couch in the basement living room that sits right outside my bedroom The televisions lone glow burns its images into my head my eyes become bloodshot as I stare at the screen until I begin to feel tired and am forced to close them This is the only way I can fall asleep and I feel it has begun to take a toll on my sanity Sometimes I will find myself on the couch staring at the television at seven in the morning Other times I will randomly become aware still sitting in front of the turned off television my eyes strained staring into the dark nothingness of it Sometimes I will come to sitting quite upright in my bed staring forward as if to be watching television eyes strained and aching staring off into the darkness of my bedroom One night after a day where I believed I would die if I stayed awake any longer I told myself I would try to sleep in my own bed by relaxing and focusing on some of my thoughtsI woke up on the couch in the living room quite upright and aware I was drawn through the corner of my eye to my open bedroom The tall figure stretched from the roof to my bed not sure if it was standing or hanging Its back was to me its head sunk low staring down over my sleeping body in the bedI saw my body wake up and sit upright as the figure fixed its gaze down on it My body in the bed sheepishly jerked ever so slightly the figure with it and I felt that same ache behind my eyes as both my body in the bed and the tall figure glared at me from the darkness of the bedroom,A Home of the Mind,4

TreasureHouseofDoom,3,35,1r7ztj,0,Dr Jefferies study lay before me energy cleared and house relatively empty but delving into other peoples personal space isnt as easy for me as it may be for others  Always my parents have cautioned me and my siblings about the dangers of disrupting others heirlooms cherishables and privacy  I knew for instance that each of us has deep connection to those things he or she treasures even if we are not personally aware of any sort of psychic ability and that some items carry with them certain protections  A locket passed from mother to daughter for instance may have compound energies susceptible to unleash if disrespected  Bring into this potential release of energy against an interloper a variable such as a holy relic or other spiritually imbued item and forces not easily rectified are to be expected  But more profound than these fears of conflict beyond my control was the deep seated notion in me that all people those among us and those just beyond ever beyond are entitled to their privacy respect beyond measure peace  Id done a pretty good job of jeopardizing such peace and now it was time for me to make things right but maybe too I would be able to bring more than satisfactory comfort  Perhaps this predicament would be remedied with two little girls finding their way to BlissWhatever Bliss is I heard someone say over my shoulder  Just to my left was a door that I presumed opened into the first room to the right of the hall  Foreboding consumed my thoughts only a moment before I pushed it out of my mind and far from my heart  Mama and Aunt Lucia would have called the voice Naysayer and I knew far more than I needed about its powers  The only power Naysayers have is antipower I remembered my mother saying Theyre the weakest link on a dark rusted chain  When all else fails Naysayers speak to hinder what must be done for Good I must have been very young when I heard her say this and I wasnt even sure she had said it to me  Truth was respect for privacy aside I was a bit of an ease dropper by nature and as far as I knew she had been speaking to a friend or relative   But the information this reminder over time was powerful strength to me  I pushed the Naysayer from my mindThere are two very important techniques to remember as one sets her mind to investigating scene and history  First proceed in an orderly and logical manner as often and well as possible  Turn over every clue for deeper consideration but remember to return every item examined to its proper place whenever feasible  Second follow instinct and revelation as each presents itself  Order and Logic have their places but in highly energized situations short cuts sometimes arise  Consult your inner voice in regards to each and if that voice is true and strong in most situations trust it nowHaving been involved in vintage house restoration through my mothers real estate dealings I knew a thing or two about the sorts of places used as secret compartments  Knobs on banisters loose boards trim and façade might function as easily concealed opening for places to hide cash or jewels even the sorts of things others might never suspect had any value at all  Quick inspection of the study revealed a few components that might serve in such a fashion  Among them were medallions at the corners of the door and window frames along the elaborate builtin bookcases and to the left and right of the fireplace attached just beneath the mantle shelf I presumed such opening would reveal a deep but narrow space  Two doors three windows and an entire wall of shelving equalled  medallions  There wasnt time to waste so I decided the best method was to eyeball each for lopsidedness or failure to sit flush in place  Any looseness might indicate wear and tear surpassing stationary use Using the chair instrumental in bringing the ouija board to our attention to begin with as stool I set myself to this task but came up short when I discovered each of the medallions at the windows and the doors paint sealed  And the medallions along the shelves were all flush  Glad not to have wasted too much time in this pursuit I set about removing books from shelves five at a time flipping through each carefully feeling the plank of the shelf beneath and the wood behind to detect any anomaly  This was time consuming but revealed nothing out of the ordinary  By now I was becoming dejected and increasingly worried  The sun lower in the sky I saw beams of it peeking past the drapes at the center of three tall windows  Now I pulled each to its corresponding side let midafternoon light push through  At first I only warmed myself in this wondering why I hadnt bothered to bring more light into the room to start but now I noticed something I hadnt before  With my back to the door it would have been virtually impossible to detect    From the outside of the study the door was virtually mundaneheavy oak painted white thick framework medallions at the corners nothing more But from the inside a fretwork panel of heavy design was fitted to meet the top of the door from corner to corner as if a transom window were hidden behind it  And now light pouring into graze the top of the desk in the center of the room hit a finely polished desk set ricocheting to the fret work and passing through  From behind tiny glows of red and ember were cast against the white paint gingerbreadExcitedly I carried the chair across the room stood on top of it hoping to budge the fretwork  There was no such luck at this height  I looked for something sturdy  to make me taller but there wasnt anything else in here suitable for that Id have to grab a stool Id seen in the kitchen earlier  It troubled me to leave the study unattended and I was not unafraid to travel the hall to the kitchen again  The energy pushed from this room might have concentrated along that dark corridor andtired as I wasI worried that my resolve might be weaker now   The best path I decided was through the front door and around the side of the house and besides I could use the fresh air I thoughtOpening the front door surprise of warm air pressed against me  For the better part of the last twentyfour hours chill had held me in its grip and now I basked in the warm mugginess of a typical Alabama fall day  Storms on the way someone said from the front walk and when I looked down from my place on the porch the broad smile of a tall man greeted me  It didnt occur to me to wonder what he was doing here and perhaps I already knew who he wasMiss Lucia shes a fine woman she told me you might need a few things and I walked to meet him with a firm thankful handshake His grasp was strong and for a moment I pondered whether or not he might be just some local with a keen sense of what most couldnt see some bright energy my aunt had detected from the other side but his overalls and flannel shirt were oldfashioned even by farm standards and the glow emanating from him spoke of peace and tranquility not found here on EarthNames Big Roy Miss Julianne And Ill help however I can You got to know I love both those little girls  Not one of thems an angel but neither is they a devil And I was glad to find his grip strong now if only for a moment  He mustve been a real force in life to bring such energy to me nowIve found a fret panel above the door in the study Big Roy I said  And I need a ladder and maybe a hammer to remove itBig Roy looked down for a moment considered the peace of Heaven against the Hell of Life perhaps then spoke  No Maam  What you need is a No Goodell Brothers screwdriver Reaching into a pocket at his hip he pulled out a relic to share with me   I made that fretwork for Mrs Moseley put it up to hide a few things His dark marble eyes clouded and he looked past the house to the back yard  I followed the path his thoughts traveled and suddenly we werent in the front yard anymore  Ahead of us stood the original kitchen rock wall reminder of the boundaries between two converging worlds  Within two little girls working on some secret danced across the windows in silhouette  The smell of fudge was heavy again and laughter wafted too on convected breezeThatll be Vassar Fudge Big Roy said  Never could stand the taste of it  Mrs Moseley wont like it in the house not since the fire  But I swear this place always smelled of barbecue and chocolate after that He shivered tear at his eye and I placed my left hand to his right arm felt the sinew hard work makes the strength of spirit hard life breeds the exhaustion such projection brought from him His memories were clues I could not cast away but feeling the drain it made on his soul saddened meIs this the only way Big Roy I asked sincerely but he only smiled sadly back at meWhatever it takes to bring peace Maam Such is the nature of love and sacrifice and now I committed the lessons Big Roy taught to memory heart spiritHis pulse quickening at my fingertips I felt the rush of energy course through me inflate my heart  Now was the time to prepare myself for the sort of vision that could drive some to madness and just as I realized this heat burst against my face like revelation of Armageddon  Closing my eyes for only a moment I turned now to see the pretty kitchen erupting in flames  The shrieks of little girls trapped inside overwhelmed me and now Big Roy ran toward the house as he had that day so many years ago relived horrible moments to break a window  And there was Mary falling through to fall into his strong arms but she reached back scrambled to retrieve her sweet friend the girl who might have been her sister always  Big Roy pulled her more tightly to his chest held her against the struggle she made and ran from the porch the pop and sizzle of pine planks harmonizing backdrop against the excruciating rising melody of Sweet Dulcies screams Puddle of sweat and tears I prayed for strength to continue as wails echoed through me  And now I felt the whistling brush of silk against one cheek and the coarse scrape of wool against the other as two mothers ran to collect babies only one to have her arms filled with a bundle of love ever again  Big Roy passed Mary to her Mamas arms and now he rushed to pull Mrs Moseley from the porch just as the pretty gingerbreaded roof above it collapsed in spark and flame  Salt of sweat and tears at my lips I wretched as the fragrances Big Roy had describedbarbecue and chocolate engulfed meThank you for reading each of these parts that explain an amazing event in my life If

lifecmcs,0,3,1r635e,0,Here is the previous story httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqynxhappenedtome     Basically this is a very scary apartment Shortly after I saw the girl things got quiet I stopped watching TV alone in the house and started going to church more When my mom who didnt have a job would leave the house I would often tag along or go in my room where my sister and I both slept she was  so she doesnt have any recollection of anythingOne day it was a rainy day and my sisters friend had a birthday party I was invited for some reason It was a rainy gloomy day but the festivals were making everyone happy so I guess I was happy as well The party was very expensive as they were sorta rich and there were tons of events and foods and things to do But enough of that storyAfter we left the party my parents decided to go to church Naturally as a energetic  year old I was reluctant to leave so I told my parents to drop me off at home with my sister The house was dark and it was raining so I was a little scared but once my mother had tucked me into bed I fell asleep and I thought that was the end of thatI believe I slept until night time because I heard the front door closing I thought it was my parents so I yelled to mom telling her I was hungry But there was no reply Instantly I was awake and my pulse was pounding I was suddenly paralysed with fear I dont know and I could only watch as I heard footsteps come up the stairs My sister I could hear her breathing underneath me we had a bunkbed but she didnt seem hear a thing             Then a creak and moan as my bedroom door opened I watched as a shadow grew between my feet and hovered over me I believe I passed out with fear or something cause the next thing I knew I was waking up and it was later at night and my parents really came homeA couple days later my sister came home with a drawing i asked her what it was as I shivered in fear She told me that she had seen the thing I saw except it spoke to her while I was sleeping that day It told her that it was related to her that it knew mom I couldnt believe what I was hearing I never told mom who was still having nightmares about her miscarriage But could it be the sister I never had,Happened to Me Part II,3
Mrreeburrito,0,7,1r5odg,0,Ok so for the past three nights in a row I have had these kinds of dreams I dont know how better to describe them but here is the first night and I will right the other nights as I get timeThe happenings that have lead up to Tuesday night I dont remember everything that happened to leading up to it I tried to go to sleep early because I moved out of my house last month and I had been getting terrible sleep because I am forced to sleep on an air mattress I am also staying at a friends house till I am able to move into my next house I went to sleep around seven at night and them woke up at eleven that same night I couldnt get back to sleep no matter how much I tried so I decided to start watching tv After a while I got really thirsty so I went down stairs to get a drink of water After I finished the water my stomach started to feel up so I went into the bathroom I finished up in there and as I was leaving I started to get a feeling like a was being watched I can even remember having the same feeling in the bathroom but I ignored it and just tooled around on my phone Nevertheless I hurried up stairs and it felt as though I was being followed I decided to ignore it and just lay down with my eyes closed and calm down I did this for the next roughly thirty minutes and drifted off to sleep With in minutes of me sleeping I again had the feeling of being pinned down and could not move It had been months since the last time this happened but it almost felt as though it was going to happen I cannot better explain the part other than I just new it was going to was coming So after that I was a little freaked out but it had happened so many times in my past that I would get more annoyed than anything else I then had a hard time falling asleep again It took me hours to fall back asleep but nothing happened after I woke up I just would stay there in the bed annoyed that I could not fall back asleep I am not sure if this is being triggered by the stress of me moving or what is happening Alls I know is that I want it to stop I will write another post about what happened last night and tonight when I get more time but this is all I can write for now   ,Terrible dreams update ,6

Undead,0,2,1r0uz5,0,So this happened about a year ago I had been loopy for months but only like see shadows or hear the TV when it wasnt on which is nothing compared to what happened to me I was home alone as I always am after my school day but today I saw and heard more things than usual but I thought nothing of it I climbed the stairs and entered the bathroom and after certain events happened that I am not going to describe because I am not gross I got up then washed my hands and went to the door which is when I heard a BANG right on the door so I did what all manly people do locked the door and hid in the bathtub Soon I began hearing foot steps but not just any footsteps but boots like combat boots on a hard wood floor After about  minutes of marching I heard whistling of a man and the faint singing of a woman This went on for about half an hour After I got the courage to open the door I looked in the hallway and SAW no onethere wasnt anybody there I checked over the house twice and nothing I received every possible test and Im not crazy so what do you think happened,Boots,2

Chibler,0,1,1qzu3b,0,When this all occurred it was before the days of pre made stands so I was up in some Jerry rigged quasi treehouse we had built as kids We had another name for Jerry rigged back then but its more than slightly racist so I wont post it As soon as I heard those gun shots I slung my rifle and started down the ladder we had nailed together with rotten two by fours pinched from a local construction site In my haste I ended up more sliding down than stepping At around the fourth rung from the bottom my leg caught between rungs but my body kept going Unfortunately it was also my left leg the one that was held together with plates and screws from an injury sustained playing ball in college The sharp twang of the metal seemed to ring out I know it didnt in real life but I swore I heard it in my head I quickly gathered myself and starting limp running towards Micks stand I didnt feel the pain really the adrenalin took care of that I used to run throught the woods like crazy as a kid rocks mud uneven terrain nothing stopped me Ive never run like this I was stupid I was just reacting I should have called the sherrif but I didnt I just took off my mind half cocked my rifle fully cocked I ran until I couldnt run anymore I ran until my chest heaved like a barrel ready to burst into its individual stags and cease to function I ran like my life depended on it because micks life depended on it When I got to the stand Mick wasnt there I knew that was what I would find but I had hoped like a fool that he would be there As I looked around my heart rate slowed and I became conscious of the in my ankle It was bleeding through my cammo pants Fuck it I thought if Curt Shilling could pitch game six with a bloody ankle I could save Mick with the same I took a look around the area I didnt see much until I looked a few hundred yards west of his stand There was a deer huge rack a real wall hanger It was dead but I had been tied to the tree next to it I looked at the area around it and saw drag marks Someone had put that deer out there for Mick and that somone had drug him away Follow the tracks its just like hunting find Mick find him These things just kept running throught my mind It was tunnel vision I couldnt think of anything else I took off in the direction of the drag marks My ankle was dragging I knew it was damaged I just didnt care As long as I didnt think about it I would be fine I followed those tracks for miles I felt like I was being watched but I pushed the thought from my mind nothing else mattered but finding Mick I kept pushing on my belt between my teeth to stifle me from crying out in pain Finnaly I came to the end of the tracks It was a cabin one that hand been taken care of half the roof had caved in and the rotting edifice was covered in green pillow like moss I stopped and froze for a moment contemplating my next move I was out of my mind I didnt think I walked up to the door and kicked it in with my steel toed boots The door gave way easily splintering old rotted wood was sent flying everywhere Before I could see inside I heard whimpering hoping it was Mick I charged into the buildingWhat I saw took me completely by surprise there was Damion Chucks brother He was chained to the ancient wood burning stove that sat in the corner of this one room cabin Damion you better tell me what the fuck is going on I screamed Damion just looked at me It was a look I knew fairly well he was coked out of his mind I was so angry I just grabbed him by the neck and yelled He made me do it he told me Id get a fix He was yelling What I questioned as I shook him The man he made me he made me I needed my fix He just kept yelling I popped his nose with the butt of my rifle stock What man I yelled The hunter hes a hunter Damion choked out through tears He made me he made me show him the stands and he asked about you guys he was just going to rob you I didnt know this would happen I swear He was out of his mind Whats happening whats going on wheres Mick I kept firing the questions Micks not gonna love through this he already took him hunting you can live run He said I was furious I paced around the room a couple times I didnt know what to do then damion opened his mouth one last time He gave me my fix I needed it Im so sorry he wailed I snapped I lost it I pulled out my sidearm and fired a whole magazine into his skullDamion was dead I dont think I have to tell you that I ignored his body and started searching the cabin Aside from a few moldy blankets and some food refuse all I found was a scrap of paper on it were a few type written wordsPredators prey on the weak to be the strongest predator is to never be weakI knew what he was doing with Mick I bolted out the back door and saw the tracks made from an ATV I started following themPart  httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqvekhuntingaccidentpart,Hunting Accident Part ,1
DarkOblivionSecrets,0,3,1qxnif,0,I and my friends knew not to disturb the man at the end our street but us being dumb  year olds we decided to rob him  As we walked up to the front yard we noticed the grass hasnt been cut for a couple years well thats the last time I saw it cut  The smell of the grass and old house instantly caught our breath but my friends decided to overlook it and go on up to his door  Going up to the door I sensed that something wasnt right but they told me to shrug it off  What my friends were planning to do was go inside his house and rob him without getting caught  They said nobody lived here and so on but I knew someone lived here because every night I looked out my window at the old house to see a black silloute of a man standing at the top right window  As my friends went on into the house but I noticed there was a very distasteful smell that smelled like burning hair  My friends in their stupid minds didnt notice it but I dont know how since it was so intoxicatingAs we stood in the dark hall with flashlights blazing ahead us I constantly heard noises soft quiet noises here and there  The so called leader of our little expedition told us to split up and find anything of value  After he got done talking we split off into groups I went with my friend Gerard and I could tell he was nervous about this whole robbery  As we searched the main floor we found little old necklaces and took them but as we walked into the kitchen we found a note that was fairly new  I read the note aloud to me and Gerard Leave before the clock strikes twelve and I wont harm you or choose to stayYour choice  Gerard noticed that it was written in red ink as I looked at it I noticed that it definitely was not red ink  We yelled so that everybody would come back to the main hall and we waited five minutes  The five minutes passed and we were all regroupedI showed them the note and everyone told me to stop trying to scare them while Gerard looked at me with a faint expression  Our leader told us to stop bluffing and find the loot  I and Gerard kept looking while three people took the upstairs and one guy took the basement  We ventured to the dining hall to only find old chairs sitting quietly with its brother the table  Two minutes later it was  and the old grandfather clock signaled loudly  After the clock stopped ringing we heard a scream from the basement and we instantly knew something was up  As the whole group met up again at the hall we all rushed downstairs  Flashlights were pointed near the old boxes and wires as we ventured on near the back of the basement we found something disgusting  There lying on the ground was our pal Tom surrounded by a pool of dark red blood  Not only was he dead someone had cut off his hands  As we threw up and looked on in disgust I noticed to a note pinned to Toms lifeless corpse by a nail  I grabbed the note nearly throwing up in the process to only find this written I see you didnt heed my warning so now I want to play a fun little game called Hunt the FoolsHa Ha Ha good luck  After I read it aloud all of us bolted upstairs to only find the door locked and another note pinned to the door again I read it aloud Trying to escape eh you shouldve taken the opportunity when I let you goNow we were all scared and scared to face the fact that we are stuck here with this maniac Knowing that only made us even more nervous  Since Tom had died there were only four of us now making us split up into two groups  I and Gerard decided to try and find a weapon of some sort in the kitchen but all the drawers were empty  An hour passed not knowing who was next to go and that alone was killing us  As me and Gerard waited ever so patiently with our backs against the wall in the dining room we decided to talk  He started off with Man I didnt know I was going to die at this age I wanted to have a family when I was older and now all of that is ruined Taking it in I replied with I I thought this was going to be easy but obviously were going to have to fight for our future  He just looked at me and noddedFive minutes we heard another scream cut off by the pounding of someone running down the stairs  It was our friend Matt he called out for us and we answered with In the dining room  He ran into where we were at panting  He told us He He got Andrew that sicko killed him hes dead we didnt even see him coming he ambushed us and killed him and stabbed me in the arm  He showed us only to find us looking at his sliced arm in disgust  He slumped down beside us looking at us knowing our fate  He gave us a note he said that the guy dropped when he killed Andrew I looked it over and read Its sad you idiots didnt leave well Ill help you out theres a knife taped to the bottom of the dining room table Come on and show me what you got ,The Man on Chicken Farm Lane,3
Narokami,0,4,1qvqr7,0,Haha holy shit MasterpiecehttpcreepypastawikiacomwikiMasterpiece Ive only ever had one night terror in my life and it was really similar to that experienceLate at night in REM sleep I totally thought I was awake My bed was placed on a wall far away from the door to my bedroom and at an angle so I could see the door if I faced the right way I had been up reading but I was tired and must have passed out A noise woke me up sometime around one or two in the morning and I at first thought it was my older brother walking aroundHis room was behind mine almost shared walls but there was a kitchen and two hallways to actually get to his room from mine so I thought nothing of itBut you see if I placed my head on the pillow just right you know like cupping an ear against it I could hear everything going on in the house My heartbeat our dogs snores the tick tock of the clock in the living room and footstepsBut footsteps are ordinary My brother walks around late at night hes a night owl The footsteps started in my brothers room I heard his sliding door open I heard it close I heard his feet stepping around one of our Rotties but my brother must have been hungry because he walked out to the kitchen opened the kitchen door and then closed it after a short while But then then he walked towards our parents room I had some minor alarm bells ringing he wouldnt do that in the day time much less when theyre sleeping he and our parents fight a lot He must have stood outside their door for a full two minutes before walking awayAt this point I was fully awake and moved to get out of bed I wanted to know what he was doing It wasnt until he was walking down the hallway to my room that I realized that my brother wasnt homeHe was working long shifts that week sleeping at a friends house Our two Rottweilers would have protected me from an intruder They would have woken up They would have done somethingI jumped back in to bed The footsteps had stopped I could feel a weight on my chest I got under the covers and pretended to sleep but in my haste I had placed my back to the door It was too late to turn around It would know My heart was beating a thousand beats a minute and each beat could not have been any louderMy bathroom door right next to my bedroom door swung open in silence but for the faintest squeak of the hinge No sound No footsteps SilenceI knew it had come to kill me I didnt know if it was a murderer or a spirit or something else I was only eleven and scared out of my mind I thought of all the things I had enjoyed all of the things I certainly had not the house was dead There was no noise The only sound I could hear was the blood being pumped through my veins my ragged breathThe door swung open Slowly The air pressure in the room shifted and a weight entered An oppressive dangerous weight that blocked out the light of my own thoughts I dont know what it was I dont know what it looked like my back was to the door I was paralyzed and I couldnt move to save my lifeI cant die like this PLEASE please Please I thought Please no I had tried to kill myself almost a year before that night tried to drown myself I still wanted to die It was just so heavy I thought through the situation as fast as I possibly could I imagined all the outcomes I tried to conjure some kind of imaginative spirit to protect me tried to will the damn thing awayBut it was there It was real and it was hard to breath Just having it in the room was suffocating meIt stood there judging me Silently It was weighing my worth Enjoying my terror I resigned myself to death I didnt want to die but I yearned for death I still doBut is death the answer Will my death solve anything It wasnt necessarily a solution I wanted But would I care Would deadme care about all thatI explored the universe for an eternity within the few seconds it had been in my room I was looking for an answer I didnt find one My chest was crushed my eyes were bleeding My mind was made whole for such a short time and then splintered worse than it had ever been It was okay I thought Mom and Dad will understand Theyll get through this theyll be strong To honor my memory you know I threw the covers off and ran towards the darkness by my toorecentlyopen door but it was gone It had left the moment I was able to moveJust a night terrorThe next day I remembered this terrifying dream and asked my father if he had gotten up in the night had maybe gone to the fridge He said he thought that I had gone to the fridge That I had stood outside their bedroom for a bit That I had then gone to my room and lied downHe asked me where the cuts in my forearm came from Deep red furrows He asked me why I looked exhausted why I looked as if I had been crying I couldnt tell him In my search for the key to the universe that night I had stumbled upon what had wanted me dead I had seen itBut it didnt want me to know It wasnt just a night terror It was Death and it came for me it left without me I wasnt sure which was more terrifying,An Ode to Masterpiece Part One of My Relationship With Death,4
LadyDevastation,2,5,1qv2wt,0,They all looked right through me The way they always do Even as I walked among them even in their midst they looked at every part of me except for my face failing to notice the disgusted look that plastered my face as I tried my best to keep my emotions stableI suppose youre wondering where so much hate came from oppression Thats where it came from years and years of their games But now now its my game I make the rules and theyre none the wiser The dress I was wearing a sexy blue chiffon with skinny straps that hated to stay up that was stolen from a crusade last weekend The diamond studs a plumage from a few months back The strappy sandals those I had snatched from one of my first tangos with the elite Its pathetic the way they all fawn over their material goods like sweating in expensive material was any different than it was in kmart clothing Like somehow their Dior made them better Petty I know But you have to understand one thing these were the people who had taken away any chance I had to a normal life repeatedly they had reminded me I was no more than the label I woreStanding among them made me sick but I took comfort knowing it wouldnt be long My idle conversation with the too tipsy escort that came with senator whatshisname wouldnt last long My eyes were set on a real prize a gem in this world of red bottom shoes He stood a sturdy sixfoot man with a smug smile plastered on his face His tie perfectly placed shoes shinning in the dim lighting of the room I excused myself from the sloppy blonde and twisted my face into a flirtatious smileHe could have seen it coming he really could have It was his own damn fault he took the time to stare at my exposed legs and not my eyes If only he had chosen to stop thinking about his own gain for a moment to think about his safety Even as he took me up the stairs to give me a tour of one of his many lovely homes even as he shut the door to the bedroom even as he poured himself a glass of hard liquor he thought about nothing but himself My eyes said it all that hungry thirst was glowing in my emerald eyes He just had to really look at them to see Instead he was busy waiting for me to stop talking so he could Too bad So sorryI remember glancing at the pigs finger he hadnt even taken the moment to slide off his ring An experienced cheater who couldnt care to give a fuck So as he poured his glass I took the time to give him what he really deserved I served the justice the rest of the world couldntThis was a work of art You really should have seen it the way the knife Id snagged from the kitchen on our little tour plunged into his back The way it disappeared into him It was truly beautiful The deep red staining his expensive suit the gurgling noises he made as he began to choke on his own blood It was truly beautiful I waited a moment and looked at my work waiting and watching as his eyes rolled into the back of his head truly beautifulI then proceeded to take a moment to ruffle up my hair and slam my fist against my cheek creating an illusion that I knew would work No jury would ever argue with me on this one Then I had let out a blood curdling scream people came faster than expected Attention whores bawling louder than the next It was a sight Now Im planning out my next scheme my next victory my next victim in the plan of cruel justice Whos next ,Twisted Justice,5
MissBHart,2,3,1qtczg,0,I am curious how many people that have sleep paralysis also have had near death experiences where they have had their life flash before their eyes  I am wondering if there is a correlation as I nearly drowned when young and when fainting have a similar experience and also have has sleep paralysis for a long time and can enter a REM like dream state very quickly,Sleep paralysis amp near death experience relation,3
Bryce,1,6,1qq9mi,1,All right NoSleep Ive been debating whether I should post this story for a while now Ive been a long time lurker and it was actually this experience which both sparked and stifled my thirst for paranormal happenings On one hand it gave me a mystery which I couldnt solve which is always exciting On the other hand it scared me so bad that its usually easier to not think about it And of course I cant tell anyone at home about it because theyll just think Im crazy or trying to scare them Probably the latter my penchant for telling scary stories as a child is finally coming back to haunt me I live in a relatively small community up in northern Utah Its very outdoorsy were surrounded or rather located in a small woods Its very pretty being surrounded by trees all the time especially in the winter It can snow pretty heavily here and the aftereffect of such snowstorms is a pristine unbelievable environment I moved here when I was  and Im currently  This experience happened last winter when I was seventeen and a senior in High School I was on a diet at the time because I wanted to lose fifty pounds by graduation I had always been overweight as a child and I had finally crossed the point into actual obesity The diet ended up working I went from  to  pounds the day of graduation and Ive maintained ever since I took diet pills for the first while to help me adjust to only eating  calories a day but one of the side effects of Amphetamines is Insomnia As such I was always up and restless after everyone else in my family had gone to bedIt had been a bad day I was at a friends house for his birthday and had eaten a lot of cake Worse still I hadnt gone jogging that day so I tossed and turned all night thinking about those heavy calories sitting in my stomach Finally resigning myself to the fact that I wasnt getting any sleep I figured I might as well exercise I LOVE jogging at night especially in my area The trails are wellkept the scenery is beautiful and the silence feels sacred in a way My dog Mickey never goes to sleep at night until Im asleep Shes a pretty active dog and so when she saw me getting ready she started scratching at the door I decided to take her with me since I knew if I didnt she would continue scratching at the door until she woke up everyone in my house We set out at about  AM I know its late But imagine spending four hours doing nothing but lying in your bed I didnt really care what time it was I just wanted out of my room There had been a light snowfall all day which had died down earlier in the night The woods were absolutely beautiful everything was covered in a light layer of snow Visibility was pretty good as well The moon was bright and reflected well off of the snow illuminating the path ahead of me nicely I was wearing sweatpants and a hoodie so the cold didnt really bother me and my dog loves it I decided to take a jogging route by the river making sure to keep a close eye on Mickey so that she didnt fall in I let her off leash and we were off This is where it gets creepy About halfway through Im huffing and puffing when I suddenly see my dog stop right in front of me I almost run her over which completely throws me off and I stop panting I lift my head to berate her when I see shes completely rigid with her hackles raised Any dog owner know that this is NOT a good sign I immediately look around searching for wild animals But theres not anything dangerous living in this area the most threatening thing around is a community of feral cats Mickey then started to whimper slowly backing up to the side of the road I followed crouching down and petting her What is it I started then stopped A complete infusion of dread washed over me Kind of like the feeling you get when you realize youve missed a flight or that your cars been stolen Its a mix of panic and fear Now times it by  and you might experience the feeling I got I swear the temperature dropped by ten degrees I looked ahead and I shit you not there was this black carriage making its way around the bend Let me reiterate that A CARRIAGE One of those wheeled wagon things used in the olden times pulled around by horses Except this one didnt have horses I have no idea to this day how it moved it just kept creaking along at a snails pace I cant put into words how terrifying this thing was It was like every pore of my body was burning telling me to GET THE FUCK AWAY from this thing Its very presence seemed wrong evil It was draped in these mothy chewed up black curtains The windows in it were tinted black and the wheels were pure black Which looking back should have given me another tip that something was wrong about it It wasnt until I got home that I realized that its wheels should have been covered in the snow sticking to the ground It wasnt the kind of snow that turned to wet mush the instant it touched something this was the hard kind that you dragged in behind you whenever you went for a walk And the smell was absolutely awful Its the sour putrid smell that only really comes with death It invaded all of my senses my eyes started watering from the acrid stench I can only imagine how my poor dog handled it This thing was moving at a snails pace right down the middle of the lane No horses nobody up front just a black carriage smelling like death taking a ride at  AM in the morning My dog and I were frozen on the side of the road Its like all of my muscles were locked in terror every part of my body was SCREAMING at me telling me to get away To this day I have no proof of why I had that kind of reaction but Im convinced something deep down inside me knew that this carriage meant trouble My dog was absolutely rigid not moving an inch not taking her eyes off of this thing As it came towards us all I could tell myself was to stay as still as possible Movement talking or otherwise providing signs of life in this dead space wasnt a good idea I think my dog felt the same way because we stayed still as statues until it came up to us I dont think we even breathed It was about four feet away from me when it passed us The smell was unbearable and I did the best I could to avoid looking into the tinted windows I was crying but not because of the smell anymore but because I was so terrified I know it seems silly to be crying about a dead carriage being pulled by God knows what but the feelings you got from being around this thing it was so unnatural and WRONG As it pulled away I started to breathe again I was still frozen because it was just behind us And that was when my dog let out a low whimper The thing stopped dead in its tracks The temperature dropped another ten degrees and looking at my dog her pupils seemed to take up her entire eye sockets I could hear this quiet rumbling or rather SENSED it It was like the feeling you get right before a movie plays in a theater when the lights start going down and the audio is just crackling to life And then I heard one of the carriage doors openMy dog bolted and after a second of pure hell I did too I didnt look back I was running faster than I had ever done in my entire life I kept my head down the entire way to make sure I didnt see anything else And also partially because I didnt want to be like those dumb bitches in the horror movies who got slaughtered because they tripped on a tree root And it wasnt until I got home that I realized there were no tracks in the snow That thing had been treading along for minutes in the type of snow that stuck to the bottom of your boots but I remember running away on snow that was completely smooth When I got home I couldnt sleep for the entire night My dog was restless as well she kept circling around me the entire night whimpering It had probably only been five or ten minutes but it felt like it lasted an eternity It took me a while to recover but slowly going back into the woods became less scary I never take that path though and I NEVER go at night anymore Even if its only eight or nine I make sure Im either at my place or a friends place One last thing this is probably completely unrelated But like any fast rushing river people have drowned in ours But the bodies arent always found which is understandable And most of the drowning happen at night which again is understandable People are usually drunk or cant see where theyre going and one wrong step and theyre in it But after my experience after seeing what goes on in that road is possible that people DONT drown Its just assumed that if you go out at night near a river and dont return you fell in But maybe something else happened to those peopleAnd maybe that something almost happened to me ,The Carriage,7

mrnosleep,2,11,1r7pum,0,I was trapped in a boiler room So what do you do in a scary situation like that Most people panic or forget what to do Im currently trapped in this room How did I get locked in here Oh right my friends wanted to see if there was any loot in a weird factory on a November night It was just another pitch black night in rural nowhere Maybe I was foolishno I am foolish to have listened to my friends Maybe they werent stupid Maybe they were just curious of the old paint cracked factory in the middle of the woods We had to steal my dads wire cutters to get past the fence Most of the doors were locked and rusted I looked up and there was a billowing tower It must have been as tall as my middle school The tower was dark and hard to see Then I get a yell from the rocket scientist of the group He found a way in It was a vent that lend to a lower room The room was barely lit and we didnt hear anyone The vent had grippable bars that we could safely climb down with As we looked around the room I could see where the light was emanating from All of the metal in the room was visible but there was no light source Everyone was confused yet we ignored that too One of the guys bumped into a massive tank with pressure gauges This must have been an old soda factory as I noticed a trashcan full of Colas The room was pretty dark Luckily we had our phones which didnt have much other use than lighting the way We didnt have a signal down here I was worried that our light would attract an unwanted guest Hey what does this sign mean Asked a friend It was a square with smaller squares within it There number  was three of the squares And Im sorry Im trying to type this on my phone before its too late and I cant remember my friends names breathingI really feel terrible right now We explored further down the hallway when one of the guys started gasping for air He didnt want to stay anymore and just left I heard a loud metallic noise in his vicinity That must have been the vent door breathingThe other friend was feeling okay but it doesnt look like hes okay right now because hes dead It started with a nose bleed I helped him back to the first room we came from but it was too late The vent door was shut My friend was dead gaspI can not remember my friends namesI feel so exhausted right nowIt must have been daylight and our parents must be worried sick Im worried I hear deafening noises pulsate through the pipes The room began to heat up It was hotter than my houses boiler room I can also hear people wahajtlking steadily on the floor above meIm too tired to tshfype anymoreMy hbsfair has fallen outMy chest bsburnsThis washas no soda factjory boiler roommmaeafdlPlease Charge Phone   Battery Life Remaining,The Boiler Room,9

broomball,0,2,1r1cwi,0,httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsjrweirdwalkaroundtheblockandweirddreamweird link to first updatewhat i realized the gold and the creature with the eyes of blue are both like guard dogs and their masters are in control of them blue acted out of instinct it has no final destination like visions where i see realities different from our owntheroy from first post in series  changes since last post moving didnt help much just bought me more time i also purchased some throwing knives since my last update not due to the creatures just because i was losing my sense of home and slight sense of security from moving from the house i grew up inwarning i may ramble a bit with exlpaimations due to me having high funtioning autism and it causes me to have longer explainations than most people i also have slightly bad social skills  due to it also sorry about spelling and grammar i am on a mobile phone and it is half an hour until midnight for me i wasnt feeling well today so i am a bit tired and half of this was typed  days ago i just fell asleep before typing certain parts out that only i would have understood and i fixed and  made readable sense of itso you are lucky for now that i formatted what i did i will do a spelling and grammar edit tomorrowThe thing that marked the change was the blue creature appeared just after i shut my eye lids and they felt stuck shut I didnt bother trting to open them i knew it was no use and that the blue one was safe but not the gold one So i kept trying to switch into a dream but none would take the creature started to make a half choking half growling sound over and over like it was choking on a word before it choked out the word protect then lefti normally can start my dreams off then fall asleep into them but i havent been able to gaurd my mind i can normally just pick a theme eg horror story abandon building and spy  every so often i will get an odd dream that my mind cant draw on my most recent dream because the normal ones seem to make a storyline like last spring a trex and i were talking and it was wearing a monacle and top hat while drinking champane in a ruined section of a city  and then from down the road walnuts got fired at me i ran forward and cracked them with my bare hands until they stopped this time though it was they hacked in to a dream i had recentlythe recent dream i had fallen asleep while emotions i had were swirling so it randomized and it was that people on my list of people i trust that was pulled from my memoriesI would be getting ready for a formal dance at the school i went to before my dad moved yet in the dream i had moved to the  town the high school i went to is in i could see the school in the dream from the house i was in and it was a bright neon green house with a picket fence and elegant hand carved wooden gate there are no houses like that near the school though and a cop knocks on the door of the house and my mom answers it and the cop asks for me and mom says i am getting ready to go to a school dance the cop explains why he is there is to get me to come with him to talk out a hostage situation because the person with the hostage asked to see me So i slip a throwing knife of the new set mentioned above into each pant leg pocket then say that he can enter my room i then ask if i can bring either a throwing knife or a wooden stake for defence should i be used as hostage depends what person from my trust list it is being held hostage already in the dreamI have trust lists because my lack of social skills makes it hard to make friends so i classify them as aquaintences with varying levels of my trust whether i am friends with  them or not is there call but in the dream after the dream completes it restarts and gets the next person on the listsI get the ok from the cop who says hopefully it wont get to that fast foreward dream the person with the hostage has the most defendable place in the school and the only possibilities for escape is the window behind  him or at least the body shape looks male i will refer to him as chompers due to him having pure gold and silver teeth alternating so it goes silvergoldsilvergoldetc i first percieved chompers as a being to represent stress then i would be called to go stand near by chompers holds a glock  pistol a common pistol in military games eg socom in each hand right hand against hostages head and the left one points at me then i offer a hostage swap and hand the other hostage the defence weapon i had up my sleeve then i stand so my back faces chompers while he demands certain politcians be eliminated and vast sums of money as if i was a powerful bargining chip the cops cant complete his ransom with the assination call so he threatens me saying any last wishes i say i wish to hear a song from my phone and ask if i am allowed to reach in my pocket to get it chompers says yeah so i grab a throwing knife and stab back wards near intestines with the left throwing knife and jab his thigh at the same time as i dropped and ducked the cops took thier chance to shoot himEach time he would normally fall and i would see the bloody muscles of his face when his head hit the floor the only difference now is his eyes have been like snake eyes bright red with gold pupils instead of just turning to empty socketsCould it be stress but what if it is two entities battling in my mind one being instinct and one being stress because the walks i would take around the block were to eliminate or at least vent off stress and the slight paranoia during the encounters let them cross into reality and be anchors for their masters if so could it be only my own brain is the only one with a frequency and pattern they can survive,weird walk around the block and weird dream weird cat

deleted,3,5,1qz2ii,0,Dear readersSo nice of you to read my story I have actually never written one but I am just really curious what you think about some things that I have experienced Lately I have been reading a lot of stories about sleep paralysis on nosleep And this reminded me of this thing that happened to me about  months agoFirst of all you should know I am from the Netherlands so I am sorry for bad grammar I used to live in a small village in a somewhat older house So creaking noises were not uncommon But I have always had a connection with the supernatural And I also believe that I have this sensitivity for it For example I would be able to feel energies from several friends their passed away family members In some rare cases I have even seen themAnyways at my parents house I used to have this little attic in my bedroom And from my room there was a stair and if you would walk on it you would be standing next to my bed I remember when I was really young around  years old When some days in a row it would sound like somebody was walking up my stairs Naturally the first times my parents would shake it off as just wood making the sounds they make when it is colder or warmer But we all know that sounds like that doesnt sound the same as somebody climbing up my small stairs So since my parents didnt believe it could be something else I stopped telling them And I started opening my door and keep on the light in the hallway Of course when I heard the sounds again I would check if there was a shadow or something in the light falls And of course there would be nothing So after this I stopped checking Until one night the creaking sounds were back and would stop at the last step My eyesight was not towards it and I was too afraid to turn around and see what was watching me so I pretended to be asleep That was when I almost had a freaking heart attack because some crazy woman was screaming in my ear When I turned around it stopped and there was obviously nothingThe next couple of years nothing really specific happened as far as I remember at least nothing that has a connection to this story I guess From time to time I would hear mumbling voices and footsteps but nothing out of the ordinary Nowadays I live alone in the city in a small apartment where no crazy supernatural things happen Untill  months ago I was just doing a nap after a busy day at work when it seemed like I was awake but at the same time I wasnt At that moment it felt like this was not the first time this was happening to me And I also felt really in danger I couldnt move even though everything in my eyeshot was normal and I was sleeping or dreaming or awake I am still not sure And that is when she shuffled into my sight first she was just looking at me Her face was not visible because there was this sort of hood over her head Actually I was not even sure if it was a woman because she was wearing a big black robe and this big hood which covered everything But deep down I just knew it And I knew her I had seen her previously Back in my mind I recognized her from passed times but I could not remember her it was like I had some sort of block in my head that contains all information about herShe came closer to me and started to talk to me At least her mouth was moving but I did not hear anything I was freaking out I was going crazy inside of my mind because I couldnt move and there was this crazy bitch standing next to my bed which was known to me somehow All of a sudden she jumped on me and somehow she was totally covered with my blanket I couldnt breath because she was so heavy on me It was like she sucked out all my energy and I got weaker I was sure I was dying and she would be the last thingperson I had seen in my short life The moment I was thinking fuck it was the moment I could move again I threw her off me and pulled the blanket Thats when I saw her face I knew I wanted to know how it looked for years And it was horrible she was like a really tiny  years old woman And then I woke up the same way I was laying in my bed in my dream and she was nowhere to be seen I was soaked with sweat and out of breathWhat do you think this could have been I personally think this was sleep paralysis and that I have had it earlier but I just cant remember the precious encounters Or do you think this was some sort of entityStay safe no sleep,Sleep paralysis a bad dream or is something following me,4
beccainjax,0,7,1qw6dy,0,HolyI just had the strangest dream I think I could have ever experiencedI was there looking in on this conversation I was a little girl sitting in a room and a little boy was sitting across from the table This part I forgot what we were doing The room was naked practically with one wall being full windows leading outside a normal door  could see trees people sidewalks so on and so forth outside Myself the little girl and the boy started having a conversation about something he started to ask certain questions football and such and myself the little girl started saying I remember this one time after I had gastric bypass I had a turkey sandwich and I The little boy interrupted me right there and said I do not want to hear this got up and proceeded to the door Myself got mad got up went to the little boy and quickly finished the sentence I remember this one time after I had gastric bypass I had a turkey sandwich and I ate it so fast I threw up and started crying really hard and started just laughing The little boy looked up at myself and said I would have just stuck to football All the sudden this vehicle came out of no where and I was in the state between being awake and sleeping I heard this soft radio signal sound and a faint female voice say hello can anyone hear me I heard me myself me as I am typing this reply yes The female voice said Can you do us a favor I woke upWhatintheworldjusthappenedI am laying here scared to get out of bed sweating my feet are in a cold sweat my cats are still here thankfully I am literally afraid to go back to sleep,I have no idea what the hell just happened,6

Vehellenstrife,0,5,1qt843,0,Part I The Demon on the Bed httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqklmzabriefhistorypartithedemononthebedPart II A Lonely Dream  httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqofqabriefhistorypartiialonelydreamShortly after my first experience with this Demon entity god or whatever it was me and my mom were talking about visions that the prophets in the church had eventually we got into our dreams you know back and forth this is where we talked about the dreams I mentioned in my previous story until I decided to deaden the atmosphere and tell her about my experience and the dream I had days after needless to say she was terrified thinking I had encountered Lucifer himself she asked if I offered to shake his hand In mormon belief if you think  you may be in the presence of an angel you are advised to ask for a handshake a legitimate angel would be able to shake your hand a Demon would kindly Refuse and Satan would go in for the handshake but his hand would pass through yours considering he has no body I smirked Yeah next time Ill ask him if he wants to shake my hand after I finish worshiping him I said smugly My dad got a better job in Farmington Nm  and we moved to my grandparents I didnt have any problems since then and I had all but forgotten about the ordeal until I woke up one night petrified with terror I had a cold sweat all over my body and it felt like there was no oxygen in the room I was trying to breathe but it was extremely difficult my eyes were darting rapidly from each shadow in the room I was staying in I dont really know how to explain it but I could not move like my mind could not communicate with my body hours seemed to go by all of a sudden I heard a loud bang I would have jumped right out of my skin if I werent immobilized My eyes flashed to the source of the sound My closet was open I could have almost swore it was shut Silencelike nothingjust voidness I was getting scared I tried to call for help but all that came out was a whisper I was still staring at the closet the blackness seemed unreal I prayed I prayed to god nothing would happen prayed that I could just go back to sleep but then out of the darkness a pale bony hand reached out and grabbed the edge of the closet and seemed to use it as leverage to pull what was following out of the blackness The robed figure walked out of the closet this time was a lot more intimidating than the last I was terrified of the man with each step he took my fear grew several times over until he stopped to the left of me lurching over my bed he sat there for minutes just looking at me Then he came down and sat right next to me much like a parent would when reading stories In My mind I was screaming I am almost certain that I was crying although I cannot remember if I could I do remember that I was in complete Terror and I realized that the feeling seemed to be emanating from this man I could not see him at all but I could feel what he was feeling if that makes sense I could feel his entertainment at watching a small child try to cower and scream but could not after a minute of just sitting by me he took his hand and brushed it lightly against my skin making it freeze on contact I could only lie down and watch He kept brushing my skin his head tilted to the right and in my mind I heard the words Never forget me again in an old cruel voice he stopped brushing and stood up and walked to the closet he walked in and turned around his hand on the door and then He slammed it shut right as the door  banged the room was filled with yellow light my eyes hurt My mom came rushing into the room and embraced me I was cold she was hushing me telling me that it would be ok It wasnt until now that I realized that my throat was sore apparently I had been screaming for several seconds I cried into my mothers shoulder  She shrugged it off as a night terror I never told her about that time I saw the man I thought I was crazy at the time I must have been jumping at shadows for weeks I was sleeping with the lights on but as time went on I graduated middle school and  became a freshman in Highschool The memory of the hooded man began to fade away and I started sleeping with the lights off as it was already hard enough to get sleep with all the extra work Eventually He was only something I would think of when me and my cousin went camping and told scary stories around the fire I never told the story about my experience in farmington but people would always ask about  The night I   met Satan but school drowned out any other distractions from my work eventually we moved to Kirtland just ten minutes from Farmington Little did I know that this would be a lifechanger for me and that the man was not too happy at all with meps I am actually living in the same house that I had this experience in if you would like pictures of the closet tell me how to put pictures on this damn thing the way the closet is made is really weird and if you slam it it makes a real loud bang but yeah and before you ask no I would never even go into that room when it is dark much less sleep in it,A Brief

judison,3,13,1qqual,0,Hey guys its November and that means uni exam time as I am stressed to the maxRecently something happened to me and Im freaking out everyone thinks Im going mentally retarded because of exam stress but Im serious something is happening PLEASE LISTEN TO MY STORY AND HELP ME OUT  I REALLY REALLY CANTUGH  I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO IM PRETTY SCAREDOk first let me give you some background information Im  female university rd year student I have recently moved out of home in a suburban apartment and my neighbour is an annoying  year old horny twit who occasionally swings by knocking on my door hoping for me to allow him to give me some special exam stress relief but I never really answered the door Right now I cant stop crying or shaking as Im typing this but ok so basically my story started at the local video store I am a horror fanatic Im always at the horror section searching for new movies to watchUnfortunately after  years of watching  horror movies a day I had ran out of options and there was nothing new to watch I keep digging around the old vintage stock for an old movie Ive probably missed but nothing Just when I was about to give up at the very back of the DVD pile I spotted a black box with no barcode or label on it Inside was a video tape with the title reading horror tape  and since I was one of the few ancient people who still had a video tape player I stupidly though OK Good enough This was properly the dumbest mistake I could ever make I went to the counter to borrow my movie but for some odd reason the line was absolutely massive I knew it was going to rain soon and I forgot to bring my umbrella Probably a sign to leave the tape and GTFO so I just sneakily walked out with the tape there was no barcode so Its not like I would get caught Karma got me back good though So when I got back I set up my old video tape player popped in the tape and played it And god the first thing I saw was staticWTFFFFFFF I thought it was a dud tape hence the no label or barcode Frustrated and wet I just left it on and went to dry my hair from the rain minutes later the tv made a boom and the once static image screen went to a scene of an old misty farm with a well in the middleAt the time I was thinking and you wouldve also been thinking the same GREAT a dodgy cheap imitation version of the ring and you know what the damn creep long haired bitch came right on que crawling out of that goddamn well What was really interesting about this was she was holding a hacksaw pretty sure this wasnt in the original A few moments later and she was out of the well and I guess walking towards the screen forward you know what I mean Head down droopy arms slow staggered walk and dragging a hacksaw along this was on the horror movie scale alright The visuals was amazing and dark and twisted I liked it and decided to sit back and enjoy abit After minutes she was still walking minutes still walking  minutesminutes etc the only thing different was the scenery as she travelled from places to placesI was getting annoyed and bored and decided to turn the tv off but asI pressed the off button it didnt turn offeven more annoying Something at that point really caught my interest the scenery looked familiar Im pretty sure she was walking past the primary school that was  or  streets away from my apartment I was a little freaked out but the thrill turned my horror loving instinct on so I kept watching Eventually she was getting closer and closer to my apartment she was now at the next block away and slowly she was on my block My assumption at the time was that it was a prerecorded tape my friends made me and tactically plan to make me watch and scare me highly unlikely but what else was there to thinkThis is where I really got freaked out I heard the engine of my other nonhorny neighbour car drive past my apartment and within seconds I saw her car drive past in the video as wellWTF WTF this isnt normal I began to get shivers and I froze as she turned to the front of my apartment block She just stood there with her hacksaw for  seconds and suddenly began to start walking again towards the apartment blockUp the stairs she went and I just helplessly watched by now I was in tears Up the stairs she continued to walk she was on level  and I was on level  I remember just suddenly pouncing up and grabbing my baseball bat and standing in front of door looking out into my keyhole Finally she was on level  and I stared at the staircase waiting for her As I turned to watch her reach the top of the staircase to my level the tv let out a loud BOOM It went pitch black and I turned around AND suddenly heard a loud bang on my door MY HEART EXPLODED I NEARLY PISSED MYSELF Something grabbed me My door started to bang again and this time it was my horny neighbour drunk and horny as ever viciously knocking on my door to let him in I didnt feel the hand anymore and quickly open my door to let him in I can shamelessly say I screwed him sillypurely out of fear of being left alone and its been weird around my apartment lately Sorry Ill update you later after I finish my last exam but please give me thoughts and tips,Creep tv girl,12
jayden,0,6,1qvzio,0,The past week has sucked Last night we had to make our own dinner And the night before we had nothing to eat Not to mention the weather has been rainy for the past three days I cant even go bush walking in the afternoons after school I sat down on the veranda to enjoy the view with while eating my recently made chicken wrap Finally a good meal to end the day My house is on a hill and we have the best view ever We can see all of my suburb I live in Australia And everyone in Australia is wonderful and nice or so I thoughtSo I was relaxing and enjoying the food as well as the view Looking to my right I can see the amazing view of the lake I stared at the lake for some while The last time I saw it it had an amazing crystal effect upon the water but the clouds of boredom has covered the sun rays to do that So I got bored and looked somewhere elseI look straight ahead gazing down upon my suburb The suburb I grew up in the suburb I love It looked very boring today It was very foggy and was almost dusk I could just see the mountain in the far distance that protects my suburb I look to my left to see the bush land The bush land I grew up in as a child the woods that holds my dearest memories But tonight the woods gave me the creeps Covered in fog just like any other bush it looked creepy I live on the outline of my suburb So the bush is close by And thats when I saw itI was just trying my best to enjoy the view I always do But not as well when its foggy the bush is extremely creepy when it is But thats not what made this particular night one of the most disturbing night of my life What was in the forestwas what made me frightenedIt was just dangling of a tree Or maybe it was not dangling of a tree It didnt seem to have any branches around it to support it Or perhaps I was too dazed by the sight to notice any branches It was a orangepink colour maybe a clothing that covered most of its body At first I didnt exactly know what it was I didnt know that it was alive Not until I looked more carefullyI am certain it was a baby A baby wearing orangepink clothing It was just dangling there No Not dangling squirming It had arms legs and I think I saw a head as well It was very hard to see but I saw its little arms and legs squirming around Trying to get down off the tree Trying to get free perhaps The poor babyOff course I was not really certain that it was actually a baby at this point I decided to go check it out without my parents permission I was badass So I ran up stairs put a jumper on put my jogger shoes on and off I went And obviously I brought my phone with me just to be safe I didnt care if it was raining or not How selfish do you think I am If its a real baby then I had to do somethingI ran through my front door and started running as my dogs started barking at me I did not care if I disturb the people living on my street I was just too worried about what I saw I had to go check out whatever that thing was It must of been a child What else moves around like that I was scared but I was determined to help Or maybe I was just too curiousIt didnt take me long to get out towards the bush The bush was behind a set of houses and the fastest and closest way to get towards where the baby was supposed to be was through a drive way And so thats what I did I was on another street and this drive way was shared between two houses One house on the left And one house on the right The drive way went straight up into the bush and then nothing Just hill and trees and maybe a hanging baby But I sure hoped notEven though I had a sharp pain in my chest I kept on running Unfortunately I am not a very fit person But off course that is off topic and does not matter As I was running I stopped Dead in my tracks I was stopped to a sound I stopped to listen to this sound A sound of a manWhat are you doing a voice said I turned to my right to see a man at his door He had a smile on his face At first I was worried but I figured that he must of been the owner of the house on the right of the drive way He was just taking the garbage out Thank GodUmmmnn Good day mate Im just going for a run I said silently I didnt want to tell him I was looking for a hanging baby I would of sounded crazy I wanted to act like a normal joggerYou are going for a run In the rain He said as hes smile faded into a a worried look No not just a worried look I swear I saw anger in his expressionI just turned and ran up his drive way towards the bush land Completely ignoring him He creeped me out I turned back just before I took my right into the bush land he was staring straight at meI am very good at navigation I used to go bush walking all the time when I was young One time we made a track of the particular bush area We had places like the Giant Rock that took bravery to get there You had to crawl and a small hole in between thorny bush And yes the giant rock was a mini cliff So crawling through the small thorny area was worth it unless you have claustrophobia Anyhow no matter how hard I looked and no matter how good at navigation I was I did not find the hanging baby I looked for ages I looked at every branch at where it should have been But I did not find it I sure wish I did because I just knew it was a baby I definitely saw it movingAs I was heading back down and around the corner of the house of the creepy man towards the drive way I looked at the house It had yellow sand bricks and a red roof It had a window at the back of the house with a glass door And there he was behind the window just staring at me The creepy man I swear he was smiling but I am not so sure After I looked at him for about ten seconds in fear I started to leave But I noticed something that made the hair on my neck stand upAfter that I just ran home as fast as I could This has been one of many creepy experiences of my life I hope it was not a baby But now that I think about it as I am typing I think it was Because through the window Of the creepy mans house I remember seeing a pink pram But I could not see all of the pink in the pram Because it was covered in mud,The baby was just hanging there,4

Jaunt,68,171,1qwru3,711,I opened the present What the fuck is this shit Oh wow grandpa thanksHe pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and said Its a Ham Radio son I used to have one when I was younger Its got a hundred mile range so you can talk to people all the way out in Fairview Real conversations not the text messages or emails you all use these days Ill even let you use my old license and call signYeah Im never going to do any of that Sounds great grandpaLets set it up togetherUh yeah coolHe spent two hours setting it up showing me how to operate it and telling me stories about the other hams hed met over the years He switched it on and got in contact with some gruff sounding dude out in Fairview They had a lively discussion about how the FCC was oppressing their constitutional rightsI caught a movie with Jeremy got some free pancakes at IHOP and turned in early A mediocre birthday like always I have a bad habit of drinking soda before bed and as usual I ended up staring at the ceiling wide awake I browsed Reddit for a while but you can only see so many cat pictures before they all start to look the sameI flicked on the ham radio and fiddled with the tuner Other than the police band the air traffic tower and some guy ranting about the Federal Reserve it was quiet I sighed laid back in bed and started to doze offThats when I heard itAt first I thought I imagined it I was in that halfawake halfasleep state where your thoughts start to play tricks on you I thought maybe I had started dreaming before I was fully asleep and had hallucinated a soundA sound like a voice calling through staticI listened for a moment Nothing Just a dream I turned over on my side and closed my eyesI snapped back awake There it was again for certain this time A voice calling out as if from a great distanceIt was coming from the radioI turned the volume up as far as it would go but I could still hear only the faintest sound like someone calling from the bottom of a well I adjusted the tuner for better reception but it didnt help I picked up the microphone and spoke into it HelloThe voice stopped There was a long moment of silence Then the voice called out again more clearly this time Hello HelloHello Can you hear me I suddenly felt very stupid It was probably just another weirdo survivalist out in the woods who wanted to babble about EMP blasts and the gold standard or something Still there was something in his voice An urgency that was hard to ignoreThere was a fluctuation in the static and the voice came in again Hello He said something else something in what I assumed was GermanIm sorry I cant understand you I only speak EnglishHe spoke again and I could hear how thick his accent was Please I ask you When are youWhere am I Im in Chester About forty miles outside FairviewNo no The static was starting to overtake the voice again When are youExcuse meWhat time What yearI stared at the radio So this was one of those ham weirdos that grandpa was talking about I shook my head and chucked a little Uh its  dudeThere was an excited barrage of German that turned desperate when the static started drowning him out Please I must ask you Please waitThen nothingI set the microphone down Great Another outlet for creepers to say creepy shit We sure dont have enough of those in the world I switched the radio off and went to sleepWhat the fuck is that shit Jeremy saidI rolled my eyes Ham radio My grandpa got it for my birthdayThats hilarious Does it workYeah hundred mile range Its stupid though The police band is sort of interesting but other than that its just survivalists and conspiracy nutsThats awesome We should pretend were under siege during a zombie attack like do some War of the Worlds shit with this thingI laughed I dont know man its just a lot of weirdos on there Like the other day I was listening to it and this one guyJeremy switched the radio on and immediately I heard a frantic voice calling out Hello HelloThis guy I said This guy is a fucking psychoDude sweet I love talking to psychos Jeremy picked up the microphone HelloHello the voice sounded overjoyed Please do not go I do many fixes to machine Transmission is very much betterJeremy giggled Dude youve got fucking Bruno on your radio He spoke into the microphone Ja das is gut Much sound BravoSprechen Sie DeutschIve had a few semesters yeahThey spoke back and forth in German for a bit What are you saying I askedJeremy sat back and shook his head This guy is a piece of work I asked him where hes located and he said long ago many years in your pastWhen I talked to him he wanted to know what year it wasHes playing a prank He probably goes on here pretends to be a time traveler to troll the survivalists and then puts the recordings up on YouTube Actually pretty brilliant if you ask meAsk him how hes communicating from the pastJeremy spoke into the microphone and there was an excited flood of German from the other endWhats he saying I askedI have no fucking ideaI thought you spoke GermanLevel three If he was describing the animals he was seeing on a safari I could maybe follow him But hes talking about like particle tunnels and chaotic duality waves or something I dont think I could understand him even if I was fluentThe voice on the radio sighed and took a long pause Then with heaviness in his tone he said Please Tell me about your worldI scoffed We should switch it offJeremy looked shocked WhyHes fucking with usSo Hes doing a great job of it Dont be such a downer This is the most interesting conversation Ive had in a while so I say fuck it Lets play time travelersWe told him about our future world We described airplanes selfdriving cars space stations microchips We tried to describe a smartphone which was difficult to do with the voices shitty English and Jeremys shitty German He was fascinated by the Internet awestruck by the moon landing greatly amused when we played some Daft Punk as an example of futuristic culture Jeremy spent a weird amount of time talking about his VitamixAnd through it all the voice kept repeating Beautiful So beautifulOkay enough about us mein herr Jeremy said Your turn Tell us about your worldA long silence My world the voice said is very dark Bad things happening I do not knowhow we will escape the shadowThis guys a great improviser Jeremy saidPlease my friends I have question It is very important I must ask youJeremy smiled Sure man go aheadThe voice asked something in German Jeremy frownedSuddenly there was a noise like breaking glass from the radio The voice gasped Nein nein There were other voices angry voices clamoring and shouting It sounded like a crowd was in the room and they were wreaking havoc Loud bangs and thuds like furniture being turned over The voices grew louder and louder There was a tremendous crashThen silenceI looked over at Jeremy What the fuck happenedHe shook his head I dont know Other people were there They were saying Dog Worthless dog over and over again Sounded like they smashed the place upI fiddled with the tuner but there was no sign of the voice Jeremy and I sat quietly for a momentHis question I said What did he ask youJeremy stared at the radio He said Can they be stoppedToo much soda again Another insomniac night I counted the cracks in the ceiling over and over Over and over My eyes began to feel heavy at lastA burst of static from the radio made my heart jump I shot upright in bed and looked over The static faded out and the voice faded in He was speaking German quite softlyAnger flared in my chest I was sick of this Sick of him and his stupid pranks I wanted to smash that goddamn radio to piecesI grabbed the microphone and shouted Leave me alone for Christs sake I dont care about your stupid fucking time travel act just stop bothering me and leave me aloneBut he just spoke over me like he couldnt hear me at all His voice was shaky and quiet I couldnt understand what he was saying but I could feel a great sadness in his toneI grabbed my phone and opened the voice recorder I sat there listening and recording until he was finished speaking I sat in silence for a few minutes to make sure nothing else was coming through then I switched the radio offI sent the audio file to Jeremy with an explanation of what had happened I asked him to translate The next day at school he handed me a sheet of paper at lunch He didnt say anything he just handed it to me and walked awayIt readgt My friends I do not know if you can hear me I do not know if you could ever hear me or if I was imagining our encounter But I hope you are out theregt The machine is critically damaged Perhaps with a great deal of work it could be repaired but I doubt that I will have either the resources or the time necessary for such a task I am deeply saddened that we could not speak further There are so many questions I wanted to ask so much more I wanted to learn about your world But please know that in the brief time we were able to speak you gave a tired man a reason to continue livinggt I know now that the madness that has gripped my country cannot be stopped I tell my son to be strong I tell him that our people have endured for thousands of years I tell him that if we were strong enough to build the Pyramids we are strong enough to withstand a few grunting apes in jackboots But he knows I am afraid too We are marching forward into a nightmare that will take a terrible toll on all of us I do not know when it will end The only thing I can cling to is the fact that somehow our world will lead to yoursgt I think of your world and I feel something I havent felt in many years An emotion almost unknown to the people of my time I feel hope For in a world such as yours a world of such wondrous invention and progress what use could there be for war What reason for hunger What tolerance for injustice I know in my heart that you have solved the problems that have plagued our species and created a world of enduring peace and unitygt I do not know how such a world could spring from the darkness that is enveloping this continent But I hope that the future is as beautiful as you described it I hope you have built the world that we could not I hope you have learned from our mistakes I hope you treat each other with the dignity and respect that is the birthright of all humanity I hope you have forgotten the word for hate I hope that things are differentgt Goodbye my friends from the shadowsgt Dr Albert Bachman Frankfurt Germany November th A prank Thats all it was I dont even know why Im even posting this Theres no way it was actually some scifi miracle It was obviously just someone with too much time on his hands playing a big joke on us Hes probably listening to the recordings and laughing at us right nowJust a prankButI still keep the radio on at night Ill switch it on as Im laying in bed and sometimes when Im starting to drift off Ill think I hear a distant voice calling out in the dark A voice from the shadows tiny and frail yet full of hope And Ill sit up in bed and listen Ill listen for a sound a word anything But I never hear more Just my mind playing tricks on meI dont sleep much

horriddaydream,86,140,1r338n,570,My mother left when I was fourNormally that wouldnt mean anything but I suspected for a long time that the porcelain dolls were coming from her like some pitiful little attempt to show me that she loved me My father he worked overtime to keep things going in the household even if it was just the two of us His hands were always worn from working the machines at the shop and he slaved even more when he got home and had to make supper for himself and I and go through my nightly routines before I hit the sack I sometimes woke up in the middle of the night and he was still awake cleaning a room in the house and I thought to myself This man is dedicated Has to be awake in only a few hoursand here he is I love my father and I always haveOne of his most trusted friends from high school Alexander was my babysitter from the time my mother left to the time I was about seven years old We trusted Alexander He worked night shift and so he was able to work babysitting in around his hours and he would have done anything to help out my father to make that work My father paid him even though he asked for nothing he said he was just doing his good deed and I like it anyway My dad used to come home from work and Alexander would pick up his bags full of toys that we played with he always brought the best toys and trinkets with him His daughter had passed away when she was ten years old and I think it brought him great joy to now share her old toys with another little girl He would say to my dad She was great for me She ate well and she took her usual long nap Ill be back tomorrow And he always came back Well eventually times changed and my dads work schedule changed with them We didnt see Alexander anymore because we didnt NEED Alexander anymore My father thought that they lost touch permanently and when I asked about him he told me truthfully that Alexander was a very busy man And he understood that and I did too For my eighth birthday the first porcelain doll arrived It had beautiful blonde curly hair and a painted on face She was wearing what looked to be an expensive velvet dress with an attached tutu She came inside a stuffed envelope with nothing else on the package to identify who had sent her Just my name that was all The first thing that my father did was call my grandmother who said No I didnt drive by and place a present on the porch Im not her coward mother I would have given it right to her That gave my father the second idea my mother Only thing was we had no way of getting in touch with her and finding out for she had literally taken off and abandoned us both And over the next few weeks nobody came forth and said they had gotten me the doll so we assumed this is who had sent itThey showed up every year since then Each unique in their own ways each more beautiful than the last I thought it was a little odd yes Especially because my mother made no outreach to me so if she was sending me gifts but not bothering to even so much call me and check up then that was just plain rude of her and her gifts meant literally nothing But I continued to set them up on my shelf in my bedroom and they looked nice there I supposeThe year I turned nineteen I was moved into college and was taking courses on my birthday My father called me from home and asked me when I was coming back home for a break and I told him that I had time this weekend but I only said this because I sensed some urgency in his voice I could make it work He told me not to worry about anything but that he would really like to see me Then he stressed that I always lock my doors and always have somebody walking with me if I was out past dark which I already knewI returned home that weekend and my father said there had been an accidentMy porcelain birthday doll had arrived my nineteenth year doll When my father brought it inside the house it had smashed into a hundred separate piecesInside there was a diary entry on a piece of paperWe spent the entire day smashing open every porcelain doll and the entire night speaking with the policeAlexander had written diary entries for every time he had drugged and molested me each more explicit admitting that he had done the same to his daughter up until the time of her horrible death My father and I hadnt a dry eye in our house that entire night and I continued to have problems throughout my college career knowing that Alexander was somewhere out there probably assuming a new identity and doing the same thing to other girlsNow I know why he had always commented on me taking such usual long napsFollowhttpswwwfacebookcomDaydreamPublishing,Birthday Presents,710
honeymoonatthefalls,59,121,1r0fus,540,The falls have a pull according to the locals  Something dark and unearthly like a sirens song sweet and somehow terrible  It draws people of a certain intent  Thats the polite way to say a lot of people end up crushed on the rocks below their limbs torn apart by the unending rush of water the brains that made them who they were nothing more than bits of foam and meat floating to the surface   a year in fact depending on who you askWe were happy  Werent we  I thought we were  I thought maybe we were different from everyone else that wed actually make it  We wouldnt end up in that  statistic  Wed grow old together laughing at the same stupid jokes knowing what was going to come out of the others mouth before they even had a chance to say itWas it the pressure of the wedding  The fact that Im still between jobs  Young somethings in one of Americas bleakest economies doing what we could to get by  Scrambling for every scrap as the magazine covers reminded us how worthless our generation is the snide remarks about our smartphones and Facebook and selfies  Maybe getting married wasnt a good ideaBut we were in love  We were in love and we knew deep down in that secret place in our stomachs that she was the one for me and I for herSo then why did it happenNo  Im not supposed to ask that anymore  Im supposed to accept that shes gone  Im supposed to accept the fact that shes her own statistic now one of  people a year  Another tumble of bones on the body count thats reached over  since the falls became an attraction both for tourists and people with death on their mindBut its hard to accept when I can still see her face so clearly that sweet heartshaped face with the little crescentmoon scar on her left nostril the way her big blue eyes lit up when she showed me the fantastic deal she scored on Groupon a Niagara Falls getaway for our honeymoonIf only I could go back  Tell her that the price was nice but Id rather go to a beach or Ireland it doesnt matter anywhere but those cursed fallsIts impossible to describe how it feels to stand at the crest of Niagara the mist peppering your face like cold little kisses drinking in the smells and the sound and the remarkable way the water rushes down down ever down  Your existence seems like a cosmic joke in comparison to this almost hauntingly beautiful feat of nature  For a moment it isThe locals say you can tell who has a death wish by how close theyll get to the edge  Those who shy away who shake their heads and insist nervously that they can see just fine from where they are thank you very much those are the ones who cant trust themselves to get too close  If they get too close to the edge some little part of them knows theyll jumpShe didnt shy away  She went right up to the railing  She was smilingThats the worst part  She was smilingIt was early in the morning one of those damp gray dawns only possible in the new spring of upstate New York  We had the sight to ourselves  It was a little spooky being out there alone the kind of spooky you get from being in an empty shopping mall after hours all those metal gates pulled down and the lights turned offShe was standing there a little too high on the guardrail leaning just a little too far over smiling as the mist touched her lips and made her hair curl in damp little tendrils on her cheeks  She was beautifulIll never know why I pushed herThats something I have to acceptWe dont sleephttpwedontsleepanthologytumblrcom,Ill never know why it happened Thats something I have to accept,661
yurglar,64,90,1qrlzl,390,This is a true story and by all means I am fully aware all stories on this website are true however I am also fully aware of the suspicion natural to people upon hearing something beyond their comprehension The case Im about to relate to you is one of those situations where reason and logic mean nothing when compared to the facts and I wish to find someone who believes me here I am a doctor a pathologist normally in charge of autopsies and anatomical studies at a highly regarded university its name is not relevant for the narrative I am writing here in this site because all my doctored friends do not believe a single word I tell them and I have also been threatened of losing my post at both the morgue and the university I do know however that I am perfectly saneThe events began when I took a trip alone as I have no close family to the north of Europe to Sweden It was not on holidays the University of Uppsala invited me to give teach there an offer which I quickly accepted I needed the money and Uppsala was quite a prestigious university boasting  Nobel Laureates However I did not stay in Uppsala I stayed at a town further north near a forest a beautiful and serene place just half an hour away I stayed in an old typical Swedish house painted red with a dark rooftop and a small garden There was something odd about it but I ignored it I should never have done so I stayed there a few nice months opening bodies and examining entrails until it started getting cold and the ravens started circling around the village crops The leaves were starting to fall and there was something ominous about the whole village atmosphere People seemed sullen and shut in old ladies gave me hateful looks and kids avoided my path like I was some kind of pedophile I was starting to think the townsfolk were avoiding me for some reason and upon reaching that conclusion I decided to talk to the only friend I had there named Father Erik the local priest I told him about the townsfolk behavior as he was the only man who did not show any signs of being afraid of me He looked at me and I remember he smiled his teeth shining through his thin lips They think you are this years Midvinterblot Midwhat I replied Father Erik then explained it to me how in this place back in the Viking age and throughout the middleages had a ritual performed here where men were chosen to be sacrificed to please the old Norse gods Midwinter blood Father Erik Ragnerson said slowly like the words meant anything to me And how is that related to what I told you I asked as politely as I can He shook his head Youre not from here you wouldnt understand These people think he chuckled think the dead come back every nine years to claim another sacrifice another Midvinterblot I saw the Christian disbelief in his green eyes and the same disbelief was also in mine pale blue eyes Viking dead I asked somehow amused to which he responded affirmatively I cannot remember his words correctly adding that the souls of previous Midvinterblots are the responsible for the collection of yet another We quickly shifted the conversation as another proof of how foolish town superstition is something global and went through several beers to which he did not say no in spite of being a man of GodThat night I returned home from the church slightly dizzy with the beverage There was snow all over and I held my scarf over my nose afraid it would freeze My house was at the end of the road and I kept walking steadily I remember as if it had been yesterday the shivers that ran down my spine as I head distant loud horns playing and ululating voices Coming from the dark from the forest The streetlamps flickered and I closed my eyes shut and when I opened them the sound was gone with the wind I thought back then the cold was just messing with my brain so as soon as I got home I drank hot tea and sat in front of the fireplace I googled all Father Erik Ragnerson had told me and confirmed it Then with some curiosity I accessed the towns morgue register That was one of the privileges my profession had Running through the names there was an odd pattern I ran my hand through my hair and that time the hair on the back of my neck prickled Every nine years a person had been found dead in gruesome circumstances in the snow of Midwinter However suicides were far more common in Sweden than car crashes where I come from and the police never paid it any heed That was when I should have left but my stubborn mind refused to see the evidence and I lingered until Midwinter finally arrivedThat day I had forgot about all the townsfolk nonsense and was busy in my study drawing an anatomical diagram when someone knocked on my door As a precaution I had become weary of serial killers or general psychos and went to the kitchen grabbed a butchers knife and opened the door to find a small old wrinkled woman looking up at me Hello I asked inquisitively the knife hidden behind my back Wear this tonight For Midvinterblot She held out a white tunic to me I remember snapping angrily at her telling the few Swedish insults I knew and grabbed the tunic from her shriveling hands hellbent on burning the thing The woman walked away and when she turned her head she had the ugliest expression I have seen in this world an expression of hate disgust and cruelty combined Angrily I kept working until I fell asleep on top of the table only to be awoken by a man on the TV announcing a starless night That is when the knock came As soon as it hit my door I felt my heart sink the TV went quiet and all the lights candles and illumination were gone with wisps of smoke I stood up gulped nervously and rationally grabbed the butchers knife still standing near me from my encounter with the old woman earlier I took cautious steps to the door and inhaling deeply opened it with a full swingThe image that was before my eyes still haunts me today A procession of people walking in the snow along the village road dressed in white tunics all shaven and either with their throats slit or limbs chopped of All of them were pale wore blank expressions and had dirt all over them like they had literally rose from their graves The drums sounded loud and all was silent but from their thud As soon as I opened the door they all stopped and turned their heads to me at once some in impossible angles twisted and turned Screaming I closed the door The townsfolk were hiding in their homes afraid and I remember how quickly the dead began to bang on my door on my walls Thinking quickly I came up with the stupidest idea I dressed the white tunic took some white powder I had in the bathroom and ran to the backyard and around the house pretending to be another one of the dead As I struggled through the thick snow my heart stopped when one of the dead turned its shaved head which I remember was painted with dark patterns and circles and spoke to me in a deep voice something so obscure it still shivers me today For some reason he seemed regal as if he was the commander of the procession He said something in old Swedish a harsh voice from the afterlife impossible to describe in words I nodded instinctively almost pissing myself and the man turned away and kept walking towards my houseI ran as soon as he was a good distance away my feet burning in the snow and my entire body turning purple with the cold I remember knocking at Father Eriks house and how he opened the door I remember taking a shower and crying in front of him like a baby as I told him how I had luckily escaped After I recovered somehow Father Erik still eyed me with disbelief The man actually talked to you Yes he bloody did I snapped angrily What did he say the calm still rational priest asked Surely he had heard the drums I though I told him the words the dead had said in old Swedish and I saw his face go pale and his eyes widen What does it mean I asked half afraid of the answer It means Father Erik said trembling Death awaits the heathen priest I dismissed his superstitions trying to convince him there were more priests in the surrounding villages and the next day I left Sweden Father Erik Ragnerson and the town behindYesterday after nine years I received a mail from Swedish authorities telling me how a man had been brutally nailed to the front door of my previously owned house in Sweden and that they would desire to ask me some questions His name was Erik Ragnerson,Midvinterblot,480

Twilight online but I want you to know right now that its not because I actually like the movie I was drunk and needed something to laugh at okayAnyway I was past three shots of rum when the CAPTCHA

movie while our other roommate Ava did homework in her roomI was hungover in the morning so I stayed in bed and streamed more movies It was time for Breaking Dawn except this time I was actually interested in Bella and Edwards relationship Dont judge I was sprawled in my bed weakly navigating to the stream page when another CAPTCHA appearedKILL AVAI narrowed my eyes What the fuck I forgot about Breaking Dawn and sat up rubbing at my eyes At this point it wasnt funny anymore it was just weird Ava isnt a very common name and what kind of sick CAPTCHA algorithm would generate stuff like

skippedYo Ava I yelled Maybe CAPTCHA went all NSA on me Come on I want to show you somethingYeah She rounded the corner into my room wearing her usual placated smileI spun around the laptop on my lap to face her I tilted the screen so she could read and as I did her expression dropped from a smile to neutral as stoneI watched her expression with one of those eager dog faces after you show someone something funnyShe punched me in the mouthI whipped over the side of the bed and smacked on the floor eyes rolling to Ava for a split second before she kicked me hard in the stomachI retched and rolled over scrabbling to get up hair in my eyes and my heart thumping She was screaming the entire time this shrill onenote screech kicking me over and over again As she rolled back for another kick my mind suddenly snapped into action I threw myself to my desk and she threw herself at me screaming and scratching at my eyes I grabbed the knife in my desk and jammed it in her shoulder She screamed dislodging herself before running out of my roomI stood shaking before lunging at my door to lock it I drew back and caught my face in my mirror my mouth was dribbling blood and I was missing a front tooth I looked like a hillbilly Whatever I already go to college in South Carolina Deal with that laterNothing that happened in the past five minutes made any sense but I knew that I had to get out of the house I couldnt stay locked up in the apartment with herI grabbed my tote bag and pocketknife before waiting at my door for a minute listeningNothingKnife in hand I cracked my door open and looked

whispersFIRSTANDLASTfirstandlastfirstandlastnonononononononononononoFirst and last Uh no thank youI rushed past her door and out the front door to the apartment complex I decided to go to my friend

the door on the first knock giving my hillybilly mouth the stinkeye Kierra what the hell happened to your faceAva beat me upWhatI pushed past him and dumped my stuff on his couch before grabbing paper

mofoWas she drunk he askedNo You know she doesnt get drunk I was getting antsy I tossed the paper towel in the trashcan once the bleeding steamed The whole thing seemed completely batshit Ava was

thorninhisside,78,177,1qtj6z,347,I dont know if what I saw was true But Im pretty sure it was You might think me mad but Ive read loads of accounts of people on the internet where people who have had shit like this happen to the recount it for others to read And now Im doing the same So here goesSnapchat is a fun little app where people take selfies and send them to each other I used Snapchat pretty much every day to send pictures of myself doing stupid things to my friends and they would send pictures of themselves back That was up until that one afternoonI had just returned home after a long day at school made even longer by my friends absence due to his little brothers funeral so I decided to recline on the sofa and procrastinate on my IPad for a while As it usually did my procrastination took the form on messing about on Snapchat I had a few unopened pictures several of them from my friend who had been absent that day I opened them Each of them was a selfie of him in his room after the funeral He looked like shit I guess he just wanted sympathy from the many girls he was looking to hook up with So I sent him a picture of me with a message attached saying Chin up man It wasnt long until he replied He just replied with a sombre image of himself and a simple message saying thanks But something caught my eye for the briefest second  A pair of eyes sunken and dead peering out of his wardrobe I was a little shaken by this as I could not be sure that I saw what I saw For images sent via Snapchat can only be viewed for  seconds then theyre deleted I replied immediately Are you all right man With a picture of me trying not to look freaked out I waited anxiously for his reply When the little notification that I had  unread Snapchat popped up on my screen I was slightly nervous about opening it I was worried about what Id see I was worried about what was waiting for me Curiosity took the better of me  I opened the message Another picture of my friend and a simple message saying Yeah At this point my IPad froze leaving the picture message from my friend on the screen I couldnt do anything The home button didnt work nor did the lock button I was left with the image of my friend staring back at me  This gave my chance to view the picture with more depth After close inspection I saw nothing out of order No eyes in the wardrobe door In fact his wardrobe door was closed I was about to hook my iPad up to my computer to see if I could unfreeze my device when I noticed that my wardrobe door was wide open,Snapchat,524
TheeMikeG,19,60,1r4fsf,273,Dear MikeTheyre letting me write a letter so I figured Id get my story out thereIt was a routine night drop nothing different from what weve done countless times before The steady hum of the C as it tore through the clouds was the only thing keeping me calm Yeah Ive done this a lot but you can never get rid of the nerves before a mission We had an idea of what awaited us down there but we couldnt be a hundred percent sure People are unpredictable and thats scary The plan from higher was to have our five man team infiltrate by night drop a small village I cant pronounce to search for and capture or kill a HVT whose name I also cant pronounce The gunship would rise up and provide overwatch until we were extracted Airborne all the way hooah The LT joined us again which he decided to do from time to time Nice enough guy I respected him Was supposed to be having a baby girl soon he would always talk about it during PT Good for him I could never hold down a relationship for very long I figured it was just because Ive seen too much shit to be normal and cuddle or whatever the fuck it is that couples do The rest of the squad was the usual guys Mitch Craft and Burroughs All experts in their craft We were a solid group and Id take a bullet or hell even two for any of them Thirty seconds shouted the LT from the bench a few spots to my right closest to the door The jumpmaster heaved the door upward and the familiar sound of air whooshing past the plane made my heart jump There was always a kick Hook up he shouted We all stood up in unison and clipped our static lines to the wire that ran through the plane above our heads I tugged on my static line to make sure it was attached There were no reserves for this one The jumpmaster held up his hand Five seconds The red light turned green and the LT positioned himself by the door The jumpmaster smacked his rear and the LT jumped out and was whisked away My stomach turned in knots Over a hundred jumps and I still hated this shit I was last to go out I tucked my head took a hop out of the plane and suddenly there was the rush and I felt myself getting tossed I heard my chute above and I breathed a sigh of relief Looking up to check my canopy I saw a fully inflated chute and I thanked the Lord once again I looked down for the rest of the squad and saw their chutes inflated too Past them I expected to see the ground but there was only a thick smoke or at least thats what it looked like A storm cloud Why didnt the jumpmaster hold off the jump until the bad weather passed Staus check I heard the LT ask through the radio As I watched the others canopies disappear into the black cloud I began to worry I heard the squad all check in though so I felt a little better  I held my hand up to my ear to activate our comms Sir whats the situation down thereZero visibility guys Pretty foggy Cant see my own canopy he saidThen I entered the black cloud and couldnt see a damn thing I heard something nearby Flapping My radio clicks before Mitch starts talking I heard something Flock of birdsWere too high replied the LT Eyes and ears open I tried to look around but there was no point I couldnt even see my canopy What if I was falling to my death right then Heavy flapping got my focus It sounded large whatever it was Sir something is up here with us I saySimmons stay calm whats gotten into Fuck Craft interrupts through the mic Then I hear a long painful scream far below me Jesus Christ yelled the LT Craft You thereSilence Not even static Guys stay calm Get ready to hit any minute I cant see the ground in this shit but well sort this out on the DZI checked my watch It takes maybe two minutes to hit jumping from a mile up Its been six minutes and I know this wasnt a HALO jump Was I caught in a thermal I pulled on my risers and felt myself drifting through the air When I released I didnt notice any change in descent speed The LT must have noticed the same thing because I could hear him cursing through the radio Theres a loud screech unlike anything Ive ever heard After it ended a few seconds later the LT had to shout over the commotion we were all making on the radio We were scared Guys I dont know what the fuck is going on but stay calm Weapons on amberMy combat gear was in a large sack between my legs but my USP was on my belt I took it out and held it ready I didnt know for what but I was ready to go How had we still not hit the ground yet Then I got an idea My combat load We are supposed to release if before landing and it slides down a twenty foot rope so we dont break our legs when we land I thought if I could cut it free maybe I could hear it hit the ground I asked for permission from the LT who quickly approved He must have been as freaked out as me to allow me to abandon my combat gear I pressed the handle on my hip and the gear slid down the rope and out of sight into the darkness I took out my knife and sawed at the line until it snapped I waited and waited but couldnt hear a thing I heard the flapping again and someone fired their weapon two three times Then silence Jesus Christ whispered the LT Status checkBurroughsSimmonsNothingSir what the fuck is going on I knew he wouldnt have an answer but I was desperate I have no ideaWe drifted through the air for ten more minutes Then I touched down I didnt hit hard it was like I was just set down Didnt even have to fall over I still couldnt see a damn thing though I heard quick steps and then Burroughs burst into view and tackled me to the ground He was frantic He begged me through tears to follow him We wandered around until we came to the LT He didnt have a right half of his body He was barely alive sputtering through bloody lips for us to run My baby my baby my baby he whispered over and over until he didnt say anything anymore The cloud cleared from the area behind him and there was this thing All I saw before I turned and ran was large leathery wings I heard the screeching and the flapping of those awful wings again Burroughs screamed as he was ripped backwards from beside me Somehow I burst out of the cloud and I saw headlights I nearly got hit by the jeep but dove out of the way just in time Out got two guards who spoke a language I didnt understand Burroughs was the translator They prodded me with machine guns and kicked and beat me until I was barely conscious How did they not see the thing behind me They dragged me into the back of their vehicle and drove me to their camp Ive been their POW for nearly a month now If you get this letter please get my story out there Im not crazy I promise I cant explain what happened any better than that Were not alone Something terrible is going on over here Time to go theyre beckoning me to come outside Its awfully dark out there Is a storm coming in ,Airborne Infantry,333
AmbiguousGopher,26,59,1r5xlc,272,For most of my life Ive been drawn to a certain room of my house A bedroom at the far end of my basement which used to be a guest bedroom I cant really explain why but I just always wanted to sleep there Until the age of  my older brother and I shared a room right across the hall from the bedroom of my parents When he was  however he moved into that bedroom and over the years the room become even more interesting The room is now filled with posters of The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix an authentic Spanish sword he bought hangs above his desk and loads of other bits and pieces which captured my imagination when I was younger To top it all off there was an air vent connecting his room and mine Almost directly below my room I could hear him some nights talking to his friends on the phone while playing video games late into the night I envied his freedom If I had tried that my parents right across the hall would hear me and Id be groundedWhen I was  myself my brother and sister twins left for college Now the only child at home I called my brother up one weekend and asked Can I have your roomMy brother paused for a long time before respondingNoHe gave no explanation but I didnt really care I could understand that when he came to visit Hed want his own room to sleep in For  more years i didnt ask to have the room again but when i was  my brother bought a house To me it seemed like he was pretty much beyond the point of having any reason to care about his old room so one day when he called to check up on things I asked againThis time he responded more quickly His voice sounded casual but at the same time It kinda freaked me out He saidNah let mom make it a guest room again Besides your room is super classy My room isnt that greatAnd so yet again I let it go I stayed in my room and didnt really think anything of it that is until last week This summer I started having severe anxiety attacks coupled with spells of incapacitating depression especially at night Ive been on different medicines to help and have been going to therapy to help work on relaxation techniques Last week my therapist noted that sometimes the brain can form associations with certain rooms or areas She suggested that my brain due to the recurring spells in my room may have formed a negative association with it She told me that switching rooms may help me relax when I start having an attackThat night I did it I switched to my brothers room and it was amazing Since my basement always stays around below room temperature the sheets and pillow stayed cool which was just to my liking I slept better than Id slept in weeks and thought that perhaps this room was going to turn things around But the second night didnt go as well I woke from a nightmare and felt as if there was someone watching me I shook the feeling and went back to sleep This kind of thing happened for a few more nights each time I awoke more worried than the last Then came the big one I fell asleep as usual and I began to dream another nightmare but this time it was more vivid In the dream I saw looking at my brother when he was only  or  years old He was sitting on his bed talking to something I couldnt see it but he was looking at an angle which suggested something much larger than himself Tears were flowing steadily from his eyes and he was pleading BEGGING the thing to go away to leave him alone The power in the room went out I heard a horrible screeching like a pig being tortured The lights turned back on and my brother lay there unconscious A large black bruise had appeared on his ribs The clock in his room recovered from the power outage blinking the numbers  My brother then jerked upright and walked over to the only poster in his room at the time his Hendrix poster He took a pen form his desk and put a tally mark on the wall behind itI jerked up in my brothers bed I turned on the lamp and looked around the room I noticed every poster Sweat started pouring from my forehead burning my eyes I looked at the clock The numbers blinked ,My Brothers Room,331
horriddaydream,37,132,1r0562,262,By the time that I was seventeen years old my parents sighed as they walked into my room one afternoon and told me that it was a necessity that I get my license I had been hanging onto that shitty little piece of paper for months that said that I could drive that meaningless little permit that meant nothing in comparison to the real deal My own license My reasoning behind waiting to get it I was terrified of the road despite the recognition others gave me that I was doing fairly well as only a permitted driver My father handed me the keys to his old Explorer that night with the promise of If you schedule your appointment and make it happen this SUV is yours And as far as I was concerned that was all I needed to hearThe license took a good four attempts Parallel parking was not right up my alley and every time I would exit the driving center with that smug look of sadness written across my face my father would pat me on the back and say Next time And he was right after that fourth time and only a few short months I had received my license and I exited the center that day smiling as I held up my temporary card flashing it to both of my parents them excitedly smiling and nodding at one another I drove them out for pizza right afterWe lived in a fairly disgusting country area even though my parents were welloff and lived on their own secluded road in a huge stone house that all my friends seemed to be quite envious of There was always your usual shit on the backroads to my house  dead animals trash things left behind from peoples midnight outdoor sex sessions including garments of clothing and used condoms I would shake my head and swerve out of the way for these things as carefully as possible protecting this SUV was a very important ordeal to me One day as I was driving into town from our backroad I came up around the corner and had no time to think as my eyes met with a cardboard box fairly large maybe even large enough to hold a large screen television In the blink of a second my car has collided with it and it took a few seconds for it to become apparent to me that I had hit HARD and whatever was inside it was now damaged all to hell My tires had shredded the box to pieces as I had seen it fly up in front of me as it got pulled along with the car I hadnt seen what was insideI was cursing up a storm inside my car as I pulled off to the side There were no houses around here and I felt uncomfortable with doing so because it was getting closer to night and I really didnt want to be back on a nearabandoned road checking out some stupid persons box contents and be picked up by some creep who would want to do whoknowswhat with meI turned off the car and slowly opened my door not looking into my mirror or anything before getting out I slammed my door and trudged back to the start of the bend where the box had been It was in that moments time that a part of me wished that I had  Either not gone back there or  Not even left the house that night to go pick up some measly groceries for my parents Nothing could compare to the feeling that struck my heart as I noticed the two small bodies ripped nearly to shreds in front of me two little children who had been alive and well probably playing inside of a box before I came along and completely fucked their day all to pieces They wore looks of total sadness on their faces from what I could make out a brother and a sister perhaps both with black hair and rags for clothing Underprivileged DeadThe trauma and torment I endured within the next few weeks was the worst experience of my life I worked alongside the police as these children went unidentified and nobody could piece together where these two children had come from I got little to no sleep at night wondering what their lives had been like what their parents were thinking wondering about where their two kids were Did they even care Had their parents been homeless and just left them alongside the road in a box and they had decided it would be worth a try to make a game out of it and push the box to the middle of the road I mean why One night I was getting a good nights sleep for once after this traumatizing incident and I heard a knock at the front door to our house I swept out into the hallway and noticed that my parents door at the far end of the hallway was still closed and that they hadnt heard the rapping which was usual because they were horribly heavy sleepers I ran downstairs as lightly and quickly as possible and opened the front door but to my surprise nobody was standing there as I had thought would be I assessed the situation and realized that it was stupid of me to answer the door in the middle of nowhere late at night but then I saw the box It was sitting off to the side of the porch and I leaned out of the door plucked it up and brought it into the house There was nothing on it It was light It was around the same size as the one that contained the childrenI took a kitchen knife and seized open the tape that held the box closed and again to my surprise noticed that the only thing inside it was a small piece of paper with writing on the insideMy heart skipped a beat I dropped it to the floor and screamed in sheer terror and panic until my parents were both at my side hugging me and comforting me Unwanted child Make a

theworldisgrim,42,78,1qsnvw,252,I was jolted awake about an hour ago confused and disoriented my heart was pounding and my sheets were soaked in sweat Some slavering malevolent horror was in the trailer with me creeping up on me while I slept with poised claws and razor teeth The absolute certainty of this coated my mouth with the metallic taste of fear sour and dry and thick I grabbed the baseball bat that lays beneath my cot and tiptoed around the cramped darkness of my trailer straining to hear over the keening of the wind outsideAnd the pounding of my own heart Of course there was nothing here except my goldfish and yours truly the sweaty guy in his underwear It was the gusting wind that startled me awake  it happens quite often in the late autumn and early winter The wind rips through the scrub of skeletal trees that surround the trailer park and charges with a lions roar into our lonely huddle of frail little shelters It gibbers and shrieks and pounds on our walls with fists of dead leaves and frozen gritSatisfied that I wasnt about to become chow for some unspeakable creature I laid back down on my squeaky saggy old cot and tried to get back to sleep  but I couldnt Instead I found myself thinking about that night in the penitentiary the night of the lockdown I kept thinking about Mikey and Big Rob and the rest of them all of us huddled in a cell with the lights off and the frigid northwest winds howling at the walls After a while I gave up trying to sleep Instead I sat down in front of the computer and I started typing Im no story teller not like Mikey or Hutch but Ill try my bestWhen I first came to the Pen the thing that struck me the most about the place was just how much the cons talk On the occasions when Id served time in the County jail there had been talk sure but it was terse and impersonal   when theyre only serving a few months I guess a lot of people feel the situation is too temporary to bother forging any ties with their fellow inmates Youd play cards with your cellie or youd sit in the day room and watch TV in relative silence the only time that there would ever be any noise or action was when a scrap broke out over a card game Fights were the only thing that passed as excitement in County every other moment of the day was comprised of dull boring nothing Going in you just hoped that the food wouldnt be too bad and that your cellie wouldnt end up being a gang member or a methhead biker waiting out a long patch of dead time People in other words who might beat the shit out of you as a way to pass the hoursThe Pen though  its an incredibly noisy smelly vocal environment I remember very clearly the moment when my little group of new arrivals were let out of the Fish Tank and into our new home a pod housing two hundred inmates I was overwhelmed by the deafening din of voices and activity when the hacks marched us bundles in hand out onto the range Of course there were the obligatory catcalls and wolfwhistling but most of the cons seemed completely oblivious to us  they were too busy living the ebb and flow of penitentiary lifeOf course this was not actually true Cons see everything And I mean everything But they talk even moreMy first cellie wanted both my bale and my ass in that order That wasnt happening I hammered him in the mouth and it was on  the fight spilled out of the cell and into the corridor of the pod He was a big tough old bull but I had him leaking and his confidence was shaken Before the COs got to us Id managed to get the nasty old fuck facedown onto the floor and was whamming away on the back of his head and neck like a jackhammer Then the hacks got there and one of them laid a size twelve boot upside my skull The kick knocked my brain clear over the Moon the world immediately went out of focus and it stayed that way for almost twelve hours I spent the next three weeks in the Hole for fighting and when I got out I was placed in a different pod Word had got around that this fish wasnt exactly new and that I had a mean rightcross no one bothered to try and roll up on me in the yard that day and when I sat down at chow with my new cellie and some of his boys no one objected I had been checked and Id passed the test I wasnt a punk or a sissy I could sit with the menYeah its a different world the Pen is and it has wildly different rules You couldnt fully understand unless youve been thereIt wasnt long before I settled into a routine up for headcount and chow off to work in the laundry chow nap work out chow  and then the struggle to fill the dead hours between supper and lightsout There wasnt much to do The cons played cards betting with tobacco bales purchased from the commissary and individual handrolled smokes Some watched TV and others watched the wall Some watched each other tensions were always high between the rival gangs Dope fiends spiked what they liked to spike in the bathrooms Daddies took their sugarboys into rented cells or the showers and they got some asspussy while a homeboy held watch for the copsAnd there was of course a lot of talk Talk of family back home women had and lost of misdeeds proudly done There were enough stories flying around that place to fill a library My cellie was an old con named Mikey He had originally been sentenced to fifteen years for seconddegree murder during a robbery  but he had gotten into so much trouble since landing in the Pen that hed managed to acquire an additional ten years on top of that Mikey was doing all day and hed made peace with that fact  a good cat all in all a straight shooter who didnt fuck with the spike The thing was hed kill just about anyone if he got it into his head that he wanted to In earlier years Mikey had been a triggerman for the bikers Hed been convicted for the murders of six people and was a suspect in sixteen others  and I can well imagine that a number of them had probably been friends of his at one point or another In certain circles a good friend can become your murderer in the blink of an eyeThats the kind of people you do time with in Maximum securityMikey and his crew liked nothing better than to spend a Sunday evening crowded up in someones cell drinking Pruno and shooting the shit Personally I didnt care much for the hooch  it tasted like rotting garbage with a heavy fruit bouquet  but the stories were welcome When Mikey or one of his homeboys were on a roll we could all forget ourselves and be somewhere else for a little while As far as cons go they were good fuckin guys they were and these bull sessions were the glue that held Mikeys crew together I remember watching and listening for hours on end spellbound as Mikey or Big Rob or whoever wove a tapestry of words in the thin air around us Theyd make us roar with laughter clench in rage and even silently choke up in sadness Some of those guys could play a mans emotions like a violin with their storytelling They were masters of the formMost of the time the stories were pretty coarse which was to be expected  look where they were coming from and occasionally they were downright fucking horrifying But  theres one in particular that I can remember word for word quite literally I can actually close my eyes and see Mikey and Rob Hutch and the rest of them sitting there in the cell that night all of us bathed in the sickly red glow of the emergency lights and transfixed by what we were being told This particular story likes to pop up in my head in the small dead hours of the night when the harsh winds of drab old November lash and rock my rusty little trailer hard enough to wake me up as they did tonightCoincidentally it was on a November night just like this when I heard this story I was about a year into my fouryear sentence for armed robbery and this was my second winter in the Pen I recall that the goddamned wind was cutting through the walls really badly that night and the drafts were freezing our toes solid There had been a murder that day and the whole Pen was on lockdown all five pods and the Protective Custody unit too Big Rob Hutch was a man who had his ear to the ground and he had known that the lockdown was imminent we had just enough time to make preparations for what was coming Happy for a chance to hang out and get fucked up seven of us quickly herded into his cell with our bedding snacks from the commissary and as much gear as we could get our hands on I remember that we were all wrapped up in our thin scratchy blankets like convict burritos The blankets were grey and made of rough wool upon checking into the Razor Wire Inn you were issued one and one only In the winter blankets were at a premium Men would fight for them sometimes even kill for themMikey and Big Rob were both sitting on the lower bunk Coltrane and his kid Remmie had the top one I was freezing my ass on the floor along with Nick and Richie The young pups had to sit on the floor thats just the way it was The old cons got to snuggle their asses into the relative comfort of the thin mattresses that covered the squeaky springslats and in Coltranes case the old cons bitch as well We werent complaining out loud about it though  we knew better than to do thatBig Rob was a trustee and one of his duties was to mop the floors in the prison morgue He was telling us what had happened when the coroner performed his autopsy on Stutters Stutters was a junkie who had been suspected of ratting out various other cons to the cops in exchange for smack He was the reason why the entire Pen was on lockdown He had been discovered in his bunk after lunch dead as dayold dogshit and full of ragged holes The shiv was found in a toilet in the shower room It had been made from plastic bags heated to melting with a Bic then compressed to form a sturdy sharp little weapon So Im mopping up by where they keep the gurneys and down the hall the doors open a bit so I can see the Doc leaning over Stutters on the table Hes humming and singing to himself like usual and Im smiling at how shitty his voice is when all of a sudden the Doc says Holy shit wouldja lookit that and then he starts gagging and retching Then  get this  then he actually screams  for real he fuckin screamed  and he yells Jesus Christ its all over my fucking arm He runs outta the room and down the other hall and Im like What the fuck is that all about I heard him yelling for his assistants or whatever they are the younger ones They all come runnin back and I heard one of the assistants say Oh fuck you gotta be kiddin me Then the smell hits me from all the way down that longass hallway and its putrid boys  it smelled like a combination of rotting flesh and an old shithouse in August I had to grab my nose and run the fuck outta there Worst thing I ever smelledNick asked What was it from and shifted uncomfortably where he sat beside the toilet  He was a good bit younger than me hed just celebrated his twentieth birthday a few months ago It was his first time in and hed drawn the fuckin short straw  fifteen years eight before hed be considered for parole His uncle fortunately for Nick was also serving time in the same facility he was an upperechelon Hells Angel who ruled both B Pod and C Pod with an iron fist As a result Nick was getting the easiest ride a firsttimer to the Pen ever had Coltrane and Mikey had personally welcomed the kid into the crew as per the old mans orders He was freshfaced and physically soft I occasionally wonder if hed ever really known just how bad it could have been for him in thereApparently Big Rob said lowering his voice to a husky stage whisper Stutters was getting checked for pokes and track marks pretty regular because he got busted so much for possession So he started shooting in his ass But not like in his asscheek ya dig I mean right into the wall of his rectum He was shooting it right inside his fuckin asshole man Can you imagine that Pretty soon he developed a fuckin horrible abscess Because of all the fecal bacteria and crap that was living up his old dirt road the abscess got infected real bad After a while it skinned over with a crust of white blood cells and gross stuff and ballooned out into a giant pusbubble That bubble got so big that it eventually closed up the poor fuckers ass and I mean right fuckin shut He was apparently going around like that for weeks man for real Weeks It musta hurt like a bitch  so the Doc saw something kinda bubbling out of the dead fuckers asshole and he prodded at it with his scalpel and pop Out gushes a metric fuckload of bloody green pus full of dead bacteria and stinkin like the Devils ballsackAw fuck thats just dirty man Mikey groaned and mimed throwing up all over Hutch We were all wrinkling our noses in disgust and shaking our heads Dirty was not nearly adequate for this disgusting imageThat aint it though my friend  that aint it The worst part he continued was the fact that Stutters had been bunged up with this fuckin pus balloon for a few weeks or so yknow It stopped up his shitcanal When the Doc popped that thing with his scalpel  aw hell It was a literal shitstorm It spurted out of his ass like a highpressure hoseWe regarded that image for a moment or two in stunned silence I felt a bit illSo  fucking  DIRTY Mikey roared and despite what Id just heard I had to laugh Coltrane and the others joined in Remmie just looked disgusted He was filing his nails Remmie was no longer just another cellblock punk a weaker man that traded what he had to trade in order to get by in world dominated by strength in recent months hed gone and went fullblown sissy After a year or so of enduring the subservient female role at the receiving end of Coltranes hogleg Coltrane was in fact the one whod turned Remmie out in the first place hed finally stopped playing the part of a woman and was now living it  It was apparent that hed started taking illicit female hormones his arm hair had thinned out and it seemed that he had recently grown the barest suggestion of breasts beneath his orange jumpsuit By the time I got out of the Pen Remmie had changed his name to Rhianne and was the wife of get ready for this none other than Nicks uncle the unofficial King of Pods B and C Rhianne was known for causing savage fights amongst inmates who were vying for his attention That incidentally was exactly how Coltrane ending up earning an unexpected early parole  a backdoorparole as they call it Because you dont leave through the front gate when youre deadSo the Doc got shit on by a corpse said Richie in a slow and dreamy tone It was puscovered shit Thats fucked up man Hey  do ya think that happens a lot to him Or like was that the first time Richie had snorted some hydromorphone earlier and now he was somewhere in the clouds floating around with a stoned grin on his face Richie thats just fuckin  Mikey trailed off Actually its a good question Want some hootch boysI was just opening my mouth to say Fuck no and then there was a POP and everything was dark The cons began yelling and hooting all across the pod both tiers on both sides Big Rob yelled Shut up ya fuckin idiots Its just a blackout fer Christs sake pipe the fuck down and for a wonder some of them actually did The thing was Big Rob Hutch was  well just that Big He was as big as a buffalo I was surprised that the lower bunk could support both Rob and Mikey who was not exactly small himselfThe emergency lights snapped on soft and red and eerie It made the common area of C Pod look like a scene from an apocalyptic horror movie We could see the guard standing there in the guard hut through the bulletproof glass waiting to see how the cons were going to react to the power going out during a lockdown now not only were we being sequestered in our cramped little cells for an indeterminable length of time we had also been rendered unable to properly read a book a number of the cons could actually read and did or see your hand while playing cards or even listen to the radio for Christs sake The hack was a dark figure swathed in dim red his body language alert and poised for action Im pretty sure it was Robson who was the boss on hut duty that night Robson was a deadeyed squarejawed oaf without an ounce of empathy in his whole body  and he just so happened to have a twelvegauge shotgun on hand with a modified choke I fervently hoped that no one would take it into their heads to start some serious shit  because if they did there was a good chance wed all regret itThere was a lot of hollering and doorkicking around the pod but it soon became apparent that the ruckus was just for show and was halfhearted at best We all silently thanked Whoever might be listening that the Emergency Reaction Team wasnt going to be called in The ERT didnt fuck around Kevlarsuited and anonymous in their visored helmets theyd march into the pod and indiscriminately barge into cell after cell busting heads and whapping out teeth with their batons Hell you might even get shot  and the ERT shoot to killRichie broke the silence Man I was gettin real worried there for a minute If the fuckin Goon Squad busted in here and found all our shit wed be dicked Richie was doing six years for selling pills the sentence for a secondtime loser Oxycontin and Hydrocodone were his chemicals of choice Faced with the boredom of prison life hed started using the products he sold He was a straightup junkie by Christmas of that year Mikey didnt care about anyone using junk  would even have a little snort here and there himself  but he didnt like addicts not one bit He cut Richie out of the crew Addled by junk plagued by debt weak and alone Richie ended up bunking with some fellas from the top tier across from us The black tier In a maximumsecurity penitentiary this has unpleasant connotations Business might occur between the color lines but thats generally where any benign fraternization ends You might not be racist when youre on the outside but when youre inside you dont have much choice To be blunt its like this if youre white you stick with the whites The black and Hispanic cons dont want to be your buddy and vice versa There are for a variety of reasons a large number of hostilities between the color lines Theyll stomp the shit out of you  or worse When we got word that Richie had been seen walking his face cast down up the stairs to that second tier  well we knew Richie had heavy debts Forced to either trade himself or die Richie had chosen lifeJesus I felt horrible for how it ended for Richie I still do His desperate last bid to cling to his wretched mortal existence only prolonged the inevitable he was dead within a month One day after enduring his morning gangrape something must have finally snapped in Richies head His will to live crumbled and fell Richie stayed behind while his tormentors went down for morning chow and he stuck a spike in his arm for the last time High as a kite Richie then hung himself from the corner post of the top bunk He did it with a rope made of knottedtogether socksIm rambling now arent I Sorry I do that sometimes  youll just have to bear with me I guess Im not a good at this not like Mikey or Hutch Im just a lonely guy who cant sleep some nights when the shrieking wind could be mistaken for the wailing of lost souls shaking and rattling the windows in their frames Even though I was released from the Pen fifteen years ago I cant shake the feeling that Im somehow still inside But I suppose that were all imprisoned by something on some level arent we On nights like tonight my prison is this rusty trailer Its my pathetic menial job My divorce My raw redeyed fury unfocused and impotent Its sorrow and regret On nights like tonight my prison is the past and my inability to leave it behindSo there we all were sitting there in the weird red gloom and listening to all the yelling and bullshit slowly die down Richie abruptly went on the nod Nick balanced a shoe on his head We all chuckled Coltrane started talking about the hockey game that was about to start then abruptly shut up We were on lockdown with no electricity  there would be no hockey game that night not for us We passed a jay around and when that one was roached we passed anotherFinally Mikey spoke up and broke the silence So  whos up for some Twilight Zone shit tonight I gotta good one for ya You remember the last time the power went out HutchHutch shot him a dark look then did something very unusual for a hardened con  he shuddered You wanna tell the boys that story I dunno man Why not Fuck the lights are out and the winds ahowlin out there Perfect time for it Okay fuck it Lets do it Big Rob cleared his throat and said Okay boys its time for a scary story Crowd around the fuckin campfire and grabba cup of this fine wineIts more of a brandy I think Hutch Mikey grinned and offered me some Reluctantly I accepted a Styrofoam cup of the murky eyewatering stuff and steeled myself to swallow it I was feeling a bit happier now  Ive always been a fan of spooky storiesHis voice stern Mikey growled Okay first things first  this shit is one hundred percent true Got it Were not bullshitting about any of this For real So dont tell us that were full of shit or you can go have a fuckin sleepover with that asshole over in the Hack ShackGot it Richie grunted then flopped over onto the floor He was out of itThis all went down a long time ago before any of you were here At least twelve years Id say MikeyYeah fer sure At least that long Back when these little punks were still givin out handjobs in Juvie haIt was a while back anyways Me and Mikey here were both running with different crews back then into different shit but we knew each other I guess I woulda been about your age he said pointing down at me So one day The Fish Tank had just been emptied out into the pod and theres a new fish with em that immediately starts turning heads I was playing checkers on the tier upstairs when they all came walking through the gate looking like a bunch of lost little lambs down there on the range They came toddling in behind a couple of the hacks and at the end of the line is the prettiest little sweetboy this whole penitentiary has ever seen I dont play no grabass like Coltrane up there but this kid  he was I dunno  almost like an angel or something He was too perfect like a picture out of a magazine yknow Slender and fairhaired teenybopper heartthrob material Yeah the kid was pretty all right and he looked like hed be easy to punkBig Rob took a moment to pause and force back a swig of the awful cloying Pruno a noxious blend of fermented fruit sugar packets and yeast As he grimly swallowed it down Mikey jumped in and continued the story The new fish immediately drove the whole pod completely fuckin nuts The wolves were losing their minds for real The guards were looking worried  a pretty kid like that can cause a lot of hard feelings between the bulls Hard feelings usually turn into murder So they released the other fishies to the care of the boss at the guard hut then hustled the prettyboy off to Protective Custody postfuckinhaste They kept him there for a few days but the wolves didnt forget about him not for a moment All the time theyre asking about the kid to the trustees who had access to PC Theyre asking if the kids lonely if he wants a candy bar or a fuckbook or a baggie of fuckin horse whatever the kid might possibly want  theyre handing the trustees love notes to give to him money weed all kinds of shit Finally a con named Holbrook called in some heavy favours and the hacks moved the kid back into the pod More to the point into Holbrooks cell I remember watching as the hacks walked the young fella across the pod and up the stairs to his new home The kid had no expression in those wide blue eyes None at all Just  blankHolbrook was a big greasy son of a bitch real nasty You could smell him from twenty feet away Complete psycho that guy Man Ill tell ya  watching as Brookie grinned and waited at the door of his cell for his new little bunkbuddy to arrive hell  it made me feel sorry for the kid He was planning do bad things to the boy you could see it in that grin He was gonna hurt im No expression at all though on that kids face I remember thinking that the fishie was either brave as fuck or just too stupid to understand what was in store for himRob tossed back the rest of the hootch in his Dixie cup and tried not to gag Gah this shit is just fuckin awful Who brewed this His voice sounded dry and burntOur fine neighbours just down the hall thats who Mikey chuckled They managed to hide it in the toilet tank long enough to get er finished and holy Jesus aint it nastyFuck I think Im going blind already Hutch held out his cup and Mikey poured him another glurt out of the plastic bag taking care to make sure that the sock he was using as a filter didnt slip out and spill rotting fruit cocktail all over the bunk I tried a sip of mine and almost retched They all had a good hardeehar at this  except for Richie I guess Richie was still laying on the floor his eyelids fluttering and twitchingIt broke more than a few hearts to see Holbrook get his dirty hooks into the kid first He would wreck the kids asshole and destroy his soul that was the general consensus Come morning theyd be rolling the kid out to the infirmary and afterward probably stick him back into PC for a twentyfourhour suicide watch Even if he did come back to the pod again no one would want the kid not after the permanent damage that Brookie was liable to do to himSee how lucky you are Coltrane said to Remmie and the little Frenchman smiled down at his nails in response Then kept filing them delicately with all of his concentration Every now and then I wonder if Remmie was already planning the flirtations and indiscretions that would inevitably result in Coltranes murder his skull smashed in with a twentypound dumbbell in the weight pit Coltrane the bull queer who had taken Remmies manhood and eventually transformed him into something that hed probably never wanted to be  thinking about it now Im pretty sure he was And I cant blame him for itRob told us I heard screaming that night It was muffled but I could still hear it So did my cellie  back then it was old Johnny Franzini I whispered up at him Hey you hear that shit man Fuck thats awful and he answered real matteroffact That boy he hadda know it was coming hey Hes too pretty like a girl to be here in this place He should have never come here As if the guy had fuckin volunteered or something I just shook my head and told Johnny to go to sleep I felt so bad for the kid yknow I think that was one of the worst nights I ever had in hereI heard it too Mikey interjected  I think we all did including the bosses on duty that night But no one went to check on him cuz money makes the fuckin rules around here not the Warden or the government Its money I dont doubt that the sick fuck offered big coin for the kid And some cold son of a bitch sold him without a second thoughtHutch nodded sourly Moneys a whore Thats okay though cuz theres a thing called karma too When morning came lo and behold Brookie aint standing outside his cell waitin to be accounted for Neither is the kid A whisper popped up real quick and spread down the lines like the breeze and it said Holbrook went apeshit on the kid last night n killed him Hes waiting in his cage for the ERT to come in and bust his head The boss doing the head count paused at Holbrooks cell and every con craned his head to see what was gonna happen next all of us in unison I seen the hack pull out his radio with one hand and his club with the other He started talkin real fast into his radio at the same time hes slowly walking towards the door of Brookies cell with his club poised to bash a skull in like hes trying to ward someone off He started yelling for the other hacks to get the fuck over there pronto They all came thundering past with their keys jangling and their boots clomping and then we all got ordered to step back into our cells with empty bellies I heard em down there at Brookies cell yelling into their radios and stomping around and then I heard someone barf I heard the puke splatter on the tilesWe had to stay in our cells for a few hours and there was a lot of bitching I remember being totally completely pissed at Holbrook me and Johnny Eff Wed assumed that hed gone psycho on the new fish and cut the kids throat while he was fuckin him or some shit like that But then some of the emergency response guys came past wheeling a gurney and when they wheeled it past us again you coulda knocked me flat with a peashooter  because it was Holbrook strapped in there not the kid I only saw him for a few seconds but I remember that his face was fucked It was mostly gone Stripped right down to bloody sinew and bones No skin or muscles left It was fucking gruesome I kinda gasped out loud and even closemouthed crookednosed old Johnny Franzini had to look twice and say Eh what the fuck They only way I knew it was him was the hair  a big greasy mop of it like a caveman The sheet covering the body was soaked right through with his blood I think that the rest of him had matched his faceNick whistled and said Fuck man thats hardcore then sparked another joint We floordwellers had almost forgotten about the discomfort of our numb behinds and tingling feet wed forgotten the lockdown and the power outage and even poor Stutters whod not only died a violent death but had also died with his ass blocked up by a cystic sore the size of a mans fist Mikey and Hutch were telling a story and we were living it you know what I mean We were right thereMikey said Mustve been five minutes later the cops are rolling this crazylooking thing down the block and Im like What the fuck is that to my cellie but he dont know either Before too long they roll it past again and Im like Ohhhhh shit lookit this You ever see Silence of the Lambs The dollycart thing that they strap Anthony Hopkins into when theyre moving him Yeah thats exactly what it was  and theyve got the kid strapped into it Bitemask and everything And the kid is just soaked in blood man It was dripping off his clothes and I could hear it pattering on the floor behind him It left a trail on the floorThey let us out for breakfast about a halfhour after that but by then it was almost lunch and we got served a fuckedup mix of warm lunch and cold breakfast There was more talking going on than eating though  and everyone was saying the same thing we were all saying What the fuck did the kid do to im Most people thought that he mustve gotten hold of Brookies shiv somehow then sliced the fuckers shit right off Whittled him right down to the bone But  Brookie was a really big dude and the guy was a crazy motherfucker How a skinny little bitch like that could have overpowered a bad dude like Holbrook so easy  well we didnt knowThe joint travelled across the floorfolk and was then handed up to the bunks Mikey hit it hard and made that funny choking noise that older guys sometimes do when holding in a big toke nasal and strangled He gave Nicky the thumbsup and blasted out smoke like a grizzled old dragonShits pretty good Nicky Good score  gotta get some more of that So yeah the kid  he got rolled off to the Hole on his fuckin Hannibal Lecter dolly and they had him on a supertight lockdown nobody even catches a glimpse of im They had the kid on a twentyfour hour watch and the whole works A couple trustees tried asking the hacks what happened with him and Brookie and they got told to mind their own business and mop the fucking floorsThe kid was in the Hole for a week then two then a month  all the while aint no one heard a peep about him getting charged with murder There was a rumor going around that the coroner said in his report that Holbrook had died from a heart attack Maybe his heart seizing up was the thing that actually killed him sure  but there wasnt any mention of the way hed been carved up like a Sunday turkey None at all Mikey poured himself another round of refreshment and the stink of the open bag made my eyes waterHutch smiled a little an action with no real humor behind it Well tongues were wagging as they tend to do and pretty soon people were saying that maybe the kid wasnt natural That he did Brookie in with his teeth  that he ate the fucker alive like some sort of monster Guys were even saying that the priest paid him a visit in the Hole and ended up leaving with tears in his eyes  actually fuckin crying and shit Wouldnt say what happened just that he didnt wanna talk to the kid never again He quit

courtneymadison,32,77,1r2j24,234,Im just a normal  year old that lives at home and goes to class Ive never really had any unexplainable experiences but I had one today I woke up and started getting ready for class I thought I saw my mom in her room so I started having a conversation with her while I was getting dressed She was responding as per usual so I thought nothing of it Quick sidenote Nothing felt wrong with the way she was responding Whatever this was it sounded just like my mom After a while she stopped replying to me Being curious I decided to go see why I went to her room and it was empty looked in the kitchen and it was empty She would of had to have walked past me to leave the house so I knew she hadnt left I decided to call her to figure out where shed gone and when I looked I had a text from her that was received at  am saying Got called in to open Be home at  so you can take the car I called her to see if she was messing with me but she was actually at work I dont know who Ive been talking to all morning and Im really freaked out Can anyone help me EDIT I asked my little sister if when she had had anything strange happen when she was getting ready for school and she looked at me like Id lost it For all the people that asked about the conversation the previous night my mom had found a ouija board unused and still in the packaging in my closet and she had thrown it away She was talking about how ouija boards are dangerous and I shouldnt mess with them She was very persistent that I dont get involved with things like that but shes always saying stuff like that so it wasnt a very out of the ordinary topic for us The conversation was about an hour long and I was fully awake when it took place We checked the house and nothing was missing or out of place We live in an apartment and all the windows were locked and the screens were intact so someone couldnt have gotten in or out through them My mom is really into the weirdparanormal stuff so I told her everything and she has no idea what it could be Also I feel I should mention weve lived here for  years and nothing like this has happened beforeBONUS EDIT My mom went to leave for work and there were footprints leading out of our house in the snow,Who was I talking to,311
PeckerPoker,41,68,1r58lt,205,Ok so this isnt a long story filled with twists and turns but it just happened about  minutes ago and Im a little uneasy nowFor reference my husband son and I moved into an apartment in the tophalf of a centuryhome a couple months ago The doors all have old knobs and the doors dont always close easily  you really have to pull sometimesAnyway I just put my son almost two years old down for his nap I told him nightnight as I closed the door As I always do I pulled the door shut firmly and made sure I heard it click I swear I heard it clickI walked away and into the bathroom to go pee As I sat down on the toilet I heard my son start crying which isnt that unusual but normally he doesnt do more than fuss for a minute before falling asleep I even kept him up a little longer than usual to make sure he fell asleep He seemed pretty ready to go down thumb in mouth under his blanky he rolled over onto his side and put his blanket over his head like he does when hes really tiredI finish peeing and walk out of the bathroom and his door is wide open I see him standing in his crib crying I go in feeling uneasy and lay him back down and cover him back up He lays there and just keeps crying as I check his closet like there would be someone hiding in there or something Kind of dumb I know but I couldnt just shut him back in his room alone without checkingEven if I was wrong and the door didnt click shut which is possible it shouldnt have been wide open When I havent completely shut it in the past it will open up about  or  inches Its never opened up all the way like thatI checked the rest of the rooms and closets feeling nervous but kind of stupid Of course there wasnt anything unusual anywhere Still Im kind of on edge I wish my husband was home,Nap Time,273
PlotThickener,12,41,1r0aj7,185,This is a story Ive never discussed with anyone aside from those people involved But I figured it belonged here For the longest time I chalked it all up to pranks my imagination whateverbut hopefully youll all be able to make more sense of itI was driving in a rural part of Wisconsin which if you live there you know is much of the state Lots of flat farms country highways named for letters empty back roads etc It was  pm or laterI dont really remember when but it had been dark for some time and it was the middle of summer so it must have been late It was the time of night cars stop moving on the rural roads so its just you and your headlights and the world around you starts getting really creepy Plus youre always watching out for deer on these roads which can just pop out at any moment so youre kind of on yellow alertIm driving north on a long section of road Theres a big flat farm on my left mostly emptylooking probably planted with soybeans which dont grow high Im concentrating on the edges of where my headlights meet the darkness to watch for deer and I think I see one walking out of the farm toward the roadI tap the brakes not sure of what I see but soon I realize its not a deer Its upright something walking on two feet and its HUGE And its all black Its still moving but its not moving with any kind of walking movement its just sort of gliding across my visionAt this point Ive stopped the car completelyin the middle of the road just watching One instinct was to hit the gas and drive past because I could have easily passed it but Im not sure if it was about to jump out Im not really afraid yet Im just frozen you know those moments where you cant figure out what something is so there are no real emotions That was meThen it comes into clearer view in the headlights Well thats not very accurate to say because it didnt seem to reflect any light It was like the light moved through it if that makes sense But I could see the outline of the figure against everything else that was litthe road the trees etcThe figure looked like Death I mean EVERYTHING you imagine when you read the storiesthe scythe the big black hood It was exactly what you think when you think Grim Reaper only unnaturally tall and thin It was so tall and thin it looked a lot like this guys halloween costume when he wears it after about five minutes or so httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvIPoCkNKDGk Especially how tall it was I mean ten feet minimum I think most people think of the Grim Reaper as being as large as a big person but it wasnt really like thatBut that was my first thought A halloween costume It was still summer though so not Halloween But I rationalize maybe its just a prank But then I pay attention to how it moves to the middle of the roadIt just GLIDES I see no feet no hint that this thing is doing anything but flying off the ground but you cant see feet or anything because the robe hits the groundThen in the middle of the road maybe ten feet in front of me it stopsThe hooded face turnstoward meIts so slow and smooth and just plain UNNATURAL that I completely freeze in the car My hands are locked on the wheel The face is turning to me slowly perfectly smoothly and Im scared out of my mind Even if this is some prank this thing clearly means business Maybe its some psychopath scaring people and not just an innocent prankIt sees me I dont see eyes no glowing eyes or anything just black but somehow I KNOW that its looking at me making eye contact I got goosebumps even on my scalp I remember my hair feeling like it stood straight up I feel like I was literally looking death in the face My stomach sank like someone just told me a loved one had died I mean you do not want to feel this feeling Ever The thing stood perfectly still too as if considering me or weighing me I felt really judged if that makes sense Like I was being consideredThen he glides off so fast I dont even see where he goes The roads are clear again and then I heard the engine running as if all of the worlds sound had suddenly been unmutedI drive back home still frozen still rationalizing what I saw A prank I figure It had to be a prank some overzealous Halloween lover setting up rumors of the Grim Reaper walking around the farms I tell my parents about it and theyre sure its a prank So sure that I eventually rationalize it away and the memory is filed away as creepy but nothing supernaturalAt about the same time I heard that a farmer who owned that soybean field had died that night But it took me a long time before I put two and two together when I realized that I saw something that looked like THE FREAKING GRIM REAPER on the same night that farmer died I remember when I first had the thought and my stomach sankIt was like the rationalization I had used to remember the story of the Grim Reaper was suddenly stripped away and I had to confront the fact that I saw something very very scaryBut what else can I do but live my lifeI went back to collegeevery time I came back home at night I took an alternate road just because I got the creeps so bad Had a good semester mostly As had some good times with friends I drive back mostly during day or evening time so I dont have to revisit those unpleasant memoriesThen my parents tell me that there are more Grim Reaper stories going around lately all pretty similar to mine When you live in a  small town it seems like there are a lot of funerals for old people that you know or at least heard of going on all the time At one funeral an old ladys granddaughter cried because she saw she said a big black figure over the casket My parents heard that story and thought of mine but they still just treated it as a jokeI would stay up a lot later than the people in my house parents  younger brother plus an uncle aunt and cousin who were spending Christmas with us and slept in a room upstairs on this little side road in a rural subdivision No streetlights out there just the lights that other people kept on their garages all nightOne night I went up to my room at about  am and of course the whole house is quiet and I go to my room and turn out the lights so I can go to bed I usually throw a glance out the window and you can see most of the side street because the neighbors kept their garage light on all nightThis time the whole scene looks a little different Theres a big shadow looming in the front yard and its blocking a lot of light Then I look closer and I realize its not a shadowits something black thats cutting THROUGH the lightThen I feel my heart practically stop as I realizeits back The Grim Reaper figureIt was just like before It cast no shadow The scythe was there and the tall hooded cloak with no faceThe breath went out of me when I realized that unlike before this reaper was not looking to the side when I discovered it It was looking right at our houseII stood there frozen again my finger still on the switch from just having hit the light It was a windy winter night and you could see some snow move but the creatures robe didnt move at all The same way its movements before had been unnatural now it loomed like a statue No flailing around in the wind Just standing tall scythe up high staring at our houseI looked away then looked back again Still there Looming I didnt get the sense that it was looking at me but I still couldnt stop staringThen I looked away and looked back again This time I KNEW it was staring Again it was hard to seethere was really nothing that I could tell that suggested it was looking at me No evil glowing eyes or anything I just felt it Felt the same feelings as beforea rotten pit in my stomach the feeling of being measured and weighed and consideredI heard a squeak and realized it was me My breath was being squeezed out of me simply from the fear Keep in mind I had no idea what this thing would do next What fly up to my window Suddenly disappear Rip off its hood and reveal a laughing skullAfter a moment its gaze departed from me again I felt good enough to go to my brothers room and wake him up to show him something in the window It took him forever to get out of bed but it may have only been a few minutes By the time he woke up rubbed his eyes and listened to the panic in my voice a few minutes had at least past I showed him the window but of course the figure was goneBut still that was it I knew The night I saw deathThat was the night my uncle died,The night I saw death,226
theworldisgrim,30,60,1qv2sj,181,The first chunk of this story can be found herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqsnvwthenewfishBig Rob grunted Billy Tremont and hauled hard on the joint decimating it to a smoldering ember between his thick fingersYeah him Billy Tremont He was a hack who worked the night shift and Ill tell ya something  he was just as dirty as they come Fucking guy wasnt just on the take  he was the take you know what Im sayin He was as much a gangster as any of the boys in here He controlled what came into the Pen and when and who got it and how much they got The dude squeezed out whatever competition he had from the other cops that were playing the game by any means available  he set em up to get fired payed to have em shitkicked by the bikers you name it He was a complete fuckin asshole but he was also real good at getting you what you wanted  for a priceWell its a fact that people love a mystery especially people who aint got fuckall to do with their time A few guys pooled together some cash and they came to Billy cuz if anyone could find the answers to their questions Billy Tremont could Billy laughed and tells em that hed love to take their money but he couldnt do what they were asking He says The weird little bastard didnt have no file as far as I can tell I dont know who he was why he came here or where he came from No one does and thats the goddamned truth The guys called him a bullshitter and Billy got serious on them He narrowed his eyes and said to em You guys dont think I tried to find out for myself already Hah Far as I can tell the kid just sorta popped up into the Fish Tank outta thin air Looks to me like everyone just kept processing him along cuz no one wanted to admit that they didnt know who the fucking kid was Call me a liar again and Ill beat the fear of God into you It was clear that they werent gonna get anywhere with Billy so the guysWhat kid Wait a minute man  which ones the kid Richies eyes looked like black bottomless pools I remember that He had already sunk deep into the mindless tar pit of addiction by then He was past the point of no return You could see it in his eyesShut up dummy Rob turned to Mikey and made a gesture that said please continueMikey gave Rich a cold stare then said So the guys gave up and said Fuck it then and thats that for a while Life goes on Then a day comes when Billy sidles up to one of the cons while hes standing in the morning chow line and tells him that hed found some information on the fish if anyone still cared to know Billy was lookin bad they said He looked tired and scaredThat night Billy comes to see the guy in his cell after lightsout He asks the guy for a smoke  and Billy had quit smoking years ago Billy says to him I dont want any money for this Keep your lousy fuckin money I dont wanna be the only one that cant sleep at night is all You pieces of shit got him into my head and I couldnt get him out Fuck you for doing that Fuck you people sideways The guy said that Billy Tremonts hands were shaking so fuckin bad that he could hardly get his smoke litBilly tells the con that curiosity had been eating him fuckin alive so he spent some time thinking on how to go about getting want he wanted  then he picked his mark Billy always had his ear to the ground yknow the type  he knew this and that who did what and where and why He knew stuff about people He knew that one of the suits in the office had a bad coke habit the kind of raging habit that most people cant afford for long He also knew that the suit and the Warden were both banging the same chick  the Wardens secretary Billy gave him an quarterounce of good rock cocaine and told him what he wanted He promised to shoot the guy an eightball on top of what he already gave him if the guy could deliver the goodsThe suit came back to him a few days later with the sniffles and a file folder that looked older than the Bible It was made outta some kind of rough crumbling old cardboard dry as dust The office stiff says that the Wardens secretary told him where to find it locked up in a cabinet in the Wardens office He said that hed put himself in all kinds of danger to get it and he wanted more than a ball for his troubles He wanted more than a quarter too Billy told him that he could either take the ball or Billy could let the Warden know that one of his minions wasnt just a cokehead and a thief but he was dipping his wick into the Wardens honeypot too Billy told the suit that the assfucking the Warden would give him wouldnt be anywhere near as bad as the one the wolves would deliver The guy shut his yap took his eightball and they parted waysSo in between drags of his smoke Billy tells the con that the first documents in the folder were pages taken from a court transcript some backwater courthouse sittin way out in cow country They were handwritten with an oldtime pen Billy said you know the kind that you had to dip in a fuckin ink well then pat dry against a blotter so the shit didnt smear Thats how old the thing was All the dates and the kids name were scribbled out Billy said but he figured that the first documents in the folder were from the late sNick snorted What That aint even possible Mikey shrugged It is what it is Nicky The transcript said that the kid had been charged with multiple murder practicing Satanic rites cannibalism arson mayhem  he was only sixteen years old when they tried him The prosecutor wanted to hang im for his crimes But the defense lawyer that the Crown had appointed some greasy little fucker  he argued it would be Godly to let the kid live out the rest of his days in jail seeing as how the kid was known to be an orphaned vagrant whod raised himself in the woods No moral guidance in the woods that was the argument The jury ended up getting all pious and they commuted the kids date with the rope to a life sentence They shipped im off to the clink and that very first night he killed his cellmate Killed him with his nails and teeth and then he ate the poor sonofabitchColtrane looked disturbed Holy fuck This is horror movie stuff Im sorry but you guys have gotta be shittin usMikey shrugged again Kinda wish I was But Im not Not according to Billy Tremont anyway Billy said that they stuck the kid in a loony bin for the criminally insane after he ate his cellie Put im in a strait jacket At some point the quacks realized that the usual treatments werent working for shit so they decided to give the kid a lobotomy He was out like a light from the ether and they were just getting ready to start when the kid suddenly breaks his arm restraints and sinks his teeth into the lead surgeons throat just like a goddamned wolf Ripped it right out Theres no way that he should have still been conscious let alone being able to snap those thick bands of leather  but he was and he didWay I heard it Hutch said after he killed the quack they put the kid back on the stand  and this time he got twelve votes for death They took him to the town square and marched the kid up to the gallows with all the townspeople screaming and throwing moldy bread and cow shit at him He was laughing at em The hangman put the rope around his neck and asks the kid if he has any last repentant words to share with the crowd The kid says loud and clear Theres nothing to repent in doing what you want Id fuck your mothers ass and fry up her heart if I wanted to and after I was done picking my teeth I wouldnt so much as fart her a blessing Why should I So the cops beat on the kid with their clubs a bit put the hood on the little fucker and the hangman pulls the lever  but the trap door wouldnt open He fiddled with it and tried three more times and each time the fucking door wouldnt swing open They didnt know what to do All the while the kid was laughing and cursing at them and praising the Devil just being a general pain in the ass People were screaming for him to swing It was getting ugly out there and fast So someone gets the bright idea that they could just put the kid up against a wall and shoot him and be done with itOnly that didnt work either Mikey added His words were becoming thick and slurred  it sounded like the hootch was starting to do the trick They put the kid up against a brick wall and five cops took aim Five cops pulled the trigger and five guns misfired They tried again and the same shit happened again By now the people watching were getting spooked The crowd of farmers and mill workers who came out to watch the kid hang  they all suddenly had places to go Everyone left and the Lords Prayer was on more than a few sets of lips as they went Id bet When everyone was gone the cops packed the kid back into the wagon because there was nothing else they could do They took him back to the courthouse and after some debating behind closed doors the judge had him sent to a different jail where he was locked up in an unused room in the basement Then they boarded up the door  and then for good measure they bricked the whole thing overRichie attempted to focus his eyes up at Mikey and asked Can they  can they really do that man Just put someone in a hole and brick the fucker overNick spoke up His voice was hoarse Maybe not these days but were talking back when a lot of people didnt even have a birth certificate Sure they coulda done that Whod ever know He lit another joint and passed itSo what man They just left the crazy little fucker there to die Richie appeared to be in the grip of a dubious species of moral outrageAnother good question Richie Maybe you havent killed every single brain cell yet after all Mikey slugged back some more of the noxious hootch and grimaced Billy Tremont said that there was only two other documents in the folder  an extremely fuckin old mug shot and a report to the Board of Corrections from a sanitation engineer It was written sometime in the Fifties Hed been down in the old basement of the very same prison where they walled up the kid he was down there checking out the shitpipes It didnt have fuckall to do with what he was looking for but the engineer mentioned in his report that hed found a brickedover doorway down there Curiosity got the better of him and he tore away the crumbling old brick with a crowbar Pried the boards off and popped the door open Do you know what he foundA skeleton Richie muttered He was struggling to keep his eyes from sliding shutNo Nothing Thats what he found When he forced the door open the room was emptyWe all took a few moments to digest this And then Bulldog ate his gun dont forget about that Hutch rumbled He handed the jay back over to Nicky Nick curled his lip in disgustWho slobbered on this shit he demanded Its wet as fuck Gross man fuckin grossNo one owned up to the deed Nick started to bitch about it some more and Hutch gave him that look the one that said shut up immediately or regret it Nick shut up Mikey snickeredThank you kindly Hutch  and Nicky Cmon kiddo just pinch off the wet part and stop yer bitching Anyhow that fuckin prick Bulldog  he was one of the leastloved hacks in the entire history of this joint A real genuine dyedinthewool piece of shit He was still a few years south of retiring when this all happened  late fifties Id say A huge fat redfaced motherfucker he was Meanern fuck His blood pressure was right off the scale all the time there wasnt nothing he liked better then to find an excuse to smash some unfortunate bastard upside the head Hed do it with a sock full of quarters that he kept hanging on his belt When you heard the jingling of the change you straightened up and stopped fucking around until it was gone If that nasty old fuck was in a mood well you steered clear and you kept yer big yapper shutSo they put this fuckin guy on watch in front of the kids cell doing the graveyard shift right He was all alone too no partner or nothin  I guess the other hacks didnt like the fat mouthy fuck either There he was night after night just him and this creepy fucking kid all night long Normally this wouldnt have been very good for the con being watched  being alone with a tired grumpy Bulldog and no witnesses It woulda been a long long season in Hell for most cons But the fish wasnt the usual whiteboy dummy we get in here  you know what I mean Like a kid who got mixed up with something stupid then wasnt rich enough to buy his way out of it Not this fish He was something else entirelyMikey paused to force down a big glurt of Pruno and Hutch jumped in Well Ol Bulldog only lasted for about a month before he goes to his shift supervisor and requests that he be taken off the watch The head screws office door was open a bit and some dude named  uh Tags or Rags some shit like that I cant remember  anyway he supposedly overheard most of the conversation while he was waiting to see the WardenWhy was he waitin to see the Warden Richie mumbled As per usual with Richie he wasnt really getting the main focus of the story Fuckin ratting on someone right Fuckin goof I hate those fuckers Rats need to get hurt bro Fuckin rats need to get Jesus Richie go on the nod or something wouldja Youre a waste of skin Hutch looked dangerously displeased Richie grinned a big goony grin and whispered Fuckin rats thoughHutch frowned at him thunderously then continued So Tags or Rags or whatever hears Bulldog say that he wants off the watch His boss asks him why and he wont say Just that hes tired and he doesnt like watching the kid Boss asks if he wants a partner and Bulldog says nope he just wants off the goddamned watch and thats that So the head screw huffs and puffs and blows him off He gives Bulldog some shitty speech about not wanting to abruptly change everyones schedule for one fucking guy and how if he did do that little Johnny wouldnt see his Daddy up in the fucking stands at his next ball game and it would fuck him up for life You know  guilting the fat prick and all that sorta thing Then he tells Bulldog no and sends him on his way So Bulldog went home and he drank most of a bottle of whisky  then stuck his service pistol in his mouth and pulled the triggerNicky roached the allegedly slobberedon joint and blew out a tremendous lungful of smoke There was no way that the smell of the dank wasnt rolling through the whole goddamned pod by then but none of us were concerned about it If everyone was behaving themselves the COs would leave us to our vices in peace The situation was volatile enough alreadyMikey piped up and said Its a sad fuckin thing you know  when one of us string ourselves up or gets his hands on a razor blade no one gives a fuck The hacks laugh atcha because your bowels let go and you fuckin shit yourself when you died and thats your obituary Life goes on and no one gives you a second thought But this asshole sticks a gun in his yapper and blows his brains out the top of his head and hell suddenly hes a hero There was even a big article in the local paper about how the stress of being a Corrections Officer causes depression and blah blah blah sensitive souls cant handle the gritty reality of working with druggedout assfucking convicts It was kinda laughable really Whoever wrote that article didnt know Bulldog personally thats for sureHutch interjected But the fuckin newspaper didnt mention nothing about what actually drove the piggy to pull the trigger and ventilate his own skull fuck no No mention of the kid at all The kid was the Wardens nasty little secret Because they still didnt know who the fuck the kid was or where he came from and one way or another the creepy little bastard was making people dead All they had to go on was an old court document that read like a horror book a passing mention in a sanitation report and a blackandwhite picture of someone who looked like the kid but couldnt possibly be the kidI was suddenly aware that I was getting a bit freaked out In the soft red gloom stoned out of my tree every word that Mikey and Hutch uttered seemed frighteningly plausible I cleared my throat and announced I gotta tell you guys this is a fucked up story Im getting creeped out down hereHutch blinked down at me with inebriated surprise Shit I forgot that you were even down there Quiet little fucker aint he More bubbly in yer cup my friendI still hadnt managed to finish my first helping of the vile stuff I shook my head and finished up Nickys doobie instead Mikey lapsed into silence and we were silent with him Even Richie In the silence something dawned on me I said Hey Mikey  when they brought the kid to a different jail and walled him up after they couldnt execute him  that was this place wasnt it When you guys first saw him he wasnt a new fish at all  the kid was the oldest con in this entire jointThis ones pretty smart Mikey Hutch said Compared to Richie hes a fuckin scholar We should make him our Treasurer or something whaddya thinkWe aint got nothin to treasure here old man Not in this fuckin shithole Mikey poured himself some another shot of the eyewatering concoction in the bag Yeah you got er buddy  according to Billy Tremont it was right underneath this very building He let out a raspy sigh and hoisted aloft his Dixie cup of hootchTo Billy Tremont he said I sincerely hope God took it easy on youHowd he die Nick asked and Mikey flashed that humorless smile againNot long after Bulldog ate some lead we woke up to the sound of gunshots in the middle of the night again They found Billy Tremont dead in the COs locker room His brains and bits of his skull were sliding down the wall beside his body like snails The coroner declared that it was another suicide but heres the thing  they found five chunks of lead embedded in a wall all at chestheight And one in his brain There was a full cup of coffee spilled on the floor beside him and he still had a vacation request form clutched in his free hand Mikey leaned back against the wall and let out a scornful gust of air So according to the official report heres Billy sipping on a fresh coffee just about to go to the office and request some vacation time  when suddenly right then and there with no warning or reason he decides to shoot himself But before he does that he fires all the bullets in his service pistol into the wall except for the one that he fires through his own temple Thats a hell of an odd way to commit suicide dontcha thinkNick looked disturbed The kid came for him Thats what happened isnt itHe appeared very young and very vulnerable in the dim crimson light his face unlined and guileless It got out of its cell and  it was coming for him The cop tried to shoot it then turned the gun on himself before it could  get at himCant say for sure Nicky The only guy who can is thirteen years in his graveRemmie tentatively cleared his throat from the top bunk You said something to Hutch about the power going out before and something that happened when it did What were you talking aboutNah maybe we shouldnt get into that tonightHell might as well tell em the rest Hutch rumbled Gone this far havent we A week after Billy bit the dust a storm rolled in and knocked the power out clear across the county We were all herded into our cells and told to shut up and fuckin behave A lot of the hacks couldnt make it into work that night on account of the roads being all fucked up with accidents and torrential rain and shit  so the bosses who did make it to work were all carrying heavy firepower They made it clear that they werent going to fuck around if somebody got out of handRight around midnight I heard a shotgun go off somewhere on the other side of the Pen Cant mistake that sound if youre familiar to it I was wide awake and on my feet in a heartbeat Then sort of muffled and far away I heard screaming There was a boss standing nearby my cell and over his radio a voice was squawking Hes out Hes out of his cell and he killed Aimsley Hes ripping everyone apart Get your asses over to Solitary NOW The hack took off running and I turned to Johnny Franzini  but he stole the words right out of my mouth He said The boy  he is loose This is badIt was dark in there but Im pretty sure I saw Johnny cross himselfMikeys eyes glittered at us in the semidarkness glassy from the drink and wide from the memory on his lips There was a second gunshot and then a whole lot more They echoed and boomed and scared us shitless When they tapered off we heard more screaming It sounded like  like animals at a slaughterhouse squealing and bucking while they breathe their last Me n my cellie we fuckin hid in the corner with a mattress in front of us We didnt know what was happening just that the hacks had tried to shoot  something and they didnt fuckin succeed Im not afraid to admit it  I was shitting my pantsI heard feet come slapping against the cement and then three hacks sprinted past our cell Hutch said They werent just running  they were fuckin sprinting haulin ass like Olympians I seen their faces for a second and they were wild with fear Ive never seen anyone look like that before or since Everyone was hollerin at em as they passed asking them what the fuck was going on They didnt answer didnt even hear us  they just ran on by and kept goingAfter a few minutes a fourth guy comes along and hes limping real bad using his rifle as a crutch He got left behind I guess The hack was looking over his shoulder a lot and sorta joghopping as fast as he could manage He was leaving a trail of blood behind him The hacks uniform was shredded and torn on one side of his body flapping around like rags I yelled at him Hey What the fuck happened to you guys Whats going on and he stopped in front of our cell I could see the guy a little better now and I wished I hadnt It was Aimsley He wasnt dead after all  at least not yet His right arm had been shredded to almost nothing I mean it was just a few flapping pieces of meat and stringy shit oozing blood and barely holding the bones together His right thigh was missing huge chunks of meat too  and most of the foot The guys face was grey from blood loss His eyes were like a dolls  like twin pieces of round murky glass He was in shock He moved his mouth trying to find some words then said I think Im dying Then he started hopping again There was a puddle of blood on the floor where he had stoppedOkay thats enough Remmie said and his voice quavered a little I dont want to hear anymoreI dont remember asking if you did Mikey rasped Remmie pursed his painted lips and was silentHutch continued I heard something else coming then It sounded like something running on all fours something with claws I backed up against the wall as far away as I could go and Johnny cowered down into his bunk with his blanket pulled up around his face It came in fast and ripped past my cell just a fuckin blur of arms and legs and about ten seconds later I hear Aimsley start wailing like a siren It was awful Those were deathscreams man  nothing else can force a living creature to let out such awful fucking sounds it took me a moment to understand that Aimsley wasnt just screaming he was saying something He was saying Mommy Its eating meeeeee Mommy Its eating meeeeee Then I realized that I was screaming right along with him So was Johnny The whole pod was screaming You remember that Mikey All of us two hundred murderers and stickup men fuckin screaming in unison like little girlsI wont ever forget that Not ever Mikey said quietly The hack finally stopped making noise and we all did too You could almost taste the terror in the air sharp and bitter I could smell Aimsleys blood that coppery smell that gets in your throat and makes you want to retch It was so quiet  silent as a tomb You could have heard a pin drop And then slowly  so slowly  a figure comes strolling into view on the range It was the kid He was red from head to toe completely covered in blood and guts and shreds of stuff that kept sliding off of him and dropping onto the floor He wandered right down the middle of the range and he was carrying Aimsleys head by the hair dangling beside his leg as he walked I watched him as he passed by and I didnt breathe not once did I even fucking dare to breathe The kid ambles on up to the Hack Shack just as casual as could be and he puts Aimsleys severed head up on the ledge of the window Then he walked out into the middle of the range raised his arm and pointed at all of us each individual cell Like he was marking us each and every one Marking us for deathWhen he was done the kid walked back the way he came and he disappeared from view That was the last anyone ever saw of him He was just  goneThere was a full minute of silence Finally I spoke up Why the fuck did I never hear anything about this before How This should have been everywhere  the news TV crime shows fucking everywhere Nick chimed in and said I never heard nothing about this either and used to love those fuckin crime showsNo you never heard nothing about that  but you might have heard something about a prison riot Mikey said According to the newspapers the cons took advantage of the power outage and went apeshit for a few hours Most of the guards on duty died trying to stop us or so the story goes The government funded a swell new electronic locking system all because of what happened that nightI thought about this for a moment then said I dunno  What dont you know Huh Ill fuckin tell you the rest hows that Hutch glared down at me and his narrowed eyes slammed phantom punches into my face I froze The three hacks that we seen running for their lives  they ran right into the arms of the SWAT team whod just gotten on the scene with their guns drawn The cops busted through the gate and they found what was left of Aimsley first They ignored our hollerin and followed the blood trail They found the rest of them in the hallway that runs down the middle of Solitary lying in a raw heap with the blood congealing in a pool beneath the bodies like gravy All the cell doors had been ripped away from their hinges and the cons inside had been torn into pieces From what I heard it took a crime scene cleanup crew six days to clean out that wing And even after that the cons and the hacks were finding driedup bits of flesh and bone for months on end We toldja what happened and you can believe it or not I dont give a fuck and neither does Mikey Ask around if you wanna  theres some longtimers here that might talk about it if you give em something to loosen their lips Once again I dont give a fuck This whole pod had nightmares for a long long time Im probably gonna have em til the day I die and I doubt Im the only one There is something within these fuckin walls that looks human but isnt Its something that you dont want to meet and believe me  you better hope you never doHutch stopped talking then and as the hour was late and we were all pretty fucked up the silence soon turned to sleep I recall dreaming of a fairhaired young man who stood amongst us as we slept silent as a shadow His eyes were completely black in the feeble glow of the emergency lights his expression vulpine and hungry I remember that in the dream I was very very afraid that the boy would sense that I was not actually asleep If he discovered that I was awake hed devour me I remember this quite clearlyWe awoke early in the morning to the pitiful sounds of a junksick Richie dryheaving into the toilet The lights were back on and the lockdown was over Richie wasnt the only one who was feeling like shit that morning  we were all in pretty rough shape especially us floorfolk Sleeping in a sitting position on cold concrete makes for a stiff painful morningNone of us had much to say We all sat and smoked and waited for the hacks to do morning head count I wondered if pounding hangovers werent the only reason for that I suspected that I wasnt the only one whose sleep had been disturbed by the fairhaired spectre A thing that should have ceased to walk the earth years before but had not A thing with a terrible appetiteThe cops finally came around and let us out of our cages They pointedly did not perform the morning cell check If they had there simply wouldnt have been enough cells in Solitary to confine all the rulebreakers We all trooped off to stand in the chow line except Richie who opted to stay behind and undoubtedly indulge in a snort or two and thats pretty much where this story endsWell almostI was released a year early for good behavior During the rest of my time there most of Mikeys crew were paroled either through the front door  or the back Richie was the first one to get wheeled out the back way Then eight months later Coltranes skull was pounded into a new and messy format and he followed Richie out the back door Six months before I was uncaged Big Rob Hutch had a heart attack while walking up the stairs that led to the tier above ours He fell backwards clutching his chest and was dead before he somersaulted over the last few steps and landed at the bottomSo for a while it was just me Mikey Nick and a few casual homeboys It got boring The crew unraveled at the seams and by the time I was paroled it had ceased to existA few months after my divorce was finalized I got nostalgic one night and decided to try and find Mikey online Soon enough I did  through his obituary He died in hospital of a short illness not long after I was released Remmie was also deceased the victim of a showerroom rape and stabbing And Nicky I discovered that he was in a mental institutionI visited him in there once Id rather be in jail any day Most of the patients I saw there were zombies chemically bitchslapped into subservience by their meds There were a few others who were just  strange Their gaze made me feel unsafe  and for Christs sake I did time in a federal penitentiary I was shown to where Nicky sat by himself at a table and he instantly recognized me We greeted each other like old friends and made small talk just like anyone would He seemed completely normal to me I didnt understand why he was in there  until I mentioned HutchWhat do you think happened to Hutch exactly I asked him and his relaxed grin suddenly became a twisted grimace of fear He seized me by the front of my jacket and hauled me close and his eyes burned bright with the fire of insanity He hissed The kid pushed him down the stairs It wasnt a fucking heart attack thats a coverup The kid got Mikey too  it ate everything but his head it left his head on his fucking pillow The orderlies grabbed Nicky and pried him off of me and they dragged him away while he screamed and flailed and twisted in their iron grip I watched this with an open mouth and my heart pounding Then I went home and got very very drunkSomewhere within those prison walls there is a thing that hungers And sometimes  it feeds I dont expect you to believe this any more than I did But you know what On nights like this with the wind howling and the fine hairs standing up on my neck I couldnt care less what you believeAnd if you were ever unfortunate enough to meet him face to face well  Ill bet the kid wouldnt care what you believe eitherNote crossposted from rTheAssembly  a sub featuring the work of the writing collective The Assembly one that I am happy to be a member

NEWACCOUNT,57,60,1qs3hz,167,I suffer from sleep paralysis pretty regularly  Ive grown accustomed to it so its not really an issue anymore  It terrified me back when I was like eight but Im twentyfive now Ive learned to copeIt only happens to me under certain circumstances  Only when Im asleep on my back Never in any other position  Its much more likely to occur during the day if I doze off for a nap  It happens plenty at night too if im too tired or not tired enough to sleep yetThe first step to dealing with it is to realize that I am in fact having an episode or whatever you call them  Thats pretty easy if I am awake scared and unable to move its pretty much a given  This seems like a trivial step realizing that im paralyzed but its really important  Having that realization help me block out all the terrifying shit thats going on in my head  It helps dull the ominous chanting that I always experience  Helps me ignore the shadows moving around the room  Helps dull the terror I have of whatever is behind my bathroom door that I generally assume is on its way to get meThe fucker behind my bathroom door isnt always behind my bathroom door  It depends on where Im sleeping  Sometimes hes around the corner of my living room  Sometimes hes coming from the back door  He was even coming from the closet door once though I dont know how he managed to cram himself in there  Its hard to convey the visceral terror that fucker instills in me at least to those who havent experienced such a phenomenon  Hes the only thing that haunts my paralysis  Others get ghosts or demons sitting on their chests or whatever but all I get is the sense of impending doom knowing its right there coming for me to do only god knows what  Its a feeling of allconsuming fear of absolute and complete panic and of utter helplessness  Which leads me to  The next thing to do obviously is snap right the fuck out of it  I think most people who deal with this regularly probably have their own little tricks to get out of it  Mines simple I shake my head back and forth  Thats it but its easier said than done  Because I cant actually move my head hence the paralysis  But I put forth the effort  Over and over again back and forth back and forth  Honestly this is the most terrifying part  It really sucks to try to move and not be able to  Especially when that fucker in the bathroom is on its way  But eventually after some time one of the mighty shakes of my head manages to move me and then everything is okay  The chanting stops thank god  Why my head conjures up some cultist shit is beyond me  The corners of the room clear out and that fucker in the bathroom goes away  The sense of terror evaporates and thats thatNext thing to do is to roll over onto my belly to ensure it wont happen again grab my girlfriend and go back to sleep  No big dealThats how it usually goes anyway  But lately its not quite been the same  Ill explain more about that in a bit but first lets take a detour to address the question that some of you may be asking NEWACCOUNT why dont you just you know not go to sleep on your back  And thats a good question with a simple answer  Its because sleeping on my back in addition to being a prerequisite for sleep paralysis is also a prerequisite for lucid dreaming  Lucid dreaming needless to say is a lot more fun than sleep paralysis  So much fun that its worth the risk of waking up paralyzed  Whats more is that im certain that these two phenomena are related in some way  For me the circumstances have to be identical for either to occur  Asleep on my back  More frequent during daytime naps or when im too tired or not tired enough to sleep  They both occur in the interlude between sleep and notsleep  At their core I think they are essentially just two tricks of the mind  One is me doing the tricking while the other is my mind playing tricks on me  Two distinct phenomena but related in some way or another  Generally its a crapshoot which one I get at a given timeThats how it usually goes anyway  But lately its not quite been the same  They are no longer distinct the barrier between paralysis and lucidity has diminished  It started off small  Id be flying around and hear ever so faintly chanting  Or id feel a bit uneasy about whats behind a door Im about to enter because maybe thats where the fuckers coming from  Not the pure panic im accustomed to because im free to move around but a sense of apprehension  Gradually it became worse over the ensuing weeks  Id emerge into the world of lucidity to fullblown chanting that came from nowhere but came from everywhere The fear and terror id only experienced when paralyzed would overcome me and id have no choice but to flee  But no matter where id go no matter how fast id run or fly away I knew that fucker from my bathroom was close  I couldnt open any doors because I knew hed be there  I couldnt stop moving or hed catch me from behind  I couldnt fly too high because I just knew he was waiting in the clouds  There fear was allencompassing Pure and absolute terror was the only thing my mind could comprehend  Id wake up exhausted from spending all night in fightorflight modeThis new phenomenon was infinitely worse than sleep paralysis  When I was paralyzed I could eventually shake myself out of it  But now I couldnt force myself to wake up Im trapped for as long as the dream lasts Im free to roam but I know hes coming All I could do is keep runningThats how it usually goes anyway  But lately its not quite been the same  Because last night I had normal dreams  The kind you cant remember when you wake up  I had to pee when I got out of bed but I didnt really like the bathroom door  I was groggy though and didnt think much of it  I used the bathroom downstairs before I made myself some eggs  When I got back to my room and turned my computer on to browse reddit I heard something  Ever so slight like it was far away I heard an all too familiar chanting sound  Whats worse my dog Riley wont go anywhere near the bathroom door,Sleep paralysis is one thing,227
SamMarduk,16,55,1qvt4k,169,I have been a Disc Jockey for five years and counting  I started at high school sporting events with a cheap ipod mixer but slowly moved up both in equipment and venuesBeing a DJ is just as monotonous as any other job for most gigs  Usually the client only wants top s hits with smooth transition to each song no silence in between  God forbid they let you showcase any talent  On the off chance youre allowed to scratch and mix you have to still be careful not to let any expletives slip out or else be fired on the spot without payI have done jobs for churches and the community and Ive done high school house parties and college keggers  My rates dont change and I get it up frontNow the scariest thing for some DJs is the equipment you never know if it will work when you want it Other DJs have wicked stage fright so they just create music on their computers and post it online  Some DJs are afraid of lower in venues like a house party All it takes is one drunken boyfriend one time to beat the shit out of you and no more house parties for that DJIve dealt with all these things and yet I have only truly been afraid onceIt was a pretty large party  The client called me two weeks in advance and gave me the rundown  I was thrilled  He offered double my asking rate and told me it would be all EDM techno and that he wanted a show The crowd was set at It was a dream eventI arrived about  hours before the event started  I came to the address I was given to a large empty warehouse  I parked at the back in some tall grass and brought my stuff insideWhen I walked in the door I saw the stage lining the short wall at the end of the building  This place was huge and it could easily hold   The dome lights that all warehouses have were brightly lit so the staff could set up There was a large circular bar in the center of the floor and multicolored lights all over the ceiling  There were tables on the far side opposite the stage and one main entrance besides the two emergency exits  Throughout the entire ceiling there were cages with paid dancers waiting to climb inside to perform  There were waiters and bartenders standing around and a few burly guys taking posts at the doors  Yo DJ A voice called  I saw the client approaching from the far wall He was a young rich white guy probably in his sWe shook hands and he showed me to the stage after quick helloIt was massive  I could see the whole warehouse Lights were all aimed at me and the crowd area Behind the stage was an emergency exit for the performersSetup was very routine and soundcheck went well  He had a great speaker systemAll was well and I could tell it was going to be a good night  Everything was perfectAll except for my headphonesIn my ears behind the tracks I swear I heard what sounded like static whispering  The main lighting turned off Then the colored lights flicked on The cage dancers started moving in their cages  Smoke machines poured fog into the giant dance floor and the staff took positionThe doors opened and people began flooding in as I hit the first trackSeveral girls who I assumed had pregamed before entering came in dancing and several douchebag guys followedAs the stage lights came on and as the fog thickened I began to see less and less  While they danced I realized that I could only see the lasers in the fog and maybe a few feet in front of the stage  I was having a blast and so were the patrons  Until that noise came back this time clearer I could make out chunks of hissed wordsEssaaa Hialaa CharamphObviously not real words but god it sounded so clearThe night rolled on past midnight and it was insane People were drinking dancing probably doing drugs and banging on the dance floor  I kept playing until I heard my headphones make a static coughing noise  This time it was loud enough to mess up my focusThats it I thought Im fixing this asapI let the track play as I examined my headphones  I turned my laptop brightness up and for a split second I thought I saw a face  Eesh Probably the lights against my relfection I gave up and kept playing through the off and on static noises the headphones tightly attached to my earsIt was roughly  am and I decided to scan the crowd The fog was still thick but I could see heads dancing  I looked until I locked eyes withsomethingAt first glance she was a college aged girl She was in a pink raver tutu and had pigtails  However the closer I looked the more horrified I became She was soaked in blood  On her skin looked like black scuff marks  She had one eye bulged out of its sockets and her jaw looked smashed  Her arms and legs were mangled beyond the point of function but she still stood hunched but still standingI shook my head to make sure I wasnt insane but the next moment she was gone I want to point out that I was entirely sober for this event All that I heard and saw was done so in my right mindI tried hard to ignore what I had seen so I made sure my ears were covered by my headphones and continued to playI was getting worried that the stress of such a high profile event was getting to me but I was able to brush it off and return to my work Until  amAt around three the static was backThis time very clear after a few seconds  I heard in my noise canceling headphones a tiny hissing womans voicesee shee leiiia ssssss shhhh shsa  SHUTUP SHUT UP SHUT UPFollowed by an intense screech I yelled and tossed my headphones off onto the tables silencing the trackAs my ears adjusted from the ringing I heard itScreamingSeveral people were screamingThe main lights suddenly came on and the doors opened as people rushed out One of the security men ran upIts a good thing you saw thatSaw what I replied as the fog was still thinning slowlyThe cage I cant see ten feet man I retortedOh god the big bouncer mutteredWhat the hell is going on I demanded more annoyed than confused at this pointA cage fell Nearly a hundred feet Crushed the dancer and some poor girl under her Her friend was screaming and thats why we thought you stopped the songI walked out to my car after the paramedics came and placed the dancer DOA The other girl was crippled but survivedI saw her body as the smoke cleared She was the same crushed corpse that watched me that night She was the same voice I heard as foreshadowing to her deathI am not afraid of the crowdI am not afraid of my equipment malfunctioningI am not afraid of people dying at my shows  But there is one thing I am afraid of I am afraid when Im at a prom or block party or house rager and in the back of the crowd I see a trampled bloody body wearing a pink tutu,What scares a DJ,224

deleted,18,55,1qvjha,145,The shadiness of this whole ordeal wasnt apparent at the time but boy do I feel stupid nowIt was a Friday I think and I had just signed onto Facebook and noticed that I had a friend request Im usually very cautious when it comes to adding people but the person listed their college as the one Im attending so I obviously accepted After scrolling through my timeline for a bit I decided to call it a night and go to bedThe next morning I woke up because my phone kept constantly buzzing practically begging for my attention Through my blurry vision I was able to read the notifications and they were all from the guy that had added me Most of them were him liking my photossome of them being ones I posted years ago but whatever it was just a guy trying to get my attention rightI shrugged it off and scrolled through my timeline in my tired state and noticed that he had tried messaging me He said that he claimed hes seen me around campus which wasnt exactly unusual but then he started to message me about trying out an app for him He said I could be one of his first beta testersI gladly accepted because what if the app became the next big thing Id be one of the first people to have used it How fucking radHe eventually sent me the file via messenger and he told me to just drag it into iTunes easy enough rightThe app was titled Smile for the Camera and the icon was a glossy animated girl with gigantic breasts typical maleWhen I opened the app I was greeted by a friendly message explaining how I was merely a beta tester for the app and any progress made may or may not continue onto the final version whateverIt made me sign in through Facebook which I wasnt too bothered by but I was beginning to think that all the hassle wasnt necessarily worth itFast forward ten minutes of trying to navigate around the app and I found myself at the main menu I clicked the Instructions option and it redirected me to another page Since the app is no longer available Im trying my best to recall what it had said but it was something like Load the app Obviously Once you are redirected to the Main Menu click the small camera icon located to the left Now that you have the camera loaded take a few pictures and then you can post them onto Facebook or whatever social media you have connected Be sure that you have your location enabled for Twitter You can add a few filters but not too many your natural state is always the best By then I had concluded that it was a sort of Snapchat knockoff but continued on anywayI clicked the icon and proceeded to take a few pictures flashing a few funny faces that I was sure my friends would get a kick out ofWhen I had taken quite a few I clicked the Export option and it redirected me to Safari and loaded what seemed to be the Facebook login pageI put in my information and clicked Log In and was redirected to yet another pageThe site looked like something Facebook would make and it had a few boxes that asked me to type in a mailing address because they occasionally liked to ship out Facebook merchandise Maybe that shouldve been a red flag right thereI put in my colleges address just for safe measure because whatever they shipped out could easily be given to me so I clicked on the Next option and Safari then closedOnce I had got to college I opened my laptop and checked Facebook to see if the pictures had actually posted and they were nowhere to be seen I tried to message the guy who had originally given me the app to test out but he had evidently deactivated his account Red flag number twoRight then and there I uninstalled the pointless app and thought nothing of it until this past FridayI was in my Anatomy class when an officer came into the room and asked for me By then I was freaked out because as far as I was concerned I had done nothing wrongHe asked me to come with him to the stationwhich I gladly compliedOnce there I was sat down with two other officers and they started asking me about the damn appI told them everything I knew from the guy giving me the download straight to when I tried to post them on FacebookBy then they were rubbing their temples clearly flustered by the whole situationThat app that app was a sex trafficking app One of the burly officers said sighing as he leaned back in his chair That guy that claimed to go to your college wasnt a real person Well they were but not who they said to beBy then my eyes were brimming with tears I was honestly terrified what did this all mean for meYou see these criminals did their research You were merely a target It looks like they gathered as much information as they could about you to make it seem legit Youre lucky we got to you in timeWhat do you mean I remember asking trembling as they explained it furtherYou see those pictures you took were listed on a sex trafficking website If they wanted you all they had to do was bid on you and you wouldve been stalked and eventually kidnapped to finalize the sale were assuming I talked to other victims who almost got kidnapped but managed to get away They didnt really give us much to work with they just said that theyre cleverer than we all take them for We had a few undercover cops bid on that website and we bid on you  Once youre sold your information is revealed to the buyer but it mentions that whoever you bought the person from will get them to you within a weeks time We noticed that it was a local colleges address so we went to get you and here we are now By then I was dumbfounded it all made sense once you put the pieces together and I cant believe that I almost fell prey to something so sinisterAfterwards they had told me that if anything fishy happened to call the immediately and they also mentioned that they were close to busting the caseI think its safe to say that Im staying away from anything having to do with pictures for now,Smile for the Camera,200
mathearetice,17,50,1qsodj,140,About a year ago give or take I took my time walking home from class at around  at night The reason why I was out so late was that it was a Friday night The night my stepfather would always become intoxicated and abusive not something I enjoy being around I was never afraid my mum would sometimes question me otherwise and Id always joke about how even junkies can be lovely I remember it had began to drizzle a little bit but I didnt bother quickening my pace I enjoyed rainy nights so I took the route that would add about an hour to my journey a bit quicker if you ran I came onto a narrow back street it before I saw the silhouette of a tall skinny man emerge from the shadows I stopped in my tracks I wasnt scared he was in my way I couldnt really see him because he was standing next to a dimly lit bus stop I squinted as best I could before I noticed him getting closer For every step he took hed purposely drag his other foot behind him I could hear the Stomp scraaape just barelyStomp scraaapeStomp scraaapeI knew he wasnt really handicapped his movements were too quick and easy  As he limped closer I noticed his hair was long and hadnt been washed in what looked like foreverHis clothes were white and covered in dirt His lips looked blood red like he had put on lipstick Stomp scraaapeWhat really put me off about him was that his clothes were close to looking brand new I found it very odd Stomp scraaapeStomp scraaapeHe stopped He stopped limping and he stopped facing me He had turned to look at the sky to me it looked like he was admiring it Maybe he wasI was a full moon tonight an especially bright one He faced me againHe started to limp and before I knew it he was feet away and at this point I was scared He did this disturbing giggle Girly he cried Come with me Lets Have some fun He reached out his bony hand that was attached to a long skinny armIt took me forever before I figured he must have been drunk so I politely said no and smiled His face went twisted with anger for a few seconds in the dim light  He was provoking me and it was workingGirly he growled are you sure I gave him no answer and continued to walkI dreaded every step that brought us closer before realising he wouldnt let me pass I decided to be brave and walked right up to him leaving a few inches between our faces He smelled putrid like fresh road kill I didnt show any sign of wanting to puke I stared him in the eyes and tried to look fierce My instincts told me to be defensive To say something threatening like Get the fuck out my way so I did Well I tried All that came out was a whimper get the fuuuJust because humans cannot smell fear doesnt mean we cant hear it I heard it in my own voice anyone couldFor a second I thought he didnt hear it was wasnt affected by it at allWithout saying a word he turned and limped away I watched him disappear into the darkness before taking the next turn out of the street Stomp scraaapeStomp scraaapeStill shocked from the strange encounter I began calculating the quickest route home The best I could think of was a walk that would take  minutes  if I ran Even after figuring it out I didnt start walking not for a few minutes anyway I finally managed to bring my foot forward and start my pace again constantly keeping a look out for any weirdo jumping out of a bush or shadow I was halfway down the street before I began to feel a bit calmerI could hear something in the distance I turned around for the last timeStomp scraaapeOh noStomp scraaapeNoAs I did my heart erupted and all blood vanished from my head He was standing there about a trucks length away from myselfThis time I could see him perfectly under the streetlight between us He was hunched over but his eyes looked straight up at me burning two holes into my face while his teeth were bloody and grittedI wish I said he was drunk or high But he wasnt Not at all He was very very insane He was the scariest THING I had ever seen He started to limp Every step he took pained me like he was killing me on the inside When he was just a foot away from me horror had consumed my whole body We were in the light I could see everything His lips werent covered in lipstick but in blood and that wasnt dirt on his clothes When I gasped from the sight he just smiled I didnt get my phone out because it was dead I didnt run because my legs wouldnt listen They just shook And I wish I had pulled out my pepper spray but I left it on the counter I finally looked up at his blood red eyes His mouth got wider and became an unnerving smile Get the fuuu he mimickedSilence had ceased the moment His eyes wide and wild his mouth still holding that painful smile He raised his hand to me expecting me to give him mineI took a step back instead His face snapped straight into rage and grabbed my arm Just as he took a loud deep breath I ripped myself out of his grip and ran for it I ran for my life The agonizing roar behind me made me run fasterGIRLY he screamed GIRLYIt sounded inhumane like he was possessed My arm hurt so much I felt tears in my eyes I think it was brokenI didnt want to look back I didnt want to see that rage in his face I tried thinking of all the routes possible but his roars clouded my mind I tried blocking them out as hard as I couldIf I took the next turn and went straight home not only would he follow me home but hed know where I lived If I ran to the park to try and lose him Id probably fall into a ditch and break a leg Then Id be done for My only hope was to run to traffic that was on the end of the street I ran the hardest I had ever in my life My lungs were aching and my chest was sore but I didnt careBy the time I had reached the end I spun around and saw no one I looked around frantically hoping I could lead him into traffic hoping someone could run him over But I couldnt He was goneI ceased the opportunity and went as quick as I could back home checking every shadow every bush When I reached the front gates of my home I looked around for the last time He was nowhere to be seen I exhaled loudly and collapsed onto the floor I felt an overwhelming wave of relief hit me and I began to smileI made it I thought to myself I actually fucking made it My celebration was interrupted by my stepfathers drunken cries and relief had disappeared I got up ready to open the gateStomp scraaapeWaitStomp scraaapeNo fucking wayI looked down the hillside of the street and there he was Right at the bottom Even in the distance I could see his wide eyes and smile He raised his hand and waved at me I wanted to scream but my vocal chords didnt want to cooperateHe started to limp Stomp scraaapeStomp scraaape,I now stay home at night,190
FishCustard,21,39,1qrr82,135,This is the story of how I became a monsterI was heading home from work on the day it started  Id stayed late to finish up a presentation for the next morning and had to take the slow train home It seemed to stop at every little place between the city and the small town where I lived The darkness closed in as the train trundled on and I drifted off into a light sleepWhen I awoke a few stations away from home I was startled to find myself staring into the face of a young woman She had long ever so slightly curly black hair bright blue eyes and a very pretty pale complexionHello she chuckled as I blinked myself awakeHi there I replied forcing all the services in my brain to start as quickly as I couldHeading home Im assuming she said smilingYeah I explained that I was heading home from work She asked what I did and I gave a quick overview of my very boring job In almost any other setting this conversation would have been beneath notice but on the cusp of night in an empty train carriage with a beautiful girl it was rather oddI asked her what she was doing out she said that she was visiting someone in one of the towns we passed through as I was sleeping The conversation went on  I learned that she lived in the same town as me that shed just moved into an apartment there and didnt know anyone that she was looking for a job etc We got off the train and exited the station still engrossed in our conversation Before we headed our separate ways I thought I may as well ask for her phone number  this wasnt something Id usually dream of doing but we seemed to have just clickedShe smiled took my phone and tapped in her name and numberElysiaA pretty name to go with the pretty girl I thought as I walked home We continued our chatting via text over the next few days and even had a Skype session over the weekend during which we argued the merits of the latest film releases and swapped favourite moviesEverything was going swimmingly until I received a text one evening that made my chest tighten instantlygtJake Im scared I think theres something weird going on heregtWhat do you mean whats going ongtYesterday when I got back home the door was already wide open Nothing was taken though Thing is the same thing happened today and now theres a horrible smell in the bathroomgtOk call the police and Ill be right over Whats your addressShe texted it to me  one of the new build apartments on the edge of town I remembered them because of how unusual the blocks are each floor is painted a different colour the first floor is blue the second green and the top floor is red They looked a bit like alien angel cakesI drove out to her as quickly as I could without drawing unwanted attention to myself The parking lot was almost empty so I parked as close to the entrance of her building and rushed in I looked at the address again to confirm  that means th floor I thought to myselfI decided to forgo the elevator and bounded up the stairs two at a time heart thumping through my ribcage When I got to the th floor landing it was pitch black A strong uneasy feeling crept up my spine but I crept forward groping the wall for a light switch as I went Eventually the lights came on of their own accord  a faulty motion sensor I thought to myself as I headed for  at the far end of the corridorElysia opened the door as I approached she must have been watching through the spyholeYou didnt have to come over but thanks she saidNo problem  did you call the policeYeah although they didnt seem to take me very seriously They said theyd send someone though to take my statement and have a look aroundI asked whether she wanted anything but she declined I continued by asking whether she minded if I had a quick look around myself  she didnt I started with the bathroomAs soon as I walked in I was hit by a disgusting combination of sicklysweetness and metallic tang I checked everywhere I could think of to find the source of the smell but it seemed to be coming from all around me there was nothing obviously out of place no rotting horrors under the bath no Cthulhoid beings in the toilet cistern I was about to head up into the loft space when the lights went deadI froze for what felt like a whole minute but could only have been a second or so I called out to Elysia No reply ShitI fished my phone out of my pocket and turned on its flashlight I crept out of the bathroom and walked straight into something Leaping back in terror I turned my flashlight on it expecting to see some shambling horror but was immensely relieved to see that it was only ElysiaYou frightened the life out of me I saidSorry I didnt know you were still in there I dont know what happened everythings dead Elysia said What do we do whats going onPutting my arm around her I led her toward the front door gently but quickly I dont know but I do know we have to get out of hereBut the policeWell wait for them in the lobby where its bright and theres more than one way out okay I think I was trying to convince myself of the plan more than her Nevertheless I felt her head nod against my shoulderAs we reached the door there came the sound of scraping metal from outside My heart nearly lept out of my mouth until I realised it was the elevator doors opening  the cops must be here The sound of heavy boots striding down the corridor followed I looked through the spyhole and immediately wished I hadntThe lights outside were flickering on and off bathing the corridor in stroboscopic lighting In the flashes of illumination I saw three large figures heading directly for the apartment They had elongated faces that appeared to taper to a tentaclelike appendage no mouth and huge black sunken eyes They walked slowly with a vaguely stooped gaitAs they approached the door I heard their raspy gurgling breathing Only then did it click that these things were right outside the fucking doorI grabbed Elysia and ran to the kitchen telling her to hide in a closet She screamed at me that there were no closets in the kitchen I was about to tell her to make a run for one when there was an almighty crash  the splintering and rending of wood They were insideI frantically searched the drawers for a knife eventually finding one I grabbed another and gave it to Elysia A second later one of the things filled the kitchen doorway I ran at it knife raised but the next thing I knew I was on my back on the floor  and the knife had slid somewhere under the cooker Elysia was too terrified to do anything  the monstrous being simply picked her up and put her over its immense shoulder I got back to my feet and looked around for another weapon eventually settling on a large marble rolling pinI followed the thing out into the living room only to be confronted with what must have been one of the others By now I was running on adrenaline only and my eyes had adjusted to the dark somewhat I swung the marble rod at the creatures head with all the force I could muster expecting it to magically deflect or simply have no effect But it didnt It connected and the horrible thing collapsed to its knees I struck it again and it collapsed to the floor its unearthly rasping breaths laboured and unevenDespite my triumph two lights clicked on in my head One by now the thing that had taken Elysia would be long gone back to whatever fucking dimension these things came from Two there were three of themI turned on instinct Too late It was on me before I could react punching me to the ground with a massive fist I tried to stand but fresh darkness was creeping into my vision As I drifted away from consciousness my arm began to burn with pain  it had injected me with some kind of venom I was going to dieOnly I didnt That might be the worst part of all thisI woke up to blinding white light and an unfamiliar ceiling I looked around and new fear gripped my heart I had no idea where I was but I knew I had to get out  clinical white walls intense lighting and nothing in the small room bar a metalframe bed and a bedside table One door I tried to get up but I couldnt coordinate any of my movements properly What did that thing inject me withThoughts swam through my brain as I remembered the beings and the apartment Elysia They took Elysia My train of thought was brought to a shuddering stop by the door opening I fully expected to see one of the tentacle faced horrors come to finish the job but it wasnt A man wearing a crisp black shirt black trousers and a deep red waistcoat stepped in to the room His clothes were totally at odds with the bright white room but his hair seemed to blend in nicely It was thick almost bushy and bright whiteIm sorry about all this he said His accent was odd British I couldnt place it Were normally a lot better than this Long storyWhat did you do with Elysia I shoutedThe girl Shes safe For nowYou monsters I spat imagining what they would do to herThats a very interesting point the man said walking to the table and pouring two glasses of water from a jug I hadnt even noticed He offered me one but I obviously declined Hm I dont blame you he muttered at that pointWanting any answers I could get I blurted out what the fuck were those thingsWhat thingsThe tentaclefaced things that took Elysia Theyre something to do with you I assumeThe man looked genuinely confused for a moment before his face fell Was this what you saw he said heading back to the door He muttered to someone just outside the room and one of the horrific beings followed him insideOnly it wasnt a horrific being It was a man A man wearing a fullface gas mask and some kind of respiration equipment on his back A long rubber tube connected the bottom of his mask to the pack on his back and there were two large black lenses over his eyes The equipment must have been heavy as he walked with a slight stoopWhat the fuck is going on here I just about managed to sayThis is Iain the man continued Youre fine to breathe in here this ones clean The monster reached up and took the mask off Underneath was a broadfaced brown haired man of about  He nodded curtlySo what happened I said unable to form more of a thought than thatWell tell me about Elysia the first man repliedI told him the story of us meeting on the train how we got closer over a few weeks and then how she texted me to say that her apartment had been open and there was a weird smellThis is the interesting bit he said almost smiling Where did she liveIn an apartment on the edge of town I said sighing Clearly they knew all thisYes one of those weird multicoloured lowrise blocks Which numberThe instant he said that my world started to upside down  I whisperedRealisation hit me again like a freight train Those wacky buildings where the first floor is blue the second is green and the third is redThere is no fourth floorWhich leaves us with the question of just where you were last night the man said He continued prattling but I wasnt listening  I was too busy replaying events Meeting Elysia after waking up on a midnight train texting her she never mentioned work or even what she did all day Then the dark landing the smell in the bathroom the lights going out the fact that she didnt reply when I called out to her yet she was right outside the door I practically fell over her when I came out of the bathroom Oh GodSo Elysia I said unable to finish the sentenceLets just say that you werent meant to get out of that buildingBut she looked perfectly normalBut we now know that appearance is far from everything It was dark Did you really look at Elysia after the lights went outAs I replayed my memory to see if I could pick out anything about Elysias appearance something else jumped out at me I hit one of them I waved a finger at Iain with a rolling pinThe whitehaired man sighed Yes you did Understandable under the circumstancesWhat happened to himHe died Subdural haematomaI collapsed back onto the bed cold and shaking Whats going to happen to meWell under official procedures youll have to be charged with manslaughter probably Obviously youd have selfdefence and diminished responsibility as defences though Cant guarantee you wont go to jail theyre under instructions to push for hard sentencesInstructions from whom Area  CIA NSA The SCP FoundationThe mysterious man stared at the floor for a couple of seconds When his eyes met mine there was a distinct sadness in them No MeFor a brief moment silence filled the room Then I burst out laughing Wait youre going to tell all this to a judge and jury I killed some man in a mask on a floor that shouldnt exist while he was trying to stop some fucking demon from eating meThey they dont eat people the man corrected as if Id just said that two plus two is nine Anyway not that kind of court Youve heard of military tribunals and such yesI noddedIts like thatDespair was about to consume me when I caught onto something Hang on you said officiallyThe man smiled Well I am one operative short now And things are so inefficient these days theyre always losing evidence and having to drop casesAnd so that is how I became a monster A monster with a long face black sunken eyes and raspy gurgling breath trying his best to save the next person from similar fate,Elysia,174
PatMallon,18,50,1qwsuf,128,It had me where it wanted delivering its final test or perhaps threat Blink and they will all be gone Everyone you love Everyone you care for Stripped from your mind like they were never thereThe following minutes were agonizing feeling like an eternity My eyes twitched repeatedly as I unnaturally pried them open They streamed tears of both pain and misery but soon those tears ran dry and dust began collecting  Thats when the burning started like hot irons singeing my corneas Despite the suffering I cried out I must keep them open But I knew I wouldnt be able to do this foreverSoon I regrettably freed my eyelids from their pry and let my lashes engage Moisture returned The pain ceased  not just the searing of my eyes but the sadness within I suddenly realized its plan was flawed I raised my head with a cocky grin to let it know that it should have chosen someone unlike me who actually had others to loveFor whatever reason it simply returned the very same grin,Blink and they will all be gone,178
youarealljerks,24,49,1qyvt1,126,I grew up in northern NJ my entire life  We lived in a couple different housesapartments in nice quaint neighborhoods with good neighbors and an all over good vibe  The first house we lived at after my parents split up will be one I will never forget and I was only  when it happened My parents were divorced on my first birthday and a year later my mom aunt and I rented a house in the small town of Blairstown  The house was split into two houses as it was a fairly large older house  We had the upstairs and a rabbi lived below us he lived there for many years  Even though I was only  or  at the time it seems like yesterday  I remember being in my moms arms as we took a tour through the house and I just felt very uneasy like someone was watching me  I guess my aunt and mom liked it because no sooner had we looked at it did we move in  As most normal renters do when they move in we cleaned the house up there was this weird red paint on the walls and water in the kitchen we thought there was a water leak  After a plumber came there was no water leak so we just assumed someone left the picture window open during the storm the night beforeEverything seemed to be going great the first couple weeks  It was a lovely neighborhood and all but there was just this weird vibe I kept getting  I woke up one morning to my aunt screaming it wasnt loud or anything but just a small shriek of surprise  Getting out of my bed I noticed the floor was really cold but then again it was winter and real hardwood  But the heat was on last night why was it so cold  I walked down the hallway and saw my aunt and mom with buckets cleaning this red paint off the walls again  I overheard them talking in low voices to one anotherMom Gum my aunts nickname was Gumby this smells like blood not paintGumby I noticed  They continued to wash the walls off as I being the little explorer I was decided to go upstairs to the attic to look for my barbie dolls  The attic door was at the end of the kitchen and usually hard a hard time closing the house was way old  As I  walk up stairs I smelled something really bad like warm dog poo on a hot summer day bad  I get up stairs and see a pile of what looks like coal in the corner and a big red door next to it  A noise from behind the door startles me and I run back down the stairs nearly falling on my butt most of the way  When I open the door I start crying and run to my mom  She asks me whats wrong and I tell her there is a big red door up stairs and theres something behind it My aunt looks at her she looks at my aunt and they both tell me its probably a squirrel or something I knew better than that  There was something bad up there I could feel itA few more weeks pass and things are getting more and more creepy  Every morning I listen to my mom and aunt clean blood off the walls  They just kept saying it must be paint that is bleeding through the wall paper  You could tell by their voices they were scared  I spent most of my time playing barbies or doll in the living room but it kept getting really cold  The pilot light on our furnace kept blowing out and we couldnt figure out why  Again my aunt and mom told me it was cold because it was winter  We would sit on the couch and watch a movie or TV at night before bed  One night my mom and aunt watched a scary movie of course I wanted to watch and they actually let me but said I couldnt get scared  Looking back now I laugh at my childish self I am a wimp for good reason  We were about  minutes into the movie when I heard a knock on the window next to the couch  I look over and see someone looking in our window waving  It was hard to tell if it was a male or female it was solid but not had a face but didnt  I screamed and jumped on my moms lap yelling Mommy someone is outside  My mom quickly glances at the window she saw it I know she did  She runs out the front door and around back  Only a few moments later she came back pale as could be and told me to go to my room  I cried that I didnt want to but she said it was time for bed  I stayed up and listened to my mom and aunt talk at the kitchen table Mom Gumby that window is  feet up off the ground there is no way someone could be in the windowGumby Tee my moms name is Tina shes a kid she probably just saw a reflection of the TVMom I saw it too It wasnt a reflectionThe house got this eerie quietness to it  I went to bed and fell fast asleepThe next day I wake up to footsteps in the attic I go out into the living room and see the attic door open my aunt is cleaning up the blood  I asked where mom was and she said Upstairs checking out that door for you  I had completely forgotten about the door I go outside and sit on the porch the neighboors dog comes up to me and starts licking my face he was the cutest black lab ever  Suddenly  his fur stands straight on end and he starts viciously barking at the front door of our house before whimpering off as if someone scolded him  I go back inside and my mom is pacing around the kitchen talking on the phone to someone  Under the door knob to the attic was my little rocking chair I had it was in my room I wondered why my mom put it thereThat evening we were eating dinner and I felt weird again  I was sitting across from the attic door eating when I noticed my rocking chair was ever so slightly rocking almost as if the wind blew it but it was smooth  Never really slowing down or speeding up  I guess my aunt saw me staring at it and looked over  I felt her kick my mom under the table and nod towards the door  My mom turned her head after a few more rocks the chair stopped dead  The lightbulbs in the small chandelier over the kitchen table started dripping water  At first it was slow but it increased to the point where there was a steady stream coming out of the bottom of them  We all looked up completely silent you could feel the wave of panichorror in the room though  I look back at the rocking chair and there is a little girl with a grin on her face looking at me  Her fingers are all bloody and her old school dress looks torn  My mom let out a shriek my aunt jumped out of her seat and ran to the attic door just before the little girl turned and walked through it  The water stopped drippingMy mom worked nights and had to leave that night for work my aunt was watching me  She put me to bed with a glass of water as usual  I dont know what time it was but I know it was before AM  I woke up and was really thirsty I reached down on the floor and picked up my glass of water  After a nice big drink I start putting the glass down and it falls shattering into a million pieces  I looked at the door I hear my aunt come running down the hallway  When I looked back down I saw a face in the puddle of water  I blinked twice thinking it was the reflection of the moon playing tricks on me  I was mesmerized by this face  It was purple and black and had this slightly evil yet welcoming grin on its face  I reached down to touch it when all of a sudden I felt this pain on the back of my hand  I screamed and the trace was broken as my aunt flung my door open  She picks me up and takes me to the kitchen where she sits me on the table  The back of my hand is covered in blood I guess the glass cut it all up but why the top of my hand and not my palm I wondered  My aunt ran my hand under water and it became clear why it was bleeding so bad  It was glass that cut me it was teeth  There was a full imprint of teeth on the back of my hand  My aunt started yelling at me for biting my hand and I told her it wasnt me it was the lady in the puddle  She didnt say much after that  She just bandaged up my hand the best she could as she called my mom to tell her she was bringing me to the doctor  The doctor looked at my hand and confirmed that I did not bite my own hand  He also had to take imprints of my  mom and aunts teeth to rule out child abuse  They werent a match and everything was fineWhen we get home I over heard my mom and aunt saying that they want to move  My mom suggests they talk to the rabbi and see if he knows anything about the house  We all head downstairs and knock on his door  His smile is warm and welcoming and he lets us in  He gives me a toy to play with and I go about letting my imagination run wild but still keep an ear open  My mom and aunt tell him everything  The big red door in the attic that goes no where is hot to the touch and doesnt have a knob  The bat crap thats next to it that she cleans up every day  The pilot light constantly going out the kitchen raining the face in the puddle the window EVERYTHING  After choking back tears my mom asks what we can do  He suggested to move out and leave everything  He pulled out a box of newsclippings and started showing them to my mom and aunt  There was a mother and little girl who used to live in the house years ago  They didnt have much money so the mom worked all of the time  One cold windy night the mom left to work leaving her daughter in the house  The wind blew the pilot light out on the furnace and with the age of the house the wind whipped through there making it nearly freezing really fast  This little girl got cold and wrapped herself in a blanket  The walls of the kitchen were still warm since the furnace was close to there  She began taking panel after panel off the wall to get to the warmth  She crawled into the insulation to keep warm and doing that cause her to choke on fiberglass and die in the wall  When the mother came home to see her daughter dead she hung herself by the window in the back  There it was all laid out on the table  The rabbi explained that most people who had lived in the house since then didnt have a problem unless they had a small child particularly a girl  My aunt and mom thanked him and we left back to our houseA week later we were finally moving into our new house  That week was the week from hell in our current house  We packed our essentials and left them in my moms truck  I had a diamond cross that was given to me as a baby that I wanted but it was stuck upside down on my dresser  The diamonds also looked like they were dying that is the best way I could describe them  The last night we were there we decided it would be best to put the queen mattress in my room since it got the most light from the outside light and moon and we would all sleep there  I was in the middle my mom to the left my aunt to the right  My aunt being the prankster she is kept knocking on the floor to scare me  Finally my mom reached over and slapped her and told her to stop because it was scaring me  A few seconds later she did it againMom Gumby knock it the fuck off youre scaring herGumbyIts not meNo sooner did she say that and my water glass started to move across the floor towards the hallway  We looked down the hallway and saw this figure at the end of the hallway where it meets the kitchen kneeling down and pounding on the floor  It was pounding so hard that you could feel the vibrations in the bedroom  The figure also sounded like it was wailing  A shrill cry of sorrow and despair is the best way I can describe it  We slammed the bedroom door shut and locked it  My mom grabbed her cross on her neck and just held us all close until the pounding stopped  I dont know when it stopped I was being clutched so tight the only thing I could hear was my moms heart beat until I fell asleepThe next day we were gone at the crack of dawn to our new place  We had left so many things in that house we were too scared to go back in let alone possibly bring something with usTo this day I still remember everything pretty clear for the most part  There are a few things I have forgotten but that is to be expected after almost  years  Whenever I am back home I like to cruise up to Blairstown and drive by the house  I still get the creepy vibe but then again thats the whole town  After doing some research my mom found that the town was once known for devil worshiping  Makes sense as to why my cross looked like it was dying and there was bat poo all by a red hot door that led no where  Id definitely like to go back in one day just to see how things are  Id also one day like to go to the library there and do some more research on the town and that houseOh and to this day I am still afraid to pick up broken glass for fear of seeing that face again,The house on Lake street,175
OdysseyTheCrip,40,37,1r4dm5,122,Fuck meI was told to come here by a friend of mine having never heard of nosleep personally Im not really on board with the idea of having a community of people read my story for personal pleasure but hey what ever I guess a little bit of back story is needed here I live on the nice end of Vancouver city with my grandmother Im in secondary school and that school is in my general poshish neighborhood   days ago I was Getting home from a longass boring day at school I decided to Fuck around on DayZ until either I died or fell asleep at the keyboard At around  my Dog Buddy Decided to be the most annoying little shit possible So i turned my computer off and put the little fuckers leash on At this time of night the whole block was lights out I Could barely see  feet minutes of walking later I began to feel a bit paranoid street lights were flickering fog was getting thicker Buddy on the other hand was  trotting along rubbing his little schnauzer face in the frosted grass Then he stopped Dead in his tracks then buried his head in my calves I urged him to keep moving and after much encouragement he reluctantly followedI rounded a corner going back toward my place when i spotted a figure in the fog a big one Thinking nothing of the fact just someone else enjoying the fucking weather or something As we got closer buddy started barking crazily I urged him to shut up lest he wake the neighbors Then I got a good look at the figure It was a man  about pale He had a brown tweed waist coat a brown tweed fedora and some brown baggy suit pants As we neared him Buddy grew more and more franticThats when I noticed his smile The scariest fucking smile you will ever see He looked like he won the lottery got laid and inherited a mansion within a period of  minutes It stretched from ear to ear a yellowed fake smileGod i wish i could have unseen itI was within about  feet of him then the smell hit me It was a mix between pure decay shit aged cheese Then he stopped right in front of me and said in the most strange voice like an elderly man trying to be smoothYou have a cute dog there boyUh yeah thanksI guess something in my voice must have pleased him or something cause he chuckled a sick smokers laugh I began to move away from him breaking eye contact Looking back on it I should have just fucking ranHe grabbed my armDo you want to see my dogI looked down and i realized he had a leash too He yanked on it and trailing blood Came the corpse of a maggot riddled dogI threw up in my mouth This thing that was once a dog was missing patches of white fur its skin was turning green bits of skin were missing its ear was ripped and an eye was gone I couldnt even tell what the dogs fucking breed wasThrough his smiling teeth he saidPet the dogMy dog was oddly quite this whole timei missed his barkingI tried to get away he tightened his grip on my arm then he dug his finger nails into mePet the dogPlease No was all that came out of my mouthHis smile drained instantly Into an angry twisted frown teeth still showing PET THE FUCKING DOG He screamed yellow spittle flying from his mouth my arm was turning red from the irritation his brown fingernails were causing meI had no choice but to pet the dog I reached down slowly and ran my free hand along its back The fur and skin began to peel back as maggots crawled along my palm My hand was covered in a clear slimy film He let go of my arm then shoved me I landed flat on my ass on the pavement Then i took off running My dog was sprinting along with me Then i heard him laugh then screamNOW I WANT TO PET YOUR DOGMy blood went coldI heard pounding on the pavement behind me and a dragging He was coming after me pulling his dog along with him Running  straight blocks i ran down my alleyway my house was at the end of the block I flew down the alley still hearing his laughter and slamming footsteps behind me I got to my house ran up the stairs and fumbled for my house keys As His laughter grew in volume to an unbearable height i got the door open shoved my dog in then slammed it and locked it not even a full second after I locked the door there was a slam on it He had ran into the door This slamming continued for  minutes and then silence I waited  minutes then called the cops in less than  minutes they were here I told them exactly that what happened they told me theyd

horriddaydream,11,41,1r68c5,117,My father always taught me to be kind to everyoneThere was this garbage dump close to my home I cant say anybody got a thrill out of living closely to the wretched thing for it stunk all to Hell and the trucks constantly entering and exiting could be an extreme annoyance I walked on the outskirts of town frequently past midnight which you may say is stupid especially if you saw my build and how small of a person I am and just how difficult it would be for me to protect myself from anyone A few times as I passed by the alwaysopened gates of the dump I also passed the man who would enter their limits every single nightAs shady as he was he had a lot to sayHis name was Terrance and he had been staying in the dump at night ever since it had opened back in  He had long straggly hair and he claimed that this area was just too dry the job shortage was unbelievable He would probably never have his own house I felt the upmost of pity for him and sometimes I even welcomed him to walk with me Everybody always seemed to know Terrance He was like the friendly neighborhood hobo They would nod to him wave give him a few dollars thank me for being so kind to him even though I would shrug it off and whisper that he was simply good company I asked him where he went during the day and he just said everywhere He had a huge black satchel that he slung over his back that probably contained normal homeless materials like paper towels maybe a few little scraps of food It always smelled but he smelled in general though I was too nice to say anything He claimed that there was a hollowedout truck near the far side of the garbage dump and he would stay there at night because it was warm and it was shelter It made me want to cry just the situation that this poor man was inI lived with only my father and so on occasion I would invite Terrance home to have a warm meal and my father was more than happy about this He was a kind man as I was a kind young adult and he completely understood that my heart was in the right place Terrance knew everything about our family in only a short amount of time and he never once took advantage of us He was just a man who had no direction after losing his wayTerrance disappeared for a couple of days I peered in through the gates of the garbage dump thinking twice about entering I walked to the back and noticed that there was nobody inside the shell of the truck that he had described to me a many of times But as I peeked inside the windows I saw many black satchels just like the one that Terrance was always carrying Most of them were empty but others were still shut tightly and looked full I reported the sceneThe cops had found small children of all shapes sizes ages and genders inside the bags He had been living off of them for years There was a lack of missing children in the area though some were found to be local Nobody knew where they had all come fromHe had been inside our house He had been inside my headNow he was nowhere to be foundFollow httpswwwfacebookcomDaydreamPublishing,Black Satchels,158
Magnum,32,58,1r5par,109,Born in the mid s i grew up active and was outdoors alot However as the technological age began I found myself inside more and more As I grew i spent more and more time watching TV playing videogames on my Super Nintendo And when the Sony Playstation came out my parents couldnt pry me from the screen As a consequence my eyesight suffered Slowly at first but as i got older it became an issue It was never so bad that I couldnt see without glasses but it was bad enough that i needed them to drive when i turned  However as senior in high school i quickly lost my glasses and proceeded to drive anyways No wrecks no tickets I thought that maybe my eyesight had improved over the few months that i had actually worn my glasses Oh how I wish I had been right Halfway between being  and  i picked up a job as a delivery driver Easy at first Until i had to start driving at night The night I almost ran off the road because I couldnt see through the oncoming cars headlights was the night I knew I had to get a new pair of glasses The next day I made an appointment and    business days later i had my new glasses Nothing special Just a simple blue metal frame with slightly skinnier than average lenses I Wore them all day And whenever someone asked how it felt to have new glasses i smiled and would comically sing Its a whole new world you know that cute little song from The Little Mermaid Oh how right i was As I prepared for bed that night getting changed taking a shower It all seemed normal Until I wore my glasses into my darkened bedroom No light was on in my room And i had foolishly turned off the hallway light before entering my bedroom Now in total darkness I realized just what real fear was You see with my slightly blurred vision of not wearing glasses any shadow could be brushed off simply because i couldnt focus and see what was just beyond the outer veil of darkness that covered them But now with those infernal glasses I could see them clear as day The creatures from monster stories My own personal Boogiemen All sitting around my room watching waiting inviting me to lay down and fall asleep right in their midst Right in my own bed I stood stunned Terrified Not Knowing what to do When suddenly one of them spoke The most terrifying voice I had ever heard Why not run away again child It amuses us to watch you at night oblivious to our very existence Unaware that you lay right where we want you Each and every night I stared blankly and felt confused Again How could i have seen these creatures before and not remember it Surely I would have some memory But none came As if to answer my question it spoke again Perhaps these will jog your memory It brought up its gnarled hand and unclenched its fist palm up to reveal my original pair of glasses A pair now almost three years old Thats when it hit me I hadnt lost my glasses But thrown them away Into a river Nearly twenty miles from where i lived Now more afraid than anything I did the only thing I could I laid down in my bed Removed my glasses and watched as those terrible Boogiemen again returned into those empty featureless shadows that surround each and every one of us every night as we lay down to sleep,Glasses,167
mrmappy,9,35,1r4x0l,91,I always listen to music as I sleep Before I go to bed I turn on my laptop by my bedside table run any pending downloads I still have open Banshee my music player press play and leave it as I drift off to sleep At times I would wake up groggy and sensitive to the sound so I would stop the music and go back to sleep Two nights ago however what I woke up to was not music Instead it was the voice of my mother Telling me something with the sweetest motherly voice I have long been familiar with  Mom already passed away For almost four years now  Was I afraid if hearing her voice Of course not Everyone at home longed to hear her again Everyone at home longed so much to see her again I missed that sweet voice and boy was I happy to be able to hear that again Of course I understand that it was just a dream A dream in the most familiar of environments with the voice of your late mother talking to you Im happy for just that  What she told me in that dream though did make me scared Her words though in the most caring and motherly of voices were  Hi honey Ill see you real soon okayIm not really sure if it was really just a dream,Mother,126
MikeyDeez,18,27,1r2k1v,97,So Ill admit it I kind of gave up on you guysI used to be on NoSleep every day Id be sitting at work refreshing the page and hoping for another Flawless Frank The Fallen Angelbut when the Boothworld Industriesfiascowent down I checked out If you were an ex girlfriend youd be snickering and telling your friends Ive come crawling back begging for your help Id be embarrassed but I havent felt much in the past few days I dont care anymore I just need to tell this to somebody I need to feel like a person again Have you ever wondered if there was anything more out there I mean literally out there above the sky  Have you ever just stared at the stars and wished that youd some day get to see the Galaxy like it was a Star Wars or Mass Effect civilization I was no naive for the yearning I used to feel Now Im the dog who actually caught the carI have no idea what to do with itand I couldnt laugh if I triedSunday night maybe amI had just shut down my computer after my nightly gaming session  I was laying in bed browsing reddit on my phone and debating whether or not I was hungry enough to eat another can of spaghettios or if it would even be worth the trouble of walking downstairs and waiting for it to heat up Im not sure what made me notice it what actually snapped my senses to the realizationbut it was suddenly too quietGranted it was am so its not like I was expecting any sort of noise in particular  My roommate had fallen asleep hours ago but it was just so still  Im not sure if any of you know what Im talking about but it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up  I felt like I was in a vacuum it was utterly oppressive Im not sure how long I sat there waiting for something before the glow  A deep blood red light had flooded the hall and oozed under my door and it was slowly pulsing  I wanted to call out to tell my roommate to fuck off but I knew it wasnt him I just knew I dont think I couldve formed words if I tried  The vacuum sensation I had felt was gone and now sitting in my tiny bedroom I felt like I was under a microscope That terrible like youre being watched sensation I read about so much hit me like a brick  I cant explain how exactly I felt a mix of horror dread and confusion  I wanted to bolt but I wouldnt have been able to force myself to open that door if I triedI managed to shuffle off my bed and to the floor  I opened up my nightstand reaching for my revolver I needed to feel that cold steel and the heft of it in my hand As soon as I picked it up I was at a loss because for the first time it just felt like a toy in my hand I looked back to the door to that glow and felt completely powerless  There was a shadow now someone was standing outside my bedroom door and I felt like I might as well have been holding a nerf gun  When the long scratch started I felt nauseous  Like I was  again smoking weed in my room when I thought I had the house to myself and my mom knocked on the door asking why the fuck it smelled like burning leaves in the hall That sudden weight in my stomach the sudden dryness in my mouthIt was like a nail being dragged down the door from the top of the doorway to the bottom  I followed the sound with my eyes and when it stopped I heard a voice  Hear might not be the right word because it came from inside my headMichael Please put down the weapon  We do not want to harm you and I do not plan on doing so Your weapon would be useless anyways but I respect your autonomy May I enterThis had to be a dream a nightmare If every waking moment since Iheard that voice hasnt been an eternity in a waking hell I might be able to convince myself that it wasI wish to speak with you Michael We have much to discuss May I enterThere was no fucking way this was happening  Imlucky I didnt need to because I couldnt have spoken if I tried  Whatever it was must have known there was no way I would have let it in because it answered me anywaysNo matter you will see us in due time  We would like to invite you on a journey Michael  You will come with us and see everything you have always wished to Weve known you for a long time you would say years  You have a week to decide we will not force you You will require no luggage no currency You will want for nothing  You will not see your family or friends again but in time you will cease to worry about them   We respect your decisions I do think however you only have one real choice  I will see you soonThen it was all just overI might have sat there for hours At some point I got up and sat on my bed  When I finally mustered the courage to look out the window it was already dawn When I heard my roommate get up and go to work and finally figured it was safe to open my doorI am a shell  I dont know what to do you guys  I havent slept I forced myself to eat something yesterday but everything tastes of cardboard  I booted up my computer but now my life just feels like a game Im sick of I forced myself to talk to my parents the other day and smile at work but any interaction I have feels forced and artificiallike Im just going through the motions There was no way I could mention what happened Sunday night to anyone He was rightI have only have one choice  If I dont go with himwith them Ill be trapped in this empty hell My life feels like a hamster in a cageWho the fuck knows what will happen if I do go with them  I cannot sleep ,Invitation,124

lynzo,10,42,1r79t5,82,Through years of failed attempts to have my own kids I yearned for children of my own well used to I would travel for hours just to babysit my nephews while Helen my sister goes for their fortnightly romantic dinners to keep the flames of passion going in her wordsPlaygrounds and parks were my favourite hunts Toddlers old enough to walk would sometimes totter their way to the bench Im sitting on just to smile at me Young children would come up to me and play pretend with me Its quite a strange phenomenon but without my trying to children takes a liking to me Of course Id gotten strange looks from parents as though I dangled a carrot in front of their childrens noses to lure them to me There were carrots but just not frI met my BF now husband some years ago In the beginning stages of courtship he would just look at me and smile and I just thought he was just smitten with me It was only some months into our relationship that I found out he could see spirits His childhood was shaky when he first realised no one else saw the paler beings He had since gotten used to them as they would either wander aimlessly or just stay rooted to a spot Apart from seemingly looking at him they dont try to communicate with himOne day a few months after finding out about his ability he told me he has something to tell me For one he isnt the secretive or romantic type so I guessed it wasnt to propose He held my hands and looked at me straight in the eye and said Umm How should I put this After a few false starts impatient me started losing my cool and he finally got it out in the crudest way he could put it I know I deserved it You have three little ones following you since the day I met you and thats the reason why I looked your way and smiled at you Ive been wondering but why are they following youHe went on with a matteroffactly tone to explain that the children at the playground were not approaching me but the little ones following me and that the little ones arent like the usual spirits he have seen but are much smaller thus the name little ones Despite it being a hot day the chills and the cold in my chest made the weather more bearableBefore this I had a failed relationship with a man who loves children as much as I did but just upped and left the day after I was discharged from the hospital for my third miscarriage,Children loves to play with me,124
DeviousPigeon,27,24,1r1o1m,77,Help meI dont exactly know where to turn like the majority of the sub Im assuming you share the same interest as me in the supernatural the other side Ive always been intensely fascinated with it usually the furthest I went was browsing rnosleep or heading into abandoned houses to sate my thirst for the creepy although the same routine things quickly became dull and eventually I slowly got desensitized bored This was about the time I started reading recipes for paranormal experiencesThe whole thing seemed awesome the Midnight Man One Man Hide and Seek The Shoebox Telephone All gave me chills but I remained quietly skeptical the whole time Fuck Why did I have to be so blind I still cant find the place to blame myself I mean reading scary stories on the internet posted by a bunch of anonymous people it would be stupid to take it all for fact rightOf all the rituals one caught my eye The Three Kings Im hesitant to post the link but I feel like it would be naive to think that no one would give it a quick search httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentswboupleasedontactuallytrythis A blunt explanation of it would be a recipe where you can contact the dead and ask them questions through two propped up mirrorsAfter reading it I felt like I had to do it I quickly spread it to a few friends and it wasnt long until hype was built upon the whole thing Me and my best mate For his sake ill call him Darcy organized to do this when we had a few friends over for a small gathering whilst my parents were out for the week Funny enough at the time the thing I was worried the most about was it not working We had tried a ouija board once at my request and nothing happened we all just sat there fingers on the cup for  minutes blaming each other for pushing it whenever it moved in the slightest They all probably thought I was an idiot So I thought I would give it a kick my bright idea would be that we would all get absolutely hammered beforehand so that when it surely didnt work we would imagine that it did or at least get really scared in the process Well at least we had the really scared part down patSo everyone came at around pm yesterday and it was all pretty normal caught up bitched about a few people had some laughs and it wasnt until around pm that we started to set up The atmosphere then was so amusing of all things We all giggled the whole time in our stupor acting as if we were kids in primary school kids about to pull a really lame prank It all seemed fun then Of course I had to be the one who volunteered to be the one who sat the throne eager to show my courage off to my friends My lifeline was Darcy if anyone was to hold the key between my life and death id gladly hand it to himFor the sake of the story Ill skip all the tedious setting up and get to am We were all fighting sleep by then and I think Sarah and Alistair were already gone though we were sitting outside that door for so long it was hard for us to miss the time When I had walked in I was immediately hit by the cool air though this one wasnt the ghostly cold it was literally fucking freezing from the fan that had been buzzing on for a few hours Though something did feel off it was either the fact that I was in a pitch black room holding a candle to my chest with a chair and two mirrors propped up adjacent to it or it was that all of a sudden everything was quite As if the world around me was devoid of life bar the constant drone of the fan I sat down clutching the candle tightly persistent to not let it go out suddenly very aware to what i was doing I remember shifting in my chair uncomfortably for a while but what follows that still remains hazy I remember trying to call out for answers Whos there What are you doing Is there another side None were answered just silence and the buzzing of the fan I then said something stupid and heard giggling assuming it was my friends outside I started cracking jokes The more jokes I made the harder they laughed until I said Why arnt you responding too scared to show your faces and looked into the mirrors Now the huge cardinal rules of this recipe is not to look in the mirrors and around about this whole thing turned to fucking shit The worst thing about looking into the mirrors isnt what I saw but rather the absence of it I saw nothing i saw the chair the fan but no me I quickly looked to the other and greeted by the same emptiness Then the rumbling began have you ever been in a house when a plane has flown overhead and the ground slightly shakes It was like that except the sound emanated from the floor rather than the sky It continued to get louder and louder until my eardrums felt as if they were going to burst and then I peed myself The mirrors shattered and sent shards of glass everywhere and my candle was quickly snuffed out and I screamed boy did I scream I legged it out of there like nobodies business and slammed the door behind me Of course everyone was fast asleep but woken up with a few of my screams and sharp kicks to the ribs They attempted to calm me down but i was flailing and screaming I told them we had to get out of my house but where do seven  year olds go at  am in the morning Eventually I calmed down and tried to pass it off as a drunk hallucination which i knew was very impossible but it made my mind sort of at ease We decided to get everyone up and camp downstairs in the living room I felt safer with all of them around me and after much apprehension my tired state got the better of me and I drifted off to sleep Last night was some of the worst nightmares i ever had I saw my friends hanging and mutilated I saw my childhood cat lay gutted on the floor I saw myself smiling at a mirror When i woke up i was upstairs in the room In between both mirrors which had been shifted to face me lying on the floor All my friends had left when i called them they all gave me half ass reasons and some just avoided the question altogether Im scared It is now  and starting to get dark again and I havent been into the room since I woke up this morning Help me please I dont feel alone in my house anymore,Please help I screwed up,101
ephique,27,22,1r5tqd,82,Me and my brother were spending some quality time playing old video games from our childhood just chilling on the couch in my upstairs bedroom when the electricity in the entire house went out It was just us two home at this point and it was pitch black outside In desperation of finding our way through the house we used our phones to take flashshots giving us a small update of where in the big upstairs level of the house we were trying to make our way to the staircase leading downWe finally did and from there it wasnt ridiculously hard to manage ourselves to find some candles and what not We did what we could to drain out the time while waiting out the electricityproblem Eating sausage rolls gossiping and having conversations about what games to play once the electricity was backIt did come back after a couple of hours We already found ourselves in the kitchen positioned in the lower level of the house so we brought some snacks and drinks before we inevitably decided to continue our journeys into Donkey Kong Country Super Mario World and Castlevania  on the Super NintendoUpon starting our Super Nintendo my brother asked me where the remote for the tv was since we both were too lazy to actually use the power button on the tv Although the remote was nowhere to be found While looking for the remote which we both swore has never been anywhere else than on the coffeetable next to the couch the electricity ran out againMy brother expressed as he sighed Oh come on are you kidding me Being slightly more prepared the second time we picked up our phones and started taking flashshots again After a couple of shots the memory on my phone ran out I never thought we had taken that many pictures Either way I entered my image library on my phone to delete the old photos from the first time the electricity went out I took a good look at the first picture I opened it was my brother walking ahead of me just before we reached the stairs There was a man standing just next to him in the picture,Where is the remote,104
BensonHedges,4,19,1r2xlz,79,I heard the coffee pot drip before my alarm even went off bizarre I dont usually set a timer I like to go to the gym before I have my coffee Maybe it was my boyfriend being nice He typically works the graveyard shift and sometimes he comes home in the early morning to leave nice surprises Might as well get up I said aloud to myself since no one else was home My cat was absent from the bed which is also weird hes usually by my head in the mornings As I stretch my legs and arms out I notice an odd chill run up my spine Surely it was the weather New England has a way with inconsistent temperatures and the blanket over me was not quite fit for winter Its November that sixtydegree weather is bound to disappear sooner or later I havent quite figured out the thermostat we just moved in and the heat only seems to kick in on times when Im not home Must be the reason we bought this place so cheapand why people keep selling it New England is not the place to have a busted heating system This has been the biggest point of arguments since my boyfriend and I started cohabitating Get out of bed youre going to be late to your class I said this to myself a few times in hopes to have motivation to get to the am class at the gym I had no idea what time it was but if the coffee pot is going off it was creeping close to sunrise I havent unpacked the alarm clocks yet so my phones been the only thing reminding me what time of the day it is I thrusted my arms to the floor and pulled my phone to my bed   am What the fuck Ive still got twoandahalf hours of sleepand why is the coffee pot onI slipped out of the bed from the left side and stumble to the kitchen to turn off the coffee pot Im a coffee lover but nothing smells worse than burntcoffee As I went to flip the switch to off I realize the time isnt illuminated on the pot Directly above on the microwave  nothing Damnit The power went out The dripsound of the coffee pot was so loud and it was too early I was confused I could even smell the lingering scent of fresh brewed coffeebut it was am my mind must be playing tricks on me I headed back to the bedroom a little freaked out but convinced it was just all a coincidence This hallway seems so much longer in the dark and I still havent gotten used to the layout of this condo As I pass the bathroom I notice a shadow out of the corner of my eye I turned my head and didnt see anything except the shower curtain pulled all the way open Since weve moved in we havent used that showerweve got a shower stall in the bedroommuch more convenient Though I am sure there was a logical explanation for it When I get to the bedroom  another chill down my spine This was uncomfortable it was a winter chill I was feeling I was sure of that Something was wrong but i couldnt figure it out I need to go back to bedI hop in the bed and pick the blankets from off the floor As I turn on my side I hear the heater click on The electricity is back onfantastic I start counting sheep in my head to fall back asleep and keep thinkinghow did the blankets end up on the floorWhat feels like an hour later my alarm finally goes off The smell of burnt coffee has filled the condo and now Im frustrated I should have just unplugged the damn thing And where is my cat I have most definitely woken up on the wrong side of the bed I moved to the kitchen to pour some coffee  and its dry Nothing I must be imagining things That chill again I could feel the hairs spike up on my neck  absolutely razor sharp I decided to skip the gym and start my morning I remained timid but continued with my normal routine As I rummaged around the kitchen I noticed my cat out of the corner of my eye He was twitchy and obviously anxious A few years ago my cat had major anxiety problems and he developed what my vet called  Rolling Skin Syndrome When my cat got anxious his skin would roll around his body it looked almost as if he had a small gum ball moving around beneath his fur Today that ball was most definitely movingHe paced back and forth around the house with me now seeming more comfortable now that I was up with him Every time I moved to another room he cautiously peeked around the corner almost as if he was looking for something We moved to the bathroom I started to floss and then I heard itdrip drip drip I am sure its not the coffee pot and the house starts to smell again As I analyze my senses the smell become more pungent Less of a coffee smell and more of a rancid scent Drip drip dripI follow the noise it seems louder now and it seems like its coming from the bedroom Surely I would have heard it loud and clear when I was in bed earlierit seemed so distant then I enter the bedroom and my cat stopped dead in his tracks His skin is rolling again and he appeared more on edge tail straight in the air and its hairs following suit And that chill of course it was back And my sheets and blankets on the floor againWHAT THE FUCK Im working from home today and every time I walk by the bedroom I get the chills Ive resorted to closing the door until Im not alone It sounds like the wind is blowing up against the windows in that room

CDC,14,28,1qwsx4,79, I always hated going outside after dark Night casts a natural shroud around my home what is familiar during the day becomes a mystery to me at night Its a mystery I have no intention of solving Those were my thoughts as a child At  years old Im suppose to be over my fear of the dark but the darkness fills me with dread As far back as I can recall going outside alone after dark has scared me As a child I had a ritual If for any reason I had to walk outside after dark I was not allowed to turn around and look behind me  There was no rhyme or reason for it I just had this very real sense this feeling that if I turned around someone would be standing there waiting for me to see them The feeling was almost a taunt as though some force was daring me to turn around but I couldnt seem to bring myself to do it At around  years of age I had been dealing with this problem for quite some time Be that as it may my absent minded ways got the better of me and all to often I would leave my bookbag in the car after school After dinner it was homework time and I inevitably would have to go outside to fetch my books My mom drove a Cutlass but we also lived with my grandparents and my grandfather had a rather large GMC van It was fun to take camping which we did often The van was parked parallel to my moms car in the driveway On the nights that I would leave my bookbag in the car it was same system every time Walk straight to the car open door grab bookbag spin around look directly at front door walk straight inside never look back on the way inside Never  One night everything changed Ill never forget that night My grandmother had made fried chicken for dinner and it was an especially cold night so I put on my blue coat to go out to the car I loved that jacket though I was beginning to grow out of it My arms stuck too far out of the sleeves and it was beginning to look ridiculous on me  Such is life I suppose People outgrow things and they replace them Although I could feel the brick in my stomach in regards to having to go outside after dark it was a brick that had been laid long ago and was generally regarded as a familiar fixture That night I walked out the front door walked to the car opened the car door leaned in grabbed my bookbag spun around saw the front door in the distance maybe  feet and I began walking slower than usual Im too old to be doing this anymore I told myslef out loud I stopped walking I stared at my front door for a while longerFuck it I told myself for perhaps the first time ever  I slowly turned my head and my body followed Turning I saw my moms car about  feet away from me I spun all the way around and looked directly at my moms car Same as it always was No different Nothing I raised my head ever so slightly and caught view of my Grandfathers van beside my mothers car I didnt notice it at first I stared for probably  whole seconds before we locked eyes Peering at me from behind the van were two eyes two unfamiliar eyes The eyes were connected to a face that seemed to be grinning at me ear to ear For a moment I stood frozen eyes locked on the man behind the van His smile seemed to get wider the longer I stared All I could see of the man was his face partially obscured by the blanket of night and his right hand planted firmly on the back door of the van I couldnt tell you how long the staring match lasted It felt like an hour though it was probably more like  seconds There was a taunt in his expression a dare Was he daring me to come closer To Turn back around and walk toward the door I felt there was nothing I could do but continue this stand off until his head slowly pulled back behind the van and he was gone I walked back into the house backward never taking my eyes off that spot on the van Somehow I managed to make it back inside without falling Good memory I suppose Today Im  I still have to go out to the car after dark somtimes but I never dare to look back I know hes there watching waiting He wants me to know hes there he wants me to see him Hell never leave me The winter is coming and Ill need to start wearing a jacket soon I bought a nice heavy one about  years ago Kind of old I know but it does the trick and this one fits me just fine ,Hes still there,107

Shanbo,12,18,1qurwo,63,My room is in the attic Its nothing special has a nice Velux window loads of music and gaming equipment and a nice big double bed I love to leave my window open a crack when its warm during the Summer but here in Ireland its now getting into the deep part of Winter so I always keep it closed Thing about Winter is that sound carries better at night Living in the suburbs I can hear every drunken scuffle and argument in the wee hoursA few months ago I started hearing these footsteps at night like highheeled shoes Itd be at about  in the morning Id hear them start out of the blue Theyd fade in from one end of my road and keep going as if they were just walking forever Id hear them go past my house but then get caught in a sort of limbo and never get any quieter Then after about  minutes my road is only  houses long theyd fade out againThey usually keep going Not anymore Now I hear them every night I hear them fade in I hear the steps walking until they get to right outside my house Then they stop My windows are on the back facing side of the attic so I cant look out to see whats going on without going downstairs and waking the house up But I know shes out there I hear the high heels clop down the road every night and stop outside my house I know shes out there,They usually keep going,81
JohnFrostNeruda,6,15,1quu9h,60,Strange things used to happen in my childhood home The house that I lived in was ancient almost a hundred years old Its only reasonable that a couple of people could have died in it right  Over the course of ninetysix years five people died in that house I did research on all of themBecause I saw all of themEvery single night the house would force the souls to replay their deaths  I noticed this when I was fifteen yes it took awhile  I was up to get a midnight snack when I saw James Gunderson in the kitchen with his greasy haircut his leather jacket and denim jeans  He was vomiting uncontrollably and then he passed out choking on his own filth  His spirit was gone the next morning  You would think I was scared out of my mind but I was more perplexed  I looked up James Gunderson and found that he died of alcohol poisoning after coming home from a party in   He was sixteen I never touched alcohol after watching his deathJames Gunderson was there again the next night and he had company  Alice Williams was chasing a dog down the stairs when she slipped and fell She was such a cute girl too with blond curls and deep nutbrown eyes  She wouldve been a heart breaker Her head struck the edge of the fifth step  I would then see her mom run screaming down the stairs to find her five your old daughter spasm uncontrollably as the family dog lapped up poor Alices blood That was a sad case But you should never leave your toys on the stairsJack Saline was an elderly man who slowly passed away in his room which my mom turned into a guest bedroom  I remember enjoying watching his death It was somewhat serene Mr Saline would gaze out the window as a spectral beam of sunlight would hit his face He smiled and then closed his eyes for eternity His body would shake with a death rattle and then he would fade out Until the next night of courseThe fourth death was strange because I never could figure out who it was A man was in the basement I heard him thumping around one night and went to investigate The mans face was sweaty and his face was stained with anxiety He got up to pace around when he looked up at the top of the basement steps Our eyes met and I saw years of wear and tear on the mans face  He nodded his head like he knew me and then he walked out of site into a dark basement room leaving his cause of death unknownThe next person to die in my house was my sister  She was never right in the head and we seldom spoke to each other  She was the eldest of my parents children and yet it seemed like she was forgotten She hung herself on the ceiling fan in her room  I remember my mother and my two other sisters being devastated but my father and I were largely indifferent He always had trouble finding feelings for others and I was a regular chip off the old block  The night after her funeral I watched Ellie grab a rope from the tool shed and tie it to one of the fan blades She hesitated a little bit when she put the noose over her neck and stepped on the chair Our eyes met and I saw a hint of fear in her eyes  She took a deep breath and jumped Her face got redder and redder and redder and she started tugging on the rope to set herself free but she was only making it worse She had second thoughts She didnt want to die like she thought she did This wrestled with me for a couple of days My parents decided it would be best to move and I agreed with themBefore we left I set the house on fire I didnt even think about it that much I just did it  I watched it burn and it was strangely comforting  I dont know if it had any effect but I like to think it did,Souls Rewinded,75
UnrealsKY,4,22,1quz7p,61, Part  Stupid bitch Die after workThose are the words that hung over me like a prophecy Im not sure exactly why normally Id dismiss such comments as someones emotions and sense of selfimportance getting the best of them But for some reason this time the words worked their way into the back of my mind like little tendrils Strangling all reason and perverting my perceptionIm getting ahead of myself I should explain a few things before sharing my experience I work at an answering service and about a year ago I worked third shift What this means is I answer phone calls for businesses from all over the country when they arent in or are otherwise unable to answer their phones I then take messages and either forward them to the office or dispatch them to people on call Third shift meant I was manning the phones pa by myself I was the sole person in the building from p to a most nights Now the majority of the calls we receive are people complaining about something They need a prescription called in their water heater is leaking or theyve locked themselves out of their apartment Something along those lines And people will often get upset when youre unable to help them This is usually expressed through yelling and cussing etcI want to share with you a series of calls I received one night around a and my experience afterwardsIt began with an older woman calling on a public housing property management account She had a southern accent The kind where the letter R has two syllables instead of one Like areuh Anyway I answered the line by saying our answer phrase for the particular accountThis is how I remember the call goingMe Thank you for calling blank Housing Authority This is UnrealskyHer Thank goodness yall answered I need help You have tosomethingShe was rushed out of breathe The end of her last sentence was unintelligible she was speaking so fast This isnt uncommon People tend to panic when their apartment is being flooded or something similar My job is to keep them on task gather their info and get someone out as soon as possibleMe The office is closed maam youve reached their answering service What is the reason for your callHer Im telling you its not workin Oh lord please help me please It took my boy I IShe had started sobbing now That last statement was kind of strange but I moved onMe What is not working maamHer Oh my god Oh my lord Im sorry Something Im sorry Oh my godHer voice trailed away as she moved away from the phone I then heard a familiar beeping on the line On this particular account the company has one of those buzzer boxes on the front entrance of the building where you can ring a particular apartment to be let in or you can press a certain option to get the office or security desk or whatever After hours choosing that option causes you to get the answering service  me  and we have no way of letting anyone in or anything like that Were in a completely different state And the line is timed so when that time is up the line will begin to beep notifying you that its about to be disconnectedAnd the line disconnectedThe call kind of rattled me People will act like anything is the end of the world but she sounded like she was actually in fear for her life Like she was in immediate danger I sat there a minute just looking at my screen as I pondered the idea of calling the security guy I mean I knew she was at the front of the building he could go check it out But before I got a chance to the same account popped up on one of my other lines I answered itMe Thank you for calling blank Housing Authority This is UnrealskyHer Let me inShe screamed this at the top of her lungsMe Maam Im at an offsite location I dont have the abiliShe interruptedHer God damn it Please let me in I cant something Oh god itsMe Maam MaamI tried to interrupt herHer Oh god Oh please Her voice trailed away from the phone again but came back Her pleading had morphed into anger nowHer You son of a bitch You dont let me in I swear boy IMe Maam I want to help you I cant let you in but I can contact securiAs I started the beeping started as well Right before the line disconnected she said those five words  yelled them actually  interrupting meHer Stupid bitch Die after workA chill went down my spine and my heart started racing There was so much hate in her voice It was terrifying Briefly paralyzed by fear and confusion I stared at the screen scrambling for what I should do Her voice and those words felt so powerful Finally my brain found its way back to reality and I quickly pulled up the number and called the security guy on his cell phone As it rang I tried to figure out a way to put what I just heard into wordsSecurity HelloHe sounded groggy I woke him upMe Hello this is Unrealsky with your answering service Ive got kind of a strange call for youSecurity  Yea What is itMe I just had two calls they both came in from the buzzer box on the front of the building It was a woman and she was kind of hysterical Sounded like she was in danger practically begging to be let into the buildingSecurity ShitI could hear him moving probably getting out of bedMe YeaI didnt know what else to saySecurity Probly some stupid crackheadMe Um I dont know It sounded legitimate to me I thought Id at least notify you in case you wanted to go check it outSecurity Alright Ill go check it outI started to say thank you but he hung up on me before I could get the words out He didnt sound very pleased to be woken up I didnt care thoughWhat she said echoed in my mind Stupid bitch Die after work I had done everything I could I did my part but I still felt antsy Uneasy Afraid I wasnt really worried for the womans safety It was just that her threat  no her curse  had freaked me the hell out It sounded unnatural Powerful Real That was when I realized that I had been sitting up straight in my seat the entire time had started to sweat pretty profusely and was bouncing my legs up and down like a maniac I had to laugh at myself Why was I letting something like this get to me Being concerned for her safety made sense but why was I so scared Why was I taking her emotionally charged but completely insubstantial curse so seriouslyI stood up from my seat and threw my headset on the desk I had to walk around Walk it off Forget about it I made my way out into the break room and grabbed my coffee cup from the cupboard As I was filling my cup with the fresh coffee I had just put on not long before I was playing the calls over in my head Trying to make sense of it allWhat did she mean by its not working and it took my boy And why did she say after work I mean I understand people get upset and will say anything when theyre mad but why after work Seems unnecessarily

catzzzzzz,7,31,1qstd2,52,Ive noticed a horrible smell coming from my neighbors house for the last few days He is a loner and I dont see him a lot but I was worried My friend ushelbels and I went over to check things out The front door was unlocked and I found a journal lying on the floor right inside the door My neighbor was lying on the floor in a pool of blood with a gun next to his hand I took the journal and read it I think he was truly disturbed and in need of help I went to the police of course but I am posting the contents of the journal here because while frightening they are also very interesting    October th  Last night I was woken at about  by a picture on my wall when it fell It seemed like it was darker than normal Without turning on the light I got out of bed and picked up the picture and hung it back up barely giving it a glance This morning though I gave it a second thought Its an old photo of my family at the beach taken on a vacation when I was about  Despite being taken over ten years ago I remember the vacation vividly My twin brother was tormenting me as much as always but the picture was one of the few where I actually looked as though as I was enjoying myself Its almost time for work now so I need to finish getting ready and stop reminiscing about the past I dont know if dreamed last night so nothing else to recordOctober th  A crash woke me up again the clock next to my bed said  AM The picture had fallen again I hung it up before going back to sleep After falling back asleep I dreamed about the family vacation My brother kept dunking me under the water I was afraid I would drown until my mom finally came to my rescueThe sad part is that it wasnt just a dream but more like a memory I havent seen my twin brother in years for good reason I should probably call mom later today I havent talked to her in weeksOctober th  This is starting to get a little creepy the picture fell again last night at  There must be some kind of animal living in the wall I will call animal control later today Instead of hanging it back up this time I just set it on my dresser I did not dream last nightOctober th  It wasnt an animal They came out and looked at the house there are no openings for anything to get in but I didnt believe animal control so I ripped out a panel of drywall and found nothing I have not been dreaming at all the last weekOctober st  Its again the picture fell off my dresser I cannot think of a reason why this would happen maybe my dresser has a tilt to it When I picked the picture up I stared at it for a few seconds I could almost swear I am turned more toward the ocean than I remember being Not to mention the fact that I look Im not really sure how to explain itthe smile I remember me having in the picture is more of a frown I am going back to sleep now but it just bothered me enough I felt like I had to write this down tonightIts morning now took another look at the picture nothing has changed I must have been halfawake last night when I thought I saw that stuff Though honestly the stuff with the picture is starting to creep me out I have it set on the floor now There is no way that it can fallOctober nd  I woke up to a sharp pain in my foot and found myself standing in the broken glass from the picture frame There was a little blood but not much if it continues bleeding I will go to the hospital I havent slept walked since I was a kid Im going to have to buy a new frame for the photo As I picked up the picture from remains of the frame I saw another change I am almost positive I have taken a few steps away from where I used to be I am behind my family I know that is not what the picture looked like before I decide to put off cleaning up the broken frame until the morning I stare at the picture studying it I doubt I will fall asleep tonightI fell asleep at some point last night and woke up with the picture underneath me It was exactly as I remembered it a little crinkled from me sleeping on it though I must have been imagining things again last night I would write it off as all a dream if it wasnt for the cut on my foot and the shattered frame on  my floor which I still have to clean up My birthday is coming up in a couple weeks we are supposed to be having a family dinner I am going to ask my mom if she has another copy of this photo Its one of my favorites from my childhood and I want an unblemished copyOctober th  I have continued to wake up at  every night I stopped looking at the picture I put it in a drawer But tonight I dreamed about it In my dream  year old me was moving backward slowly like some invisible force was dragging me toward the ocean The first thing I do in the morning is look at the photo Its still the same Always the same The five of us my mom and dad in the center with my dads arm around my moms shoulder Smiling the happiest of smiles My older sister next to my mom her head on her shoulder a half smile on her face and her hand on my brothers shoulder Then me and my twin next to my sister in one of the few moments where he wasnt trying to strangle me we almost look as if we want to be around each other All this on a beautiful beach with blue waves crashing in the background A picture perfect happy family I know this picture by heart It cant change its impossible I tried calling my mom she didnt answer My sister also didnt pick up her phone Ill try again tomorrowNovember st  I decided to look at the picture when I woke up tonight I pulled it out and was horrified Im in the water now up to my neck choking on a wave I immediately shoved it back in the drawer After a few minutes I reconsidered opened the drawer again and carefully placed it in an envelope further adding another layer between it and me I tried to call my mom again but its late Im not surprised she didnt answer My birthday is in two days We never came up with any solid plans but I always go home for dinner on the holidays so I will see everyone soon and maybe this will make more sense I havent been sleeping well since all of this startedI didnt sleep last night I spent most of it thinking I dont know when was the last time I talked to my family Or saw them for that matter I wonder if I did something to upset them I mean thats the only reason I can think of for them avoiding me Maybe it was that fight I got in with my brotherNovember nd  I managed to sleep for about  hours last night and I had a very disturbing dream I dreamt that my brother was laughing and eating me alive I think I might be going crazy I pulled the picture out at around midnight and it was normal Looking at it though I dont really look included in the family I dont think it represents the happy memory I want it to November rd  Todays my birthday I am about to drive to my parents house Im bringing the picture along to show them    I dont know who I am I dont know whats going on Are all my memories false am I crazy I am trying to calm down enough to write this outI arrived at my parents house a little after pm Dinner is always at  Their old black sedan was parked in the drive the same as always At the last second I hesitated and decided to leave the picture in the glove box I have gotten too obsessed with it and I dont want to scare my family And I can describe which one it is pretty easily anyway to see if my mom has another copyI went up to the door and rang the bell I havent had a key in a few years My mom opened the door and looked confused She asked what I wanted I told her I was there for dinner just like always she only looked more puzzled She said she had no idea who I was but she was very busy getting ready for her sons birthday dinner I thought she must be trying to play some kind of joke on me I reached for the screen door to open it She yelled out Stop sounding afraid I jumped back I realized she truly didnt know me I wondered if in the time since we last talked if she had had some kind of accident or started to develop early onset Alzheimers I was very worriedHaving heard my moms yell my brother appeared at the door behind her and asked what was going onTrying to cope with what was happening I started talking to her as if she was a child I told her I was her son I was born November   She told me she only has one son My twin brother was standing right behind her getting scared I yelled at him asking what was going on He responded that he had no idea who I was but November rd was his birthday and he did not have a twin Upon hearing this my mother began crying Through her tears she told my brother he did have a twin but he was underdeveloped and died at  AM the night they were bornAt this point I was terrified and confused As a last ditch effort to understand what was going on with my family and make them understand they were mistaken I told them to wait I had something to show them I frantically ran to the car and popped open the glove box I pulled out the envelope with the picture and ran back to the doorstep I told them it was a picture of our family at the beach around  years ago I slowly pulled out the photo and turned it over It was a picture of a happy family of four people I wasnt in the picture My mother and brother both gasped seeing that it was indeed a picture of them My mother then began to get angry and demanded I leave before she called the police because she thought I was trying play some sick prank on them I got in my car crying and came home Im still sitting here in shock not knowing what to do next I pull out the picture looking at it Im not in it How am I not in it I cannot accept this as the truth    I found the picture he was obsessed with Its actually kind of funny there is someone who looks a lot like me standing in the background,Family Photo,83
iwillneverbefree,8,18,1r1p8k,48,Im just your average everyday guy with a job I cook I clean I drink hell I even had a girlfriend before all this started going down If you saw me on the street youd walk right by me without a second glance Its just that I have a job Im a ParamedicI dont do anything important I just help those in need I started doing this because I didnt feel great about myself I always loved helping others and I always loved AampP so I saw this as a logical step I loved every second of it when I first started There was no greater high than when your adrenaline kicked in and your hands moved faster than your mind could think It was ecstasy This went on for  years Every day I fell more and more in love with my job My calling The only thing that bothered me was that overwhelming sense of being in a battle I thought it was normal afterall I was fighting for someone elses life I thought If only I knew how true that statement wasIt started off with a shadow when I walked onto a scene I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me Maybe it was my constant concern of someone attacking me God forbid I got shot while working I should have known something wasnt right when my partner looked in the same direction when I did I should have known better when he just shut down and barely spoke the rest of the night This went on for a while every so often seeing the shadow Things started to get worse however when the whispering startedAt first they were nonsensical Sometimes I wondered if they were even there at all if I was just going fucking nuts But they were They WERE there It only took me losing my first patient to hear them clear as day They were congratulating me They were telling me how great of a job I did I didnt understand then My mind had been turning on me it had to have been Its the stress Its the stress of losing someone I told myself on my way home I sat at home and hit the bottle Hoping that my next shift would be an easy one one quiet shiftIt wasnt quiet I should have known better than to use that word Its bad luck The voices didnt go away They only got louder Every patient I had I could hear them Its their time Shes ours now Let her rest I thought I was just compensating for losing someone I thought I was just preparing myself if I lost another one The more people I lost the more they got more sinister Youre almost ready I havent seen one this talented in eons You cant change fate Come join us I didnt understand right then but I understood it all soonIt was a  year old male His heart stopped I had to save this one he was just a child I HAD to save him We got him to the back of the ambulance and I started my work Things felt odd I felt as if I was in a daze My vision was blurry the lights seemed faint against the road I tried not to think about the voices I tried to block them out I did a damn good job until it screamed my nameJOHN I heard I stopped and slowly raised my head to look at the bench seat across from me It wasnt what you would expect death to be It wasnt a man in a robe with a scythe It was just a man in a suit with black eyes I froze I had to have been insane I needed to tell my partner to drop my off in the psych ward when we got to the hospital His smile was calming It was the kind of smile youd expect a great car salesman to have calming but also sinister His hair was well kept for a man his age Id have to say s or s His eyes like a void of everything that makes us human as if they were a black hole that sucked all feeling out of whatever had the poor misfortune of getting caught in their pathHavent you been listening John He said with a caring toneYou know what you must do You know who youll become Why are you fightingI started screaming at him Who are you What do you want Why have you been following meHe ignored all of my questions He simply put his hand to the child and started rubbing his headYou fought for so long John You know this is your fate How much more pain can you endureWhat are you talking about I yelled at him as the childs rhythm became worse and worseDont you understand John weve been with you since day one We are who you fight every day We are the ones who you ignore to do your job We are youI began to understandJohn you must know something He said looking at the monitor as it flatlined This will also be your fate You will die just like everyone else Theres nothing you can do about itDont you think I fucking know that I yelled grabbing the epinephrine out of my bagJOHN He yelled again knocking the epinephrine out of my handYou need to understand the forces that be When you die John you will become one of usThe fuck I will I said standing up but was forced back down by some unknown forceIts not something you can change John You have so much potential so much promise Weve been watching you from the day you were born and we are very very excited to meet youI stopped fighting I looked into his eyes and I felt something Something I wish I never would have felt I felt at peace It was if all the stress of saving a life was gone It was as if I didnt have to fight anymore It felt like I was being held by my mother again like all was right with the worldI sat there and placed my hand on the child I felt death pass through me I felt the coldness of the nothing reach my heart and sit there I understood now I understood why I am who I am It was as if everything made sense to meYou dont have to believe me Hell if I was you I wouldnt either All that I ask of you is that the next time you see an ambulance look closely for the man in the suit with black holes for eyes Maybe Ill see you too,I work with death,66
jinn,8,39,1qzm6d,48,Ok so Im not a writer so please excuse my mistakes and storytelling telling style Im not great at descriptions or anything like that so forgive me This actually happened in  I have a son who at the time was  years old when his father and I moved us into a small two bedroom house in an older part of the city I was telling him about the spooky things that happened  in that house and this is when he told me something new about our time thereFirst I have to describe the place When Lee and I went to look at it it was so adoreable on the outside It was painted white on a quiet street with a huge backyard It completed my ideal of a family home We were living in a basement suite at the time and I was tired of living in suites I wanted my own space and backyard This little house was within my budget It was a two bedroom the second bedroom being in the basement The first bedroom faced the street and to right of that small bedroom was a livingroomkitchen area and towards the back to the left a bathroom and across from  that to the otherside of the kitchen a stairwell into the basementThe very first night Lee left me and my son alone I dont remember why I just remember that I had this continuing nightmare throughout the night about something dark coming for us from the basement and it took its time I felt frozen in the front room and I struggled to get to the front door which was a few feet from where we slept At about sunrise I woke up finally The horror of the dream lingered but the sunrise eased my fears I made it away in my dream but after I woke up I still felt haunted That was the first nightLee and I got a dog We adopted one from the spca and he was already full grown He was named Sparky  my son named him Sparky was a lively gentle and smart dog He had something stuck in his paw but he never snapped at anyone who bumped it We only found it after we had taken him to the vet It was open and bleeding and we had to give him antibiotics for it and keep it cleaned but he never snapped or showed any discomfort The reason why Im going on about this is because when i tried to get him to come downstairs so he could sleep there instead of outside he growled when i pulled his collar and he knashed his teeth at meSo he had to sleep outside Lee worked until am because he was a cook and so it was me my son and Sparky each night except for weekends when my step kids came over to stay with us Anyways this dog would always bark at  at the back door I told that to Lee and the dog had to sleep outside after that because he was noisyLee had three other children Sally who was  Asher who was  and lily who was  months old Thats a different storysigh Our family was complicatedThe first thing I suspected something was wrong was the night I went to bed downstairs Lee was already under the covers and I was in my tshirt at the foot of the bed I felt this draft come from the floor up my legs under my shirt I got goosebumps all over me It couldve been a draft I know  A draft that went up and across me It was a basement afterallThe second thing that happened was in that basement bedroom again I woke up with the moon shining brightly through the small window above our bed I looked over at Lee and he had this grimace on his face and it changed his face his expression made him look like an older man plus ive never seen him make that face before I got chills and rolled over to face the wall and cringebut then i thought maybe he was having a nightmare so i turned back to see if he was ok his face was smooth and he looked like Lee again I dont know how I fell asleep but I didLife continued Lee and I were arguing in the basementwhen al of a sudden he went white and his knees buckledshit that scared me I grabbed him and put his arm around my shoulder and took him upstairsHis daughter would scream and cry when he tried to bring her down there I told him the second time she did that to stop bringing her down there I knew the house wasnt right I just had other more pressing things on my mindOk this is part is from my sons point of view It was a weekend i had the kids and it was a hot summer day Sally was feeling left out from the boys and so I told Asher to stay with my son while i went ot get ice cream with Sally I wanted to have some girl time and make her feel special and wanted because with the new babylily it was a rough transition to going from daddys girl to big sisterAnyways we get back and I knew something happened Both my boys were in the backyard and not arguing just serious and outside watering the lawn I asked Asher what happened I was thinking an accident of sorts He tells me there was a man in the basement A man with a green shirt My son collaborates with him on this and they are both looked very disturbed by this I asked him where he went and a white faced Asher says he didnt know he didnt come out The chills up my spine man I asked if the man talked to them tryed to come close to them or anything to make sure they hadnt been touched or anything and they said he didnt come close to them he just walked around downstairs thats when they ran outside and waited for me to get backThis last part is when my son told me just recently He said one night he and Sarah were awake in the bedroom  they all had to share that one room Asher and Sarah on one side Aer on the other bedIn the white light fixture it was one of the square white shallow dishes put over the light bulbs Anyways in the light fixture in the saw a woman in the kitchen moving around looking like she was cooking something but the could clearly see the kitchen and no one was in there and I guess Sally asked Aer if he saw it too He said no because he didnt want to say yes out loud he said he was too scaredhe said it was the middle of the night we were downstairsWe moved out shortly after For different reasons but that house without a doubt had something in it I tried to ask the neighbor next door but she said nothing ever happened there It looked so cute out on the outside,The cute little white house,87
UnrealsKY,1,34,1qxu2p,50,Sorry for the delay You know rules and all of that Part httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsquzpstupidbdieafterworkpart if you missed it Part   I started walking back into the call center from the break room when a thought occurred We have a voice logger that records every call that takes place on our system so I stopped at the supervisor station on the way back to my desk Maybe if I tried to figure out the pieces of what she said that I couldnt understand I could make some sense of it I pulled up the logger and searched for all the calls on the account in the last hour There were three The two from her and the one where I called security I clicked on the first one to start playing itMe Thank you for calling blank Housing Authority This is UnrealskyBut then where I should have heard her voice there was just this static It kind of waved in and out getting higher pitch at times but there was no woman Just staticMe The office is closed maam youve reached their answering service What is the reason for your callAnd then the same static again There was nothing besides my voice talking to and responding to this static I sounded crazy I set down the headphones I was using to listen to the call  What the hell is this and various other similar thoughts trampled through I tried to mitigate the wave of confusion and fear with some sort of reason Maybe theres just a problem with the call or the voice logger and it only recorded my side of the conversation Maybe it was because she was calling from that buzzer box Maybe it was just that callI picked up the headphones again and clicked on the second callMe Thank you for calling blank Housing Authority This is UnrealskySuddenly this painfully loud static screeched through the headphones causing me to drop them I could still hear it as they laid on the desk so I clicked stop on the call and just stared at the screen for a whileI reasoned that that had to be it then When they use that buzzer box to call in it has to cause some sort of problem with the way the lines are forwarded or something and for whatever reason the voice logger cant pick up the other end of the call It just comes through as static Its the only thing that made sense It was the only explanationDeciding to just forget about it I walked back to my desk and sat down A few calls came in on other accounts before I got another call on the housing authority account Nervously I answered itMe Thank you for calling blank Housing Authority This is UnrealskySecurity Hey man its security Just wanted to let you know there wasnt nobody out thereMe Oh um alrightAgain I didnt really know what to say On call people rarely check back with us about this sort of thingSecurity Was probly just some stupid kids out playin pranks tryin to scare people Fuckers spray painted your name on the front door in big red letters He laughed My heart raced and that chill came back My nameSecurity Probly thought you were goin to be the one to find it Heh idiotsI feigned a laughMe Yea people can be ridiculous sometimesSecurity Youre tellin me makin me get up in the middle of the nightMe Yea sorry about that she just soundedHe interrupted meSecurity No no its not your fault this town is full of idiots Bet youre as ready to get off of work as I am to get back to bedHe laughed again Whats with all the small talk They never do this especially not in the middle of the night Ready to get off work Whats it to this guy Whats going to happen when I get off work I feigned another laughMe Yea um you have no ideaSecurity Well you have a good night manMe Alright you too ByeMy adrenaline was pumping Ready to get off of work What the hell was that And my name spray painted on the door It had to just be kids They knew my name from how I answered the phone That made sense And their story wasnt even very good it didnt make any sense Its not working it took my boy Amateur Just some stupid kids trying to scare me Stupid kids and a line forwarding problem Nothing moreRegardless of my attempts to reason it away it all kind of lingered on the edge of my thoughts as I tried to collect myself and took a few calls on other accounts As the time passed I managed to push the subject further and further away but I just couldnt shake it entirely I felt uncomfortable and tense Despite being alone in the room I felt like somebody was watching me Like something was waiting for me When not on a call I paced looked out the windows repeatedly and drank my coffee Hidden in my little room counting the time until I was off work and I could see that this was all just some stupid kids playing a joke and nothing was going to happen I mean they were in a completely different state what were they going to do to meI drank so much coffee that night The rest of the night was really slow even for third shift Usually I would consider that a good thing but that night I hated it It felt like torture waiting and watching the clock I knew nothing was going to happen but that didnt matter Those words had a grip on meStupid bitch Die after workAt a I heard the door buzzer go off meaning someone had opened the back door Only employees know the code to get in but regardless it startled me The back door is in the break room and I could see the door into the break room from where I was sitting so I leaned back to peer through the little window It was the first shift supervisor early for her shift Despite knowing that was who it had to be I was relieved I dont know what else I would have expected We greeted each other as she entered the room and she offered that since she was there early and it was slow that she would just take over for me and I could go home Normally this would be something Id jump at but this time I was hesitant Suspicious I got a grip on reality though and took her up on the offer and thanked her I thought about telling her about the weird calls Id had but figured Id just end up sounding crazy Back in reality it was kind of embarrassing So I just left it aloneAnd thats really what Ive done with the whole thing for the past year Just left it alone Nothing ever came of it Obviously Im here writing this so I didnt die after work I realized it was just one of those things where something finds just the right spot in your brain in just the right circumstances to plant this little seed of fear   of some inexplicable unknown  that grows and grows gripping and strangling your thoughts until you find all the pieces Until you can explain away that unknown And that morning when I got off of work and nothing happened I was able to leave it all behindBut theres a reason I decided to type all of this out I still work at the same answering service though now Im a second shift supervisor and we still answer for that same housing authority One of my agents tonight received a call on that account and asked me to listen to it She said the person gave all of their information really quick and she wasnt able to get it all down before they just hung up on her So I pulled up our voice logger listened to the call and wrote down the information the caller had rambled off At the end of the call though my heart started thumping again The caller didnt hang up on my agent She was calling from the buzzer box I heard that familiar beeping again shortly before the line disconnectedThat means our voice logger works just fine recording the calls from that buzzer boxWho or what did I talk to that night,Stupid b Die after work Part ,84

MissMonstrosity,20,26,1r5z11,49,Hello everyone I told this story to a friend who told me I should post it here in Nosleep Im sorry for any grammatical errors or bad commentary Im not much of a writerAbout four years ago I was a troubled thirteen year old who like most teenagers didnt get along with my parentsIt was just me and my little Brother our Mother who spent more time on the computer then being a real Mother and our Step Father who in most cases acted more like a frat boy roommate then a parental figureAnyway this all started one day when my and my Mother got into an argument only god knows what it was about since we argued all the time  back then All I remember is that I stormed off taking a backpack of clothes and some food with me and ran into the woodsWe live on a huge property in the country and the woods go on for miles and miles in every direction with only a small creek running through it to break up the never ending amount of treesAlot of people might be freaked out by the ominous looking place but I loved it I went exploring out there everyday and I knew those woods like the back of my handI ran to the south west down a large hill that had the creek I mentioned earlier at the bottom of it the creek itself went on even farther than the woods cutting through several private properties and stopped just outside of a town over fourteen miles awayI decided Id follow to town where Id find somewhere to stay the nightWhy not just take the road to town well we lived in the country there were alot of crazy people out here drunks hillbillies prostitutes and a combination of all three I figured if I took the road Id only be asking to get raped or robbedIll fast forward a little about  hours later I finally came to the edge of our propertyThe property after ours belonged to an old man we met him in church a couple times Despite several threatening No Trespassing signs  I wasnt worried If he did so happen to come all the way out here and somehow find me I could just claim to be lost  I was sure he wouldnt be this far out in the woods anyway Here the woods thinned out a little and there were several small fields tucked between the trees I came here before but never went any further then the edge of the fieldsAt this point   the sun was only an hour or so away from setting and I started walking faster to hopefully get to town before nightfall I ran through the creek that separated me from the field and slipped on something causing me to fallIt hurt like hell later I found out I had broken my toe It was bleeding badly and I had to limp the rest of the way through the creek and fieldsI came to the end of the fields several minutes later where a small path either for ATVs or a tractor led through the woodsI never went this far before but I knew if I kept going straight Id get to the town within only an hour or so so I went onAfter what felt like forever of following a twisting path that seemed to go nowhere It finally came to a small circular clearing There was a fence surrounding it with a large sign once again threatening anyone who crossed I thought it was strange we were hours from any house why bother putting up a fence blocking off where no one would ever be likely to go Then again I was going through so maybe it wasnt all that uncommon I crawled under the fence foot still hurting like hell and went on through the clearing I knew I wouldnt be caught theres no way there would be anyone out hereI walked or more less limped through the clearing on the other side there was another small field and just my luck there was a old tree stand in one of the trees surrounding it We have a large hunting community and hunters often hide out in the tree stands that were often camouflaged in the treesI thought it would make a great place to stay the night since the town was still a long ways away and it was already starting to get darkI went up to it and poked my head inside it was perfect Just enough space to lay down and sleep if need be I climbed back out and headed back to the clearing There was a large hill to one side of it I figured if I climbed up it I could see just how far away the town was Ignoring my aching foot I limped over to the hill and right in that moment something hit me on the back of the head It felt like someone angrily poking me or throwing a small  pebbleI turned around quickly expecting to find an angry farmer or hunter no one was there it was probably just an acorn or nut falling from one of the surrounding treesI laughed at myself for being stupid and rubbed at my now aching headFor whatever reason I decided to not try to force my way up the large hill and instead went to the opposite side of the round clearing I dont know why it just felt like something was pulling me thereAbout half way across the clearing I stopped dead in my tracks and gasped I literally uttered  the words Oh my God Before quickly shutting my mouth in fear someone might have heard meThere before me were several grave stones All ranging in height and design The ground in front of some of them was lower than the rest of the ground almost as if the coffins underneath had caved inI stumbled over to the graveyard and bent down to try to read the headstonesMost were unreadable Only one of them had enough words I could make out it looked like two headstones fused togetherThe one on the left read GA Keaton date unreadableThe one on the right said Harriet Keaton   at the bottom just visible was Our angels together in heavenAt this point I turned and ranI blacked out for most of the time I was running I ran through the clearing ran along the path ran across the fields until I was finally back on our property I only slowed down because it was pitch black outside and stupid me forgot to bring a flashlight It was so dark I could hardly see in front of meOnce again Ill fast forward I finally got home after my step father had found me apparently he went out looking for me not to ensure I was safe and guide me home no Only because he wanted to drag me home to make me apologize to my motherI didnt care I happily followed him homeAfter finally getting there I found my brother looking like he was crying and my mom sitting at the table eating dinner looking like she didnt have a care in the world She glanced at me made a face And left the roomOver time I ended up telling her about the graveyard she found it interesting and soon enough all my family knew about the weird graveyard in the woods It became quite a conversation topic in our family before over time being forgottenOne thing I never told anyone though And the reason I went running out of that place like a baby Was because shortly after finding that cemetery I started to hear whispering and among the trees behind the graveyard I couldve sworn I saw something moving Then right after reading what was on the one tombstone what felt like a long boney fingerStarted tapping on the back of my head,A Cemetery in the Woods,75
wezziford,7,20,1qxs1g,45,There is almost nothing that I hate more than flyingUnfortunately yes yes first world problems due to the course my life has taken I find myself on a plane at least once or twice a month  Generally speaking my flights are boring and uneventful with a smattering of panic attacks here and there when we fly through a thunderstorm or encounter severe turbulenceGenerally speakingOne of my more recent flights was from Miami to Boston a voluntary trip home to see friends family and dog  Midafternoon departure exit row to myself  all ingredients for an almost enjoyable flight  Honestly except for the woman in the row ahead of me chatting yelling with her row mates all flight I would have had no complaintsUnfortunately for those of us that fear a fiery plane crash into watery grave type of death the most direct flight path from MIA  BOS is largely over open water  For most of the flight I had my nose in a book and felt no need to even peek out of the window next to me  This time though the captain announced that the left side of the plane had a postcard perfectview of New York City  However as I am lazy and perhaps spoiled in the sense that Ive seen the city so many times I decided to stay put and see if the right side of the plane had any majestic vistas to offerI started to lift the shade  what the fuck was thatAlright wezziford youre a paranoid flyer  Look again  rip that fucker open  Holy shitAn unfathomably huge head blunt at the end and longer than the freighter it was surfacing next to  I looked around me  of course  The view of the city had almost everyone on the other side of the plane oohing and ahhingSnap out of it  Look again  Too much medication before the flightA literal gaping maw  It looked like a portal in the ocean full of teeth on top of teeth  Andshipping containersThe freighter  Fuck  Now listing heavily to one side as its cargo tumbled into the ocean cavern and just as quickly swallowed by the blackness  In about  seconds maybe even less the ocean was still again  The hole in the ocean replaced by what looked like a huge greyblue island that shot a geyser into the air that seemed it would hit the plane before disappearing back into the seaI turned my head from the window breathing heavily and sliding the shade back into place  I denied denied denied willing myself to believe that it was an overactive imagination and paranoid mind at work always assuming the worst when it comes to flight  As I settled back into my seat trying my damnedest to stop sweating I realized how quiet the exit rows were  I noticed wide blue eyes looking around the seat in front of me  the loudmouth  With a face as white as the clouds we were flying through she looked to my window and then back at me  Hands clutching the cross around her neck lips moving without sound I knew at that moment that she had seen it too  This wasnt a Benadrylinduced illusion  This was real and true and completely unnoticed to anyone but usMaybe the Biblical tales and sailors stories have been true all along  We laugh and poke holes in the plots looking for scientific explanations to prove them wrong because it makes it easier to sleep at night  The ocean is vast unexplored and desolate even more so than outer space  Perhaps its best we keep it that way,Livyatan,65
irinax,47,16,1qzk7i,40,UPDATED Ive been trying to find similar stories to mind but I wasnt able to find anything that would help me figure out what is going on But I found this subreddit so I figured I would just register for an account and try to find help hereI recently moved to a new town its all been great and I love it One evening at a park a woman approached me and started asking me how have I been doing how is life and in the end  why am I in that town how did I decide to come she wouldnt expect to find me there She referred to me as Magdalena and asked me why didnt I stay in a certain small village When she figured I had no idea who she is and that I was rather shocked that I was approached by her she got kind of angry and first told me to cut the shit and kept ranting I couldnt shut her up to ask what is this all about she kept rambling and rambling on and on In the end I just told her to shut the fuck up shes a freak I have no idea what was all of that about and I dont want to hear any more I even started making threats She was pissed but she walked away Im not Magdalena that is my greatgrandmothers name She lived in the village the woman mentioned  Shes dead And the woman that approached me couldnt have known her because she doesnt look older than  my greatgrandmother has been dead for more than that People say I look like her when she was young and there is only one picture of her  when I compare it to me yes we do look alike almost the same My grandmother says we even have the same walk same mannerisms and voice But thats not a weird thing  not freaky at allWhat is weird in this  even if this woman DID know my greatgrandmother or saw a picture or whatever  why would she address me as Magdalena No one can stay the same after more than  years and thats how long ago she COULD have looked like I look now If she was alive she sure wouldnt be a young woman walking around parks in random towns Its a ridiculous assumptionI asked my grandmother about this she asked me to describe the woman and tell me about her behavior I did She asked me how did I react and as I explained the exchange she just cut me off and asked me if I was bitchy to the woman I had to admit that yes I was but she provoked that reaction My grandmother said Good she wont bother you again But that was it I asked her about the woman who is she what does she want why and how would she assume I am my greatgrandmother but my grandmother just told me to leave it as it is because I got rid of herMy father told me that its all ridiculous and she must have made a mistake looking for someone else but it doesnt sound like it What kind of a coincidence would it be that she was looking for a Magdalena from that village And plus there are no young people in that village anymore Especially not ones that are called Magdalena and look like meI met her in the same park again and she just apologized to me for her behavior I didnt I figured if my grandmother says I got rid of her by being bitchy Im not going to take it backI was still in shock but a few days later I approached her shes always  in that park in the evening  I asked about her name who is she why did she talk to me that day etc but she wouldnt answer She would keep going off topic saying that its a nice day or that the woman over there has a nice jacket or the dog under the tree is cute etcSo I just let it goBut Im still creeped outPlus I see this woman all the time in that park And the moment I arrive  she turns to me looks stares She listens while I talk to people looks at me no matter what am I  doing When I leave the park she stares at me for as long as she can see me She never gets up even though I assumed shed follow meI dont see her any other place but the parkMy grandmother told me not to talk to her not to mess with this to just let it be and let it go but I cantHelp advice opinions  UPDATE  I called my grandmother since I figured it would be better than trying again with the woman At first she wouldnt tell me absolutely anything but once I said She couldnt have known greatgrandma she cut  me off and said She could and she did Then she said something like But she doesnt need to know you and Im telling you to stay away  Obviously I tried asking who she is what is she but I got no answer so I asked is she dangerous evil  she said no but she isnt such good company either  She compared her to a friend I had when I was about  that wasnt really evil or bad she just often caused trouble and if you were her friend youd be in that trouble too of course Shed stick with you through everything but shed cause the shit that you have to stick through in the first place I told her I want to know more and if she doesnt tell me Ill find out on my own possibly by asking the woman she said I dont need to know but its my choice and if I dont trust her enough to stay away thats fine but shes not talkingMy father told me its all bullshit and I can just go talk to the woman and ask her is she crazy or drunk or drugged or something But how the fuck did she know,Who is this woman,56
Desequencer,3,20,1qwubp,45,I woke up this morning with little to no recollection of the day before Its not the first time eitherI remember waking up I vaguely remember going to work I dont remember what I worked on I only remember waking up again this morningBeing a detective you can imagine that this type of mental illness would not go over well with my higher ups No one knows that I have a fleeting memory except my brother I call him every time it happens because I have no one else to talk toAgain he asked wearily not even greeting me after he picked up the phoneI sighed and rubbed my headStill no headaches or anythingMy brother works in pharmaceutics so he knows his fair share about medicine but hes still no doctor I havent gotten any pills from him instead Ive only gotten pleas do go to a real doctor Like I said I cant do that Not with my jobIm going to work I saidCome on man Be reasonable What case are you working on right nowThat missing person case where the husband claimsRight right He became more serious solemn even I know you dont trust him butBut whatMaybe hes telling the truth I laughed Like hell Theres a realistic explanation for everything that appears supernatural Including hauntingsI believe himAfter the brief chat with my brother I got ready for work It pained me to be unable to remember a single damn thing from the day before The best I could do was believe I followed my usual routine deep into the fog of my memory Shower breakfast drive case I would have interviewed the husband about the case I would have written down new information I would be fineI got to work and found the most recent folder in my case list A missing persons report and the husband was being held for questioning There was no new information from the day before so I wondered what work I had even gotten done yesterdayAn officer brought the husband into one of our interrogation rooms at my request Still no headway huh the officer asked when I met him at the doorI furrowed my brow Why do you say thatHe shrugged Well you were in here with him yesterday You left in a hurry so I figured you you know had somethingI glanced at my folder in which I had written nothing about this interrogation yesterday Struggling with what to say to cover I shook my head NothingDidnt mean to step on your toes Detective Just curiousNot a problem I gave the officer a reassuring smile and entered the roomWhat is this for man the husband asked before I had a chance to shut the door He was frustrated and I didnt blame him I needed answers for more than just this case thoughI sat down across the table from him and opened the folder skimming over it Id already read through the available information but I wanted him to sweat Based on what I had I suspected the guy and I wanted him to think that Id found the evidence to nail him But when I looked up after a minute or so he wasnt sweating He was dejected his face in one of his handsSo whats the story I askedI told you he groaned It was thatThe last four interviews he said the same thing Thats what my reports say But the last time I dont know what he began the story with I glanced up at the camera in the corner of the room deciding to pull the tape and see what had happened As for now Id had enough Why dont you tell me something new JohnLike yesterday He was quick on the trigger What about yesterday huh You hurry out of here like youve got to take a huge shit and now youre back here today starting overI held my hands up to calm him down Alright okayYou didnt find her thenI didnt remember Sorry not yet You know Im working on itGo talk to the dry cleaner or his wife theyll corroborate my storyThat your wife is missing because of a ghost Maybe I had already gone to see them and one of them hit me over the head so I wouldnt rememberThen again maybe my lapses in memory were related to the case Theres a realistic explanation for everything that appears supernatural Including hauntings I was making headway but forgetting the progress and not for inexplicable reasons Was someone keeping track of me I glanced up at the camera again briefly imagining that one of my higher ups was responsible for this I suddenly felt in over my head as I tried to reason through this logic It was as unreasonable as a haunted dress right Are you even listeningI snapped out of my train of thought and looked at John No I was thinkingDonthurt yourself he said quietly sitting back in his chairWhen I noticed that his eyes were fixed on my nose I became aware of something draining from it BloodAre you alright DetectiveI didnt have an answer Ill be I got out of the chair Ill be back I stammered backing out of the roomAfter waving the officer off I got to the restroom to clean myself up The bleeding stopped after a moment but even then I remained to stare at myself in the mirror trying to figure my own self out There was a piece to this puzzle in my brain and I didnt know how to get it out Maybe my nose would bleed it out for meI went back to my desk in a daze I sat down and found that my computer was off which was peculiar Due to the long boot up time I usually just logged out and left it idle overnight Groaning I pushed the power button on the tower and waited the agonizing several minutes before the login screen appearedOnce logged in I used the shortcut to open the program we use for digital case information Instead of opening the program it opened a text fileCheck your trash and youll seeA wave of chills crashed against my back What was I supposed to see I swallowed and looked at my trash can Empty Not that I would rummage through it while the office was busy anyway Then realizing my mistake I checked the computers trashA single text file UntitledI opened it hesitantly and I was greeted with a long slab of prose instead of a single line of text Shaking I began to readIt was that dresshttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsowyathedress,And Youll See,65
Decendent,4,26,1qwq4m,43,My mother recently told me about how sheoblivious at the time was almost raped and possibly murdered by Mike The Mall Passer DeBardeleben httpenwikipediaorgwikiMikeDeBardelebenHe was a serial rapist murderer counterfeit money passer and sexual sadistShe told me recently that in  while she was in college in North Carolina she noticed someone following her in a big car as she walked home one night from class She tried to ignore it at first but when it was obvious that she was being stalked she got scared She saw a cop car parked at a gas station and ran to it and the car that had been following her peeled off Once she thought she was safe she continued her walk home Everything was ok until she had to cross the little footbridge thats on her way home Once she was over it the same car ripped around the corner and stopped her and a man rolled his window down and started small talk and asked her if he could give her a ride She said No and started to turn at which point he grabbed her and tried to pull her into the car She said she jerked away and immediately ran to a house that was across the street and he sped away weeks later she awoke to the sound of her roommate screaming Mom and  other girls all shared a  bedroom apartment so it was  to a room When she gained her vision she saw THE SAME GUY standing in the middle of her room looking at her She said that the look on his face was calculating The roommate screamed Who are you what are you doing here and he turned and replied uhI uhforgot my guitar and grabbed a guitar that was leaning on the wall The roommate shouted Thats my guitar and he threw it to the ground and ran outAfter reporting this event to the apartment manager the manager told my mom that some guy had come by a few days earlier stating that he was a family friend of the pretty girl with long dark hair that lives upstairs and wanted to surprise her So the apartment manager gave her pretty much ever detail about my Mom Where she works goes to school basic weekly routines Of course my Mom flipped out on her as anyone wouldThat was the last she ever saw or heard of him until several years later She was reading a book about notorious serial killers in America and read the story of Mike DeBardeleben Who was all over the country raping and apparently killing some of his victims When she flipped the page and saw his picture she gasped It was him They also showed a picture of his car and it was the one that followed her that night Once she told me I started to research I found this page  httpwwwdocstoccomdocsJamesMichaelDeBardelebenMallPasser that showed that he was in the North Carolina area at the same time my Mom was attending college there Also the victimology shows that he targeted women around age  and  my Moms age at the time Seriously got the creeps He died in  I wouldnt be here today if he had done what he was planning to do Im glad he dropped his pursuit but I wonder more often than I shouldwhy I can only assume that his initial plan failed and it would have been too easy to tie him to any crime committed against my mother at that point so it was easier to move onHis next victim was Laurie Jensen She lived but was repeatedly raped Who knows where she is now but for some reason I cant get her out of my headTLDR  My mother was almost raped and possibly killed before I was born by a serial sexual sadist named Mike DeBardeleben He died in prison in ,I was almost never born,69

DickBanditDoneLanded,10,65,1r1zac,39,As a kid I grew up singing songs of joy with my friends Fun songs that made me feel like a child There was one song that I never really liked for reasons unbeknownst to me but that one song would become a living hell during my adult lifeMy wife packed my sons lunchbox with a pizza lunchables It was always his favorite one I had the privilege of walking him to school that cold October morning holding his hand the whole walk We talked about toys games and then the topic of songs came upHey dadhow come you never showed me the song about Josh Jacob Jinglehyper Smith he asked Haha you mean John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt I never liked that song kiddo I replied I thought his name was Josh like mine He added We got to the school about half an hour earlier than the entry time so I suggested we go to the playground located around back Josh agreed and followed me The air felt relatively dense that day I could barely see fifty feet away and asked Josh to stay in sight and have a little fun before school starts I look away at the birds in the trees and Im startled by the piercing cry of my son nowhere in sight I call his name and he says Sorry dad I fell off the monkey bars Ill be fine I sighed and laughed a little knowing my kid was such a warrior I notice Josh riding a swing and laughing with another little boy who also came to school too early I see his father standing on the side laughing and I worry about not being a good enough dad to Josh I start to walk toward the boys and thats when it hits me I wasnt watching Josh play none of the two boys was mine I tried to keep calm but felt the need to yell out his name to locate him I look around the playground and the school bell rings announcing the schools opening The dense foggy air dissipates and Im able to see everything clearly I find a note in the second floor of the jungle gym it reads I know how hard you tried to avoid me I wouldnt want the same thing happening with JoshMy heart sank and my eyes widened as the note dropped on the mulch and made a thud I felt every possible emotion at that one point in time I didnt know what to do where to go who to ask for help so I walked into the school where I come across a corkboard with pictures of kids on it All of these children were abducted by a strange man who walked into the forest beside the school I knew what I had to do I ran into the woods clenching the note he had written John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt I hear a high pitched voice scream from the bushes as I fall to the ground in fear I noticed a building on a hill about a mile into the wild It was a greenish wooden house much like the ones mystery inc would investigate but this was not a game this was my sons life and possibly that of many other children The smell of rotting was emitting throughout the air and I feared the worst for the status of the kids Not willing to be detected I snuck in through a window that was left open and creeped about the dark house with nothing but my signalless cellphone and my dedication I was in the basement floor and couldnt see anything so I turned on my flashlight app I had no idea I was about to come across one of the most horrible sights anyone couldve seen There were mutilated corpses not just any corpses but children kids who I had met through class pictures my wife bought and showed me The kids were decapitated burned sliced naked I was scared for my life I almost threw up one too many times but swallowed it back along with my will to flee I found a wooden staircase that was old and rotting The first step I took on it made a loud creak and there was a groan in the distance I hid behind a giant flowerpot as a huge figure approached the area I was in I could barely breathe as I noticed this man had blood between his fingernails as if he mutilated the children with nothing but his fingers He returned to the room and I followed him from afar The smell I picked up earlier was much stronger than before and I heard muffled cries coming from the room the man walked into Say it with me now kidsJohn Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt His name is my name too Whenever we go out The people always shout There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schm A kid bit a hole through the duct tape on his mouth and was able to scream while he sang I heard the kids name It was GaryThe children were all able to remove their mouth bindings and cried in unison for about ten seconds Then I hear a loud laugh followed by a SHUT THE FUCK UP At this point I was enraged Nobody has the right to scream at kids like that nobody I barged in grabbing this freak by his backlength hair and slamming his face into a table with limbs on it What did you just say to those kids you motherfucker I yelled oblivious to the children in the room Youre gonna pay for all your shit you son of a bitch I said Well thats just too damn bad He added I didnt know today was the day Id be found Its such a shame youve missed your playdate with your sonhe was SUCH a nice boy He said laughing his head off at the sight of my expression I was cold I was numb My son was dead I unleashed my fury on the man not holding back at all I knocked him unconscious and tied him down to a giant piece of metal I broke both his legs and made sure hed never walk again then I released the children many starving and ready to go home I tugged the slab down the hill and walked alongside the children toward the school The police had previously raided the woods but never came across the house in the entire year he had been performing the kidnappings I called the school and notified the authorities of the serial killer I had slayed and I wanted to make sure he was arrested and would suffer his whole life for what he did to my wife and I She was hysterical unable to perform for almost a whole year We cancelled any holidays and vacations and mourned a year away We finally concluded that our son was happy in a better place with the rest of his friends Although my wife and I never had any other children I became teacher at an elementary school in another state and was happy knowing I had kids who were fun to be around and nice to me One Monday morning we have a new girl come in and I ask her to introduce herself Shes laughing and shes shy and she wants to whisper something in my ear Ill introduce myself if we can just play today She says I promise her along with the class that well have a free day and she introduces herself and makes friends I start to like this girl because I never had a chance to have a daughter and always wanted one She was very sociable and was the class clownShe stopped coming to school for a week and out of curiosity I called her parents to ask about her sudden disappearance Her mother was crying and I couldnt understand her so her father came to the phone I told him about how the class missed her and he told me about a note that was left at their door one afternoon It read Go through her drawings I asked the dad to give me a minute while I did just that HE was in the pictures Every drawing she made had him hiding in the background There was a folded piece of paper that was thicker than the rest Little did I know it wasnt school paper it was skin Pressed and cut to replicate a note I thought by now youd figure out I was never human I got on the phone to tell the girls father the news but all I heard was a demonic maniacal laughter I felt a hole in my chest as the phone line went dead followed by three beeps and elongated static,His name is my name too,104

breezy,4,12,1qvgrc,36,I was about  or  when this happened and I will never forget it I ate lunch with my little group of friends every day at school We noticed that our friend Erin had been overly tired for the past few days and asked her if there was anything wrong At first she answered no but then she said Well there is but you guys wouldnt believe me if I told you Well of course we wanted to know what it was after that We finally got it out of her Ive been waking up in the middle of the night lately andI swear my dolls are breathing Woah What Our friend Blair and myself automatically gained interest  we were big fans of the paranormal Mary wasnt as interested and was very skeptical Blair and I decided a slumber party was in order statThe next day was Friday we all arranged to have a sleepover at Erins house and find out for ourselves about these breathing dolls Erin had a rather large bedroom upstairs At the far end was a bay window with a bench to sit on and on both sides of the window there were two shelves lined with Erins porcelain doll collection probably about  dolls in all We had a great time doing normal dorky things girls do at sleepovers we all practically forgot the main reason we were staying there in the first place Time flew by and before we knew it it was about am Well said Blair lets hit the hay and see what these dolls doWe all settled into our sleeping bags or makeshift beds shut off the lights and waited Occasionally one of us would say something that would make the rest of the slaphappy gang laugh but eventually we settled into silence We all laid there for probably about an hour listening and waiting and trying not to fall asleep I was just starting to doze off when I heard Erin whisper There it isdo you hear it Blair Mary and myself lifted our heads up and listened It was quiet but definitely therea faint rhythmic breathing Are you sure were not just hearing each other asked Mary We all held our breath to test that theory but the breathing still continued Blair the bravest of us got to her feet and slowly made her way over toward the dolls Erin and I got up and followedMary followed also but hung back a waysThe moon was shining through the window illuminating the dolls from the side As we leaned in to have a closer look we noticed somethingcondensation underneath the noses of several of the dolls The condensation coincided with the breathing we were hearing the spots getting larger on the exhale and smaller on the inhaleTHE FRICKIN DOLLS WERE BREATHING Needless to say we freaked out There was a door in Erins room that led to a storage area over the garage We flipped the lights on ran into the storage area grabbed a box and threw all of the dolls in it Then we took it back into the storage area put a couple heavy boxes on top of it then closed locked and barricaded the door None of us slept very well the rest of the night after experiencing that and just knowing that those dolls were still under the same roof as usErins house was and still is incredibly haunted and all kinds of weird things have happened there over the years but this was by far the craziest I had one porcelain doll that immediately went into the trash as soon as I got home To this day I still refuse to own one and really just hate dolls like that in general I know it wasnt the dolls themselves so much as whatever was possessing them but Im definitely not providing a vessel for whatever it was,The Breathing Dolls,48
DarkPie,12,14,1qvq2y,27,For those of you who didnt see my original entry I figured I should put a link to it Here you gohttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqqxasmomiloveyouI was asleep a lot the past day or so I think it was the blood loss personally but as soon as I was awake I was confronted by a psychologist Dr Sharon Richardson a woman who I never met before but she knew a lot about me She knew of my mom her snap the wounds I had received She was worried about me to say the least One does not get betrayed by their own parent and feel nothing That might be true but that wasnt how mom saw itIll be okay once she gets the help she needs The look of pity on her face made me confused but she simply said it was someone elses job to explain that to me We talked for about an hour about everything from school to the recent craziness and she came to the conclusion that I was in mild shock It sounded right I still hadnt wrapped my head around the fact that I was alone now Ill talk to you in a few days she said with a smile resting her hand on my headA woman in her early fifties she had aged well A fine wine among most women who age admittedly like milk She left and I thought I could rest I couldnt I was confronted instead by Officer Hughes a man of Filipino descent He introduced himself asked how I was feeling seemed like a genuinely good man He slid up the chair and sat down looking at me with the somber expression that made it seem like hed be telling me my mother was deadSon Its about your mother My heart stopped My pupils dilated my muscles tensed I sat straight making the bullet wounds stretch and feel just awful Do you have any idea where she might be She was still alive I thought that had been what I wanted to hear but instead I panicked My mother when she was more sane was OCD She didnt like leaving jobs half done Face growing pale I shook my head Uhm I have Grandparents I could barely talk and the answer didnt please himYes we know On your mothers side Theyve both been killed It seems after your mothers escape she went there to talk to your parents We assume that your grandfather decided to call the institution and tell them where your mother was and she found out Your grandmother died from lacerations your grandfather Well Theyre no longer alive he said Now I felt it Remorse pain Without his assurance though I knew this wasnt my fault Mom was She was going crazyHow do you know they were calling the institution The officer smiled They received the call They just never heard his voice She was too fast for them he said trying to say it as calmly as possible From there she took your grandfathers Browning M handgun and  HampH rifle I guess you came into contact with the handgun He seemed solemn My mom Shes not going to jail is sheIf we catch her shell be in an institution the rest of her life Medication forever She wont escape there Is there any other family she might go to There wasnt Do you guys have any regular places youd like to go We didnt Well fuck where would she b his voice was rising but he was cut off by the nurse entering the room quickly We received a phone call she said in a panic The officer stood quickly and she almost started balling Some woman she sounded mad She She said she was coming to pick up her son she said among chokes of tears Goddamnit The officer yelled running his fingers through his hair I didnt understand the problem but apparently the area they thought she was in was the complete opposite side of town from the hospital He was my only protection I have an idea I offered up timidly The officer looked at me bemused and irritated Well If I know her she just wants to finish what shes started Which means she knows charging in here wont work out Shell probably just sit around until I try to go home So why dont you just take me home in your car well beat her there and you guard me You can have your backup waiting like a block or two away And shell think she has a chance if its just me there Kid thats actually a good idea he exclaimed He helped me into a wheelchair and took me to his squad car loading me in and watching his back like he was the one being followed Once I was strapped in he entered his seat and we started driving I arched back watching the hospital fade away as a nurse stepped outside to see me offIt wasnt a nurse though It was my mom in a nurses outfit Shed been in there I was wrong She was going to finish the job in there herself I cried I lost it unable to keep it in anymore and explained through sobs what I sawHe shook his head unable to believe it Dont worry kid I offered my service to this career to help people like you Innocents Itll end soon and youll be okay he tried soothing me I know but it did little to help She almost had me She knows where Im going I can feel it Its about to end I feel scared I feel like youre the only ones I can talk to None of my friends have contacted me and this officer Hes great and all dont get me wrong Nice down to earth and genuinely wants to help But he took me upstairs and put me in my room and has been watching out since The police agree that staking out the house would scare her away and we need her

at night in my moms old room Ill have no time to talk to him to take the load off my mind But its coming to an end soon I can feel itPlease be with me Nosleep I need you,I Love You Mom Part ,41
IrishSurfer,2,13,1qscwt,33,On June th  my high school was one of many that took us to Disneyland for Grad Night If youve ever been to Disneyland on Grad Night you know how much fun  and how crazy  it can be The park stays open extra late the skippers who drive the Jungle Cruise boats let loose and tell dirty jokes and theres plenty of opportunities for people to sneak booze and weed in Getting a bunch of amped high schoolers in Disneyland is one thing but with a nightlife and party atmosphere behind it things can get pretty nutsMy two friends and I Anaheim locals were particularly excited We all loved Disneyland and while we didnt get to visit often living practically in the parks backyard gave us more opportunities than most In addition we hadnt been since the new Fantasyland opened earlier that year going from a sort of Medieval fairground into a storybook village so I was kind of looking forward to that Unlike a lot of people who were there we intended to keep things clean and have a grand old time of it hit as many rides as possible and just revelBut the big plan for the night was kind of ambitious and maybe a little reckless  to this day I cant remember who suggested it first only that we all thought it was a great idea We had already gotten into the park and gone on a number of rides when it was brought up while we were sitting on a bench in Frontierland eating churros From where we sat we could look across the Rivers of America to Tom Sawyer Island and past that where the river curved to New Orleans Square Poking above the trees was the cupola of the Haunted Mansion with its clipper ship weathervane The sun had just gone down and the sky was awash with dull orange and purple clouds most of which seemed to loom behind the cupola I pointed out how perfect and spooky the whole thing looked and that got us talking about it The mansion was a collective favorite and being dumb kids we agreed to do a little exploring to effectively spend the night in the Haunted MansionWe laughed about as we got in line for it moving past the brick columns and up the walk toward the mansion but inside I was a bit nervous You have to understand security was a bit more lax back then so it was plausible that we would be able to pull this off if we were careful Plus Grad Night always had kids getting into trouble and the likelihood of us getting banned for good was not as high as it could have been But I still felt tense that feeling you get when youre scared about going on a thrill ride for the first time excited but hesitantThe three of us  Mike Karen and myself  had it all worked out when you first enter the mansion youre escorted into a room that seems to stretch and warp before your eyes which is actually an elevator that takes guests below ground where a hallway connects to the ride building beyond the parks berm As everyone else crowded out of the room and into the Hall of Morphing Portraits we lagged behind which the disembodied voice of the Ghost Host jokingly warns you not to do and fell in at the very back of the line By the time we piled into our Doombuggy there was no one else behind us and the black endless procession of clamshelllike cars were emptyWe went through the ride as normal cracking jokes and making banter at all the old familiar scenes until we reached the exit crypt We stepped out onto the moving platform and walked toward the escalator ramp that leads from the crypt back to the park outside If you dont know the escalator hugs the wall on the right but on the left is a small crypt scene where a tiny ghostly bride stands on a stone shelf and tells you to Hurry backHurry back Mike took charge here deliberately turning backwards as we went up to watch the cast member near the buggies below us Mikes a big broadshouldered guy a football player throughandthrough and his bulk hid me and Karen from view as we slowly ascended At his signal when the cast member monitoring the exit had his back turned Karen and I climbed over the rail and dropped down into the crypt scene where we quickly scurried under the dusty space beneath the escalator Mike was over a moment later and we laughed and congratulated each other on a job well doneWe must have spent a good hour or so down there giggling into our hands whenever we heard footsteps and voices overhead of unsuspecting people exiting the ride Karen even had some snacks shed brought with her and we sat there in the dark and ate and whispered to each other It was like being in a weird clubhouse and it felt good that we three shared this delinquency together even as the narration of the ghost bride looped over and over again in the background Hurry backHurry backBe sure to bring your death certificate If you decide to join us make final arrangements now Weve beendying to have youEventually the novelty wore off and we got quiet and then listless Sure wed managed this much but then what Karen pointed out that it had been eerily silent for awhile  other than the monotonous speech of the bride and other spooky ambient sounds there were no more people coming up the ramp Mike said he thought maybe the park had closed but that made no sense because it was open all night on Grad Night Not wanting to get in trouble but also wondering what was up I volunteered to clamber back up and take a look When I did using some of the crypt scenery for hand and footholds I saw that there was no one around not even a cast member down at the unloading platform at the endWhen I reported this Mike and Karen climbed back up as well and we went back down the unloading station to look around All the Doombuggies coming along the corridor were empty and there was not a person in sight It was odd to say the least and I felt like something was definitely off to have the place so empty I was about to suggest turning around and heading back outside when Mike said hed always wondered where the Doombuggies went after they dropped you off They rounded a dark corner in the crypt area and vanished from sight and Mike was curious what was down thereNow really I should have said no that there was no point and that we could get into some serious trouble if we snooped around back there It was probably just a utility corridor anyway since the buggies just looped back around to the loading room anyway But I was young and I was stupid and when presented with a golden opportunity like that it was hard to pass it upSo we went ahead and jumped into a Doombuggy going by and it slowly rounded the corner into the darkness This was uncharted territory for us and even if it turned out to be boring back there at the very least wed get a chance to see it and maybe get another ride out of itHardly a day goes by where I regret not having said somethingThe main thing I remember was how spartan it was It wasnt quite pitch black but it was even gloomier in there than the rest of the ride There were small lights set into the walls on either side of the track but they were low to the ground and far between The walls were painted black and the corridor seemed so narrow that I felt boxed in It was quiet too other than the hum of the track moving the buggies I felt tense and Mike and Karen werent helping that because they looked tense too I think it was dawning on all of us how much trouble we might get inI think a minute or so had passed like this us going down that dark featureless backstage corridor when the ride suddenly stopped and I nearly jumped out of my skin as a voice came from somewhere overhead  and laughed when I realized Id been startled by the normal breakdown spiel Playful spooks have interrupted our tour the recording went Please remain seated in your Doombuggy We will proceed in just a momentThe teasing was immediate as we all pointed out to each other how wed jumped We waited for the ride to start again and every thirty seconds or so the spiel would play We have been unappointedly detained by prankish spirits Kindly remain seated in your Doombuggy We will continue our tour momentarily This went on for good long while  ten maybe fifteen minutes  and still the buggies hadnt moved no one had come looking for us We were getting antsy and the silence between the announcements was becoming unsettlingThen Karen leaned out a bit and looked around and she noticed the door first Just ahead past the buggy in front of us worklights revealed a little alcove and a utility door on the righthand side of the corridor We were so sick of being in the buggy by that point we were willing to try anything so after a short discussion we all squeezed out of the buggy pressed against the wall to go past the next one  Mike had trouble here  and stood before the door I pushed it open finding it unlocked and it led to a metal staircase leading down into the darkness footlights like the ones in the corridor revealing where to go I was thinking up excuses in my head as we went down the stairs to explain why were likely stepping into Disneys underground utility corridors  the infamous Utilidors said to run like a spiderweb beneath Disneyland  if someone found us And by this point I hoped someone didAt the bottom of the stairs another closed door with a sign on it reading Cast Members Only We pushed through that as well and were legitimately surprised to see that it opened into what looked like a themed hallway Disney even backstage seemed to be paying attention to style as this hall sported the purple demon wallpaper and wainscoting of the rooms above It was even lit by candle sconces on the walls the fake flickering bulbs coated with cobwebs and dust Several detailed wooden doors lined the hall with outofplace white placards mounted to them Each was marked as a Prop Room with a corresponding numberAs we made our way up the hall we tried each door we came to and found them all locked The first door Prop Room  shook a bit but wouldnt budge Same with  and  Mike chuckled and said he wondered if we would find Walt Disneys frozen head down here but I could hear a nervous waver in his laugh Even I was feeling some sense of dread with each door we tried something hard to place but nagging At Door  I put my ear to the edge of it and thought I heard what sounded like rushing water or faint TV static from the other side and at  I noticed that the faux candles flanking it were flickering more sporadically than the rest like they were faulty Door  to left and near another plain utility door that marked the halls end was the only one that yielded to us and I was the one who turned the cold handle and opened it for the first timeIts difficult for me to describe what I saw in there without shuddering because even now my telling makes it sound fairly normal That is as normal as a room hidden under a theme park attraction can possibly be It wasnt very big almost like a large storage shed Unlike the hall this one was the bland utility black and lit by a single fluorescent light in the ceiling albeit a dim one The walls were lined with metal cabinets and there was some sort of large archaic gadget shoved into one corner not unlike the old computer banks from the s But what caught my attention right away was the grinning figure near the far wall across from the door  a dummy or animatronic of some sort lifeless and unmoving but standing on its baseThe discovery was fascinating to all of us and without thinking we all edged into the room and immediately approached the figure It was clearly meant to be one of the ghosts in the ride a specter in a top hat with a skulllike face cartoony bulging eyes and a leering smile one of the teeth was even painted gold He stood in a bowlegged stance one gnarled hand holding a cane and the other a hatbox None of us had ever seen this particular character on the ride before though Karen said its face looked a lot like the tall skinny hitchhiking ghost from the end of the rideI was just turning away from the figure to look at the cabinets when there was a combustion roar from the hall outside like the sound of a passing motorcycle followed by a loud bassy boom that made the floor shake The door to the room swung shut and the fluorescent light sputtered and went out leaving us in total darkness Mike gasped and Karen screamed and I was just reaching out for them in the dark when I heard a peculiar whirring sound Another light came on this one a concentrated green light above the hatbox ghost showing its skeleton smile for a moment before that light faded and another faded on illuminating the hatbox I could see through the material of the hatbox now and saw the ghosts head grinning at me from inside The pattern repeated itself rhythmically making it seem like the ghosts head was disappearing from his shoulders and appearing in the hatbox It wasnt a terribly convincing effect but in the dark and with the strange things going on around me it genuinely scared meI turned and stumbled through the room ready to get out of there feeling around for the door Now even the light on the ghost shut off and I heard Karen and Mikes feet behind me a crash and the sound of something solid tapping the concrete floor I tried pushing the door open but it wouldnt budge and somebody slammed into my back in the dark and caused me to hit it hard I was dazed but unhurt and another scream from Karen fueled my adrenaline even more I instead gave the door a tug and it openedI was out in the hall without a second thought without even looking back I started running sprinting back the way I had come gasping for air I was never a very athletic kid but panic kept me going I heard sounds behind me  footsteps Mike and Karen yelling in terror as they followed and what seemed like rapid knocking and banging on the doors around me  but I refused to look over my shoulder Up the stairs and back into the Doombuggy corridor in what felt like a matter of seconds The Doombuggies were moving now endlessly traveling through the shadows I knew it was risky to jump into one in this narrow corridor and for a moment I stopped trying to figure out what to doI finally looked back back down the stairway I had come from I thought Mike and Karen had been right behind me but they were gone I called out their names my voice echoing down the stairs but there was no reply Not until I heard something tapping the metal stairs coming up toward the door and saw an unfamiliar vague shadow on the wall that I flung the door closed and dove into the nearest buggy which carried me down the corridor a little ways before finally emerging into the limbolike loading roomAll of the effects were still running here including the eerie music and sounds but there was still no one else around I yelled for help but no one appeared As soon as I could I jumped out of the Doombuggy and ran back up the line into the Hall of Morphing Portraits Ahead was the door to the elevator the Stretching Gallery but I remembered that this area had a more immediate chicken exit meant for those too scared to ride the ride and wanted to head back up to the park The door was marked with an obvious exit sign sitting between two shuttered windows that made it look like it led outside to a stormy night and without hesitating I pushed through that as wellBeyond was another corridor on either side of me flashing lights pointed at the windows to simulate lightning flickering with each thunderclap that boomed through the hall disorienting me even further Turning left I followed the hall as the floor inclined gently up my throat tight and a stitch in my sideAnd then my throat closed altogether as I turned a corner almost ran into the hatbox ghostIt was standing smackdab in the middle of the hall between me and the door that led outside I scrambled backward instinctively but the figure didnt move It was a static prop grinning its cadaver grin backlit by a ceiling light further down the hall The light also broke the illusion of the hatbox and I could see vaguely the shape of the disembodied head through the scrimI was convinced  thoroughly convinced at that moment  that thing was going to suddenly jerk to life and come after me but it didnt I had no idea how it had gotten there from down in the sublevel or how it had so quickly Maybe the one Id seen below wasnt the only figure maybe Mike and Karen were pulling a fast one on me and had dragged the figure up with them I was frozen trying to figure out where to go next not wanting to go anywhere near the ghost but not wanting to backtrack either because I still felt like there was something sinister behind me Nervously I croaked out the names of my lost friends but there was no reply Noises from the ride seemed to come floating down the hall muted but everpresentThen I heard the groanIt could have been a human groan or something mechanical but I definitely heard it It didnt sound like any of the standard audio and it came from a point somewhere near or past the hatbox ghost maybe even from further down the corridor past the exit As if this were a trigger I realized that either my eyes had adjusted to the dark or the lighting had somehow changed because I looked again at the hatbox and saw the thing inside through the scrimThere was still a head in there but I know it wasnt the ghosts head It wasnt even a cartoon caricature of a head It wasnt Mike or KarenIts at this point the details allude me I know that what I saw shook me to my very core and thats part of the reason its taken me so long to recount this I remember seeing the thing in the box seeing that it was indeed a human head  a mans face a face I didnt recognize seemingly looking back out at me with shocked pleading eyes  but after that theres a blur of sheer terror and snatches of frightening images gnarled hands tombstones pneumatic hissing the stretching room going in reverse shrinking shrinking too fast the ceiling rushing toward me the corpse hanging in the rafters descending on meI try not to dwell on them too much because now Im no longer sure which really happened and which were the results of the nightmares Id have for years afterThe next thing I can remember clearly after that is being on my hands and knees just outside the fence of the Haunted Mansion vomiting onto the pavement while around me crowds of people stood Most of them werent paying me any mind there was lots of whispered talk and a few were crying There were redandblue lights police cars parked nearby but I couldnt tell why I just sat there gulping and sobbing until a cast member finally noticed me and led me to a first aid stationKaren was there when I arrived and she jumped up and hugged me tight when she saw me I dont think either of us made much sense we were both at our wits end but it was such a relief to see her after all that that any questions I had fell by the wayside Ill never forget how haunted she looked wideeyed and pale barely able to form a sentence without tearing upMike never turned upThat fateful night has never left me and in the years since then Ive slowly begun to piece together the details trying to vainly make sense of what happened It became sort of a private obsession something to do in the background as I moved on with my lifeFirst it didnt take long for Karen and I to learn why the police cars were there and they werent for us According to the reports we heard later an yearold guy from New Mexico had died while we were in the Haunted Mansion He and a friend had snuck into a backstage area on Tom Sawyers Island and stole a rubber emergency boat to go for a joyride around the Rivers of America Apparently this guy was pretty drunk and it wasnt long before he hit a rock throwing he and his friend from the boat His friend went for help but he drowned before they could find him His body was discovered an hour laterI wonder now if thats why there was no one around when we crept backstage I managed to track down a few cast members who were working that night and though most of them claim that they were told by management to not cause alarm and keep to their posts several admitted they had gone to check out the grim spectacle especially those CMs that were on attractions near the river like the Haunted Mansion Was the timing such that everyone turned a blind eye while we stumbled into something hideousMikes disappearance was something me and Karen both felt deeply and we tried for years to get something from anyone about it His parents told us later that hed shown up again a day or so later behaving erratically barely registering them deeply disturbed by something Mike had planned on moving out beforehand but that night after lashing out at his folks he grabbed very few personally belongings took the family car and drove off to points unknown After that he dropped off the face of the earthKaren and I eventually drifted probably because we blamed each other for what happened She never expressed to me what she experienced after we got separated either because she wanted me to feel guilty for leaving them behind oh Karen you have no idea or that she like me can only recall so much We were both too shaken to recount to each other But time and distance make things easier and with the advent of the internet there was suddenly a wealth of new information Ive since begun to piece together cluesAlmost immediately I found our Hatbox Ghost Plugging that into any search engine will turn up multitudes of pictures of that bowlegged grinning figure that has often floated through my minds eye in the dark It was apparently part of the attraction when it first opened in  and much of the promotional material of the ride at the time featured this character and his ubiquitous hatbox He originally stood in the attic scene right across from the ghostly bride with the beating heart but was quietly removed from the ride after only a week apparently the effect of his disappearing head never worked properly or so the official account goesIn recent years the Hatbox Ghost has gained a fanbase groups of Haunted Mansion fans that want to see him restored to the ride Its wishful thinking Im sure because that figure had to have been stored downstairs for a reasonIt took longer to find out about the backstage area where the Doombuggies go that empty corridor not originally meant to be seen by guests disabled guests however travel that route all the time Wheelchair access to the ride is done through the Limbolike loading room and guests travel back around to this room to reclaim their wheelchairs and head back out Ive posted about it and posed queries for details about that area but no one has given me a description that sounds anything like what I went through Its been described as short bland and with some sort of catwalk going over the track but no mysterious alcove or obvious doorway It takes less than  seconds for the Doombuggies to go through and then youre back in the loading room I suspect Disney might have changed that area since ht s but whyMost recently though Ive come across an odd factoid that seems more like a morbid curiosity than anything else unless ones been through what I have Its not about the Haunted Mansion however but its nearby Eticket neighbor Pirates of the Caribbean According to the story  and this has been published in various Disneyowned books so its no vague rumor  the Imagineers who built the ride felt that the faux skeletons of the time werent convincing enough for the underground grotto scenes So they borrowed real human remains from the UCLA Medical Center dressed them up as pirates and put them in the caves Let that sink in for a moment millions of people went by on boats and had no idea they were looking at real skeletons all propped up in pirate garb Eventually a later team of Imagineers would replace these with more convincing facsimiles and supposedly the bones were returned to their countries of origin and given proper burialBut whose to say they were What if something was left behind in that basement when the bones were taken And what if Pirates wasnt the only ride that did this The show building of the Haunted Mansion was built along with the rest of New Orleans Square in  but it took another six years for the actual attraction to open Why the delay It couldnt have just been the gridlock from the  Worlds Fair and Walt Disneys death in  could itAll of this is speculation a string of understanding that raises more questions for me than it does answers I want to get to the truth of what happened that night but everything Ive found doesnt add up to a concrete explanation perhaps there isnt one though I desperately want there to be And I cant go back  I wont  not after the things I saw and felt I havent set foot in Disneyland since that nightMaybe though Maybe its time I tried againKaren if youre out there and youre reading this Im sorry about everything Im trying to make it right trying to put some meaning to this Contact me if you can I need to know what happened to you and Mike  maybe you have the key to the mystery in your memories I cant do it alone but together we might get to the bottom of thisFor everyone else let this stand as a testament some things are backstage for a reason and a company like Disney must have a multitude of skeletons in its closets Think twice before you pull some stupid stunt like I did because it might not be security that finds you,Haunted House,46
koolgirl,15,20,1qufp4,26,For those that dont know Canadian woods can get a bit creepy during winter months  Anyway my grandparents own a farm outside of a very small town We only had some horses and ducks but my yearold self thought it was pretty cool There was a field with the main house in it a driveway up a small hill leading to my grandpas garage Just beside the driveway many meters is the barn the barnyard and the  fields behind them down the other side of the small hill The rest of the property is woods that me and my cousins used to explore  Now onto the story in question it was the middle of the night and I was having trouble sleeping Which was odd because I normally slept well especially at their house The guest room door was just open a crack to let the hallway light illuminate the room just a tad I was never afraid of the dark however I was terrified of the idea of someone watching me sleep without my knowledge The bed was parallel to the window so I could see the stars when the blind was down I sat there telling myself to sleep and eventually I did but I just couldnt force myself to at the moment I have a sudden urge to look out the window into the field even though I could already see the outside sky I sit up leaving the warmth and comfort of the blankets A light snow is falling and the beautiful Milky Way lights up the field almost like day I admire the beauty of the snowy field and woods until I notice a shadowy figure crossing the field towards the road staying along the treeline At first I dismissed it as a animal we saw animals a lot then I noticed the way it walked It was eerily human  It may only be a hunter I told myself as weve had hunters trespassing on our property before and I could see tracks behind it that looked human but something was different It was almost like it sucked the light out of the air It looked like it was a shadow Thats when it turns but I cant see if its towards or away from me The hallway light flickers and goes out Leaving only the ominous Milky Way looming over the earth to light the room I lay down  and decide Im imagining it The hallway light can wait until morning plus I dont think my grandparents would be very happy if I woke them up at  am to change a silly light bulb  As I finally feel myself slipping from the hands of reality I feel a breath on my face a small shhhh and hands locking around my neck and I fall into the void of unconsciousness  I woke up with bruises on my neck To this day I dont sleep with the blinds open  I also have many other stories involving that property that I may post in the near future  Edit I remember a whisper That may have been my imagination though   Edit  The tracks There was tracks behind it but they were gone by morning from the snowfall  Edit  Herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqxqptheshadowboy is the next one,The Shadowy Figure in the Field,46

slivr,9,11,1qtewa,28,a little groggy from the beer a few hours earlier a little stoned no worse for wear though  In any condition I was good to drive  I didnt even remember the womans name whos apartment I had just slinked out of at am  It didnt matter anyways I just wanted to sleep in my own bed  I pulled up the drive as I had any other night parked the car in the same spot as any other night  Something felt different this night though  Maybe cause I hadnt smoked or gotten laid in a while maybe cause my guard was down just a little bit more than usual I stepped up to the door reached into my pocket for the keys I thought I heard something as the keys made a light clatter while coming out of my pocket  You know one of those faint sounds where youre probably just hearing things where its probably just the wind going throw some tree branches or something like that  It was dark and I was feeling lucky so I picked one of the four keys and tried it and as I did I heard it again was it calling my name I fumbled as I hesitated while attempting to grab another key and I heard it this time it sounded like it was coming from inside help it was distant but it was urgent  I thought it could be my roommate it sounded like his voice Mike I said as I fumbled through my keys then hastily decided the moonlight wasnt bright enough I had to use the light from my phone  Hello Helpp once again was called out but I couldnt tell if it was from afar or from within my house or even if it was Mike saying it  The voice was so unusually muffled  I was still shuffling through the keys finally under the light of my phone as I urgently said Hang on Im coming I finally grabbed the house key as I heard it again this time it was incomprehensible yet still I could not pin where it was coming from  I unlocked the door and barged in and immediately called out to Mike beckoning for a response Mike Hello Mike  No answer  I stood there waiting for what I dont know anything  SilenceDistraught I went back outside to see if the voice was actually coming from out there My phone is dying  whatever Im at my house anyways I can use it to see in the dark if I need it  I called out Hello loud enough so that it could be heard but not too loud to wake up the neighbors at am  Nothing  A chill of realization goes up my spine as I discern that it has to be be one of two things Im crazy and hearing things or theres something there  Maybe it was the wind maybe I was just zoning out and imagining things  My pride wouldnt let me believe it no I thought I just made a scene in the middle of the night I heard something    I irrationally recalled how I had joked with Mike about our house being haunted after watching The Amityville Horror with him a few nights prior  Stop scaring yourself I thought that has nothing to do with anythingI walked as slowly and quietly as I could throughout the house first  I didnt dare flip the lightswitches for reasons unbeknownst to me  So I used my phone as a flashlight in hindsight this wasnt a bright idea  I didnt realize I still had my keys gripped tightly in my hand until I got to the den  Mike I whispered with doubt in my voice  No response  There was but a ember or two glinting in the fireplace and his car was in the driveway so he mustve gone to bed a little over an hour ago  I didnt bother checking his room I now knew the voice wasnt his He was asleep and I didnt want to wake himIt had to have been from outside  I felt as if I was going crazy but I needed to find out what had happened   fuckin battery always dies when I need it  I shined the light into Mikes car halfexpecting to see something that I dont wanna see  The muffled voice it would only make sense  To my relief and dismay nothing was in there other than the ordinary debris  I walked around to one side house Mikes bathroom light is on this is ordinary though so I trudged back the way I came   Cmon its been like  minutes I called out one last time with hope in my voicea little louder too Hello Fuck the neighbors I wanna know whats going on  I walked around the other side of the house shining my phone left and right methodically at an almost frantic pace  I stopped  There I stood looking into the darkness of my house through the window my phone pointed at the ground  Im genuinely scared to bring the light to it I dont know why it was just like any other night  As I raised my phone to peer inside seemingly irrational fear struck me like a ton of fucking bats flying within my chest trying to get out  I slowly raised the phone from the ground up I saw nothing until until I got to eye level  There they were staring right back at me then GONE in an instant  I shined my phone around what the fuck was that Did that just happen I thought out loud  Then and there right at that very moment my phone died,So there I was driving home from a night out,39
lifecmcs,2,14,1qynx5,24,When I was  years old we moved into a new apartment It was a great deal for my parents and I could remember them being so excited to move there It was across Torrance CA in a Redondo Beach next to the ocean though we still had to go  or  miles to get to the beach and couldnt see it from the apartment It was me my younger sister  years younger my dad and my mom The apartment was also very big with a stairs important detail leading up directly from the front door The only thing that was a bit off was the fact that we were allowed to get the house for almost a  discount I was later to find out that the previous owners had left all of a sudden and only told the owners of the apartment to lease the place Nothing really happened for a few days only the anxiety of going to a new school living in a new house etcPrior to that move I had had no cable tv For some reason my parents decided to get a plasma flatscreen and I became instantly hooked I was watching Spongebob Squarepants Jimmy Neutron etc I was a TV addict Plus the fact that I had almost no friends at school at the time contributed to me watching TV more Then one day I met Jacob Jacob told me that he loved Star Wars and as much as two fourth grader could we became best friends We would hang out all the time playacting star wars Then one day he asked me if I was Christian It was out of the blue I told him that I went to church but I wasnt too convinced Then he told me his dad had told him that God would die Then he gave a prayer to Lucifer who I didnt know Then that was when the wierd shit hit the fanMy mother miscarried my younger sibling Even now the though that I would have a younger brothersister is still haunting to me Then she would have bouts of nightmares where she would scream in the middle of the night scaring me and my little sister Then my dad started having nightmares as well He told me that he heard a horse galloping outside the hooves of the horse hitting the pavement The thing is the last times that had happened his father and grandmother had died This happened three times in a row Turns out one of our aunts in Korea had just passed awayMeanwhile nothing was really happening to me Then one Friday night I was at home watching TV There was Church Service that day but I was at home watching TV Now the thing is the living room is right next to the front door So if you enter the house you immediately see a staircase and to your right you would see the living room i was in the living room watching TV facing the side of the staircase next to the door I saw my basketball roll down and bounce down the stairs I ran to get it looked up and saw my sister standing at the head of the stairs I yelled at her for playing with my ball then threw it back at her Then I went back to the couch and watched Drake and Josh However because my mind was so addled with the hilariousness of Nickleodeon Comedy I failed to realize that my sister was with my parents at church and there was someone else upstairs When I realized this I ran out of the apartment as fast as my legs could carry me But then I locked myself out and got sick cause it was cold and was grounded for a week But still to this day I dont know who the fuck or what the fuck that girl was,Happened to Me,38
BumpinRapTapes,10,7,1r0hla,26,So I got a call from a telemarketer nothing weird about that really  But before I hung up the automated voice started spitting out stuff like my address age stuff like that  And then my social security number  Then a list of my room mates  And then I was concerned  I waited until the machine stopped expecting some numbers to press for more info or whatever so I could find out whats up and get myself off their call list  All the lady robot said though was The Intermed company thanks youReasonably concerned I started doing some research after ignoring a bunch of message board sites  I finally found what I think was the Intermed site in like the fifth page of results  This is all it saidIntermed is at the forefront of the organ trade market and thought processing innovations  All our services are backed with industry leading research and proven by numerous customer testimonials  Many of our customers are satisfied to the point of frequent return and we pride ourselves in maintaining our client pool  Products and services offered by our company are backed with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime maintenance all available with a phone call

and all imperfections flowing through your bloodline at a price you wont need to think twice about  Never again will the flaws of your fathers keep you from the life you deserve  Even the best and brightest are far from perfect and we strive everyday to make you the perfect human beingNothing else  White page black text  Thats it  I decided to backtrack to the message boards to see what I could find  This led me to some random sites and eventually I found a few message threads of people sharing stories similar to mine  A weird robot caller with way too much information  One guy got the call in the wee hours of the morning and totally laid a boner kill on a sweaty night with his lady  They all seemed to be on the same hunt I was except for one username that I saw pop up on a few of the sites he called himself ASimpleCipher  All this dude did was sing Intermeds praises how he and his friends had used their products and services to tremendous avail and would recommend to anyone  All very cheesy and all seemingly marketing plants  Since that was my best lead I decided to make an account on one of the thread sites and try and get in contact with himI sent him a rather aggressive message which mayve been a mistake looking back  But regardless and unsurprisingly I got no response  I decided if worse came to worse Id just deal with it when it came up  I put the whole thing in the back of my mind  For a few monthsThen ASimpleCipher responded  Heres a copy and paste of our correspondenceMe  Hey man its really obvious you work for intermed youre not fooling anyone  I want to know who you are what intermed is and how you got so much of my information  And I want MY private information deleted from your database and I want off your call list  Immediately  I will not hesitate to get a lawyer involved if this goes any furtherASimpleCipher   I appreciate your interest in my company Ben  As always customer care is a top goal at Intermed  My representatives tell me that based on market research you would be a prime candidate for our products and services  As a courtesy we like to know as much as we can about potential customers so as to provide the best quality care possible  Like you I once felt a terrible weight in my life one that rendered me incapable of reaching my full potential as a human being  When doctors could not help me mend the flaws given to me by generations past I took matters into my own hands  As it came to pass that effort is what gave way to this current business venture  You may hesitate at terminology like Thought Processing and Organ Trade but let me assure you the danger begins and ends at the television screen  So if I may Id like to draw some common ground between yourself and I  We do share many similarities  As a young man I was plagued with severe asthma like yourself from my mothers side of the family leaving me unable to compete physically with my peers  This lead me to more intellectual endeavors as I began to mature into an adult  Cruel as fate is however I soon discovered Id inherited a more severe form of my grandfathers autism  His genes riddled me with social anxiety and I was thus outcast from much of any community I was ever a member of  In spite of my flawed genetics I was only more driven to clear the blemishes of my being  Nothing I vowed would hinder my quest for perfection of the perfect human being  Given to me from my lineage however was the savvy and cunning of generations of businessmen  Years centuries it seems passed while I honed my craft and built my empire  Once one is outcast from society one develops a strong callous to sympathy  Under a mutual agreement of confidentiality between you and I I will admit to using almost every associate of mine as merely a means to my own end  Well that end is Intermed  Intermed is my true brainchild as it were  I will also admit to misleading you a bit giving the facade of a full staff under my employ  Let me assure you I am fully capable of operating this venture on my own  Let me also assure you your personal information is safe and sound as I said I only aim to ensure the best service possible  Never miss a detail is a creed I operate underEnough business however  Even a jaded outcast such as me has need for camaraderie  During my time working in the shipping industry I found myself in Northern California in the early s  My business associate at the time was a rather unstable man  Every bit of his free time it seemed he would study the art of coded language ciphers cryptograms whatever one may call them  Strangely he got me very interested in the art and it has since become a favorite hobby of mine  Of course his were much more complex than anything I cared to attempt he was also versed in astrology and loved to incorporate knowledge of the stars into his little puzzles This earned him quite the sinister reputation after we parted ways  On the other hand I preferred to leave little clues here and there woven into my business dealings  Now imagine what fun it would be if someone figured out my little puzzles  All that work of building a persona of mystery  Unravelled by a thread Id left loose for some cunning soul to pull  Really I thought someone wouldve found it by now  Even after everyone Ive tried to sell Intermeds services and products to it is you cunning lad who has finally made contact  Very clever indeed  Of course you saw my companies website  I admit it is a bit sparse a work in progress  Reducing my mission for Intermed to a single paragraph however I did put in a bit of extra effortI have been rambling though I do apologize  Thank you for inquiring about my company I hope my response has eased any concerns you may haveIntermedI really dont know what to make of this guy  It really cant be some prank the guy knew I had asthma as a kid  How  I have to say that Ive never experienced such an air of creepiness from pure text  Something about the way he composed his message was off  I dont know  I cant make a lot of sense out of any of this  I stopped my investigation there being as I have seen too many horror movies and dont like the idea of rabbit holes  Its been a few months since and I havent heard anything from Intermed or ASimpleCipher  I check the thread site every now and then  I did go back and check out the Intermed website again  Im really not one for puzzles I cant make anything out of it  So Im submitting it here to see if someone is more cunning than me  I hope so  Anyway that about wraps it up sorry for the length Ive been staying in lately as my asthma has been returning so Ive kind of been alone with my thoughts,A Simple Cipher,33
zombiebunny,9,13,1qu3ux,25,Eyes are stunning They hold your personality your spirt If you look into the iriss of someones eyes you can see the flaps of color that look like the underside of a mushroom If you look at just the right angle you can see the color change as the light hits it differently If you hold the eye up and turn it around the tendons holding onto the eye when pulled will slowly rip away and create the sweet sound of ripping flesh as the eye tears from the tendon if you follow the tendon it will eventually lead to the brain But theres about something the eyes that excites me I cant help myself but to collect them Many eyes blue green and brown sometimes if I get lucky Ill find a amber one those are my favorite The last eyes I got were a marvelous bright blue The woman I got them from was just as beautiful She had blonde hair and a starfish tattoo on her shoulder Her screams they were like a symphony of nails on a chalkboard Her gorgeous eyes flicked from side to side she was terrified Soon she would be with me forever She screamed and clawed at me when I cut her face the blood dripping from the wound and pooling at the hollow of her neck They never like me taking their eyes In fact they dont like me at all I ignore them and keep my collection after all their spirits will stay with me forever Inside glass jars filled with alcohol,Eyes,38
unforgivingcake,3,14,1qx58h,23,My best friends older sister is pretty InstafamousCaroline has always been fashionforward and very selfaware Ever since Ive known my best friend weve either admired or resented her sister with little middle ground Any time my friend would have sleepovers wed all listen with our ears pressed against the wall to all of Carolines multiple hourslong phone calls and listen to her flirting and giggling This was when she was in Jr High We hardly ever saw Caroline when she was in high school because shed always be off with one of her many suitors or all her friends at some underage clubNow that Instagram has become a thing Caroline has bested us all at that as well She does the weekday themes and hashtagthis and hashtagthat Caroline was big on the leggy shots in a bathtub or holding a beer up next to her giant sunglasses by a pool or snapping a quick photo of her halfeaten salad  sofullInstagram has become an epidemic Its everywhere with its shitty filters and the paragraphs of tags Caroline was no exception to this truthfully neither was I but Im not as fond of my face as she is and now she has nearly k followers the majority of them people shes never met all liking photos of her bellybutton ring and the new bikini she boughtThis past August Caroline moved to New York for an internship She never calls home so my friends family has hardly heard anything from her If they want to reach Caroline they just log onto Facebook or her Instagram and make sure shes alive Eventually shell respond to their missed calls with a short text call u lr xoThen sometime in the middle of October my friend got a call from Caroline early in the morning It was sometime around  AM she told me and Caroline sounded frightened She was telling my friend all about this guy just some guy shed met at a book signing shed gone to and how he hadnt left her alone for daysWhen my best friend called Caroline back the next afternoon she didnt answer but a few hours later insisted everything was fine through texts and that she and this guy were going out for dinner that nightRolling her eyes my friend turned her phone to me that night and showed me Carolines Instagram It was a photo of two plates and candles in between and two glasses of red wine  classybitch wino WoodyWe both assumed Woody was this creep shed been referring to My friend joked he must have had enough cash to sway Carolines decision and over the next few days there were more photos and more hashtags to comeCaroline hadnt called my friend back and not unsually she wasnt returning any of their mothers phone calls either Still her Instagram was active with pictures of two pairs of feet propped up on Carolines coffee table with cozy Woody Another the next day was a picture of a cabin with a long porch surrounded by woods Carolines car was parked next to the cabin and it was tagged cabininthewoods vacay WoodyNothing was too unusual until my friend and I were browsing at the mall and she showed me a picture of Caroline lying on a mattress Her hand was propped under her head her eyes closed and she was wearing a plain white dress that was strangely out of season for Caroline sweetdreams WoodyIts so fucking weird my best friend had said Its like shes going to marry this guy or something And how sleazy is that to just snap a picture of her and put it on her InstagramAt first Id assumed my friend was jealous We were both jealous of Caroline a lot of the time I mean shed gotten to go to NYC she was gorgeous and my best friends parents were practically paying for her to live in her apartmentThe following week there were countless calls being made to Carolines phone My friend had pointed out how odd Carolines new guy was and her mom went into fullpanic mode This time however Caroline didnt even reply in texts It was like this guy was brainwashing her Maybe hed convinced her to cut ties with her family She hadnt updated her Facebook in a while eitherA couple of days went by without any word when there was another picture This time it was of wooden beams a concrete wall and stacked boxes WoodyIs she moving in with him My friend wonderedThen another the same day This time the picture was of the same mattress as before but it was in a corner on the floor Next to the mattress was an iron spike that had been lodged into the cement and around it was latched a thick chain The chain was pulled taut out of the picture WoodyThis sort of outoftheordinary situation when reading it in this context seems like a cause for alarm At the time it was definitely alarming but didnt seem like enough to report to my friends mom People were still liking these photos That last one had at least something likes before my friend even showed meOver the next few days the pictures continued but nothing stuck out until the one of a stove with a pan that had two eggs frying in it and two mugs of coffee on the counter next to it Behind the cups there was a bottle of chloroform WoodyWe told Carolines mom and then the police There was a huge debacle and the cops telling them there was nothing they could do about it These photos didnt prove a single thing They were obscure and more than likely a ploy for attention Besides the office said  people liked itMy friends family packed up a few bags and bought plane tickets If anything Caroline would have a big surprise when she got home that eveningThat day I kept up with Carolines Instagram account The final photo before I got a call from my friend was of two pairs of feet sidebyside One pair was shackled at the ankles the other in shiny brown loafers The shackled feet were bare and pale and bruised and the toenails were painted a hot pink cozy love WoodyThe call that night was unsettling My friend was tearful and told me that Carolines apartment was unlocked when they got there The inside was trashed and there was spoiling food in the garbage with flies everywhere and dishes piled She said it was like Caroline hadnt been home in weeksTheir family went to the police in NYC and filed a missing persons report a week ago Their father got himself a hotel room and both my friend and her mom came back I havent seen either of them and the whole family has been trying to deal with this privately but all of Carolines friends on Facebook have been leaving concerned messages and everyday theres a new photo with new likes and always signed Woody ,Woody,37
yurglar,6,11,1r6zsn,22,Under the BedIm writing this because I simply cannot sleep and theres something I really need to tell someone and I find this reddit to be a good place to do so It is something that is not what youd consider in the domain of classical horror stories like zombies or ghosts It is not because it was and Im afraid still is real It is so real that it happened  years ago when I was only  on a cold morning of December As you can see not the night of st October Just the placid boring morning of th December I was in bed and I knew my parents were already out they liked going on morning jogs together It was a Sunday and my head was throbbing I have frequent migraines and that th December migraine was particularly bad So there I was feeling shitty and thinking about lunch when I moved and my bed creaked The house was old like proper old and we had just moved in in this regard that part of my life did sound like the beginning of a cliché horror story I thought it was just temporary anyway once dad left his job we would leave to CaliforniaWhen I was a kid I had this habit of putting a pillow over my face when I had a migraine normally one of those useless small pillows always hanging around They were always cold and the cold felt good on my forehead and cheeks It might sound a bit stupid to you but to me it felt good for a few seconds On th December I did this and suddenly I could not remove the pillowI tried to remove it with all my strength and whoever whatever was pushing down gave in It was more or less the strength of a skinny teenager I started panicking scared my legs twisting and my heartbeat shooting through the roof I didnt even wonder what was happening I managed to catch a breath and then it happened all of a sudden I heard the light switch of my room go out and the blinds closing violently and the pressure on the pillow suddenly increased Twice then tenfold It was no longer the strength of a human being but something else I felt my mind slowdown from the lack of oxygen and I stopped fighting I felt a strange calm wash over me Whatever was killing me was impossible to fight it was like there was a ton of stone over that pillow I saw a light my vision going white and then tunneling and I heard whispers I was dying I felt scared then I put my hands over the pillow but there was nothing there and I only felt the hairs of my arms standing up My hands were not smashed as I expected My young brain could not make sense of it but I remember being scared really scared Thats when I heard a barkMy dog Thor had heard me twist and struggle in bed and had come to my lucky rescue The pressure immediately disappeared the blinds opened and the light turned on and thats when I felt it sliding over my right arm like a hand caressing it but a dead hand callous and cold hand and I felt it whatever it was turning and hiding under the bed like a snake hiding under a rock Thor kept barking madly teeth showing and ears back He was a German shepherd huge for the standards Then he neared my bed looked under my bed growling and then stopped He sniffed once then twice looked again under the bed and then climbed on top of the bed and licked my face where I laid regaining my breath and control over my limbs which had gone a bit numb I remember hugging Thor and almost cryingI told it to my parents but they did not believe me they thought it was the migraines and started talking about a psychologist or psychiatrist and bad grades at school I remember being angry with their reaction but over time it faded It took some time for me to sleep again and Thor always slept in my room sometimes even with me but there were never any more issues I never even remembered it from time to time it was just a scary traumatic memory my brain just erased For  years I slept over that memory over whatever was under my bedWe moved out a month ago after  years to a new modern house in California where my bed doesnt even have space under it and I love it My dad sold the house to this young couple who were his friends who didnt have much money but loved the retro feeling of the house Back then I didnt even remember that scary event  years agoThats when as I was laying on my new bed yesterday I remembered along with all my morning nightmare details  years ago my dad complaining the other day at dinner table how John and Mary the young couple havent phoned or said anything about the house since they started living thereI went to get Thor in my bedroom I cant stop thinking about it and I hope they are alright,Under the Bed,33
SwordOfCielmor,1,7,1qv4w6,22,As a kid I wasnt allowed any video games My parents were firmly of the theyll rot your brain and make you a serial killer camp and nothing could convince them otherwise We had a computer though and I was allowed more or less unlimited internet use I quickly became hooked on browser games you know the kind amateur games made in Flash or Java Id scour various sites for them quickly building a large collection of favoritesI cant remember the name of the site I found Sword of Cielmor on The main page had a light purple background and there were two columns with descriptions and thumbnails of the most popular games Basically it was every Flash game site ever Most of the games were pretty generic there were Tetris and Snake clones and a few platformers and rhythm games My favorite section of the site though was its collection of pseudoRPGs Most were fairly simple and extremely short each game was one chapter and despite promises of updates I never saw any series go higher than four of these chaptersId played through all the games in that section and was about to move onto a new site when I checked on a whim to see if any new games had been added I didnt really expect to find anything updates were rare but it was my lucky day three new games had been added One was a puzzle game similar to Minesweeper one was a trivia game with only twenty or so questions and the last was Sword of CielmorIt was a fairly typical turnbased RPG set in a fantasy world You could choose from several characters I cant remember all of them but I do recall a knight a mage and a healer I picked the knight like I always did and began my adventure to obtain the mythical Sword of Cielmor and rescue the princess who had been kidnapped by an evil overlord who had previously usurped the throneMy adventure started uneventfully I traveled through a cave and then a labyrinthlike forest killing various monsters before night fell That was an interesting mechanic the game had after a certain amount of time passed day would turn to night and your character would pull out a tent and go to sleep The screen would go black and white text would give a recap of what youd done that day It was a neat feature but a little annoying because the days werent all that long and I had no problem remembering what Id doneThe following day I emerged from the forest and began traveling across a field that was said to lead to my next location a town After killing a few more monsters a soldier employed by the evil overlord appeared It wasnt an especially difficult battle The soldier was defeated his sprite vanished and I continued to go on my way until night fellThis time instead of the typical You made it through the forestdefeated ten monsters text the game began to tell me about the soldier Id killed Apparently he had two children and a wife He hadnt wanted to become a soldier but there werent many opportunities in the small village hed come from He was scared every day he was sent out to patrol and he had no clue that the king was evil In his last moments before Id skewered him with my sword hed thought about how it had all been pointless that his children would grow up without a father that there would be no money to pay for food or rentAnd then the text shifted to the wife and children and how they would eventually be left on the streets The mother would die first of an unexplained sickness It would come quickly for her but the starvation of the children would be long slow drawn out their last moments would be spent wondering whyThere was a quick flicker and I saw the sprite of the soldier a few pixels of red on his chest representing blood alongside a female sprite and two smaller ones flash across the screen before fading into nothingnessAnd then suddenly it was day again and I was back on the fieldI remember being disturbed but not disturbed enough to stop playing Honestly but I was a little impressed These games had never been known for their stirring stories or sense of realism and the fact that the games creator had gone the extra mile to make it a little more well for lack of a better word meaningful made me want to keep playing even if I did think perhaps hed laid it on a bit thickThe game continued I reached the town stocked up on magical potions and equipment and headed west toward the castle where the princess and the mythical Sword of Cielmor was being held On my way I came across two more soldiers and defeated both of them When night fell once more I was a bit apprehensive but morbidly curious at what the game would have to tell me about their livesThis time the game went into even more detail its been years but I still remember it vividly It told me how one of the soldiers had cried when he realized he was dying that he realized hed accomplished nothing to be proud of in his life that he wouldnt be remembered at all I remember reading that his father never forgave himself for being the one to push him to become a soldier that for every day of the rest of his life he walked across the field his son had died on wondering if there was an afterlife wishing it had been him insteadOnce more the image of the fallen soldiers flickered across the screen but this time the graphics were slightly better not at all realistic but less blocky and amateurish than the previous spritesBy this point I didnt want to keep playing but well I wasnt about to stop I needed to know what would happen I couldnt look away Several more days passed as my journey continued and the stories of the soldiers of the rogue bandits of the mercenaries I killed grew longer and longer I read a description of a daughter growing up without her father and how one day she saw a man in a crowd that looked so much like him that for a momentShed gone home and simply cried wishing she could turn back time wishing she had known in advance wishing she could have changed thingsThe graphics were getting better and better but only during these sequences only when I was learning about the people Id killed and their loved ones I wasnt only seeing their corpses now I was seeing quick glimpses of their lives before they died I saw the soldier with his father the father beaming with pride at his newly adult child I saw the children who would later go hungry running through the back alleyways of a town playing tag I saw the daughter who would later long for her father taking him for granted too busy thinking of her own futureThere were witches whod spent their final moments in a numb state of disbelief that this was it that it was over There were warriors who prayed for the first time since they were young And there were families left behind or in some cases no one no one who would ever remember theyd even existedTheir faces which had originally been nothing but flesh colored pixels were becoming more and more detailed Rudimentary facial features appeared and as the graphics improved they became more and more lifelike Each person had their own traits quirks one mage had a slightly lopsided grin a soldier had a mole just below his left eye that vanished when he smiled And before they vanished into the darkness it was always the same their eyes would widen slightly and theyd realize what was about to happen Then the screen would cut to their corpses each time more real than the last and a new day would beginI found the Sword of Cielmor I rescued the princess I completed the journey bit victory music played as the sprite of a princess kissed my heros cheek and thanked him for his bravery The music swelled to its peak the screen faded to black and the game ended or at least I thought it did As I moved the mouse over the back button the game faded back in to the hero sitting in a chair in an empty room completely alone The princess was nowhere to be seen It was just the hero the Sword of Cielmor at his feet silent unmoving The music stopped and after nearly a minute passed I was certain that the game had frozenBut no it was fading to the people Id killed and their families one last time only this time it looked so real that I could have sworn I was looking at photographs of dismembered men and women There was an image of a man bent over another staring at his mutilated body both faces blank and uncomprehending The two children who would later starve to death sat side by side on the street their bodies emaciated the younger one confused while the older one tried her hardest to protect her little brother clearly frightened herself It all looked so real to this day Im not sure if I was looking at actual photographs I dont want to believe they wereI closed the browser window and left the room I went outside I tried to forget what Id seen Over the next few days I managed to half convince myself that it had been a dream or a hallucination until finally I couldnt take it anymore and went back to the site Nothing had changed It was the same website with the same light purple background and the same two columns of games But now there were only two new games instead of three the Minesweeper clone and the trivia game remained but Sword of Cielmor was goneOver the years Ive tried to find it again but no one has ever heard of it Maybe I did hallucinate it But either way I cant stop thinking about the people of the game and of the photographs I keep trying to tell myself that it was someone with a sick sense of humors idea of playing a joke I keep trying to tell myself the the photographs were fake or staged I didnt do anything wrong I didnt kill anyone All I did was play a simple poorly made browser gameAnd yet I still feel guilty,Sword of Cielmor,29
Chenigin,7,9,1r6b7r,20,When I was ten my parents divorced Soon after I moved into an old house in Orange County CA with my mother and stepfather This house had a nice floor plan but needed major work With all the remodeling being done to the house it was not uncommon for my step father to walk around at night to check up on and see how the house was holding up One night I was laying in bed when I heard heavy footsteps outside my bedroom window My room was located at the side of the house Me being young and naïve I automatically thought it was my step dad I heard the footsteps walk into the garage and enter the house via the garage door I knew this was the time to go to the restroom because well their was an adult and he could protect me from my fears of the dark When I heard the footsteps walk past my door I slowly opened my door and called out my step fathers name At the same time I stuck my head out my door and saw the back of a boot I never saw before turn the hallway corner This made me reconsider how safe it was to go take a leak I heard a sound in the kitchen the distinct sound of the drawers opening and a hand shuffling through its contents After what seemed like an eternity I decided to call out to my stepfather again this time slowly creeping out of my room so I can get to the corner of the hallway As soon as I started to edge forward I heard the heavy footsteps make a b line straight for the front door I started to pick up my pace so I could get a good view of who it could be When I got to where I could get a good view of the door I saw something I would never forget The door slammed shut and the lock turn to the lock position As if someone had the key and was locking it from the outside By then my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I ran to the door to see if I could see who was in our house When I opened the door I saw nothing No sight of someone running away no evidence of anyone ever being there in the first place Just  year old me standing in the dark Suddenly the fight or flight instinct kicked in again but instead its the opposite instinct fuck Im ten I am by myself in the dark someone just broke into the house I slammed the door shut and ran into my mothers room My stepfather right away called the cops and propped a chair to the front door and the garage door so even if someone had the key they could not open it The cops showed up and didnt find a single thing No footprints nothing My mother turned on me and said it was just my childish imagination making up things I started to doubt myself after the years Chucking it as what my mom said my youthful imagination I am  now I dont sleep walk nor have I ever If it was a dream I never had one like that ever since If anyone has any ideas on what I might of experienced please I am all ears I always wondered what other people would have to say about this Glad to have found Reddit thats for sure ,Still think about this all the time,29

theunlockeddoor,2,9,1r1j47,19,I work at a public library and I really need to write about this  Yeah boring LibrariansBlah I know  This is probably going to be tldr and dull  I know Im supernew to reddit but I really need to get this out of my system and Id feel weird posting about this anywhere else  So mock me for my noobness but I really need to talkAnd aside from sexy librarian sterotypes you ought to know that the people checking books out from behind the desk have to deal with all sorts of people  People checking out books about livestock and winking and grinning at you too much and women tearyeyed avoiding your gaze checking out books about abuse or divorce  Were sort of like bartenders but without the convenience of bouncers  So when I tell you that meeting this one particular guy kept me up at night you ought to know that its not because I have a simple dusty job This is a story about  person I met through my job  Its also a story told to me by that person  When I came in to work one morning my boss was wandering around the workroom looking disgusted  She kept going between the bathroom and her desk trying to work but getting nauseous every so often  Apparently when shed rolled up in the parking lot that morning shed found something on the pavementA wet set of denturesWe all laughed at how weird that was and set the things gingerly on a pad of paper towels in the backroom  No way were we putting a pair of raw dentures in the lost and found tub  We forgot about them before lunchLater that day though this guy came in  I ended up knowing him as Irmas NephewHe limped in and asked if we had any books about dentistry  I told him I didnt know where to find them off the top of my head and proceeded to do a search on the computer  As I typed things in and scanned our holdings he kept staring at me  His eyes seemed too large and white popping out against his skin  He kept chewing his lips and the sides of his cheeks  It was so fierce so intense and obsessive it looked painfulThen he said Teeth  Cmon gimme anything about teeth  How they grow  And trailed offI was rattled but I managed to scribble a number down on a scrap of paper and gesture towards the nonfiction section  He hobbled offTwenty minutes or so later it was the top of the hour and my turn to do a walkabout  Walkabouts are a thing our library system made up to make sure nobody is being harassed or molested out in the stacks  Were supposed to check all the blind spots in the building every half hourSo I was doing my walkabout when I spotted Irmas Nephew sitting on the floor between two rows of books  He glanced up at me stood and as I was moving away caught me  His hand on my wrist made me nervous but I looked back at the circ desk and saw Vikki watching us like a hawk  Somehow this made me brave  He told me he needed my help that these books werent helping  So I asked him what else I might look up for himNo he said I need to talk to you to someone to someone to anyone  My aunt she  And he trailed off eyes buggingSadly money doesnt reach superfar in the library world and I hadnt been trained on how to properly treat a mentally ill patron  As a fail safe I went with gentleness since he had a hard grip on my wristSo I asked him to talk to me looking back over my shoulder at VikkiThis is the best version I can write of the garbled story he told me  I could just say And then he told me a spooky story but that wouldnt explain why Im jumpy I apologize that this is long but Im trying to get this out in an accurate wayIve got an Aunt named Irma and she pretty much raised me  Shes like my mother but shes been gettin on gettin on you know and recently shes been forgetting things  I need these books for her  Shes got a problem  A real strange thing goin onLast summer she got all her teeth pulled  Got dentures instead  And she hated them said they always felt funny in her mouth and I TOLD HER wed go get them refit recast but shed still hate them  Shed just spit them right out onto the carpet and glare at me with her mouthskin all sunkin and puckered up  Im the only one of the family that visited her anymore  So that meant she blamed me  I was the only one around to be hateful to  FuckIn June she started doin this thing where shed say she lost her dentures  Whenever I went over to see her shed lost them and Id scold her because dentures are damn expensive  Pardon me  But shed say its no problem and grin big  Id look all over turn the house upside down and not be able to find them  Shed say Theyll turn up in notime and wave her hand at me like this  The weird thing is that they would  Id come over again and shed have them back in  Clack them at me and laugh  Everytime  Clack clack clack  And laugh  Clack clackShe uh she just kept losing them  I tried talking to her neighbor down the stairs Lucy to try and help her out  Lucy is a nice woman and said shed check on her when she got the chance  And she did good  When I hadnt been able to visit in a few days Id get a text or call from Lucy lettin me know everythings alright with Miss Irma  Only I got into a car wreck  Was laid up in the hospital doped out of my brain on pain killers for whoknowshowlong  Doctor said Id broken my thighbone  I didnt see Miss Irma for a long time  I think I got a call from Lucy at some point but its a foggy  I remember answering and Lucy just murmuring murmuring something I couldnt understand  It must have been the drugs  It must have beenSo eventually Im better and I go over there  I try knocking on Miss Irmas door  She never gave me a key but she always bustled up and let me in  I knocked and knocked and she didnt come so I got nervous you know  I went over to Lucys then to see if she had a backup key or could call the building manager  But I when I knock on her door it just kindawhooshopensI call her name but nothin  So of course I go in cuz maybe they both in trouble  But Lucy is nowhere  Her apartment is just empty  Except just as Im leaving I see something pink on the floorHere the guy paused licking his lips again  It seemed to me he was winding up his courage or working past something particularly horribleIt was teeth maam  Dentures  A top and a bottom both  The top was kinda falling off the bottom was at an angle  Like theyd just been dropped and left  I knew Lucy didnt wear dentures so this scared me a lot because Miss Irma might be wandering around lost with her dementia  Shed started forgetting my name  She could be anywhere doing anything if she was spitting her teeth out againSo I run  Run and find the janitor that sometimes cleaned up the stairwells and he looks at me like Im crazy  He says I thought your gramma moved out last month I say No sir you are mistaken  She cant have gone nowhere  And he says Well I aint seen you nor her in that time  And I argue with him but eventually he comes with me and unlocks the door   Inside Miss Irmas the tv was on but she wasnt in her chair where shed sit for hours and watch tv  I mean shed sat there so much it had left an impression her shape  But that wasnt all she left  She also left her teeth He was giggling a bit hysterically at this pointNo not the ones in Lucys place  These were different  These were more  These were MORE  All over  Pairs and pairs of false teeth were lying all over Miss Irmas apartment  They were on bookshelves and on the kitchen table  The biggest pile was around her chair  I was confused at first  There was no way she could have collected all these teeth by herself  I certainly only bought her the two pairs  She didnt have no friends to bring her sets of teeth teeth teeth teeth teeth  And they were different too  As in some were little  Like tiny white baby teeth just little gappy chips  And others were big and wide and long  And some of the sets I dont know how they could fit in a persons mouth  they were full of fangs and tusks andAnd it makes no sense  I can only come up with one idea  She was on her own for a month except for Lucy  I know Lucy didnt bring her all those teeth  The only thing I can think is that she was growing them back herself  That every time she had lost and found her dentures before shed just thrown them away and grown a new pair in her mouth  Then that set would fall out and shed grow more  And then they must have started growing strange in her mouth  And shes gone off somewhere wandering wandering I cant find her I dont  I need help for herI peeled his hand off and somehow got out of there  I went back and handed him some paper I think had a number for psychiatric help on it  Really I went back to the staff bathroom and sat against the wall for a while breathing and feeling really strange in my stomachWhen I left work I had to pass the set of dentures my boss found in the parking lot that morning  I found myself staring at them ,Sets of Teeth,28

BiohazardTyrant,3,8,1r4rao,20,So to begin I was eleven years old I believeMy father had brought me to a friend of his house Or rather farmI was excited because I had befriended the son of my fathers friend for stories sake I will call him James James had a older brother who was a year and a half older so I was eleven James was twelve and his brother thirteen We had all played around the barn and fields plenty of times before This time though it was a celebration of some sort I wish I could remember why but anyway they had been in this house on this farm for about half a year Tonight was the big party as in the most vivid thing I remember about that night The cut off pigs head Literally just cut right off and sitting on a support beam about shoulder high to the adults The body was dangling from a chain for a while until they skewered it onto a metal pole and roasted it whole over a fireI really wish I could remember why they were doing that but sadly I cannot In any case me James and his brother were just running around like we always did like idiots They had all of the farm as a playground and plenty of space to play We began by walking over to the stalls where they kept the horses and cattle The sheds were HUGE and seemed to be endless to a younger kid as myself After about a half an hour of walking through corridors left and right in the dark we started hearing noises but not normal ones Like chains being hit on metal and slammed into the ground then grunts We all took off running following James brother who quickly let out out to the closest exit None of us knew what the sounds were because of the fact the farm had been out of commission for about thirty years Nothing alive should have been in there We quickly made out way back to the farm house the big one where all the adults were partying and tried to talk to them about it but of course they had all had a drink or three and ignored us laughing it off as childish imagination For some reason Some stupid god forsaken reason James said we should go back out and just play in the field where there was a little light away from the adults and we listened Once the three of us were out there it turned into a I dare you to go out in the field gameWe each took turns going farther and farther out into the night Finally we all ended up ignoring the occurrences from earlier and started playing hide and seek Bad idea Very badJames and I were hiding in the tall grass near the side end of the barn and his brother came running out faster than I have ever seen anyone run screaming bloody murder to get away as fast as we could get to the adults James and I ran to him and stopped dead in our tracks quickly seeing why he had been fleeing There we were James his brother and I all standing still like sacks of meat staring to the treeline where we saw it There were three if I remember correctly faces All white and elongated just weirdly shaped about six feet off the ground and then came the true horror the glint off the blades they were holding We all ranFaster and faster we ranI turned around two times and I regret it to this day for the fact they were even closer than I thought blades outstretched trying to mince us up and drag us back into those hellish woods We finally made it to the adults The only thing I remember after that was that damn pig head cut off and just sitting there I could see the spine and every last vein we tried telling the adults but they just laughed None of us left the main barn after that for the rest of nightAbout a week later my friend Chris came over and had the worst part to share with me He had been having these night terrors of these creatures tearing at him and chasing him through his own new homeThen he told me his family had left the farm and moved to the cityThen he told me why He was attackedThen he showed me and lifted his shirt up showing me a scar which I know he did not have before because we used to swim together all the time He never had a mark there a week before But now across his stomach he had a fully healed scar of about ten inches going from left to right like he had been gutted But the scariest fact like I said was that it had not been there one night then he woke up with that kind of scar His family moved because of that that day And never returned to that farmI have long since lost touch with him he became very paranoid after that and I just cant forget thatFigured I would share it with the community I do hope if any of you take anything away from this if you see a creature with a white face long arms and a huge blade by a treeline Run just run And try to forget about it,A tale of a Farm and three young kids,28
buffalowing,6,9,1r337b,19,I probably cant tell a great story but I can tell you what I saw last fall I was outside admiring my garden that runs along the side of the house I froze as soon as I looked towards the front of the house I saw something short maybe  feet walking on two legs It was walking in the direction of my porch or front of the house I thought it was kinda strange since I live out in the suburbs and something like this would easily be noticed by any of my neighbors The funny part is we both made eye contact it noticed that I was looking straight at it As soon as it did it ran away and I ran after it When I turned the corner there was nothing I ran around the whole house just in case it was running circles around my house Nada So yeah I saw that once No biggie since I havent seen it again or it hasnt messed with my garden Here is a small image of the scenario and what I sawhttpimgurcomQarl,Random thing in my front yard,28

gabsgirl,11,5,1qtkjz,20,I was walking around at am one morning because I do that type of thing I was walking and listening to music on my mp player and zoned out I had just been dumped by my girl and was feeling like shit But I was finally on the street heading home I was walking and felt strange a sense of pure fucking dread entered my stomach and made me stop dead in my tracks directly under a street light The headphones were still in my ear and the music was blasting but it seemed like complete silence The street I live on is off of Main street and not a lot of traffic goes on it during the day its a little hidden I was standing by the bridge on this street If I took my headphones out I might have had a warning I felt a tap on my shoulder I turned around to see this girl who looked about my age I was  at the time and she was looking down She had light brown hair and was a little taller than me She wore a red hoodie and a pair of blue jeans so it was nothing out of the ordinary and I instantly felt a little calmer even though the dread still settled in my stomach She was dressed like me not identical but like me So I figured maybe someone had scared her or something with the way she was looking down with her hands in her pockets Can I come home with you I need to use the phone and call my mother She needs to know where I am thats what she said to me and her voice was strong and clear It was weird because she said she needed to use the phone and didnt have one of her ownYou dont have a cell phone I asked she shook her head and said it didnt hold a charge very well and she had discovered it was dead I cant really let you in my house My dad is sleeping and I kind of sleep in the living room right now I said to her This is when I freaked the fuck out she looked up at me and I couldnt even see her eyes It was just black black pupils I stood there frozen eyes locked with hers and finally I turned to run I hate to say it but I just ran I tried to run all the way home but suddenly I felt something hit me on the side of my head and it stunned me and the person was able to pull me to the ground The weight on me wasnt that heavy and the hands were grabbing at my pockets I screamed at the top of my lungs and jumped up I turned to see a shorter man staring at me with normal eyes I just stood there stunned and than I screamed GET OUT OF HERE he turned and ran and I followed him because I could still see the girl in the distance He ran by her with me screaming at her to run and still chasing the man and she jumped out of the way with a terrified screech at the top of her lungsI ran to her thinking nothing of the black eyes or the feeling of dread and helped her up she had fallen She looked at me and her eyes were normal She looked a little dazed and said I need to go It was still in a clear and somewhat angry voice I let her go Are you okay I asked I started to help brush her off but still felt fearful She looked at me and her eyes looked black again I instantly let go of her and stepped backThanks for the help I need to go now she said in that clear and scary tone I backed up a little more and felt fear over take me but the thing is she wasnt even looking at me now Well remember this is all she said She walked away and I just stood there stupidly and watched her fucking leave I walked back home that night my head reeling I dont know what happened to the man who had tackled me and I never saw that girl again I did do some research though and found that there is something called black eyed children the only thing that doesnt match up is this girls eyes went from normal to black it looked like I had just hit my head so maybe I was seeing things She did ask to come to my house but the feeling of dread was a little more calm after that dude tried to mug me I dont know what happened that nightSometimes I look outside at night and see children walking down the street which is odd for this time of night and year Sometimes they look at the house and I have to reassure myself I didnt see black eyes But I dont feel dread so thats a good thing I dont know maybe they just watch maybe Ill let them in if they knockand they are those black eyed children The girl didnt attack me or anything She just walked away ,I have no idea what this was,25
cmd,4,5,1r2xzg,18, unexplainable experiences are not completely abnormal for me Every house or apartment that Ive lived in Ive seen or heard something that would make a lot of people hide under a blanket or leave the house all together The man at my window was one story of mine that never fails to make whoever I tell shudder so I figured Id share it hereIt began when I was  or  years old We lived in an older house but not one that would instantly stand out as creepy or unusual We didnt live in the middle of nowhere but rather on a street lined with houses on both sides of the road It was a fairly quiet neighborhood the kind where the rare car that came down the street would often break up a game of football or hockey that was being played by the kids that inhabited almost every house It wasnt perfect but it was great I was a very happy child One night I was plagued by a very odd yet equally terrifying nightmare I dreamt that I was in my bed in the room that I shared with my older sister I sat up and looked out of the window that was next to my bed which sat in the one corner of my bedroom flush against the wall The window overlooked the back yard and in that yard stood a man He wore a long black coat a widebrimmed black hat that hid his face from me and a black suit On his shoulder there sat a very large black bird with red eyes I stared at him for what seemed like forever before he looked up at my window The only features of his face that I could see were his eyes which were a deep red just like the birds Just as he made eye contact with me the bird left his shoulder and flew straight at my window When the bird got to the point where it would have inevitably smashed through the window and probably eaten me I woke up I was on my side facing my sisters bed that was situated in the exact same position as mine but on the opposite side of the room I stared at her as she slept soundly terrified and unable to go back to sleep I decided that the only way I would get any rest was by looking out my window and proving to myself that the man wasnt really there so I rolled over and sat up My curtains were already pulled to the sides of the window since my bedroom was on the second floor of a house in a decent neighborhood  we didnt really worry about anyone trying to peep on my sister and me The second I looked at the window he was there Even though he was impossibly directly outside my window  close enough that he should have left fog with his breath I still couldnt see any features of the mans face except his blood red eyes I did what many children would do I laid back down and threw my blankets over my head I eventually fell back asleep despite being scared out of my mindThe man visited me several times a month for several years after that always just staring at me through my window during the darkest parts of the night When my sister moved out I started sleeping in her bed  across the room and away from the window I didnt see the man anymore One day I was cleaning my room in preparation for my friend to sleep over that night I knelt on my old bed still there for when we had guests  to clean the window I pulled the curtain aside as a teenager now I valued my privacy and saw a handprint on the glass It was bigger than my own but I didnt think anything of it I had assumed one of my friends had left it there I sprayed the cleaner and wiped it away with the paper towel but the handprint remained A little grossed out I went over it again a little harder to scrub the print away It was still there That was when I realized that despite not seeing him anymore I still received visits from the man with the red eyes The hand print was on the outside of the window,the man at my window,23
quietgrl,5,7,1qvoaz,17,I have been experiencing some strange things for a while including some kind of phantom that haunted my shower Im happy to report that I havent been awaken by the sounds of running water or a man whistling in the bathroom the past few nights Maybe I was just imagining it or dreaming it like my friends and family have been suggestingHowever I get this deep anxious feeling in the pit of my stomach that whatever is happening to me  its not really over and only escalating It feels like things are just getting started in some kind of twisted cosmic joke set at my expense Ever since my last post I had this feeling that the other shoe was about to fall and my instincts seem to be rightLast night I was leaving from my job at the local shopping center and heading for my car in the parking lot when I noticed a man standing by another vehicle two rows away Its not uncommon to see a few latenight shoppers around this time heading home with their last minute items but something about this guy was off He was kind of attractive tall with bronze skin and long dark curly hair not overly thin nor tall Honestly I wouldnt have noticed him if he was within a crowd but the thing that stood out about him was the smile that he gave me His initial response to my eye contact with him was that of a little confusion but then he smiled very brightly a lot satisfied that I had noticed him standing thereIt would have been an innocent kind of situation except his smiled seemed a lot creepy and a bit unnatural The corners of his lips seemed to stretch a little too wide than it should for a human smile his teeth were a lot too white and bright under the dull lighting of the street lamp nearby His huge brown eyes were unblinking still and lifeless and it reminded me of the eyes of a dead fish within a markets display He said nothing to me at all just stared and smiledI didnt want to be rude so I nodded his way in acknowledgment of his smile and then quickly got into my car I didnt make eye contact with him again quickly started my car sped out of the parking lot and on my way home Somehow the whole encounter caused me to feel frighten and I wondered if I was just losing my mind or becoming paranoidWhile driving and switching to the local music station my heart began to slowly return back to its normal pace I had laughed at myself for being so jittery lately and vowed to cut back on my coffee intake from now onAfter ten minutes of driving I pulled my car into the driveway of the house which I am currently staying with my sister and mutual friend I had a few bags within the trunk items that I had bought at the shopping center on my lunch break It wasnt anything special just a few new towels and a couple of boxes of cereal Besides the freaky unexplained happenings I pretty much live a boring and uneventful lifeI grabbed the two small bags from the trunk of my car slammed it shut then took a moment to glance towards the house across from the one Im staying I was hoping to get a glimpse of the handsome neighbor who I sometimes speak with his name is Charlie He wasnt on his front deck as he sometimes was and I could see no lights within the windows of his home Maybe Charlie was still at work or possibly asleep I would have to wait until some other time to chat with himAs I was having this usual and mundane thought I felt as if something was watching me from behind I have a hard time explaining this feeling well so please be patient with me but it was like I felt some kind of presence or heat behind me It was like I could feel a breath on the back of my neck or feel someone moving behind me although my rational mind was pointing out the fact that I didnt hear footsteps on pavement I turned around and gave a startled yelp as I saw the same man from the parking lot standing a few steps away from me He was staring and smiling at meI gulped in a quick and shallow breath regaining my composure and replied to him lightly Im sorry you scared me I didnt hear you walking up behind me The man didnt say anything didnt blink didnt seem to breath He just stood there staring and smiling at me I felt a lot uncomfortable and uneasy about this as the air around us seemed to be a lot too still as if we were standing within some kind of unseen bubble that locked the rest of the world outSir I said trying my best to keep my voice from wavering May I help you Is there something that you want The man didnt reply standing there like an unmoving mannequin staring and smiling Do you live here I asked trying to get some kind of human response In this neighborhood I mean Are you lost He said nothing his cold and lifeless dead eyes locked into a stare that seemed to be looking straight through me  And his smileit was stretched too far for it to be real it almost looked like some kind of creepy Halloween mask My skin crawled and I gave up on being polite I turned without another word and promptly sprinted towards the door of my house Its a good thing that my sister never feels the need to lock the doors in this part of town because I didnt have to fumble with the keys in the door as if I was within some kind of bad horror movie I simply pushed open the door and ran inside quickly slamming the door behind me Once I was on the other side of the door I did lock it dropping my bags on the first stair of the short staircase that lead to the living room aboveI dont know why but curiosity got the better of me and I decided to take a look through the side window of the door Cold dead and fishlike brown eyes stared back at me That unnatural smile stretched even more in a silent chuckle as the man pressed his face just inches away from the glass I screamed and fell backwards falling on my backside with an audible thump on the floor My sister overhead and came running What happened Theres a creepy man outside I shrieked scrambling away from the window He followed me from the parking lot Hes out there and peering into the window My sister rushed to take a look and I reached up tugging at her shirt sleeve No Dont do that Just call the police However she ignored me and looked out there anyway After a short pause she smirked Theres no one out thereI couldnt believe it as I scrambled on all fours towards the window looking out to find that the man wasnt there anymore But my voice wavered as I shook uncontrollably He was there he was right there in the window I saw him Im not crazy and Im not making it up Maybe he left she shrugged her tone unconvinced Maybe he heard us screaming inside and decided to leave before we called the cops Maybe I said unable to stop myself from staring out into the empty pathway for a whileI dont know who that man was or what he wanted Im very scared that he may return and what he may do to me I will no longer take night shifts at work if I can help it And if I have to I will ask my sister to come drive me home from work just in case the man with the creepy smile does return I will also make sure that the doors and windows of the house are locked before I sleep at night Maybe I am going crazy,The Man With The Creepy Smile,24
meltedroad,3,12,1qssb7,20,This happened well over a decade ago when I was still in junior high  My family had moved into a new neighborhood just north of the city  My parents chose that bungalow primarily because of the large lot  Before we moved into the house I recall my parents making remarks about how they wanted my brother and I to be able to have a proper backyardWe moved in on the first of September I was very excited about the move  Since I could remember my brother and I always shared a bedroom with the new house we would finally each get our own space  My parents chose early September to move so the academics of my brother and I wouldnt be affected  especially for my brother as he was just entering high school  At first it was great our backyard was large enough for me to practice my pitching for the upcoming little league season and my brother and I finally got along well  However not long after that I started feeling very uneasy about the house  I would hear noises and creaks  When I first expressed my feelings my parents assured me that there was nothing wrong with the house that it was just the house settling and that I had simply been watching too many scary movies  The kid in me though would not believe my parents and knew something was not right My parents and brothers bedroom were on one side of the hallway my room a converted den was located on the other side  I felt alone being on the other side of the house by myself and slept in my brothers room the week after telling my parents about the noises  My brother was annoyed but accepted me into his room  After that week though I moved back into my room and everything was fine again  Until one night in October when I was woken up by footsteps I could hear the old hardwood floor creaking as the footsteps got closer to my room before finally stopping  I bolted sitting up and stared at the crack under my door  I looked at that door for minutes even though I couldnt see anything under the door  I felt an intense relief when I heard the creaking start again moving away from my door  I am not sure how it mustve been because of how young I was but I managed to almost instantly fall back asleepI mentioned the incident to my brother as we started getting along better than we ever had  He said hes heard the occasional sounds but just like my parents insisted it was just the house settling  He advised me not to bring it up to our parents as my father was getting increasingly agitated with my interest in the paranormalI accepted my brothers recommendation to not tell my parents  but I started believing the house was haunted  I avoided leaving my bedroom after I already turned in I would keep a bottle of water on my nightstand in case I got thirsty but tried my best to not use the bathroom that was down the hall  One particular night on early December I woke up in the middle of the night and knew there was no avoiding the bathroom if I wanted to fall back asleepI had not heard any strange noises recently so I felt brave enough to cross the hallway to the main bathroom  On my way back I saw something on the corner of my eye  Imagine seeing a shadow of your hand cast against a wall but the wall is far away not quite a distinct shadow but more of a subtle shade  We had a night light in the kitchen to make it easier to use the bathroom at night  that light was what was causing the shadow  It wasnt a clearly defined shadow of anything but I knew it was moving because after a few seconds of staring at it it was no longer there  I ran back to my room and hid under the covers until the next morningThe next day after school I headed to a church down the street  My family is Christian but we were not practicing at the time  I asked the priest there for a vail of holy water  Being that I was barely eleven years old the priest was more than suspicious  I lied and said my mother had asked for it  I dont think he believed me but I sprinkled the holy water everywhere  in the living room basement kitchen and all the bedrooms  I read verses from the Bible as I was doing this  I am not sure if what I was doing would work but to my eleven year old mind it was putting me at easeFor a time the noises stopped  Then a few days before Christmas they started again  The creaking noises originated from the other side of the hallway and continued into the living room and all over the house before finally stopping  I was still scared of the noises but managed to fall asleepThe next morning my parents asked me what I did with my present that was under the Christmas tree  I had no idea what they were talking about  They attempted to make me confessAre you telling us that you didnt take the Game Boy Color that was under the tree  They inquiredI didnt know they were getting me this even though I had asked numerous times  My little mind started connecting the dots my brother had express interest in a Game Boy for some time  It was my older brother who was creeping around the house late at night it was him this entire time  There was nothing paranormal going on  my brother took my present  When he woke up later that day I confronted him and tried to fight him but he was four years older than me and easily subdued me  He denied everything I accused him off and when my parents searched his room and found nothing they reluctantly believed him  I was grounded for the next few days until Christmas for starting the fightThe relationship with my brother deteriorated back to where they were before we moved into the house  My parents never gave me a replacement present and I blamed my brother for stealing my present  By late January I had stopped being afraid of any noises that came from the house  As soon as I heard any creaks I would think of my brother and got upset  Eventually when I heard them I just rolled over and went back to sleep  In the last week of January a flu was going around my school and I eventually caught it  I tried to shrug it off but on Thursday I was sent home at lunch and told not to come back until I was properly rested  My brother and I walked to and from school together everyday so I had to drop by my brothers highschool they called him out of his class and I let him know I was going home early and not to wait for me after classWhen I got home I realized that my brother hadnt locked the door  I took a mental note of this  anything to get my brother in trouble  I went to the kitchen threw my bag on the counter and started to pour myself a glass of milk  Looking around the kitchen I noticed it looked different  There was a dirty plate in the sink as well deli meats on the counter  My brother and I were the last to leave the house in the morning  We did not leave it like this  None of my parents cars were in the drivewaySuspecting the worst I took the cordless phone dialed  and ran out my home  I reported a burglar in the house and within a few minutes three cruisers were at my house  The officers searched the bungalow and called my parents  The police then locked down the neighborhood  searching everyone going in or out  Around  pm we were finally allowed back into the house  The police explained to us what happened  Someone had been living in our house for the last few months  They were hiding themselves in the crawlspace under the basement stairs  In the crawlspace they found several magazines packaged food and my missing Game Boy  The police speculate that the individual knew our daily activities and left the house when he thought we were gone  He must have been doing this for a while as he was brazen enough to just leave a mess while he went out  He didnt have a key so the door was left unlocked for him to return later  The police say I was very lucky to not be harmed  If the individual had returned while I was still in the house who knows what couldve happened  I remember my mother hugging me for a very long time my brother even hugged me too  The creaking of the house never returned but we never felt comfortable again in the house and moved out a year later,Why I Cant Be Left Alone Anymore,32
WithoutACompass,6,16,1qyxxt,17,Sent from    at  am November  Youve probably heard millions of versions of stories where the protagonist has the feeling of being watched In fact you may have experienced it yourself And maybe you like me brushed those stories and feelings off I mean get real This is a world of math science and cold hard logic If you were ever watched it was probably a pervert call the cops hell get arrested soon enough Yet the saying that In every story there is a grain of truth persists and because this is a logical world there must be some reason for this So maybe you like me got to digging And by the time you get to that infinitesimal spec youll wish you had listened to the other saying You know that oneIgnorance is bliss Oh and lest I forget the other other sayingCuriosity killed the catNow everyone has their own methods of research but mine began with asking questions to an all powerful entity google I began with myths and legends but I soon progressed to eyewitness accounts There were many fascinating reads but nothing that convinced me Still some of the stories struck a chord within me Tales of the Midnight man Bloody mary and she found her way into my home stirred something in me but I forged onward crushing those feelings of trepidation Sadly those stories were as good as it got for me Soon I lost interest and moved on with my life namely college work Engineering majors arent easy Yesterday my friend came over to my dorm room to work on a programming assignment Of course we ended up procrastinating It began with him showing me a series of youtube videos about creepypasta He insisted on lights off to maximize the impact This of course prompted a brief relapse in which I shared some of my research with him And just like before I soon got bored and so did he I decided to get started on the assignment but he was still not in the mood so he started fiddling with my phone I was finally starting to make some headway in the assignment when he suddenly punches me in the arm and says Hey youve got to see this Its hilarious Naturally I looked over and my friend started cycling through my picturesI dont get it I told him Damn it you really are pretty oblivious huh Youve got a secret admirer You know how in high school you would just happen to show up where your crush was Well look here he replied scrolling back to one of the earlier pictures and pointing to an obscure figure with his or her back turned in the background Jack that is possibly the most retarded thing that has ever come out of your mouth Oh look some random person in the background of your picture She must like you I mimicked him in falsetto as I moved to swipe my phone back Come on get your act together we need to get some work doneNo seriously Look Jack scrolled through several more pictures in my phone and in each one he pointed out the same obscure figure in the background As he progressed I noticed more and more details Black dress long black hair painted black nails several red tattoos And then it hit mejack does it look like shes getting closer in every picture or is that just meUhm yeah youre right Its not much but shes definitely getting closer And hey I think shes starting to turn around too Weird huh I guess shes just shy jack said laughing But I wasnt amused Not in the least bit A chill ran down my spine No need to jump to conclusions I told myself there is a reasonable explanation for thisI swiped the phone from jack and started going through the rest of the pictures as jack looked over my shoulder And to my horror in each picture whoever she was was getting closer and turning more and more of her body to face the camera Dude I guess she most have lost interest Sorry man jack said patting me on the shoulder What in the flying fuck are you talking about jack dont fuck with me Im not in the mood Dont fucking fuck with meJesus Relax man Are you okay What the fuck Did you know her or something Have a crush on her too Im sorry but I mean shes not in the pictures later onShes right there rightthere I scream at him jabbing my finger at her location on the picture And of course the stupid touchscreen takes that as a Oh hey lets move on to the next picture Jacks staring at the picture in confusion wondering if Im high just as I calm down Maybe calm down isnt the right phrase Its more like my brain just shut down Information overload Ive gone deathly silent Because in that next picture I finally see a part of her face  I can see nothing but a glimpse of teeth through her hair  but why the fuck does her smile almostreach her fucking ears Are you really okayman jack asks genuine concern in his voice as he waves his hand in front of my face breaking my trance Theres nothing there Nothing Look again theres nothing thereAnd he was right There was nothing there Nothing at all I felt relieved more relievedthan I hadever felt in my life so relieved that I wanted to cry Alright I think weve stayed up too late Youre tired Im tired lets get some sleep jack says as he climbs off of my loft bed and into the adjacent one recentlyvacated by my room mate who decided to live off campus Yeah youre right I say as I climb out of bed and head to my rooms private bathroom I push the door open feeling for the light switch when I see a pair of eyes staring at me Holy fucking shit I scream backpedalingand crashing intosomething or someoneJesus man What the fuck It was just jack Apparently he had comedown to take a piss too Those eyes were his reflected from the mirror inside Sorry jack I must stillbe tired and seeing things I sayas Iget to my feetand help him upYeah yeah just get on with itwill you Use the damnbathroom so I can go too and then we can sleep So I do I go about my business and he goes about his And miraculously probably because I really was tired as hell I fell asleep And awake an hour later to a bright light My phone I groggily get up and check it Huh no message no call Weird Im about to put it back and go back to sleep when I notice a glow from under the bathroom door Was jack in there I glance to my left And swallow one of those dry swallows where all you swallow is air and your throat is even drier than it was before jack was still in bed So who was inthe bathroom No theres noone in the bathroom jack probably forgot to turnoff the lights before With that thought in mind I put my head down on my pillow and close myeyes And I immediately hear the creaking of a door Im scared shitless If I had any bodily fluids left in me they would have all come out But Im guess my DNA is more similar to a cat than I thought so I take a peek and there she is standing there only thing visible id a form two eyes and that smile too wide for her face I try to scream for jack to wake up but it comes out as a sort of strangled whisper So I go to my last resort something I havent done since I was a child  I ducked underthe covers Now here I am typing away on my phone telling

JordanThirstExile,6,13,1r857m,18,  It started with the roses Ever since I was a little girl I loved them I loved the scent of them and the colors they came in I loved them so much that my mother had planted a few rose bushes outside our house so when it bloomed I could sit and stare at those beautiful roses They bloomed in shades of white and pink but my favorite rose was red like satin It reminded me of my mother and the way she always drew roses on her letters                                                                                                                                                          Fast forward to the time I was  years old I was never a popular girl by far but I wasnt unknown either I didnt have long blonde hair or blue eyes but I had talent a slim body and an obsession for roses All my friends knew how much I loved them Theyd buy me perfume in a roseshaped bottle or a dress with red roses on them for my birthday  I made the best out of what I could in high school being a short brown haired greeneyed girl      It was the day before homecoming when the boy Id secretly been in love with asked me to the dance with a white rose I swooned and he took me to the dance the next night I of course in a rose dress and him in matching colors He had brought me a white rose corsage to match my dress We danced all night and we continued to date until high school ended After our senior year we went our separate ways and stopped talking But this didnt bother me I hadnt time to waste when I was busy with my roses        In college I had been taking Art classes in my third semester when I got a call one evening informing me that my mother had pasted away in the hospital The following Tuesday we attended her funeral My father had picked out the colors We buried my loving mother in pink roses because she was a former cancer survivor and we were blessed to have her as long as we didFor the months following my mothers death I became deeply depressed The only thing that eased the pain from losing my mother were the roses When they bloomed in the spring my sprits suddenly lifted The roses were my life and I dont know what Id do without them           years go by and I ended up meeting a nice guy who joined my ecology class His name was Dylan and we immediately hit it off He gave me everything a girl couldve ever wanted and treated me like a princess I loved him more than anything in the world We talked about moving in together and buying a house after college We talked about getting married and having a daughter named Rose for my love of roses His handsome blonde hair and chiseled feature would make a beautiful baby         We went through college and eventually graduated together and got married We lived in a small townhouse in Vermont for a long time after that After trying many times to have the baby I so desperately wanted the doctor came to tell that I was infertile Dylan tried to tell me we could always adopt always have a child if I wanted but I didnt It wasnt fair If I couldnt have a child that was my own flesh blood how would she share the love of roses like my mother did with me          Again for a long time I became mute I could not eat or sleep Dylan became very distant and we hardly spoke Everything we had was gone Nothing made me happy anymore Nothing would until I had a baby rose I would look out at our garden and wait for them to bloom but even then the roses did not make me happy It was the next winter before I found out I knew something had gone wrong because all of the roses had turned over black instead of falling off and dying Dylan had come home late that night and seemed very stressed I decided that night while he slept Id go through his phone          He had  missed calls and a text from a girl named Lisa The text readYou HAVE to stay home tonight She wont stop crying unless youre here Lisa         Who wouldnt stop crying Did someone care that much about my dear Dylan to cry when hes not there I remember him saying he worked at the office with a girl named Lisa so I decided to send her a text replying Get her to stop crying I cant be that important          After that I waited for a reply for several minutes before I got a reply backOf course youre important to her love Youre her daddy And she needs you here Just take off work this one nightWORK SHE though HE was at WORK He was supposed to be at work all day And WHOS daddy was she talking about          I carefully went through his address book in his phone and found her home address I silently walked downstairs and out the door grabbing a hoe from the garden before leaving in the carI knew the black roses meant something was wrong          I returned a few hours later with his baby in our car I left her there while I waited behind the house About an hour later I see Dylan walk out the front door to leave when he suddenly stops when he sees the child in the car with the windows up He screams ALLISON          Is THAT the things name So it IS his At this point I was furious          As he went to unlock the door to retrieve the child I pulled him backwards so he fell into the garden I picked up the hoe and shouted ALL I WANTED WERE THE RED ROSESThe hoe dug into his head once and I felt all the love Id ever had for him release into the small tiny bits of pieces that were once my loving husband When I was all through I tossed his body into the cellar along with his companions          At least now the black roses are blood red once again         A beautiful thing the roses are          Little rose lives with me now and she has just enrolled in preschool She loves the roses as much as I do but her favorite ones are the dead petals So pretty she said Even after theyre dead          I always agree with her on that Sometimes she asks where daddy is and I must tell her Simple Prim Rose ask the petals,It Ended With Roses,31
schizoidvoid,10,6,1r45ql,16,Part  Manifestationshttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrxtthesilverladypartmanifestations For several years now Ive had this story inside me like lead shot in my gut Ive considered telling it hundreds of times over but the sheer magnitude of it has always stopped me With six months of therapy under my belt I figure its time I know now that I wont be free of this thing until I write it out Settle in because I cant tell this story in ten thousand characters or less Ill be lucky to get through it in twice or three times that Its hard enough to sum up everyday life and this story is anything butI had a recurring dream when I was really little I would wake up in the dream and standing beside my bed was the most beautiful lady I had ever seen Long straight hair and long flowing gown both of the purest silver like captured moonlight She would smile at me so sincerely so lovingly as she sat down beside me and began to speakThe words were comforting like a lullaby but I couldnt understand them Though she spoke quietly her voice seemed to echo through the room through the universe backwards and forwards in time begging to be understood by my adolescent brainI always tried to stay in the dream as long as I could but eventually I would drift back off to sleep in the dream and wake up to my mom gently rousing me for breakfastMy mom died when I was seven and the dreams stopped Well I prefer to say she died She was murdered I hate that word Its so cold it falls off the tongue like shards of glassMy mom was a health nut protein shakes weight lifting yoga the whole lot Above all she loved to jog We had several acres of untamed land around the house She always woke me up about an hour before dad went to work so she could go take a fortyminute run through the forest and along the creek it befell dad to make me breakfast and get me ready for schoolThey found her by the lake south of the house And hanging from the old weeping willow in the middle of the pasture And scattered across the countryside in a tenmile radius around the house  but that was mostly after the funeral All told the casket had about twothirds of a person inside when we finally buried her They never found her headWe used to be a close family  me my sister my mom and dad  Losing mom and losing her the way we did splintered us Dad lost himself in his advertising job My sister turned inward and fell into drugs and alcohol when the kids our age figured out how to get ahold of it Besides his job dads other mission was to keep his girls safe from all harm and he took that one even more seriously Leanna got it a little easier since she was four years older I was taken out of school Dad hired a tutor to homeschool me I wasnt allowed out after dark I wasnt allowed out without supervision Unless I was being taken to town for some reason I wasnt allowed to range out of eyesight or earshot of the houseI started writing obsessively Mom taught me how to keep a journal as soon as I could hold a crayon I still have my very first one the pages are filled with scribbles in different colors and some pages are nearly colored solid I guess I thought that good writing should fill as much of the page as possible I remember how unabashedly delighted mom was to see every single entry I guess writing is my way of honoring her memoryI took moms death hard but it was a long while before I really understood what it meant that mom was killed Dad told me that a very bad man had taken my mom from us that she was dead that shed never come back All things considered he handled that conversation pretty well Nothing could have softened the blow though My mommy was gone I loved her and wanted her but Id never see her again She was dead and death meant people were gone forever We werent a religious household so at that young age I was coming to grips with the fact that mom didnt exist anymore There was a hole in my world It was like that feeling when you go to grab something like a can of Coke without looking at it and you end up swiping at the air because that can wasnt where you expected it to beI healed in time For several years I was just chugging along going through the motions numb to the outside world Closing myself off was easy the outside world mainly consisted of our house and the clearing around it My dad was mostly an authoritarian figure when he was home always vigilant but never available My sister babysat me when dad was gone though she usually left me entirely to my own devices She was homeschooled too but she could drive sometimes she would simply leave me at the house and go off to do Big People stuff That Big People stuff as Ive written consisted mainly of shooting up with her friends or scoring more dopeShe had been chasing her high for ten years straight when I turned eighteen Leanna had been living with her junkie boyfriend for a couple years She was never able to hold down a job for very long so she would spread her legs for a dealer until he let her move in That was how she kept up her habit When that didnt work out shed beg dad for more money and find another dealer to fuckIt was a miserable shady life for her and she would have kept going until it killed her And it didMy dad got the call at four in the morning on a Tuesday I remember waking up blearyeyed to see him looking like death warmed over I had only seen that tortured look on his face once before and I shot straight up wide awake when I saw it that nightLeanna I saidHe nodded My heart sank into my stomach and stopped beating She was living in the city a fortyminute drive away A long miserable fortyminute drive away Neither dad nor I spoke a word He sat stoically knuckles white on the wheel crying silently I might as well have been dead myself I stared at my lap taking in nothing thinking nothing feeling nothing Where my heart had been was a gaping holeDad led me by the hand into the funeral home and sat me down in a chair where I waited motionlessly as he went to identify the body I heard his wracking sobs as he came back to get me some time later I reflexively turned towards the sound The funeral director and another man were practically holding him upright as he stumbled across the lobby They took me up and walked us to a private area with a couple of couches where we both collapsedI sat on the couch mindlessly pulling at my hair gazing at my father as he poured out his grief He had always been a reserved man but the dam had finally broken We had no family but ourselves Mom had grown up in a foster home and had no love for the people she called her fake parents My biological grandma had a stroke and passed in her sleep My grandpa followed not long after as old widowers are wont to do I never knew either of them If we had any extended family we never knew themI halfnoticed the little hank of hair tangled around my hand I hadnt felt it when I ripped it outDad cried for a long time eventually slumping sideways into his couch When his voice was gone and his sobs came without tears he stood up He seemed to be carrying the weight of a thousand suns on his shoulders At his slight nod in my direction I stood up myself and we walked together to the car He pulled out a rumpled piece of paper and his phone and dialed a number We were at a motel fifteen minutes later We went to sleep in our clothesThe next few days were a blur There were arrangements to be made and that was dads job I went to town and bought us clothes and toiletries to keep us going while we stayed at the motelThe funeral was a small affair back home We laid her to rest in the plot next to moms Dad and I were the only mourners A minister said some words we each tossed a handful of dirt on the grave and it was over It was overWe stepped through the doorway and into our home Quiet pervaded the empty space the sort of quiet only found indoors Clocks ticking a gentle hum from our air conditioner our breathing and the stecatto hitches as one or the other of us suppressed a sobWe stood alone in an empty house our bodies kept upright through some force of habit or instinct in the absence of warm blood flowing through our veins My sister had imparted some vitality into this place unbeknownst to us even after our mothers murder As our Leanna died so died the house I might have turned to see the land itself had withered without so much as a shrugDad pulled the door shut and the click of its latch impossibly loud against the quiet signaled the start of our new life or merely the end of the oldI glanced at the clock almost noon The gears in my brain began turning cast about for something to fill the time until bed and found nothing It then latched on to the only activity left and my feet carried me to the stairs with sliding steps They balked briefly as if puzzled by a reason to lift off the ground more than half an inch and then continued A minute later I fell backwards collapsing onto my purple comforter My toes brushed the carpet from time to time but that didnt matter Nothing did Apathy sang me a lullaby and the world faded awayMy staggered footsteps echoed through the tunnel meshing with the steadfast crashing of many feet behind me Searing hot agony blazed through my side I had to keep running I had to reach the end before I snapped upright eyes unfocused drenched in sweat I bent forward reflexively and threw up bile into my lap I sobbed and choked on my own vomit I coughed until my throat was raw until the vessels in my eyes popped and then collapsed sidewaysGood morning worldPart

all this started I wasnt afraid for myself  Lexi was hanging from the tower just like Kelly was two nights ago  She was wearing the same black tank top and underwear she had on when I left her back in the pit and I could tell from the mascara marks streaming down her cheeks she was cryingDavid  Help me she screamed  I got up from the bench and surveyed my surroundings  It appeared to be just us  for the moment anyway  I was also wearing the same clothes I had on in the pit the same clothes Id purposely gone to bed in  I began to run as fast as I could towards her  At first I rapidly closed the gap  I was only about twenty yards away now and could see the panic on her face  However with each step I took the gravel I was running thru seemed to get thicker and thicker  My feet started sinking into the ground deeper and deeper  Each time I stuck my foot in the gravel it became harder and harder to pull out  I began to feel drained it felt like Id been running all night  Finally about twenty feet from the tower I couldnt take another step  I collapsed to my hands and knee in complete exhaustion my right leg still stuck in the earthDavid help me  I cant move my arms  Im scared David For the first time in the short time Id known Lexi she sounded like a little girl  Her tough facade was completely gone replaced by the terrified little child in front of me now  Im stuck Lexi  I cant move I answered back  She began openly crying  Im scared David  You have to help me I was at a loss  I wanted to help I wanted to get up  but Id never been so tired in my life  I could barely keep my head up  Then in the stillness of the night the silence was broken  Off to my right I became aware of a familiar sound a sound that in that moment I couldnt quite place  A rhythmic metallic squeaking noise that I knew I should recognize  Lexis eyes met mine and without exchanging words we both knew things were about to get a lot worse  As she turned her head to her left  her expression change from fearful dread to sheer unadulterated horror  I could feel her scream reverberate all over my body  I turned to look  it was Kelly  She was sitting in the middle swing of the swing set about thirty feet away  Both her arms were wrapped around the chains that connected to either side of the seat with her hands resting in her lap  The open wound from her chin to her waist was clearly visible and fresh blood covered the front of her body  Her head rested against the chain to her right blankly starring straight ahead  There was such sadness in her eyes  The terrible image of Kelly momentarily blinded me from what was going on  Kelly was moving backwards in the swing back to something behind her  it was the little blackhaired girl  When Kelly swung to where she was the little girl gently pushed her forward again much like a mother would a really small child  carefully forward as not to push the child out of the swing  Lexi was screaming and crying like a little baby now  God no please god no she sobbed  Turning back to me Please help me David I dont want to die  Oh my god no please noThe helplessness I felt with Kelly washed all over me again  Gathering all the strength I could muster I tried again to pull my leg out of the gravel  It barely moved an inch  Looking back towards the swings again the little girl had moved next Kelly  Reaching out she grabbed the chain of the swing stopping it on the next pass  The little girl her hair covering most of her face bent down next to Kelly  She lovingly brushed Kellys hair off her face and then kissed her on the forehead   Kelly never even blinkedThen the little girl started to walk towards the tower  Lexi screamed louder No  God no  DAVID  Please help me Lexi was fighting now her arms and legs kicking against the chains the clatter almost drowning out her screams   The little blackhaired girl was almost there now an evil smile noticeable thru the long strands of hair dangling in front of her face  As if accepting her fate Lexi stopped kicking and screaming  I could only hear her faintly sobbing shaking like someone stuck outside in a freezing rainstorm without a jacket  My heart was breaking I couldnt believe this was going to happen again  Id failed miserably  and somebody else was going to suffer for my mistakes  The blackhaired girl was directly in front of Lexi now with her back to me  When Lexi made eye contact with her her eyes widened and she let out another scream as all the color drained from her face  I dont know what she saw  I dont want to know what she sawI couldnt let this happen  I had to make it stop  If this was a dream I needed to wake up  and wake up now  I started pinching the back of my hand as hard as I could  Nothing  I slapped my face again nothing  Dropping my head I couldnt bear to watch anymore  Then I saw it the outline of my pocket knife in my pants pocket  As quick as humanly possible I dug it out and opened the blade  If this didnt wake me up I didnt know what would  Looking back at the tower I could see the pale arm of the little girl extending up towards Lexi  If I was going to do this it had to be now  Taking the knife I jabbed the blade into my thigh a couple inches above my knee  When I did the blackhaired girl snapped her head back towards me  Before I closed my eyes in pain I could see the anger in her face her eyes glowing redThe pain was immense  I let out a loud cry and jerked upright in bed  Id gone to sleep with the light on so right away I could see the little pocket knife sticking up out of my leg  Holy Shit I said aloud  Reflexes took over  I instantly yanked the knife out and tossed it to the floor  When I did blood poured from the wound and down to my sheets  I had to stop the bleeding I thought to myself so I grabbed my leg and began to apply pressure with my palm  Looking around I saw some dirty shirts lying on the floor  Rolling out of bed I grabbed the nearest one and clamped it down on the cut and limped my way towards the bathroom down the hall  My brother was already standing in the doorway of his room as I passed  Dude what the hell did you do I ignored him as I continued  In the bathroom I grabbed a hand towel from the rack wet it and replaced the shirt Id been using  Moms gonna be pissed dude thats one of the good ones he said referring to the flowered covered towel I was using to soak up the blood  I gave him a what do I care look and proceeded to dig thru the cabinets looking for something to clean the wound  My mother being the typical hypochondriac nurse had plenty of choices available  I grabbed something I couldnt pronounce and poured it on my leg  That didnt help the pain one bit   Seriously David what did you do  That looks terrible  My mind was only now beginning the catch up with events I had to come up with something quick  Um I guess I fell asleep with my knife in my bed  I must have rolled over on it Ok that sounded lame even to me  Holy crap  How far did it go in he asked  I dont know half inch  Maybe more I replied  Looking at his watch Its almost seven Mom should be home any minute  Dude I think youre gonna need stitches  Stitches  I think if you asked any twelve year old kid what fear number one would be that would be it  Before this week I wouldve agreed  By the time my mother got home most of the bleeding had stopped  Unfortunately my brother was right and mom didnt even get a chance to change clothes before heading with me right back to work       Lying on the hospital gurney in a curtained off section of the hospital ER I was finally able to think about the situation  Sure I was able to get myself out of the dream but I still wasnt certain how Lexi had fared  Remembering how angry the little blackhaired girl looked my guess would be that itd worked  Hopefully I was right  Most of the time at the ER was a blur  I think I dosed off a couple times but I couldnt be sure  I only vaguely remember my moms lecture on knife safety while getting the stitches but I distinctly remember the shot to deaden the pain  and the other one for tetanus I got before leaving  That one hurt the most Mom had to help me up the carport steps and onto the living room couch  It was still late Saturday morning so she turned on cartoons Bugs Bunny was just ending and Scooby Doo was coming on  They ruined that show when they added Scrappy I thought to myself but since this was before the days of remote controls and a hundred different choices I had to suffer thru it  If Id have known Emmas phone number I could have called and asked her how things were going  I could have discreetly asked enough about Lexi to maybe figure out if she was ok  But I didnt know the number and there was no way Mom was going to let me out of the house today  I was stuck without an answer for nowMom sat in the chair across from me for about an hour  She pretended to be watching TV but I think she was just so tired she was zoning out  Finally she got up  What do you want for lunch she asked heading for the Kitchen  But before I could answer there was a light knock at the carport door   If thats Greg youre not going anywhere I heard Mom say as she made her way to the door  From where I sat in the living room I had no view of the carport entry only the section of the kitchen furthest from that door  Our house was pretty small though so I could hear everything clearly Hello maam you must be Davids mom  How are you  It was a girl  Yes I am  Im fine how are you my mother answered  Im good maam thank you  Im a friend of Davids my names Lexi  I was wondering if he was home  Relief overwhelmed me she was ok  As quick as the feeling of relief came it was gone  Oh no I thought to myself  Just the appearance of Lexi would get me grounded for the rest of the summer  Yes hes home but hes had a little accident  I dont think hes up to coming outside today  Then what she said next completely floored me  Hes inside watching TV would you like to come in and say hello  Shes letting Lexi inside the house  Lexi  On her best day she looked like the spawn of Satan I could only imagine what she looked like todayThank you Mrs Anderson Id love too then you could hear the screen door open and Lexi step into the house  Lexi you said  You must be new to the neighborhood I dont recall seeing you around before  she replied Yes maam we moved in just last weekend  Is David ok  Oh sure  Hes fine Ill let him tell you all about it Mom said as they stepped into viewI couldnt believe my eyes  The girl standing in the entryway to the living room was NOT the Lexi I knew  She was wearing a pink and white tiedyed tshirt with jean shorts that were rolled up just over the knee  The heavy mascara and black nail polish were gone and her hair was pulled back into a single pony tail behind her head  she was even wearing a gold cross necklace around her neck  But the biggest outward change to me wasnt any of those things it was her smile  There was a genuine warmth behind her eyes that wasnt there beforeHey David what happened to you she asked  My mother was behind her and couldnt see her face when she shot me a quick knowing look before feigning ignorance  Oh nothing really  Pretty stupid actually I guess I rolled over onto my pocket knife while I was sleeping last night I said  Ouch Lexi replied That must have hurt like a um really really bad  Please have a seat and make yourself at home Lexi  Anything I can get for you Mom asked  No thank you Mrs Anderson Im ok she answered heading for the chair across from me Mom had sat previously  Ok then Ill be in the kitchen if you change your mind and with that left the roomKnowing my mom could hear Lexi continued on sounding as nonchalant as she could yet with an extremely serious look on her face Funny thing when I turned the corner onto your street it looked like there was a police car in your driveway  It kinda scared me a bit  A police car my mother asked from the other room  Yes maam but it turned out it was at your neighbors house not here  Mom was instantly in the entryway Lexi swiftly changing her serious glare back to one of indifference  Theres a police car next door she asked again with a deep look of concern on her face  Yes maam its still there right now Lexi said  Im sorry youll have to excuse me  David Ill get your lunch in a second  I need to check on Ms Elliott  She still hadnt had a chance to change out of her nurse uniform from the previous night but was out the door in a matter of secondsWhen she was sure Mom was gone Lexi stood up and walked over to the edge of the couch  She just looked at me for a moment before dropping to her knees and wrapping her arms around my stomach burying her face into my chest  I laid there with my arms in the air not exactly knowing what to do with them  That was until I could feel her tears soak into my shirt  She was cryingI awkwardly put my arms around her shoulders and she stayed like that for at least a minute before she finally spoke  I thought you were dead  She paused I was so scared and crying so hard all I could see was the flash of the knife when you stabbed yourself  I couldnt tell where then I was back in my room  Rising up she quickly wiped the tears from her eyes without looking at me and then rested her hands on her lap  Then when I saw the police car I lost itI sat on the curb next to the school for I dont know fifteen minutes maybe  just looking at that tower thing  I couldnt believe it  I finally got up the nerve to come the rest of the way I had to see what was going on  When I figured out it was Kellys house well Well you know  She paused again to wipe her face  Still looking down she said Thank you nobodys ever well just thanksI was stunned  Let me get this right youre thanking me I asked  Lexi this whole thing is MY fault  If it wasnt for me none of this would be happening  She hesitated for a second then continued I know I get that  but Im not a very good person and Ive been nothing but mean to you  You didnt have to do what you did you didnt have to stop it  you werent in any danger  I cant say I would have done the same thing for you if the situation was different  Thats allBesides its not all your fault she continued  If Id of left you alone from the beginning I wouldnt be involved either  You warned me but I wouldnt listen  I shouldnt have been hell bent on messing with you so its not ALL your faultI laid there for a moment just looking at her she looked so different  Nice shirt I said trying to lighten the mood  I barely got the words out before she punched me in the shoulder  Ouch I snapped trying to act like it didnt hurt as bad as it really did  Be nice she said  I took these from Emma  I heard you telling her about your mom that day at our house  I was upstairs eavesdropping  I knew I wouldnt get passed the front door looking like I did I did this for you so dont give me shit about it  I laughed  Well you certainly pulled it off  I like the necklace  nice touch  She laughed I stole it from Emma too ironic huh  Lexi stopped smiling and got serious again  So now whatLooking at Lexi I didnt have any answers  I dont know I said lets talk about last night,Dreamescape,26

Kaghiti,4,11,1qtux0,15,My dreams have always been somewhat odd I dream about death distortion and decisions Maybe its because my life just isnt going the way it was meant to or something odd like that but enough of the explanation and onto my dreams Last week Tuesday I believe I had a dream in which I was at school everything was normal and nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary That WAS true until the person I hated with a burning passion walked over to me and straight out punched me in the face The world became static and blur mixed with the noise of my classmates declaring a fight by going ooooh After regaining my vision I was no longer in the classroom but somewhere else The ground was rough and scratched my skin as I got up Sand I thought No thats too hard to be sand I was a bit stupid thinking it was sand although in reality it was a cave but the texture of the stone felt sandlike I looked around but saw nothing until I looked a bit farther in front of me A red light faint but noticeable from a distance It seemed as if the dream was planned out for me and beckoning me to walk over to the light I did so with caution When I got about  or  feet within the light I saw something no someone Glowing a now bright red in the darkness was a person no wrong again it was a demon Slowly turning its head towards me it said two simple words that woke me from my slumber EAT THEM,Dreams,26

someone couldnt afford something they worked for the owner until theyd made enough money to buy it But I suppose Im rambling about sonething that has nothing to do with the story at handLike every rural town we had our fair share of legends and when everyone knew everyones business those legends expanded every year My experience with Black Warrior River a murky creek that runs into the Alabama River was woven into our towns tapestry only a few years ago It was winter midDecember and in the prime of hunting season when I decided to take a brief vacation along Black Warriors muddy banksThe Indians who lived there told stories like youd expect the sort with maneating fish and vengeful spirits but I never paid any mind to them Winter was a nice enough time and Black Warrior was a nice enough creek so I felt reasonably safe sleeping in a tent miles from the nearest house Still like any hunter I was packing and made sure to have enough orange clothing to avoid an unfortunate accidentIt was the third morning that Rocky walked into my little campsite and I would be lying if I said I didnt welcome the company Rocky was some kind of mongrel dog an attractive sort of mutt that was the favorite dog of many a country boy and unlike most of his kind he had a collar denoting his name Yo dawg I said when I first saw him in my usual greeting to stray dogs I didnt expect an answer and didnt receive one but that suited me just fineHe was a good boy the sort to follow any human who felt like leading him around the sort who was owned by neighborhoods instead of families Lets go see what trouble we can stir up boy I said uncasing my rifle as I did every morning because Id always been told cold air could warp a scopes settings Rocky just cocked his head and barked but followed like Id spoken his languageWe hiked for what must have been three hours by the sun which meant it should have been about seven in the morning given that wed left with the sunrise I wasnt surprised to hear a couple gunshots around me most of which were the sort of caliber hunters liked to use Rocky didnt mind so I suppose I didnt either Hunters were normal for December so were bloodstains and bulletholes in trees Leaving slaughtered deer lying around wasnt and God help me but seeing what soemone did to that poor animal stirred more than anger in meIm not exactly averse to blood and gore but something about the way this deer was strung up irked me and Im not too proud to admit that I was a little scared It was a buck easily over two hundred pounds and hung from a water oak by its own innards not that much of it was in the tree Fur meat and bits of bone were scattered in a twentyyard radius from the tree which grew alone in a clearign slightly larger than the gore field I didnt like it and neither did Rocky who had raised the scruff of his neck and growled at the corpse Lets move on boySo we walked and noticed the only sound around us was our footsteps which wasnt unusual for winter but there should have been a gunshot here and there Instead we had dead silence and I distincly remember thinking those very words Bears maybe mountain lions werent unheard of but they werent exactly common so I was hesitant to believe one of them did the poor buck in Despite the cold I held my  with a steadiness I more expected from a statue and looked around fast enoguh to cover everything Rocky couldntWe found a local landmark a house carved into a cliff built by the federal government for a surveyor during the eighteen hundreds and decided to stop for a brief rest it being about noon then To this day I regret going in there maybe more than I regret anything Ive ever done before or since but my gut said everything was okay so I didnt pay Rockys nervousness any mind As I stepped inside because the house lacked doors and windows by which I mean added structures as it obviously had to have the holes for them to qualify as a house in my book I noticed a few chunks were broken off the doorway coming from the inside and I could only tell by looking at the breakageI was spooked Ill admit but I was also tired cold and hungry enough to not care In case you didnt know December in Alabama can get pretty cold especially on the assend of the mountains like Black Warrior was I didnt smell it until I was right on it but I suspect Rocky knew while we were still outside and I nearly slipped on a dark puddle halffrozen in the morning chill Like many men of the rural persuasion I recognized blood when I saw itA tangled mess of meat rested at the back of the house at the beginning of the blood trail At first I didnt know what it was but the torn bits of cloth and scattered brass casings told me it was another person one who had been attacked by something A Glock rested next to the body which I assume was male but there wasnt much to go on at the time Scared backed away and tripped on a little composition notebookIt was a cheap thing probably bought from Walmart and had a few scattered words here and there but it was mostly full of drawings Figuring there was no sense in leaving and possibly running into whatever had caught this guy I sat my ass down and flipped through and dont think my cell phone had any reception or I would have had the game warden down there faster than I could shit myselfApparently Clark the dead guy was studying Native American culture at UAB and found out about my towns legends from a friend of his whod once lived in the area I say once because I knew the man in general had been the local pastor and had died four years prior Black Warrior was apparently the site of a massacre when Jackson was president where soldiers had killed the indegenous people when they refused to relocateThe legend goes that they guarded the people of the valley from He Who Hungers a spirit that supposedly drove men to killed their families and friends before fleeing into the woods and becoming a monster that was neither man nor animal Personally I figured the guy was mistaken because it sounded like a wendigo and we were a ways away from any Inuit tribes to put it lightlyRocky had gone outside to piss or whatever it is dogs do when they  leave humans alone I heard him yelp then nothing I looked outside and realized Id been reading for the better part of an hours so I decided to forget about getting back to camp and get to my truck near the road Rocky I yelled hoping to get him to follow me if only to spare him the fate that befell the buck and Clark There was a rustling that soundign like something running to me but it stopped just beyond the scrub about thirty feet ahead of meI pointed my rifle at the bush and called for him again Whatever it was it was a bit bigger than Rocky and a bit bigger than me so I did the only sensible thing and shot it It howled like something out of a nightmare and bolted away shrieking at the top of its lungs I sprinted as fast as I could and I couldnt care less about where I went as long as it wasnt where that thing wentI ran for hell I dont kniw how long but I finally reached the highway I barely had time to jump in truck before that thing came back and ran across the road on two legs It yelled at me again something like what I imagine hell sounds like the screaming of a thousand tortured souls I drove off then and didnt stop until I was at a gas station a few miles from my house too scared to go home i case that thing followed me but I was being silly then  i knowIf youre looking for resolution dont I went to the police and reported it but they never found any evidence of Clark or the dead deer I checked with a relative of mine who works at UAB and found put Clark was indeed a real person who attended UAB and went missing a few months before I still live in the area but havent gone hunting in years Rocky is still around but hes on three legs these days Things havent changed much but every now and then I flip through Clarks notebook when Rocky stops by for a visit and readIt gets my mind off the screaming that comes from Black Warrior during the winter,Black Warrior River,19

thenightblogger,4,4,1qqmjy,15,The previous installments can be found herehttpalbrunoblogspotcomthenightbloggerstoriesarehtmlJuly nd At two am the home security system at  Dallas Street went mad the shrill beeps of the smoke detector the piercing wail of the burglar alarm and flat chirp of the carbon dioxide alert rising up at once in a mad chorus The noise sent Bobby Dooley tumbling out of bed his head aching and his heart trying to tear its way from his chest Not a good way for a man his age and weight to be awoken He blundered around in the dark trying to find the wall pad that would disable the noise but just as he got his bearings in the darkened room the television blared to life Blinded he misstepped and cracked his toe on the corner of his dresser The sound of his agonized cursing set the dog barking downstairsAnd that was a real problem because Bobby Dooley didnt have a dogHe grabbed the phone with one hand and a golf club with the other When he dialed  he got a message that the number was not in service The barking was getting louder Longnailed paws clicked on the stairs How was there a dog in the house Had one of the doors been left open and some stray wandered inside Had some petloving thug decided to bring Rover along while doing a home invasionThe barks dwindled to a long ugly growl A low canine shadow stretched across the floor Bobby dropped the phone and gripped the five iron with both hands The dog entered the roomThe animal was like something out of a veterinarians nightmare Longbodied but shortlegged with eyes the color of milk and teeth the color of rotten wood It had no fur just leprous exposed skin that crawled with bloated parasites When it saw Bobby its growl took on a leering quality Its tail began to wag and with each wag it sprayed rivulets of shit along the walls The ID tag on its collar was large and instead of a name it had an engraving of a cruellooking owlI cant be sure but I like to imagine Bobby thought something along the lines of No Fucking Way before he brought the golf club down hard onto the dog splitting its skull with a sound that reminded him of an overfull garbage bag splitting openOnce he was sure the animal was dead Bobby ran past it and headed for the stairs Whatever was happening around here hed feel safer dealing with it from a distance All his family pictures had been turned upside down Now he was panicked and sad this was a five bedroom house but he lived here alone The Marines had taught Bobby Dooley that respect was more important than love but his wife and children never quite understood the lessonThings were even louder on the first floor the blender was running the microwave was beeping the dishwasher door was open and water was gurgling out He grabbed his car keys and turned to go but then he saw the TV was on in the parlor The sight of it stopped Bobby in his tracks because somehow his copy of the Kim Kardashian sex tape was playing but impossibly at the same time so was the Barney the Dinosaur DVD he kept on hand for when his grandkids came to visit Old Barney was really giving it to Kim thrust after joyful purplehued thrustA growl startled Bobby The dog came bounding down the stairs brains and loose teeth spilling from its head Bobby screamed and ran slamming the door closed behind him His heart was pounding in his chest his vision was marked with white dotsBobby got into his sports car The dog came crashing through the front window of the house Just like I would weeks later Bobby gunned the engine and screeched out of his drivewayThe dog gave chase but quickly began to lag behindThe neighborhood of Tates Corners was quiet and dark Bobby hoped someone would see him and do something but everyone was probably in bed He glanced into his rearview mirror to see that he had lost his pursuerHe must have wondered if he was going crazy he had to think that the strain of the Homeowners Association the constant arguments and court orders had driven him mad Hed let dealing with Tom Palmer consume his time and money was his sanity next He decided to keep driving until he got to his exwifes house What would he say then He didnt knowThe sports car turned onto the ramp that led to the overpass that connected with the Northway The hammering in his chest started to fadeThat was when the dog in the back seat started barking Bobby Dooley swerved in panic and went right off the side of the overpassYou might dismiss the fact that a trailer towing a heavy duty construction shredder had stalled out directly below the overpass as mere coincidence You might even suggest the way the shredder turned itself on at the moment Bobby Dooleys sports car landed in it as a mechanical failure But how dear reader how would you explain the dog collar the police found mixed in with the tatters of metal and fleshTHE NIGHT BLOGGER A Season In Hell Episode Thirteen The Devils PlatformhttpalbrunoblogspotcomthenightbloggerstoriesarehtmlbyAl Bruno IIII know what youre thinking Youre thinking Foster how could you know all that What you just read was a combination of witness interviews traffic camera images police and accident reports footage stolen from Brian Dooleys own security system and in some cases complete and utter bullshitThe thing is Brian Dooleys death wasnt the only one in Tates Corners there had been all kinds of crazy deaths all accidents all gruesome and in every case a dog collar was found near the body A dog collar with an owl engraved on it There was one more coincidence tying all these deaths together all the victims had been members of the local Homeowners AssociationHow could I resist a story like thatIt didnt take much digging for me to find out that the five fatalities of Tate Corners had all come into conflict with one man Tom Palmer More research led to some even more troubling conclusions apparently Mr Palmer had been seen in the company of one Ashley Fowler she of the red hair and mens suits I only know Ms Fowler by reputation and the reputation is that shes beautiful rich and she thinks shes the DevilAround  at night I was sitting in my car about a block from the Palmer residence I was eating a kind of trail mix that had far too much candy in it to pass for healthy and waiting for Jasper Moradi to show up I know getting him involved breaks my number one rule of preternatural investigation but he asks all the damn time and truthfully I still feel guilty about punching him in the mouth Yes it was years ago and yes he had tried to kiss me but thats no excuseSo anyway I sent Jasper to Hobby Lobby to pick up some insurance for tonight but he was either taking his time or my debit card was maxed out It was around about the time I was debating wasting gas and battery power so I could listen to the radio when a knock at the window startled meTom Palmer was there dressed in sweats and smiling pleasantly He wore glasses and his hair was pulled back into an anemic looking ponytail Mr Foster he said through the window I think we should talkSheepishly I got out of my car and followed him What else could I doHis house was a generic two story job with a big picture window in the front the colors were tasteful and subdued the landscaping was meticulous It was the kind of place I was sure I would ever be able to afford As he opened the door to lead me inside I saw he had something in his right hand It was an empty dog collarDid your pooch get away I askedHe smiled thinly Please do come inThe inside of his house was as tasteful as the outside Tom Palmer had no wife or kids that meant the place was quiet That also meant no witnesses if things got out of hand He gave me a full tour of the place showing me every room and every toy he had Then he brought me into his study it had lots of books a kickass sound system and autographed pictures of celebrities hanging on every wall He threw the collar aside and sat down behind his wide oak desk He gestured for me to sit down in the comfortable looking seat in front of it We looked at each other for a moment then I started talking I guess you know Im something of a freelance reporterI know what you are he repliedMetroland has asked me to do an article on the pros and cons of Homeowners Associations I explained and yours has been in the news a lot these daysThose incidents have been blown out of proportion by a scandal hungry media he saidAre you saying you didnt fine Bobby Dooley multiple times for having a Marine Corps sticker on his carHe bristled That wasnt an ordinary sticker It took up the entire rear window and as per the HOA bylaws it constituted an advertisementI shrugged That seems kind of nitpickyWhats the point of rules if theyre not enforcedThen of course there was the incident with Amanda WardHer lawn statuary was in violation of the bylaws he threw up his hands I dont see whats so difficult to understand about thisI replied According to her she was singled out because her statuary was of a religious natureShe had a martyr complex Tom Palmer seemed to enjoy putting a particular emphasis on the word had They were still trying to find out how she got caught in the gears of the pin reset machine of the Playdium Bowling CenterYou couldnt have been happy that she and Bobby Dooley were trying to unseat you from your position as leader of the HOAI would have abided by the vote of the committee but it didnt come to that did it He smirkedI smirked back There are Or should I say were people that accused you of pushing an agendaMy only interest is in making Tates Corners a thriving progressive communityI thought the only thing Homeowners Associations were for was keeping the property values upI think the two go hand in hand and I am of the belief that glorifying postmodern Dominionist attitudes and the military industrial complex encourage attitudes and behaviors that attract the wrong elements Even a lowly homeowners association can be a platform for change He stood up and crossed the room There was a tall oak armoire against the left wall But enough chit chat lets talk about you Mr Foster Lets talk about your futureAccording to my High School guidance councilor I dont have much of oneHe opened the doors of the armoire to reveal a little altar the centerpiece of which was a bronze statue of a cruel looking owl This he began is MolechOK I got to my feet already making calculations about my chances to make a run for the door I guess that answers some suspicions of mineAnd we shall carry Molech our king he picked a dagger up off the altar cut his palms and let the blood drip scorned by Solomon bringer of the fortune and wisdom Sacred Molech Amen Amen AmenWhy I paused letting all this sink in Why are you doing all this for control of a local Homeowners AssociationIf I change the reactionary attitudes of a single neighborhood I might in turn change the world he held up his bloodied hands Molech is a means to and end for me A means for a better more progressive communityArent you worried about Hell Crimson wetness was beading up on the carpet DamnationI dont believe in all that claptrap he said Im an atheistThen how can you reconcile any of this with your beliefsMolech is just another kind of life form an alien intellect communicating and influencing humanity from afar Tom Palmer smiled hes not some devil out of a childrens storyNow I was almost feeling sorry for him How can you be sureBecause Molech told me soSuddenly I didnt feel sorry for him anymoreDo you believe in anything Mr Foster He said Are you willing to forgo the joys of the here and now on the off chance there might be an afterlifeAll I could do was shrug Im not sure what I believe these daysEver since I learned you were poking around I did some investigations of my ownOhThe vorvolaka has marked you Its only a matter of time now I can help you he gestured to the altar splattering more blood we can help youVorvolaka You cant imagine how much I hate that ridiculous and terrible word I felt a momentary twinge of temptation and let it pass Can I think about itTom Palmer sighed heavily I can tell youve already thought about it Do you know what you are Mr FosterWhat I was was out of there I went barreling down the hallway I wasnt surprised to find the scurvyridden ruin of a dog waiting for me in the foyer Old texts like the Constantinople Document called these things barghests It was blocking my way to the door so I ran into the parlor It snapped at me tearing at the back of my jacket I threw myself out the picture windowI hit the ground hard broken glass landing all around me on the meticulous lawn As I tried to raise myself up I heard Jasper Moradi shouting my nameThe barghest leapt out the gaping window He would have landed right on me if not for Jasper pulling me roughly out of the way I felt some part of my arm come loose with a pop but didnt care All I cared about was him getting me behind the line of statues before the monster could get meYes statues Lawn statues to be precise All the while I had been inside Tom Palmers house Jasper had been placing over three dozen statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary in a circle around it in a display Im sure the late Amanda Ward would have approved ofAnd now I was outside that circle and the barghest was inside it The creature paced back and forth on the front lawn but kept well away from the cheap plaster effigiesIts real Jasper said with a kind of wonder Its really realI replied I think you really dislocated my shoulderThen Tom Palmer was striding out the front door the dagger was in his hand and there was no doubt in my mind that he meant to use it Oh you have got to be kidding me Is this what you believe That God and the angels are going to come down protect youJasper started manhandling me into the street where his car was double parked but he shouldnt have botheredIt all came down to a paving stone just a single loose paving stone Tom Palmers toe caught the edge of it and he landed right on his faceAnd his knifeKarmas a bitch I said to no one in particular Thats what I believethere you have it The Police found no sign of the Devil dog just an empty leash The crazy deaths stopped with Tom Palmer and the Tates Corners Homeowners Association voted to disband shortly afterwards Did Tom Palmer find oblivion or Hell waiting for him when he died Your guess is as good as mine all I can say is that in this humble bloggers opinion he sold his soul very cheaplyHopefully if and when the vorvolaka comes I wont make the same mistakeTo Be Continued,The Devils

PretendingToCare,2,8,1r6wgf,14,It was around am when Steve and I stumbled upon the railroad tracks that lead out of our small village You know about two miles down the track theres an old church thats been abandoned I hear its a place for Devil worship Steve was grabbing a branch just off to the side of the track Fuck that I snapped Chicken shit Steve smiled No I just dont think its a good idea Rick said hed been there during the day with Alan and there was blood all over the place and a stick that had been used to stab somethingHow would he know thatThere was blood on itWell look Ive got a stick Hows about I stab anyone if they get near Or you for being a pussy Steve began jabbing towards me like some sort of fencing opponent Fine we can go but you lead the way big man I agreed We hiked down the tracks for about an hour and a half maybe longer if you count the couple times we stopped so Steve could smoke from his pipe The church was in sight As we got closer we notice a faint light pouring out of the broken door at the front of the church When we were within twenty or so feet from the side of the church when we crouched behind some trees in the woods Do you hear that Steve gasped Hear whatThat chantingWe fell silent for a few seconds but in turn were met with more silence Nothing Look lets creep around front and see if we can get a look inside Steve was already headed toward the front before I could object Its a surprise that if anyone were inside they didnt hear us Steve was stepping on every stick his feet couldve foundAs we placed our backs against the wall of the church we could hear shuffling against its concrete floor then silence again Steve leaned over to me Right on three we both take a quick look One two threeWe probably should have booked it as soon as we saw what was inside but shock had totally frozen us in place Upon looking inside we were met with the dead stare of about thirty fully cloaked people They knew we were there and they just stared at us Behind them was a bloodied lamb and beside it a man holding a stickNow Im no expert but I thought sacrifices were conducted with a blade NOT by gouging what must have been a couple dozen holes in the body of your sacrifice Jesu Oh my God man fucki RUNWe ran as fast as we could for about ten minutes before I pleaded Steve to wait for me I couldnt run any more I had to catch my breath What the FUCK was THAT Steve gasped I dont know You fucking idiot I told you we shouldnt have gone anywhere near that fu I stopped abruptlyBehind us was a mob of people carrying flashlightsGet down I gasped We laid silently in the dark of the woods for what seemed like forever We kept our heads down trying not to breathe The only indication about where they were was from the lights they carried and then the worst possible thing that couldve happened didIn succession all the lights that were just on went off We were blanketed in darkness with this group of men no more than thirty feet away We only heard the crackling of branches and the shuffling of leaves for the next few seconds before we heard a voice nearby grumble a faint We have seen you Come outI couldnt see Steve but I knew what had happened Steve bolted off further into the woods snapping their attention right at us I could hear him sulking as he ran harder and harder but they were catching him I remained silently on the ground as they disappeared I must have laid there not making a noise for fifteen minutes What just happened I was worried sick about Steve They got him I just had this feeling they got him Eventually I crept my way back home and snuck into my room without waking my parents I contemplated waking them up to tell them what happened for a while before I broke down and did exactly that Sort of At this point it was around am and dad was getting ready for work I told him that Steve and I were in the woods and we got spooked by an animal and lost each other running so I just came home I told him I was worried Steve might have gotten hurt and that we should call to see if he was okay My dad is a sharp man and knew something was up but didnt question me He just nodded his head and said Okay We contacted Steves mother who confirmed that surprisingly Steve was home After a few more minutes my dad concluded their phone conversation and reassured me Steve was okay Around noon I drove over to Steves house to check in on him When I got there he signaled me to follow him up to his room They know who we are He said As I was running they yelled my name at me These people they know who we areI frozeIf they know who we are then they live in our villageExactly we Steve stopped himself What do we do He asked I dont know,The Church Part ,22
