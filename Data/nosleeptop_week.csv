horriddaydream,90,174,1r338n,670,My mother left when I was fourNormally that wouldnt mean anything but I suspected for a long time that the porcelain dolls were coming from her like some pitiful little attempt to show me that she loved me My father he worked overtime to keep things going in the household even if it was just the two of us His hands were always worn from working the machines at the shop and he slaved even more when he got home and had to make supper for himself and I and go through my nightly routines before I hit the sack I sometimes woke up in the middle of the night and he was still awake cleaning a room in the house and I thought to myself This man is dedicated Has to be awake in only a few hoursand here he is I love my father and I always haveOne of his most trusted friends from high school Alexander was my babysitter from the time my mother left to the time I was about seven years old We trusted Alexander He worked night shift and so he was able to work babysitting in around his hours and he would have done anything to help out my father to make that work My father paid him even though he asked for nothing he said he was just doing his good deed and I like it anyway My dad used to come home from work and Alexander would pick up his bags full of toys that we played with he always brought the best toys and trinkets with him His daughter had passed away when she was ten years old and I think it brought him great joy to now share her old toys with another little girl He would say to my dad She was great for me She ate well and she took her usual long nap Ill be back tomorrow And he always came back Well eventually times changed and my dads work schedule changed with them We didnt see Alexander anymore because we didnt NEED Alexander anymore My father thought that they lost touch permanently and when I asked about him he told me truthfully that Alexander was a very busy man And he understood that and I did too For my eighth birthday the first porcelain doll arrived It had beautiful blonde curly hair and a painted on face She was wearing what looked to be an expensive velvet dress with an attached tutu She came inside a stuffed envelope with nothing else on the package to identify who had sent her Just my name that was all The first thing that my father did was call my grandmother who said No I didnt drive by and place a present on the porch Im not her coward mother I would have given it right to her That gave my father the second idea my mother Only thing was we had no way of getting in touch with her and finding out for she had literally taken off and abandoned us both And over the next few weeks nobody came forth and said they had gotten me the doll so we assumed this is who had sent itThey showed up every year since then Each unique in their own ways each more beautiful than the last I thought it was a little odd yes Especially because my mother made no outreach to me so if she was sending me gifts but not bothering to even so much call me and check up then that was just plain rude of her and her gifts meant literally nothing But I continued to set them up on my shelf in my bedroom and they looked nice there I supposeThe year I turned nineteen I was moved into college and was taking courses on my birthday My father called me from home and asked me when I was coming back home for a break and I told him that I had time this weekend but I only said this because I sensed some urgency in his voice I could make it work He told me not to worry about anything but that he would really like to see me Then he stressed that I always lock my doors and always have somebody walking with me if I was out past dark which I already knewI returned home that weekend and my father said there had been an accidentMy porcelain birthday doll had arrived my nineteenth year doll When my father brought it inside the house it had smashed into a hundred separate piecesInside there was a diary entry on a piece of paperWe spent the entire day smashing open every porcelain doll and the entire night speaking with the policeAlexander had written diary entries for every time he had drugged and molested me each more explicit admitting that he had done the same to his daughter up until the time of her horrible death My father and I hadnt a dry eye in our house that entire night and I continued to have problems throughout my college career knowing that Alexander was somewhere out there probably assuming a new identity and doing the same thing to other girlsNow I know why he had always commented on me taking such usual long napsFollowhttpswwwfacebookcomDaydreamPublishing,Birthday Presents,844,nosleep,top_week
honeymoonatthefalls,61,144,1r0fus,617,The falls have a pull according to the locals  Something dark and unearthly like a sirens song sweet and somehow terrible  It draws people of a certain intent  Thats the polite way to say a lot of people end up crushed on the rocks below their limbs torn apart by the unending rush of water the brains that made them who they were nothing more than bits of foam and meat floating to the surface   a year in fact depending on who you askWe were happy  Werent we  I thought we were  I thought maybe we were different from everyone else that wed actually make it  We wouldnt end up in that  statistic  Wed grow old together laughing at the same stupid jokes knowing what was going to come out of the others mouth before they even had a chance to say itWas it the pressure of the wedding  The fact that Im still between jobs  Young somethings in one of Americas bleakest economies doing what we could to get by  Scrambling for every scrap as the magazine covers reminded us how worthless our generation is the snide remarks about our smartphones and Facebook and selfies  Maybe getting married wasnt a good ideaBut we were in love  We were in love and we knew deep down in that secret place in our stomachs that she was the one for me and I for herSo then why did it happenNo  Im not supposed to ask that anymore  Im supposed to accept that shes gone  Im supposed to accept the fact that shes her own statistic now one of  people a year  Another tumble of bones on the body count thats reached over  since the falls became an attraction both for tourists and people with death on their mindBut its hard to accept when I can still see her face so clearly that sweet heartshaped face with the little crescentmoon scar on her left nostril the way her big blue eyes lit up when she showed me the fantastic deal she scored on Groupon a Niagara Falls getaway for our honeymoonIf only I could go back  Tell her that the price was nice but Id rather go to a beach or Ireland it doesnt matter anywhere but those cursed fallsIts impossible to describe how it feels to stand at the crest of Niagara the mist peppering your face like cold little kisses drinking in the smells and the sound and the remarkable way the water rushes down down ever down  Your existence seems like a cosmic joke in comparison to this almost hauntingly beautiful feat of nature  For a moment it isThe locals say you can tell who has a death wish by how close theyll get to the edge  Those who shy away who shake their heads and insist nervously that they can see just fine from where they are thank you very much those are the ones who cant trust themselves to get too close  If they get too close to the edge some little part of them knows theyll jumpShe didnt shy away  She went right up to the railing  She was smilingThats the worst part  She was smilingIt was early in the morning one of those damp gray dawns only possible in the new spring of upstate New York  We had the sight to ourselves  It was a little spooky being out there alone the kind of spooky you get from being in an empty shopping mall after hours all those metal gates pulled down and the lights turned offShe was standing there a little too high on the guardrail leaning just a little too far over smiling as the mist touched her lips and made her hair curl in damp little tendrils on her cheeks  She was beautifulIll never know why I pushed herThats something I have to acceptWe dont sleephttpwedontsleepanthologytumblrcom,Ill never know why it happened Thats something I have to accept,761,nosleep,top_week
Jaunt,54,152,1rff5i,531,I wrapped my dollie in her prettiest red dress looked into her cracked eyes and whispered I love youI held her tight I love you I love you But I started to cry because dollies dont love back No my dollie wouldnt do not anymore I wanted something of my own to care for Something soft I could nuzzle up to at night when I was lonely Something that needed me I wanted a real babyI asked mama how to make a baby She slapped me across the face and made me drink dish soap to wash the devils talk from my mouth The red mark still burned on my cheek when I got to school but no one noticed They never noticed me except when I fell and spilled my lunch or when Jenny and the other girls made fun of the holes in my dresses They only noticed me to laugh at meThat night after I said my prayers I looked at the stars through my window and spotted one I had never seen before Big bright and ruby red it seemed to get bigger the more I stared at it It was beautiful so I sent it a wish Bring me a baby I said bring me something to loveThe star grew bigger and bigger until ruby red filled the room and turned the air thick and rusty Something was there with me Black and formless like a storm cloud it floated above me You want a child it said speaking into my head instead of my ears I will give you a child but you must promise to love and care for him no matter whatI promiseWisps of black wrapped around my wrists and pinned them to the ground as sure as steel rivets My nightdress was lifted and my legs pulled apart Gritty black tendrils rough as sandpaper opened me and slithered inside They scraped my insides slowly at first then faster and faster It felt like I was being shredded to pulp from the inside out I tilted my head back to scream but black filled my mouth and nothing came out Shhh it said to love your child you must suffer for him first A final push in and shards of splintered glass exploded inside meThe thing loosed its grip and I reached down to feel sticky red goo oozing out of me onto the floor I was shaking and cold and the room was falling away Will I die I askedNo You must care for him It is your promiseI woke the next morning without a scratch Was it a dream I touched my belly No he is there I can feel him Tiny and vulnerable and perfect I would keep my promiseHe grew every day Soon my belly was round and full underneath my dresses Everyone noticed me now especially Jenny and the other girls Slut they said Whore Trash One day Jenny fell in front of a school bus as it was pulling away You could hear the tire pop her skull open from across the parking lot When the police dragged the driver away he stammered that he had seen something push her something small and black like a living shadowMama cried She held me in a scalding tub and scrubbed my body until my skin cracked and bled Not clean not clean she said She pulled me out of school and swore that I would never leave the house until it was over and done because what would the neighbors think I didnt mind As long as my little boy was safe inside me I didnt care where I wentI dreamed of him He told me his name but it was a sound I couldnt pronounce a sound like a cloud of flies buzzing through the air I couldnt say it but I could hear it in my head and that was enough He told me that he would accomplish great things but he needed my love to make him strong first In my dreams I held him tight looked into his dark eyes and whispered I will love and protect you alwaysMama dreamed of him too I think She would lay in bed with sweat soaking into the sheets whispering Please Please help us God She ate less and less until she was sunken and pale like a skeletonI was drawing pictures one night when it happened I reached up for a red crayon and pop yellow liquid gushing out of me Hes ready hes finally ready I called out to mama and told her it was time She phoned the doctor begging him to be discreet to hide it from the neighbors He arrived and offered to inject me with something to relieve the pain I refused To love my baby I must suffer for him firstPushing screaming breathing pushing again Hours and hours I was weak I was tired But the thought of him kept me going After so long we would finally meet I would hold him in my arms for real and give him the love I kept in my heart just for him I pushed again with the last drops of strength I had left I emptied out and collapsed down onto the bed sighing with reliefI am sorry dear but the baby didnt make itNo No youre wrong I kept him safe this whole time I protected him and loved him and spoke to him in my dreams I was going to care for him and make him strong he cant be he cant be he cantI am so sorry Here child you can say goodbyeI held him in my arms He was limp and motionless his skin a pale gray his eyes shut tightly He looked so peaceful I had never seen anything so beautiful in all my life I clutched him to my chest and cried tears dripping onto his head Goodbye my love goodbye But no wait He cant be gone I can hear him I can hear the flies in my mindHis eyes snapped open and his head twisted around to look at mama and the doctor Mama fell to the floor and screamed Her legs scrambled to press her into a corner of the room and her eyes bulged as she shrieked and pleaded to God The doctor stood frozen for a moment before walking into the bathroom and quietly shutting the doorMy babys head turned back to me and I looked into his eyes for the first time Two huge pools of midnight black that seemed to suck the light out of the room itself I looked into those cold dark eyes and I smiled My son My beautiful son I am so happy to see youI stood up while mamas jagged screams scratched my eardrums and I carried my son to the bathroom I opened the door stepped over the spreading pool of red underneath the doctor and turned on the tap I bathed my son in the icy cold water as he stared up at me He was perfect He was everything I had hoped for And he was mineI saw things in my dream that night I saw great buildings and monuments ground to dust I saw waves of fire washing clean the cities of man I saw clouds of flies so thick they blacked out the sun I saw red Mists of red rivers of red chunks of oozing red heaped high in the moonlight And in the middle of it all I saw my son my baby boy Mamas so proud of you sweetheart I will always be there for you I will make you strong I will make you the man youre destined to be I will love you and care for you and protect you no matter what I promise,The Promise,683,nosleep,top_week

Exxile,97,152,1rbws0,391,Hello reddit Im a killer and I have no problem admitting that Many people have fallen victim to my gruesome attacks and I live life regretting none of it Im only sharing my story on here  so that someone out there can know about it Whether or not you choose to believe it is up to youI was a normal child but normal is relative so who am I to make that call What I should say is that I grew up how you would expect a kid to grow up My parents treated me properly I did great in school and I had many friends It wasnt until high school that I started feeling the need to kill It was all so spontaneous I was just sitting in class one day staring at one of the students when the image of him dying popped into my head I zoned out and focused on the image his body lying in a pool of blood leaking from his head His arms were snapped behind his back  and his feet were missing the big toes A few weeks later that daydream became a reality and I got away with itEveryone in the school was whispering rumors to one another as I walked to classes Some were saying that he joined the army others were convinced that he just moved like so many other kids did before him I was the only one who knew the truth and I had to hide my devilish grin from the rest of the school That was my only murder in high school but it ignited the flameWhen I reached adult hood I landed a successful job and had plenty of money to obtain the tools I had always dreamed of using on my victims Thats when I began to develop a signature style I would always sever the big toes but I no longer snapped the arms behind the back Honestly the sound of the bones breaking didnt sit well with me Every day I would watch the news expecting to see that one of the victims had been found but they never were Years went by and I targeted another twelve victims They were no one in particular Women teenagers it really didnt matter to me A dead body is a dead body in my eyes I dont care who it belongs to Very few of them would put up a fight and that was fine with me I wasnt trying to drag out the last moments of their lives I just wanted them to die I wanted to savor the warmth of their blood on my hands as I slit their throat  About a week after I killed my final victim I met a girl that I ended up falling in love with She doesnt realize how close she was to becoming just another undiscovered body She wasnt able to have kids which was fine with me I never really saw myself as a father Neither of us believe in god so we saw no point in getting married I was okay with this as well I felt like my life was finally going to be normal again After we had been together for a few years I decided to tell her about my past I made a special dinner for her to lighten the mood However when I told her she just laughed and thought I was being ridiculous It turned into her treating it like some type of role playing fantasy I had and she ignored me as I told her it was the truth I didnt know how to prove it to her so I killed someone in front of her One night I brought her with me on what she thought was a date When we got to the spot I opened the trunk so she could see my victim She still thought it was a joke and asked me how I got my friend to agree to this I think she finally understood that it was no joke as I sliced the mans throat Her face turned pale and she reached into her purse to get her phone I was prepared for this though and I knocked her unconscious After I finished with  my signature killing pattern I drove back to the house My secret was not safe with her but I loved her too much to kill herRight now shes kept in my basement I dont treat her like a prisoner mind you she has everything she could ever want Im hoping in time I can start leaving her untied at night so shell quit trying to escape I know one day shell accept who I am Maybe one day shell help me fulfill my new fantasy of killing together Or perhaps you guys wont believe me either and youll brush this off as just another made up story But thats the funny thing about being a killer,The funny thing about being a killer is that no one believes you if you tell them the truth,543,nosleep,top_week
AmbiguousGopher,31,81,1r5xlc,358,For most of my life Ive been drawn to a certain room of my house A bedroom at the far end of my basement which used to be a guest bedroom I cant really explain why but I just always wanted to sleep there Until the age of  my older brother and I shared a room right across the hall from the bedroom of my parents When he was  however he moved into that bedroom and over the years the room become even more interesting The room is now filled with posters of The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix an authentic Spanish sword he bought hangs above his desk and loads of other bits and pieces which captured my imagination when I was younger To top it all off there was an air vent connecting his room and mine Almost directly below my room I could hear him some nights talking to his friends on the phone while playing video games late into the night I envied his freedom If I had tried that my parents right across the hall would hear me and Id be groundedWhen I was  myself my brother and sister twins left for college Now the only child at home I called my brother up one weekend and asked Can I have your roomMy brother paused for a long time before respondingNoHe gave no explanation but I didnt really care I could understand that when he came to visit Hed want his own room to sleep in For  more years i didnt ask to have the room again but when i was  my brother bought a house To me it seemed like he was pretty much beyond the point of having any reason to care about his old room so one day when he called to check up on things I asked againThis time he responded more quickly His voice sounded casual but at the same time It kinda freaked me out He saidNah let mom make it a guest room again Besides your room is super classy My room isnt that greatAnd so yet again I let it go I stayed in my room and didnt really think anything of it that is until last week This summer I started having severe anxiety attacks coupled with spells of incapacitating depression especially at night Ive been on different medicines to help and have been going to therapy to help work on relaxation techniques Last week my therapist noted that sometimes the brain can form associations with certain rooms or areas She suggested that my brain due to the recurring spells in my room may have formed a negative association with it She told me that switching rooms may help me relax when I start having an attackThat night I did it I switched to my brothers room and it was amazing Since my basement always stays around below room temperature the sheets and pillow stayed cool which was just to my liking I slept better than Id slept in weeks and thought that perhaps this room was going to turn things around But the second night didnt go as well I woke from a nightmare and felt as if there was someone watching me I shook the feeling and went back to sleep This kind of thing happened for a few more nights each time I awoke more worried than the last Then came the big one I fell asleep as usual and I began to dream another nightmare but this time it was more vivid In the dream I saw looking at my brother when he was only  or  years old He was sitting on his bed talking to something I couldnt see it but he was looking at an angle which suggested something much larger than himself Tears were flowing steadily from his eyes and he was pleading BEGGING the thing to go away to leave him alone The power in the room went out I heard a horrible screeching like a pig being tortured The lights turned back on and my brother lay there unconscious A large black bruise had appeared on his ribs The clock in his room recovered from the power outage blinking the numbers  My brother then jerked upright and walked over to the only poster in his room at the time his Hendrix poster He took a pen form his desk and put a tally mark on the wall behind itI jerked up in my brothers bed I turned on the lamp and looked around the room I noticed every poster Sweat started pouring from my forehead burning my eyes I looked at the clock The numbers blinked ,My Brothers Room,439,nosleep,top_week
TheeMikeG,21,72,1r4fsf,336,Dear MikeTheyre letting me write a letter so I figured Id get my story out thereIt was a routine night drop nothing different from what weve done countless times before The steady hum of the C as it tore through the clouds was the only thing keeping me calm Yeah Ive done this a lot but you can never get rid of the nerves before a mission We had an idea of what awaited us down there but we couldnt be a hundred percent sure People are unpredictable and thats scary The plan from higher was to have our five man team infiltrate by night drop a small village I cant pronounce to search for and capture or kill a HVT whose name I also cant pronounce The gunship would rise up and provide overwatch until we were extracted Airborne all the way hooah The LT joined us again which he decided to do from time to time Nice enough guy I respected him Was supposed to be having a baby girl soon he would always talk about it during PT Good for him I could never hold down a relationship for very long I figured it was just because Ive seen too much shit to be normal and cuddle or whatever the fuck it is that couples do The rest of the squad was the usual guys Mitch Craft and Burroughs All experts in their craft We were a solid group and Id take a bullet or hell even two for any of them Thirty seconds shouted the LT from the bench a few spots to my right closest to the door The jumpmaster heaved the door upward and the familiar sound of air whooshing past the plane made my heart jump There was always a kick Hook up he shouted We all stood up in unison and clipped our static lines to the wire that ran through the plane above our heads I tugged on my static line to make sure it was attached There were no reserves for this one The jumpmaster held up his hand Five seconds The red light turned green and the LT positioned himself by the door The jumpmaster smacked his rear and the LT jumped out and was whisked away My stomach turned in knots Over a hundred jumps and I still hated this shit I was last to go out I tucked my head took a hop out of the plane and suddenly there was the rush and I felt myself getting tossed I heard my chute above and I breathed a sigh of relief Looking up to check my canopy I saw a fully inflated chute and I thanked the Lord once again I looked down for the rest of the squad and saw their chutes inflated too Past them I expected to see the ground but there was only a thick smoke or at least thats what it looked like A storm cloud Why didnt the jumpmaster hold off the jump until the bad weather passed Staus check I heard the LT ask through the radio As I watched the others canopies disappear into the black cloud I began to worry I heard the squad all check in though so I felt a little better  I held my hand up to my ear to activate our comms Sir whats the situation down thereZero visibility guys Pretty foggy Cant see my own canopy he saidThen I entered the black cloud and couldnt see a damn thing I heard something nearby Flapping My radio clicks before Mitch starts talking I heard something Flock of birdsWere too high replied the LT Eyes and ears open I tried to look around but there was no point I couldnt even see my canopy What if I was falling to my death right then Heavy flapping got my focus It sounded large whatever it was Sir something is up here with us I saySimmons stay calm whats gotten into Fuck Craft interrupts through the mic Then I hear a long painful scream far below me Jesus Christ yelled the LT Craft You thereSilence Not even static Guys stay calm Get ready to hit any minute I cant see the ground in this shit but well sort this out on the DZI checked my watch It takes maybe two minutes to hit jumping from a mile up Its been six minutes and I know this wasnt a HALO jump Was I caught in a thermal I pulled on my risers and felt myself drifting through the air When I released I didnt notice any change in descent speed The LT must have noticed the same thing because I could hear him cursing through the radio Theres a loud screech unlike anything Ive ever heard After it ended a few seconds later the LT had to shout over the commotion we were all making on the radio We were scared Guys I dont know what the fuck is going on but stay calm Weapons on amberMy combat gear was in a large sack between my legs but my USP was on my belt I took it out and held it ready I didnt know for what but I was ready to go How had we still not hit the ground yet Then I got an idea My combat load We are supposed to release it before landing and it slides down a twenty foot rope so we dont break our legs when we land I thought if I could cut it free maybe I could hear it hit the ground I asked for permission from the LT who quickly approved He must have been as freaked out as me to allow me to abandon my combat gear I pressed the handle on my hip and the gear slid down the rope and out of sight into the darkness I took out my knife and sawed at the line until it snapped I waited and waited but couldnt hear a thing I heard the flapping again and someone fired their weapon two three times Then silence Jesus Christ whispered the LT Status checkBurroughsSimmonsNothingSir what the fuck is going on I knew he wouldnt have an answer but I was desperate I have no ideaWe drifted through the air for ten more minutes Then I touched down I didnt hit hard it was like I was just set down Didnt even have to fall over I still couldnt see a damn thing though I heard quick steps and then Burroughs burst into view and tackled me to the ground He was frantic He begged me through tears to follow him We wandered around until we came to the LT He didnt have a right half of his body He was barely alive sputtering through bloody lips for us to run My baby my baby my baby he whispered over and over until he didnt say anything anymore The cloud cleared from the area behind him and there was this thing All I saw before I turned and ran was large leathery wings I heard the screeching and the flapping of those awful wings again Burroughs screamed as he was ripped backwards from beside me Somehow I burst out of the cloud and I saw headlights I nearly got hit by the jeep but dove out of the way just in time Out got two guards who spoke a language I didnt understand Burroughs was the translator They prodded me with machine guns and kicked and beat me until I was barely conscious How did they not see the thing behind me They dragged me into the back of their vehicle and drove me to their camp Ive been their POW for nearly a month now If you get this letter please get my story out there Im not crazy I promise I cant explain what happened any better than that Were not alone Something terrible is going on over here Time to go theyre

PeckerPoker,43,86,1r58lt,234,Ok so this isnt a long story filled with twists and turns but it just happened about  minutes ago and Im a little uneasy nowFor reference my husband son and I moved into an apartment in the tophalf of a centuryhome a couple months ago The doors all have old knobs and the doors dont always close easily  you really have to pull sometimesAnyway I just put my son almost two years old down for his nap I told him nightnight as I closed the door As I always do I pulled the door shut firmly and made sure I heard it click I swear I heard it clickI walked away and into the bathroom to go pee As I sat down on the toilet I heard my son start crying which isnt that unusual but normally he doesnt do more than fuss for a minute before falling asleep I even kept him up a little longer than usual to make sure he fell asleep He seemed pretty ready to go down thumb in mouth under his blanky he rolled over onto his side and put his blanket over his head like he does when hes really tiredI finish peeing and walk out of the bathroom and his door is wide open I see him standing in his crib crying I go in feeling uneasy and lay him back down and cover him back up He lays there and just keeps crying as I check his closet like there would be someone hiding in there or something Kind of dumb I know but I couldnt just shut him back in his room alone without checkingEven if I was wrong and the door didnt click shut which is possible it shouldnt have been wide open When I havent completely shut it in the past it will open up about  or  inches Its never opened up all the way like thatI checked the rest of the rooms and closets feeling nervous but kind of stupid Of course there wasnt anything unusual anywhere Still Im kind of on edge I wish my husband was home,Nap Time,320,nosleep,top_week

tellmewhatiswrong,52,56,1reivz,215,Arghhh I have no idea what to make of this situation I find myself inI started off  as being in the most amazing relationship Ive ever had I married the girl of my dreams last year after being together for  years prior to that She is the most beautiful intelligent interesting person I have ever met and I knew that as soon as we met each other Immediately the chemistry between us was electricDont get me wrong we are extremely different in a lot of ways but up until this point that has only helped to make our relationship stronger Im an atheist a kind of scientific nerd I guess She on the other hand was morenew age I guess you could say Not particularly religious but interested in the paranormal philosophy anything that cant really be explained It would not surprise me to see her out hunting for UFOs however for the most part this side of her was really just limited to reading about such events and watching the odd documentaryHaving said that she is so sensible and smart Shes a very curious person thats what I put her hobbies down to really Its never been more than a passing interest of hers She works as a personal assistant to the CEO of a law firm in the city Everyone says she should study law because her talents are wasted as a secretary But she seems content enough at the momentwell she didThe reason I find myself in this mess is because she has changed her mind about something we used to agree on  kids When we first got together we both agreed that we did not want to have children We based our entire relationship on that premise We were content with travelling the world expensive wines and sex on the kitchen bench All that would change if kids came into the picture I have never wanted children and dont feel like I ever willShe used to feel the same Until her sister had a baby She started to get a little clucky she said She started to see us with a baby of our own At first I thought it was just a passing comment but the longer time went on the more I realised she was serious Thats when the fights started Fight after fight every week Her crying and yelling and begging me to change To compromise Me dumbfounded and annoyed that one of the foundations of marriage is suddenly being challenged Things have been said in the heat of the moment and both of us have been deeply hurt by the other She makes me feel like I cant give her what she needs that Im denying her her happiness I make her feel like shes not important she says That Im being selfishMaybe I am I dont knowSo we found ourselves in a stale mate She posted something on Reddit asking for advice and most of the suggestions directed us to attend couples counsellingI was reluctant to say the least But I was willing to give it a shotSandra our therapist was actually not what I expected She seemed rational and quite straightforward not the Einsteinesque shrink that I had imagined She advised that we really we had two options  either she could stay with me and be without a child Or she could leave me for someone who would give her a baby We seem to be stuck in secret option number  staying in the circumstances we find ourselves inDisregarding all the fighting she was still her normal self and we have been managing to keep it together and still spend some quality time together We have still been going out with friends and going for walks with our dog and I know we still love each otherI stopped going to couples counselling I sort of felt like she couldnt give us a real answer she was only there to listen My wife kept attending on her own though I think she takes some kind of comfort in itShe came home last week and told me that shes going to be attending a Self help seminar and would I like to go I said definitely not I couldnt think of anything worse than to be honest Even the counselling sessions were too much for me She asked if I minded if she went She said it was with some famous psychoanalyst and that her therapist would be in attendance on the Assistance Team I said whatever she felt would help She said she feels it will help her clear her head on the baby issue Im all for anything that could help us get back on track so I told her to go for itThe seminar seemed pretty intensive It was  hours a day Friday Saturday and Sunday of last week It was also very expensive but I bit my tongue She got home last night and just seemed exhausted I havent gotten many details out of her as every night when she arrived home she went straight to sleep and we barely had time to speak Today we both had the day off which was recommended by the people who organised the seminarToday we woke up and she wasintense I woke up with her clinging to me for dear life She was stroking my face and staring into my face It was quite nice actually Nice to have some affection We cuddled in bed for a long while She seemedok Her eyes definitely looked brighter but she didnt say much just was very intensely affectionate She got up to have a shower and I went out to have some breakfast After about half an hour I knocked on the bathroom door telling her to leave some hot water She must have had it on so hot steam was pouring out of the door into our hallway and the walls were dripping with condensation I knocked a few more times and yelled out to her but got no responseI opened the door and waited for the hazy steam to clear to see her standing there fully clothed and staring in the mirror The shower was on full ball and extremely hot and I reached over the turned the tap off She didnt take her eyes off her own reflection She was very vague when I questioned her and sweating profusely I managed to get her dressed out her pyjamas and shes in the other room now watching TVI assume this weird behaviour is something to do with the seminar I dont really understand all this new age crap has anyone else ever been to one of these seminars Or know someone that has Ive tried googling more information but cant see anything about this specific group Any advice would be appreciated Im a bit weirded out right now to be honestUpdate herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrhbucupdateneedsomeadvicemywifeseemstobein,Need some advice My wife seems to be in some weird trancezombie like state Not sure what to do or if Im

PlotThickener,13,47,1r0aj7,198,This is a story Ive never discussed with anyone aside from those people involved But I figured it belonged here For the longest time I chalked it all up to pranks my imagination whateverbut hopefully youll all be able to make more sense of itI was driving in a rural part of Wisconsin which if you live there you know is much of the state Lots of flat farms country highways named for letters empty back roads etc It was  pm or laterI dont really remember when but it had been dark for some time and it was the middle of summer so it must have been late It was the time of night cars stop moving on the rural roads so its just you and your headlights and the world around you starts getting really creepy Plus youre always watching out for deer on these roads which can just pop out at any moment so youre kind of on yellow alertIm driving north on a long section of road Theres a big flat farm on my left mostly emptylooking probably planted with soybeans which dont grow high Im concentrating on the edges of where my headlights meet the darkness to watch for deer and I think I see one walking out of the farm toward the roadI tap the brakes not sure of what I see but soon I realize its not a deer Its upright something walking on two feet and its HUGE And its all black Its still moving but its not moving with any kind of walking movement its just sort of gliding across my visionAt this point Ive stopped the car completelyin the middle of the road just watching One instinct was to hit the gas and drive past because I could have easily passed it but Im not sure if it was about to jump out Im not really afraid yet Im just frozen you know those moments where you cant figure out what something is so there are no real emotions That was meThen it comes into clearer view in the headlights Well thats not very accurate to say because it didnt seem to reflect any light It was like the light moved through it if that makes sense But I could see the outline of the figure against everything else that was litthe road the trees etcThe figure looked like Death I mean EVERYTHING you imagine when you read the storiesthe scythe the big black hood It was exactly what you think when you think Grim Reaper only unnaturally tall and thin It was so tall and thin it looked a lot like this guys halloween costume when he wears it after about five minutes or so httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvIPoCkNKDGk Especially how tall it was I mean ten feet minimum I think most people think of the Grim Reaper as being as large as a big person but it wasnt really like thatBut that was my first thought A halloween costume It was still summer though so not Halloween But I rationalize maybe its just a prank But then I pay attention to how it moves to the middle of the roadIt just GLIDES I see no feet no hint that this thing is doing anything but flying off the ground but you cant see feet or anything because the robe hits the groundThen in the middle of the road maybe ten feet in front of me it stopsThe hooded face turnstoward meIts so slow and smooth and just plain UNNATURAL that I completely freeze in the car My hands are locked on the wheel The face is turning to me slowly perfectly smoothly and Im scared out of my mind Even if this is some prank this thing clearly means business Maybe its some psychopath scaring people and not just an innocent prankIt sees me I dont see eyes no glowing eyes or anything just black but somehow I KNOW that its looking at me making eye contact I got goosebumps even on my scalp I remember my hair feeling like it stood straight up I feel like I was literally looking death in the face My stomach sank like someone just told me a loved one had died I mean you do not want to feel this feeling Ever The thing stood perfectly still too as if considering me or weighing me I felt really judged if that makes sense Like I was being consideredThen he glides off so fast I dont even see where he goes The roads are clear again and then I heard the engine running as if all of the worlds sound had suddenly been unmutedI drive back home still frozen still rationalizing what I saw A prank I figure It had to be a prank some overzealous Halloween lover setting up rumors of the Grim Reaper walking around the farms I tell my parents about it and theyre sure its a prank So sure that I eventually rationalize it away and the memory is filed away as creepy but nothing supernaturalAt about the same time I heard that a farmer who owned that soybean field had died that night But it took me a long time before I put two and two together when I realized that I saw something that looked like THE FREAKING GRIM REAPER on the same night that farmer died I remember when I first had the thought and my stomach sankIt was like the rationalization I had used to remember the story of the Grim Reaper was suddenly stripped away and I had to confront the fact that I saw something very very scaryBut what else can I do but live my lifeI went back to collegeevery time I came back home at night I took an alternate road just because I got the creeps so bad Had a good semester mostly As had some good times with friends I drive back mostly during day or evening time so I dont have to revisit those unpleasant memoriesThen my parents tell me that there are more Grim Reaper stories going around lately all pretty similar to mine When you live in a  small town it seems like there are a lot of funerals for old people that you know or at least heard of going on all the time At one funeral an old ladys granddaughter cried because she saw she said a big black figure over the casket My parents heard that story and thought of mine but they still just treated it as a jokeI would stay up a lot later than the people in my house parents  younger brother plus an uncle aunt and cousin who were spending Christmas with us and slept in a room upstairs on this little side road in a rural subdivision No streetlights out there just the lights that other people kept on their garages all nightOne night I went up to my room at about  am and of course the whole house is quiet and I go to my room and turn out the lights so I can go to bed I usually throw a glance out the window and you can see most of the side street because the neighbors kept their garage light on all nightThis time the whole scene looks a little different Theres a big shadow looming in the front yard and its blocking a lot of light Then I look closer and I realize its not a shadowits something black thats cutting THROUGH the lightThen I feel my heart practically stop as I realizeits back The Grim Reaper figureIt was just like before It cast no shadow The scythe was there and the tall hooded cloak with no faceThe breath went out of me when I realized that unlike before this reaper was not looking to the side when I discovered it It was looking right at our houseII stood there frozen again my finger still on the switch from just having hit the light It was a windy winter night and you could see some snow move but the creatures robe didnt move at all The same way its movements before had been unnatural now it loomed like a statue No flailing around in the wind Just standing tall scythe up high staring at our houseI looked away then looked back again Still there Looming I didnt get the sense that it was looking at me but I still couldnt stop staringThen I looked away and looked back again This time I KNEW it was staring Again it was hard to seethere was really nothing that I could tell that suggested it was looking at me No evil glowing eyes or anything I just felt it Felt the same feelings as beforea rotten pit in my stomach the feeling of being measured and weighed and consideredI heard a squeak and realized it was me My breath was being squeezed out of me simply from the fear Keep in mind I had no idea what this thing would do next What fly up to my window Suddenly disappear Rip off its hood and reveal a laughing skullAfter a moment its gaze departed from me again I felt good enough to go to my brothers room and wake him up to show him something in the window It took him forever to get out of bed but it may have only been a few minutes By the time he woke up rubbed his eyes and listened to the panic in my voice a few minutes had at least past I showed him the window but of course the figure was goneBut still that was it I knew The night I saw deathThat was the night my uncle died,The night I saw death,245,nosleep,top_week
chimeraphantasm,44,52,1rbg7n,181,My name is Ramiel and I want you to read this right before you go to sleep Trust me its better this way If its the middle of the day for you or perhaps youre not quite tired yet bookmark this and read it when your eyes are starting to itch with tiredness but youre not nodding off yet I dont want you to forget what youre about to read Im on the tall skinny side of my arabic family I guess I take after my mom in that respect Though im pretty sure she didnt have this much facial hair She named me after an angel that is responsible for divine visions I wonder if she knew how right on the money she was  Why does my name and physical features matter I suppose it doesnt but if Im going to share something this personal with strangers for help or some kind of catharsis id rather you had a good idea of who I am and not just a blank slate  I dont want you to forget me when this is over Before we begin heres an interesting fact to wrap your head around Your brain produces extremely high amounts of a psychedelic compound called DMT Dimethyltryptamine two times in your life Once when you are born to help cope with the pressure it puts on your fragile infant body during the painful process of birth and once again when you are seconds from dying to ease the burden it puts on your body and mind as they both shut down for the very last time This is often why people claim to see their loved ones who have long passed on by their side bright lights from the sky or feelings of elation This process is so strong that it has the capabilities to erase everything in your mind like a mass wipe of your hard drive Now you might think that isnt too important if youre just starting out your life or simultaneously moments away from it coming to an end but I ask you to entertain the notion that you possess a soul or an inner essence of sorts what if that soul that consciousness that essence of you simply continued on without the knowledge of a past existence What if at the moment of death you saw something so undeniably horrifying and inconceivable something youd only seen in fleeting dreams and nightmares throughout your life that your brain compensates in the only way it knows how by erasing any prior memory of it before allowing what makes you you continue onto the next stage of whatever is out there Your brains last failsafe a defence mechanism to ensure you wont carry the burden with you But like any kind of defence mechanism theres always a bypassand theres always a black box  DMT is a chemical produced by your pineal gland and it is responsible for us dreaming every single night Not the reason however We have no idea why we dream we just do As soon we enter REM sleep our dreams become their most memorable and malleable It is at this point we have dreams which take proper form that we feel most real and perceive to be the most accessible though we seldom ever remember the dream itself Because like a drug trip our brain is determined to protect us from that experiencebut what if that wasnt the only reasonConsider this The older we get we sleep considerably less hours As babies we sleep for up to  hours and by the time we hit  years old its half of that amount What if this is a defence mechanism our brain develops so that we dont spend too long in that realm No im not talking about the further from Insidious or some kind of Nightmare on Elm Street knockoff before your already horror obsessed minds make some kind of parable to an existing franchise for comfort or relatable aspects Youre still very much within your own mind but theres something else there with you  Now I ask you to suspend all beliefs or nonbeliefs and read on to hear my story and why I no longer sleep and why despite being an Atheist I pray to something to anything hell even Hypnos would be a welcome evil right now that should my mind succumb to sleep and my body fail me that I dont dream Im a counsellor at my local university I took on the job in September of last year as a ditch effort to bump up my resume and to reduce rent through living on the campus It was your usual run of the mill kind of work talk to terrified st years whod never lived away from home before and were simply not used to their newfound freedom dealing with homesickness new friendships one night stands etc The nd years were dealing with social troubles within their housesapartments deadlines mounting and the occasional unplanned pregnancy The final year students were typically near breakdown over their dissertations and end of year exams so youd offer them all the appropriate advice your own experiences at the university as an example and then ultimately hope it all sinks in If not well theres always next week and beyond that a private therapist But like all forms of employment that deal with face to face interactions theres always one encounter you never forget For me that was Milo Moraga a nd year student studying Psychology amp Philosophy The first time he came into my office he struck me as a little bit gaunt his striped longsleeve top hanging off him like itd stretched in the wash Strung out but shy That would have been my first impression I think he sensed my preconceived notions avoiding making eye contact with me as he shuffled inside He was apprehensive sleep deprived his hair greasy under a black beanie and his eyes laden with heavy dark bags underneath like someone had put on eyeliner while he slept He sat down glancing around at the windows and leant forward cracking his knuckles and rubbing his hands over one another hastilyHello Milo how can I help you I understand you asked for this appointment because ofanxiety Do you want to tell me about that I looked through the brief set of notes the receptionist gave me and tried to study as best I could while he spoke Nothing that would ultimately help me ascertain the problem it just gave him time to compose himself He didnt respond just kept shuffling in his chair I guess he wasnt  sure he should come here  Your lecturer sent you here didnt they I said bluntly feeling a slight headache come on as I felt an awkward  minute session rearing its ugly monotonous head He nodded but I noticed something in that moment that made me think there was more to it His expression was almost like he was pleading for his life as he quickly nodded  I leaned forward placing my hands under my chin and up to my lips as I observed him I had to be very careful with how I handled this If he was suicidal one wrong statement could leave him with a noose round his neck  Milo what happened in the classroom to get you here Can you tell me that muchHe mimicked me leaning forward as well though his posture was the furthest parallel from my own it looked like his spirit was broken The lecturerMs Armstrongshe was talking about solipsism and I just gotlost within it Do you know what solipsism isI did but I shook my head I didnt want to interrupt him when he was being so open Its a philosophical belief that everything an individual perceives is only in his own mind it is a construct of his own psyche There is no other human beings no other individual thoughts just his or her ownI guess I found the idea kinda comforting and I broke down I raised an eyebrow thats certainly not a usual response Comforting Milo You mean to say you enjoy being alone amp isolated  No the opposite actually I have a lovely group of friends a loving family and a fiancé but it was comforting for another reasonif Its just me then what hurts me is just me I know what im capable of and it makes any kinds of threats a moot point It means thatthat He put his hands up to his mouth and began crying silently the picture of this situation was getting uglier and murkier the more he explained It means that I might not die after all I rolled up my sleeves my flannel shirt was already beginning to chafe me First signs of stress I suppose I looked down at my charm bracelet my wife brought me and took in a deep breath I knew this was going to be rough Itsits my dreams doc Theres something in my dreams I cant sleep anymore Each time I do its like I can sense im going into that place again journeying deeper into the void with every evening Ive tried taking coffee shit loads of red bull and any cheap ass energy drinks I can get my hands onI even took those pills truckers take so they can stay wired for  hours butwell you know the problem right doc He looked down and started rubbing his hands together again his knee bouncing as he struggled to keep it under control Withdrawal symptoms combined with sleep deprivation this kid was getting more tweaked by the minute The problem being that we all have to sleep eventually no matter how long we put it off I exhaled Milo I want you to start at the beginning I know youre anxious to get some kind of help but if I dont know the route of the problem I cant give you the correct advice okay Now I want you take in  deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth Can you do that for me And you dont need to call me doc im just a volunteer counsellor You can call me Rami if you like He nodded and did as instructed his demeanour improving slightly with each successive inhale though this was hardly a permanent solution to his paranoia I didnt want to ask at this point how long hed been awake for but I could tell itd been more than a handful of days Once an individual goes past the  day mark they will begin to lose their grip on sanity and brain cells will start to die I was silently hoping I could find out the problem to this sooner rather than later  Alright I picked up my laptop to take notes Go ahead tell me what started this all offWhat follows is the unedited conversation this is verbatim what was said between the two of us If I can find the audio recording later I will attach it to the post  Do you know much about lucid dreaming Rami  I know a little just that its something practiced and allows for complete control of the dream by the dreamer He nods before continuing Theres a learning curve to it you need to lie in bed and shut out all outside sounds and impulses The typical things really the sensation to scratch your arm to roll over to block out the voices He stopped and stared at me with fear I didnt mean to tell you that  Its alright well get to it later lets just focus on the why and not the how for the moment What made you decide to lucid dream in the first place  He shifted in his chair and suddenly looked very timid I kept seeing him in my dreams at first hed just be a random appearance and then hed start to try and approach me friendly smile and hand outstretched like he was greeting an old friend Never threatening or hostile just attempting to make contact with me Though hed never get to Every single time id be distracted by something at the last second or my dream would veer off in another directionHe shifted in his seat and closed his eyes before continuing I remember in the first few dreams we had hed just be lingering in the background If I was walking through a street hed just be standing with the crowd my brain created and not really reacting to anything but me Id see him watch me but then my dream would shift and I guess id just ignore it and carry onafter a few weeks I began getting better at controlling my dreams Id start to mess around with the world I was inhabiting like Inception I guess but morepersonal Id turn myself into a member of XMen or id go on a date with my perfect woman yknowthings that you can only dream of literallywell thats when he started to become more apparent Id usually wake up before he actually got too close but Id always remember the look on his face before I did His eyes widened He always looked so angryFormer abuse victim I thought adding it to the list of potential issues and solutions I didnt want to stop him while he was on a roll I nodded to show my attentiveness and he continued I still remember the first time he managed to speak to me I was in a park id visited as a child with my mother It was a small piece of heaven in London back then a mental safe haven when things got too stressful I guess But this was nothing like I remembered it the trees werent trees they were corpses stacked on top of one another some overlapping andmeshing with one another in unspeakable positions to form branches I could feel the atmosphere almost turn to pure disgust as they noticed me unable to move or even speak to me But their eyes their eyes said everything Because at first they fixated on me with hatred then quickly away in sheer terror Theyd seen something far more terrifying than the fate they were already sufferingsoI His eyes welled up with tears unblinking as they streamed down his face  I looked Rami I looked and saw him standing some  feet away down the path his head bowed He wasnt moving and yet he was His body was almostrippling The closest way I can describe it is the way a signal on a TV channel in the old days used to bend and flicker when the signal was weak Every time I blinked he came closer I tried for the longest time to not blink reallyI did But the brain betrays your conscious impulses The more you try to put off a basic function the more your brain wills you to do it When he was  feet away he simply vanished By the time I had registered that he was gone I heard a whisper in my earhe was standing right behind me I could feel his breath on my neck Ramiit didnt feel humanThere was an awkward silence he took in some deep breaths and shuddered Obviously reliving the memory wasnt going to be something pleasant for him butthe way he reacted it was like he truly had experienced this I stared at him nodding and silently encouraging him to continue When he didnt I leaned forward and quietly asked him what im sure he was waiting me to ask What did he say to you MiloMilo shook his head Im sorry I dont remember That was when the dream ended I didnt see him again in my dreams for a whileWe talked for a little while longer mainly about his anxieties in crowds and eye contact then our time came to an end and we scheduled an appointment for the following week This would be our last session together  It was a Monday morning and id just come back from a friends wedding my wife and I had been drinking so by the time I got to the office I was nursing a hangover my flannel shirt covering the bruises id sustained falling over and my best pair of jeans smeared in alcohol It was a day my mind was not in the work I suppose I just wanted to get home and go to sleep    Milo came in earlier than planned he looked desperate He was pulling at his hair biting his fingernails and pacing constantly It didnt look like hed seen any sleep at all I sent a text to my colleague asking for security to come over as soon as possible He was going to need to be sectioned for his own safety How on earth hed managed to go this long without his friends or fiancee doing something is beyond me  I remember what he said Rami I remember it clearly now He said between pants and more nail biting Okay Milo Well why dont you take a seat and well talk it out He ignored that but stopped pacing and stared intently at me  Ill be right here always He put his arms around himself a self defence mechanism when a persons personal space has been violated That was what he said I heard it again and again every time I closed my eyes He started bashing at his temples IT WONT FUCKING STOP  All I could do at this point was try to keep him talking and calm until security got here  Did this make you afraid to dream Milo  He started laughing his face showing the complete opposite of his vocal expression Pure incredulity and fear on his face against the guttural sound of his manic laughter  You dont get it do you He didnt mean just when I dream He meant always Now I knownow I know for sure He took a deep breath in and his demeanour shifted he suddenly looked like a man almost at peace Not content but willing to let go  Thanks for listening Doc sharing this with someone was important to meand to him Hes going to have his work cut out for him im sure And just like that he got up and left I followed him out naturally concerned for him I watched him leave the building and cross the road  Then he did something I wont ever forget  He turned to me smiling and outstretched his hand crying openly as a vehicle struck him I didnt even see it coming I was so captivated by his expression  I couldnt even bring myself to go over to his body I gave my statement and went straight home All I could do was look in the mirror wondering what it was that was bothering me so much about how I looked and why Milo outstretching his hand was so disturbing to me When I looked at myself I didnt see a  lb brown coloured hipster I saw someone troubled someone who didnt look like theyd slept much lately someone like MiloI got a phone call from the hospital later on that evening Milo was in a coma and on life support He was nonresponsive and likely brain dead His family were choosing to keep his life support on in lieu of their religious and moral views I think deep down they just didnt want to let him go Id been asked to go into his apartment with a member of his family to see if there was anything to indicate why he would willingly stand in front of oncoming trafficI wont bore you with the traveling details but his apartment was surprising I was half expecting a filthy run down place filled with half eaten food and human waste given his obsessive and unstable state Guess I just watched too many detectivehorror movies growing up His place was immaculate everything was extremely clean and organised hed already packed up a lot of his material possessions into boxes with names on the front this was already beginning to look like premeditation He had a desk beside his bed this was the only place in his room that showed any signs of his lack of sanity rubbing off on his living conditions Books on demonology the science of sleeping DMT some sleeping pills and a journal His brother went through the boxes while I took a look at the journal ill include photos later if I get permission from the family names have been changed and anything too personal will of course be blurred out It initially contained legible competent insights into his nightly journeys as he began to lucid dream But as this other entity began to make himself more known and aware the content shifts and the writing becomes hastily scrawled certain words appear larger than others he questions himself on numerous occasions and draws the mans face more frequently as the journal comes to its end  The final entry is barely legible but it details a conversation he had with the man in his dream and that a reminder that he would be with him always  After this there is just a single word on the hardback of the journal rewritten over and over almost like its been carved in DREAMWhich brings us to the final part of this story the present Im sure youd all love to discover im actually cursed or that this story will follow some typical archetype of horror shorts and im moments away from death passing on a final message But as im sure youre all coming to realise that is not the case  I just woke up from a lucid dream ive never had one before nor do I know how I had one but it was definitely a lucid dream I was able to control my reality my own physical form and everything around me It was here I saw Milo He approached me slowly and before I could even say anything he asked me a favour  Pull the plug let me dieI was so taken aback that my rational thought process dissipated and for a moment I wonderedwas this perhaps a shared dream I cant take the torture anymore Rami Please tell my family I love them but I need to be let goIts okay you dont need to suffer anymore in the real world ill do what I can to convince them I croaked placing a hand on his shoulder Milos smile faded  Im not talking about the torture there Rami Im talking about the torture herewithout being able to wake up he has complete control Im his new puppet and he wants to play forever He has no physical form this is where he resides This is where he plays  He looked over my shoulder and back at me with a sad smile on his face   Now hes chosen you as his new playmate He knows youre going to take my place Look at my journal again look at the drawings youll need to rememberHe turned to walk away leaving me feeling completely helpless in my own lucid dream  Oh and Ramidont turn aroundI didnt but my entire being was willing me to Its that same feeling of anxiety you get when youre home alone at night and you have the feeling something is watching you A crushing horrifying feeling I woke up in a cold sweat and did as he said I looked over the journal and in addition to scanning the drawings I found a theory Milo had documented in between the pages of his journal An idea is manifested through suggestive stories and cultural signifiers we can plant ourselves a character or a concept into our subconscious and our dreams with enough hints both subversive and subliminal An idea be it malicious or noble can grow and manifest in one mind before being shared to the masses through any kind of information supplement  The second section detailed a supporting theory  Within every story told fictitious or semibiographical exists a universe that we have created that is as real as our own For how can we truly know if our reality is more valid than the one we have created How can we truly know we have not just been added into a story of our own by a neutral writer we know as god This reality is as malleable and relevant as the one within which we dream Our dream world or coma world it can be argued are the realities and our concept of reality is but a dream in itself that our brain creates to escape the chaos uncertainty and pain of our dreamsYoure probably painting a very good picture of what is happening right nowIve attached an image of the man in this story and im sure youre all familiar with him  If you are youll understand why ive done this  Why ive made you awareThere is no Ramiel that name is a subliminal plant in itself it means Dreamer in Arabic I described him perfectly for you as a defence mechanism against what is going to happen in the coming weeks months and years I gave you plenty of physical aspects for your brain to put together you only know a basic layer of who he is so that your brain can put in the key elements which will make you trust him You know its funny but I found out what Milo meant by Dream its an acronym Dream Rami Evil Always ManifestsThats where I got the idea for RamiHe exists now to help fight off him  Because now youve read this read my experience and Milos youre aware on a subconscious leveland he needs new playmates This is no warning that implies you can do something to change it You cant your dreams are his playground not yours  You can shrug this off as another horror short if you like if that makes you feel better and sleep easier But he doesnt just strike the night you fall asleep he strikes when you allow your dreams to become more open and easier to mould He only enters when the reality is in flux  But with Ramiel in your head now too you have a guide a protector to help you  I didnt At least Milo is at peace hopefully I will be soon too Ive been putting off sleep for days I cant keep doing it much longer   Im beginning to feel drowsy I took a large amount of sleeping pills before writing this last section I cant put off sleeping forever I dont know whether im going to wake up or not but at least youve all been warned about him Feel free to reverse google image search the hosted image learn about him and if you do feel a sense of familiarity please be carefulDream of Ramiel you will be safe I wish you all the best you might not know my name or my face but do not forget my story  I will do my best to answer any of your questions in the comments later Do not forget about him Because believe me he wont forget about you when you fall asleepThe worst thing about all this Im not sure he stays in the dream world anymore When Milo looked at me I think I mistook his expression and his gesture At the time I thought he was crying and happy stretching his hand out to shake my hand Now I think he was terrified to see his worst fears manifested in the real world and he was stretching his hand out to stop him getting to me in the real world Why say this now Well ive been getting steadily drowsier and Ive felt something breathing down my neck for the last  minutes Who knows maybe its just my paranoia Sweet dreams

afewsmallrepairs,11,48,1rff0q,186,Theres always some chipper real estate agent waiting at the door with her flyers and her toobig smile and her nails painted to match her pantssuit  Theyre nosy and smothering but today I see that this one is busy with a bright young couple pointing out how much eastern light the kitchen gets with one perfectlylacquered finger the same goddamn shade of melonred as her smart little blazer  I still take a flyer from the cheery wicker basket in the front hallway out of politeness more than anythingThe house smells like cookies  Its an old realtor trick make someone think that they could be happy in this strange new place picture yourself cozied up on the couch with a plate of freshbaked chocolate chip cookies and a mug of hot cocoa and suddenly the price doesnt seem quite so steep  People want to feel like theyre homeIts a candle I think  Smells soursweet and artificialI realize suddenly Ive been standing alone in the foyer for a few minutes staring aimlessly into the house  Where to begin  The living room I guessTheres a big ugly fauxleather couch along one wall  The cheap kind you find at Big Lots  It doesnt serve much except to fill up the space  Its flanked by two particle board end tables little doilies on top of these  Miss MelonRed Blazer doesnt have much of a sense of style if this is her handiwork  The room looks like a scene straight out of a s Sears catalog  I can feel one of my headaches coming on like the low rumbling of summer thunder on the horizonThere are little dimples on the walls paint covering old nail holes left behind from family photos that once hung there  Scenes of summer vacations children playing smiling happy faces  You only put up pictures if the people in them are smiling rightWell the realtor hasnt put up any pictures  The room feels empty skeletal without themI move into the bathroom  Nothing special here more mementos from Walmart in the form of a seashellshaped soap dish and a tacky plastic shower curtain but Ive found the cookiescented candle so I blow it out with deep sense of satisfactionThere are two bedrooms  One at each end of the hall  I choose the one to my right feeling faintly like Alice in Wonderland as the real estate agent babbles away in the sunny kitchens eastern lightIts a small bedroom  The baseboards look brand new even though the house is several decades old whoever replaced them was an amateur  This looks like a shitty piecemeal job done by someone without nearly enough time or care  Its a shame is what it is  This would all have to be redoneTheyve set up this room as a home office but it should be the childrens bedroom  Where the thriftstore desk and bookshelf sit I can picture two tiny pink beds with matching flowery comforters sweet shiny stickers placed haphazardly across each headboard as little girls sometimes doThe headache is no longer approaching its here spidery sensations of dull pain spreading across my brain  I tap my knuckles against the space between my eyes but it holds fastFocus  I brace myself against the doorframe and there it is the telltale trace of someones childhood tiny little ticmarks carved in the wood to indicate height and its progression through time  I run my fingertips along these marks still so visible through the fresh coat of paint  It even looks like someone tried to sand them off  who would do something like that  Who would try to erase the remnants of someones lifeIf I dont leave I might faint all the blood is in my head with the headache so I do leave I move down the hall to the other roomThis one is the master bedroom  Looks like they couldnt afford a bed to properly stage the scene so this one feels even emptier than the den  The walls have been repainted a cheerful robinsegg blue but its wrong  Its all wrongThey did a fantastic job covering any sign of the fire but this color I hate this color it clashes with my bedspread and I wouldve never slept here beneath this hideous shade of blue  though there were many nights I suppose I didnt sleep I lay awake for hours trying to comprehend what had gone wrong where he was and why he thought he could fool meI drop to a knee to touch the outlet in the wall  Its new of course they wouldve had to replace it  Faulty wiring that causes fires well that just wouldnt do  When the bank takes a house it cant sell one with such a serious problem  Sometimes things need to be replaced resold  A fixerupper thats what theyd call itThe headache is in full force now yet a small smile tugs at the corner of my mouth when I remember everything hed promised to do to this damned house all the little projects he swore up and down hed finish someday to make this place perfect for me things that went forgotten when he decided his energy would be better spent fucking any secretary at the office that looked his wayIt wasnt hard  I went to the library two counties over and did research on arson  I was careful used the private browser on Google Chrome and still cleared the history wore a wig  Id seen enough about Casey Anthony to know how careful you have to be even if she did get off  but no one will ever truly believe she was innocent shell be a pariah forever and thats simply not how I planned to live the rest of my lifeIm really sorry about the children  My daughters  I truly am  I didnt know theyd be in our bed that night  They were supposed to be at a friends house but they came home early someone had pulled someone elses hair and that set everything off like a line of terrible fateful dominoes and the headaches were getting worse and it was probably all for the best anyway  I didnt do anything that couldnt be fixed with a few small repairs both to the house and my lifeIt makes me so angry  He was still acting like father of the year when every night for months he slipped under the sheets beside me reeking of some other womans sex  He couldnt even bother to take a shower and rinse the stink off his dick but he was still being a model dad letting our daughters snuggle next to him when the boogeyman came in the dark and mommy wasnt there because she was away at her own mommys the perfect alibi for when the police came to tell her Im sorry maam theres been an accident could you please come with usIm still crouched next to the outlet when I hear Miss MelonRed Blazer behind me inquiring politely if theres anything she can help me with  The bright young couple has gone and it smells like shes relit the candle in the bathroomI straighten tucking a strand of the long blonde wig behind my ear and smiling in the way that makes members of the service industry smile back at meI explain Im just looking  The price on the house is so low though what could possibly cause such a dramatic drop in this recovering economyThe real estate agents smile falters and she hesitates  I know shes bound by law to tell me to explain what happened here and why the pricetag on a little creampuff in a nice neighborhood is next to nothingI know the old saying about returning to the scene of the crime how dangerous it is and how not careful Im being right now but something in me cant resist because I can still see the little matching beds the stickers across the headboards and the ticmarks on the doorframe and something inside me needs to hear her say it to quantify each and every step I took to get hereWell she says slowly about a year ago there was a fireI nod and smile and as she tells me my story in her own words and somewhere in the back of my skull the headache lets go the pain in my brain dissipating at last leaving behind just me and the real estate agent in my old bedroom standing in the same place where about a year ago my plan went into motion and I set my husband and children aflame ,I hate open houses,234,nosleep,top_week

OdysseyTheCrip,45,47,1r4dm5,148,Fuck meI was told to come here by a friend of mine having never heard of nosleep personally Im not really on board with the idea of having a community of people read my story for personal pleasure but hey what ever I guess a little bit of back story is needed here I live on the nice end of Vancouver city with my grandmother Im in secondary school and that school is in my general poshish neighborhood   days ago I was Getting home from a longass boring day at school I decided to Fuck around on DayZ until either I died or fell asleep at the keyboard At around  my Dog Buddy Decided to be the most annoying little shit possible So i turned my computer off and put the little fuckers leash on At this time of night the whole block was lights out I Could barely see  feet minutes of walking later I began to feel a bit paranoid street lights were flickering fog was getting thicker Buddy on the other hand was  trotting along rubbing his little schnauzer face in the frosted grass Then he stopped Dead in his tracks then buried his head in my calves I urged him to keep moving and after much encouragement he reluctantly followedI rounded a corner going back toward my place when i spotted a figure in the fog a big one Thinking nothing of the fact just someone else enjoying the fucking weather or something As we got closer buddy started barking crazily I urged him to shut up lest he wake the neighbors Then I got a good look at the figure It was a man  about pale He had a brown tweed waist coat a brown tweed fedora and some brown baggy suit pants As we neared him Buddy grew more and more franticThats when I noticed his smile The scariest fucking smile you will ever see He looked like he won the lottery got laid and inherited a mansion within a period of  minutes It stretched from ear to ear a yellowed fake smileGod i wish i could have unseen itI was within about  feet of him then the smell hit me It was a mix between pure decay shit aged cheese Then he stopped right in front of me and said in the most strange voice like an elderly man trying to be smoothYou have a cute dog there boyUh yeah thanksI guess something in my voice must have pleased him or something cause he chuckled a sick smokers laugh I began to move away from him breaking eye contact Looking back on it I should have just fucking ranHe grabbed my armDo you want to see my dogI looked down and i realized he had a leash too He yanked on it and trailing blood Came the corpse of a maggot riddled dogI threw up in my mouth This thing that was once a dog was missing patches of white fur its skin was turning green bits of skin were missing its ear was ripped and an eye was gone I couldnt even tell what the dogs fucking breed wasThrough his smiling teeth he saidPet the dogMy dog was oddly quite this whole timei missed his barkingI tried to get away he tightened his grip on my arm then he dug his finger nails into mePet the dogPlease No was all that came out of my mouthHis smile drained instantly Into an angry twisted frown teeth still showing PET THE FUCKING DOG He screamed yellow spittle flying from his mouth my arm was turning red from the irritation his brown fingernails were causing meI had no choice but to pet the dog I reached down slowly and ran my free hand along its back The fur and skin began to peel back as maggots crawled along my palm My hand was covered in a clear slimy film He let go of my arm then shoved me I landed flat on my ass on the pavement Then i took off running My dog was sprinting along with me Then i heard him laugh then screamNOW I WANT TO PET YOUR DOGMy blood went coldI heard pounding on the pavement behind me and a dragging He was coming after me pulling his dog along with him Running  straight blocks i ran down my

Angelbut when the Boothworld Industriesfiascowent down I checked out If you were an ex girlfriend youd be snickering and telling your friends Ive come crawling back begging for your help Id be embarrassed but I havent felt much in the past few days I dont care anymore I just need to tell this to somebody I need to feel like a person again Have you ever wondered if there was anything more out there I mean literally out there above the sky  Have you ever just stared at the stars and wished that youd some day get to see the Galaxy like it was a Star Wars or Mass Effect civilization I was no naive for the yearning I used to feel Now Im the dog who actually caught the carI have no idea what to do with itand I couldnt laugh if I triedSunday night maybe amI had just shut down my computer after my nightly gaming session  I was laying in bed browsing reddit on my phone and debating whether or not I was hungry enough to eat another can of spaghettios or if it would even be worth the trouble of walking downstairs and waiting for it to heat up Im not sure what made me notice it what actually snapped my senses to the realizationbut it was suddenly too quietGranted it was am so its not like I was expecting any sort of noise in particular  My roommate had fallen asleep hours ago but it was just so still  Im not sure if any of you know what Im talking about but it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up  I felt like I was in a vacuum it was utterly oppressive Im not sure how long I sat there waiting for something before the glow  A deep blood red light had flooded the hall and oozed under my door and it was slowly pulsing  I wanted to call out to tell my roommate to fuck off but I knew it wasnt him I just knew I dont think I couldve formed words if I tried  The vacuum sensation I had felt was gone and now sitting in my tiny bedroom I felt like I was under a microscope That terrible like youre being watched sensation I read about so much hit me like a brick  I cant explain how exactly I felt a mix of horror dread and confusion  I wanted to bolt but I wouldnt have been able to force myself to open that door if I triedI managed to shuffle off my bed and to the floor  I opened up my nightstand reaching for my revolver I needed to feel that cold steel and the heft of it in my hand As soon as I picked it up I was at a loss because for the first time it just felt like a toy in my hand I looked back to the door to that glow and felt completely powerless  There was a shadow now someone was standing outside my bedroom door and I felt like I might as well have been holding a nerf gun  When the long scratch started I felt nauseous  Like I was  again smoking weed in my room when I thought I had the house to myself and my mom knocked on the door asking why the fuck it smelled like burning leaves in the hall That sudden weight in my stomach the sudden dryness in my mouthIt was like a nail being dragged down the door from the top of the doorway to the bottom  I followed the sound with my eyes and when it stopped I heard a voice  Hear might not be the right word because it came from inside my headMichael Please put down the weapon  We do not want to harm you and I do not plan on doing so Your weapon would be useless anyways but I respect your autonomy May I enterThis had to be a dream a nightmare If every waking moment since Iheard that voice hasnt been an eternity in a waking hell I might be able to convince myself that it wasI wish to speak with you Michael We have much to discuss May I enterThere was no fucking way this was happening  Imlucky I didnt need to because I couldnt have spoken if I tried  Whatever it was must have known there was no way I would have let it in because it answered me anywaysNo matter you will see us in due time  We would like to invite you on a journey Michael  You will come with us and see everything you have always wished to Weve known you for a long time you would say years  You have a week to decide we will not force you You will require no luggage no currency You will want for nothing  You will not see your family or friends again but in time you will cease to worry about them   We respect your decisions I do think however you only have one real choice  I will see you soonThen it was all just overI might have sat there for hours At some point I got up and sat on my bed  When I finally mustered the courage to look out the window it was already dawn When I heard my roommate get up and go to work and finally figured it was safe to open my doorI am a shell  I dont know what to do you guys  I havent slept I forced myself to eat something yesterday but everything tastes of cardboard  I booted up my computer but now my life just feels like a game Im sick of I forced myself

tellmewhatiswrong,39,45,1rhbuc,118,OriginalPosthttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsreivzneedsomeadvicemywifeseemstobeinsomeThanks to everyone for your responses I have taken a lot of your adviceIll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours I was going to walk our dog Zeus but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confusedShe woke up after a couple of hours and waswell Happy Really really happy Almost manic She woke up full of beans and smiling like a maniac I was initially relieved I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed We set off for our normal walk and she was extremely energetic bounding off in front of Zeus and I Zeus is a Labrador and although he is a big boy hes still a pup We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as were trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable Its always been a real task getting him back on the leash though he never ever comes when hes called Anyway we let him off and hes running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough My wife shes picking flowers and sniffing them and singing She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit as she sings under her breath I was feeling quite content at this point Figured she must have just been over tiredShes swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt She yells in an almost unfamiliar masculine voice Zeus Here and points in front of her feetI stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know solemnly trot over to where shes pointing sit in front of her and stare up into her face They both sat there for a split second very still looking at each other I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her Umwhat the hell How did you manage that and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again and she started swinging again  Oh she said I used my mind to call out to himits something new I learnedShe seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest I pressed her for more details but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got She knows I dont believe that for a second Im just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained Thats really the only explanation I asked her to do it again but she refused so I think we both know it was a flukeThe rest of the afternoon wasnice Kind of odd Its like theres something thats amiss Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that something is not how it should be but you cant pin point whatWe talked a bit about the seminar She said that it was very intense The days were very long She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset to explore the root causes for whats going on in your life I asked if any hypnosis was used as suggested by you guys and she said no They talked a lot and were assigned to small groups and encouraged to open up and explore their inner beings She said she felt a lot better since attendingStill something was not quite right For instance we were talking about my sister who lives in another state and how she had recently got a new job A few minutes later my phone rang and it was her I picked it up and said Emma Speak of the devil and my wife smashed me up the side of the head causing me to drop the phone and shouted Emma is NOT the devil How could you say that Emma is NOT THE DEVIL I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down She was very upset at what I had said She sort of went silent again and was very still She seemed rather annoyed at me but by this point I was nearing exhaustion myself so I let her beShe fell asleep early about pm on the couch I covered her with a blanket and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and Ive never noticed it before I think that in my state of hyper vigilance I am being overly perceptive of small details I read more of my original post and all your comments and decided to step outside and call our therapist just to find out more about the seminar as I knew she was there assistingI walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her She answered on my first ring What she said has really weirded me out Only because although she gave me a lot of information she has raised many more questions as well as answered them She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda who are both selfappointed psychotherapists She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state they may need assistance She said she has referred a lot of her clients to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases Basically the course is about discovering your inner self and using different methods to connect to your inner voice to find out what the cause of your worries are She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense Each session goes for  hours with only an hour break During these sessions many different activities and topics are explored including regression Apparently Brian does this  hour session on the second last day where he gets everyone to meditate and be still and he regresses them back to childhood or even in some extreme cases past lives Our therapist said it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that but that she seemed brighter had a clarity about her after this experience They discussed what my wife had gone back to in her mind and the therapist was happy that it hadnt caused her any great distress but reminded me she couldnt discuss the specifics She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her experience I told her about my wifes strange behaviour She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions but nothing major I dont know if its just me but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice I dont know maybe I imagined it She said to call her if theres any further problems I hung up and as I was putting out my cigarette I turned to go inside and my wifes standing there staring at me I jump and say Jesus Christ honey you scared me and she replied Not as fucking much as Im going to scare you Ummm ok I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face and her face was fixed in this awful scowl I figured she must still be pissed at me from before I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep And well thats where she is now she was supposed to be off work today too but I was meant to go back to my job But when my alarm went off I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok I rang in sick for work and Im just doing some household jobs waiting to see if shes better when she wakes up and googling what regression means and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone Still nothing that convincing though I dont know Maybe Im too skeptical I just dont believe this crapThe whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me if Im honest But I have to say it has caused some kind of change in my wife She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment and Im worried because we both have to go back to work tomorrow and her work environment is very proper She is always a perfect employee and very dedicated to her work I cant help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in thismood Do you guys know anything about this regressionis it the same as hypnosis She was adamant she wasnt hypnotised but it sounds like it to meEDIT Ok now Im getting really freaked out I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep I cant quit work out what song shes singing Ive never heard it before But shes saying something about being someone called Azara or something Its really fucking unnerving it doesnt even sound like her Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light EDIT TWO Ok I managed to record a bit of itshes singing but I dont know what has anyone heard this before Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her Im kind freaked out now Ill admit it Here it

slightlyspooked,45,22,1re11f,87,NoSleep I need your help Where do I begin I started working volunteer shifts at my local community centre about  months ago I love my job I get on well with all my coworkers but somethings been bothering me recently More than bothering me actually Theres been an attack on a child Well  I cant call it an attack exactly Everyones calling it an accident but I cant believe that Let me start over This whole thing began when the centre began to hold saturday clubs  an hour or two every weekend when kids are given pretty much free reign over the place We put on activities  cake baking crafts that kind of thing  and just generally keep an eye on the placeWere also there to keep the kids out of the basement Id like to say before I start that Ive never heard of anything being up with the basement before Im not a particularly superstitious person or at least I wasnt before all of this happened and I dont scare easy Basically the kids have to stay out of the basement because theres a lot of junk down there that could topple over onto one of them or otherwise get them in trouble Just to reiterate this is the only reason I was ever given for keeping them out of the basementBut kids arent satisfied by a simple its dangerous down there They wanted to know why Well I spun them this cock and bull story about how Id seen a monster down there once The other volunteer that day Julie joined in on the fun immediately and soon we had them all believing that there was something dark and horrible in the basement that would snatch them up and eat them if they ever went down there Were talking about  year olds here so the stories werent particularly gory or scary  but they believed us pretty much right off the bat Maybe thats why things went so weird Im sure those of you whove been around children know that they see the world in a different way to the rest of us  what seems to us like childish fantasy might as well be real life to them Anyway I told them that story three or four weeks before the incident Every Saturday wed have these kids in and every Saturday the veteran members of the group would take on the duty of informing the new members of what horrific fate awaited them should they wander into the basement With each telling theyd add details Some of them were actually very grim  they came up with one about a Victorian boy  bearing in mind that the community centre was only built in  that had been eaten by the monster and still roamed the halls crying out to go home The details got more and more gory  they came up with the idea that the monster would mark its victims with three slashes of its horrendous glistening claws  this was the same week we were showing the Zorro movies on the old projector In short it was beginning to seem as though Saturday Club had turned into NoSleep Junior We had complaints from parents about their children being too scared to come in and so my boss decided it was time to put a stop to the monster talk We tried everything we could to get the kids to stop talking about it  we played nonmonstery games with them we made apple pie we even passed the caretaker off as a professional monster hunter That kept them quiet for a while and we began to hope that theyd lost interest altogether In the meantime though I began to feel more and more uneasy locking up the centre at night I had no reason to be afraid  Julie or one of my other coworkers was usually waiting at the front desk for me in case there was trouble and the Zumba fitness group usually hung around outside until we locked up anyway In short nobody could get in without one of us noticing I mention that because the night before the attack I could have sworn I heard someone   a small someone  crying all through my lockup It always seemed like the voice was coming from the next corner but when I looked there was nobody there I even got Julie out to have a look  she said she couldnt hear anything but I could tell she was concerned Maybe she just wanted to get home early I dont know I told the police I hadnt seen anyone for definite anyway I wasnt working the next day but thats when the attack happened I dont know much about the details  the police told me that Julie heard crying and screaming from the basement and went down to find two of our regulars Tommy and Rosie spattered with blood and crying When she rounded the corner she discovered a third child  I wasnt told his name he was new  lying unconscious beneath a shelf She confided to me later that while shed told police the shelf must have toppled onto him it looked more like hed been hiding beneath it What sent me to you guys though is the other thing Julie told me Her first instinct being a mother herself was to pull the child out from under the shelf and make sure he was okay He didnt have any of the injuries shed expect in this kind of accident  no broken bones not even a bruise Instead he had three bloody lines carved into his chest Three large horrible claw marks When the police asked the other two children what theyd witnessed theyd only say The monster got him The Centre is closed until further notice  I think they think theres some sort of psychopath living there Thats the logical explanation but somehow I cant help questioning it When I pass by the closed Centre I swear I can hear a child crying inside  crying to go home The boy is okay by the way  apparently hes recovering at home but he wont name his attacker Hell only say that something got him I take a little comfort knowing that hes alright but how long will it be before something else happens Something worse Im afraid NoSleep  what have I done,Ive Created a Monster,109,nosleep,top_week
DakotaKim,23,38,1raxlb,87,Before you skip past this No this is not a coincidental Doctor Who related post I dont know if Im the only going through this I cant stay here long The quickest way to explain whats happening to me is with a recap of my days I woke up in my bed as usual but the second I blinked I was in the local train station two weeks ago My clothing changed accordingly I looked around and people were giving me puzzled looks I looked in the passing trains glass and saw that I was bleeding from my mouth and eyes I blinkedI was in my childhood home watching my childhood self enjoy a bowl of cereal He saw me and ran off terrified My father who recently passed ran into the dining room and shot me in the chest Pain surged from my chest to my brainI blinkedDue to the stress of the situation I cant really remember where Ive been I just remember fear and painI dont know whats going on but when I blink I get ripped from where I am and I open my eyes to a new settingRight now Im trying my absolute hardest to not blink Im at a Best Buy on one of the laptops My eyes are welling up with blood and I dont think I can do this for long I dont know whats going to happen to me If I leave I will check back when I can if I can My memory is slowly fadingThe only thing that I know for certain is that there is a man wherever I go I cant see his face but he looks to be in his late sixties carrying a duffle bag Hes here in the store Watching me with a smileI dont know what will happen if I dont open my eyes If I keep them shut will this fix itself Ive gone to over a thousand different places today and I need anyones help If you see a man bleeding from his eyes and mouth its me Restrain me and dont let me goDo I need to talk to the man Im trying so hard not to blinkOne of the worst places Ive been so far was an abandoned hospital where the man tried to ch,Dont Blink,125,nosleep,top_week
DeviousPigeon,27,26,1r1o1m,83,Help meI dont exactly know where to turn like the majority of the sub Im assuming you share the same interest as me in the supernatural the other side Ive always been intensely fascinated with it usually the furthest I went was browsing rnosleep or heading into abandoned houses to sate my thirst for the creepy although the same routine things quickly became dull and eventually I slowly got desensitized bored This was about the time I started reading recipes for paranormal experiencesThe whole thing seemed awesome the Midnight Man One Man Hide and Seek The Shoebox Telephone All gave me chills but I remained quietly skeptical the whole time Fuck Why did I have to be so blind I still cant find the place to blame myself I mean reading scary stories on the internet posted by a bunch of anonymous people it would be stupid to take it all for fact rightOf all the rituals one caught my eye The Three Kings Im hesitant to post the link but I feel like it would be naive to think that no one would give it a quick search httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentswboupleasedontactuallytrythis A blunt explanation of it would be a recipe where you can contact the dead and ask them questions through two propped up mirrorsAfter reading it I felt like I had to do it I quickly spread it to a few friends and it wasnt long until hype was built upon the whole thing Me and my best mate For his sake ill call him Darcy organized to do this when we had a few friends over for a small gathering whilst my parents were out for the week Funny enough at the time the thing I was worried the most about was it not working We had tried a ouija board once at my request and nothing happened we all just sat there fingers on the cup for  minutes blaming each other for pushing it whenever it moved in the slightest They all probably thought I was an idiot So I thought I would give it a kick my bright idea would be that we would all get absolutely hammered beforehand so that when it surely didnt work we would imagine that it did or at least get really scared in the process Well at least we had the really scared part down patSo everyone came at around pm yesterday and it was all pretty normal caught up bitched about a few people had some laughs and it wasnt until around pm that we started to set up The atmosphere then was so amusing of all things We all giggled the whole time in our stupor acting as if we were kids in primary school kids about to pull a really lame prank It all seemed fun then Of course I had to be the one who volunteered to be the one who sat the throne eager to show my courage off to my friends My lifeline was Darcy if anyone was to hold the key between my life and death id gladly hand it to himFor the sake of the story Ill skip all the tedious setting up and get to am We were all fighting sleep by then and I think Sarah and Alistair were already gone though we were sitting outside that door for so long it was hard for us to miss the time When I had walked in I was immediately hit by the cool air though this one wasnt the ghostly cold it was literally fucking freezing from the fan that had been buzzing on for a few hours Though something did feel off it was either the fact that I was in a pitch black room holding a candle to my chest with a chair and two mirrors propped up adjacent to it or it was that all of a sudden everything was quite As if the world around me was devoid of life bar the constant drone of the fan I sat down clutching the candle tightly persistent to not let it go out suddenly very aware to what i was doing I remember shifting in my chair uncomfortably for a while but what follows that still remains hazy I remember trying to call out for answers Whos there What are you doing Is there another side None were answered just silence and the buzzing of the fan I then said something stupid and heard giggling assuming it was my friends outside I started cracking jokes The more jokes I made the harder they laughed until I said Why arnt you responding too scared to show your faces and looked into the mirrors Now the huge cardinal rules of this recipe is not to look in the mirrors and around about this whole thing turned to fucking shit The worst thing about looking into the mirrors isnt what I saw but rather the absence of it I saw nothing i saw the chair the fan but no me I quickly looked to the other and greeted by the same emptiness Then the rumbling began have you ever been in a house when a plane has flown overhead and the ground slightly shakes It was like that except the sound emanated from the floor rather than the sky It continued to get louder and louder until my eardrums felt as if they were going to burst and then I peed myself The mirrors shattered and sent shards of glass everywhere and my candle was quickly snuffed out and I screamed boy did I scream I legged it out of there like nobodies business and slammed the door behind me Of course everyone was fast asleep but woken up with a few of my screams and sharp kicks to the ribs They attempted to calm me down but i was flailing and screaming I told them we had to get out of my house but where do seven  year olds go at  am in the morning Eventually I calmed down and tried to pass it off as a drunk hallucination which i knew was very impossible but it made my mind sort of at ease We decided to get everyone up and camp downstairs in the living room I felt safer with all of them around me and after much apprehension my tired state got the better of me and I drifted off to sleep Last night was some of the worst nightmares i ever had I saw my friends hanging and mutilated I saw my childhood cat lay gutted on the floor I saw myself smiling at a mirror When i woke up i was upstairs in the room In between both mirrors which had been shifted to face me lying on the floor All my friends had left when i called them they all gave me half ass reasons and some just avoided the question altogether Im scared It is now  and starting to get dark again and I havent been into the room since I woke up this morning Help me please I dont feel alone in my house anymore,Please help I screwed

BensonHedges,4,22,1r2xlz,78,I heard the coffee pot drip before my alarm even went off bizarre I dont usually set a timer I like to go to the gym before I have my coffee Maybe it was my boyfriend being nice He typically works the graveyard shift and sometimes he comes home in the early morning to leave nice surprises Might as well get up I said aloud to myself since no one else was home My cat was absent from the bed which is also weird hes usually by my head in the mornings As I stretch my legs and arms out I notice an odd chill run up my spine Surely it was the weather New England has a way with inconsistent temperatures and the blanket over me was not quite fit for winter Its November that sixtydegree weather is bound to disappear sooner or later I havent quite figured out the thermostat we just moved in and the heat only seems to kick in on times when Im not home Must be the reason we bought this place so cheapand why people keep selling it New England is not the place to have a busted heating system This has been the biggest point of arguments since my boyfriend and I started cohabitating Get out of bed youre going to be late to your class I said this to myself a few times in hopes to have motivation to get to the am class at the gym I had no idea what time it was but if the coffee pot is going off it was creeping close to sunrise I havent unpacked the alarm clocks yet so my phones been the only thing reminding me what time of the day it is I thrusted my arms to the floor and pulled my phone to my bed   am What the fuck Ive still got twoandahalf hours of sleepand why is the coffee pot onI slipped out of the bed from the left side and stumble to the kitchen to turn off the coffee pot Im a coffee lover but nothing smells worse than burntcoffee As I went to flip the switch to off I realize the time isnt illuminated on the pot Directly above on the microwave  nothing Damnit The power went out The dripsound of the coffee pot was so loud and it was too early I was confused I could even smell the lingering scent of fresh brewed coffeebut it was am my mind must be playing tricks on me I headed back to the bedroom a little freaked out but convinced it was just all a coincidence This hallway seems so much longer in the dark and I still havent gotten used to the layout of this condo As I pass the bathroom I notice a shadow out of the corner of my eye I turned my head and didnt see anything except the shower curtain pulled all the way open Since weve moved in we havent used that showerweve got a shower stall in the bedroommuch more convenient Though I am sure there was a logical explanation for it When I get to the bedroom  another chill down my spine This was uncomfortable it was a winter chill I was feeling I was sure of that Something was wrong but i couldnt figure it out I need to go back to bedI hop in the bed and pick the blankets from off the floor As I turn on my side I hear the heater click on The electricity is back onfantastic I start counting sheep in my head to fall back asleep and keep thinkinghow did the blankets end up on the floorWhat feels like an hour later my alarm finally goes off The smell of burnt coffee has filled the condo and now Im frustrated I should have just unplugged the damn thing And where is my cat I have most definitely woken up on the wrong side of the bed I moved to the kitchen to pour some coffee  and its dry Nothing I must be imagining things That chill again I could feel the hairs spike up on my neck  absolutely razor sharp I decided to skip the gym and start my morning I remained timid but continued with my normal routine As I rummaged around the kitchen I noticed my cat out of the corner of my eye He was twitchy and obviously anxious A few years ago my cat had major anxiety problems and he developed what my vet called  Rolling Skin Syndrome When my cat got anxious his skin would roll around his body it looked almost as if he had a small gum ball moving around beneath his fur Today that ball was most definitely movingHe paced back and forth around the house with me now seeming more comfortable now that I was up with him Every time I moved to another room he cautiously peeked around the corner almost as if he was looking for something We moved to the bathroom I started to floss and then I heard itdrip drip drip I am sure its not the coffee pot and the house starts to smell again As I analyze my senses the smell become more pungent Less of a coffee smell and more of a rancid scent Drip drip dripI follow the noise it seems louder now and it seems like its coming from the bedroom Surely I would have heard it loud and clear when I was in bed earlierit seemed so distant then I enter the bedroom and my cat stopped dead in his tracks His skin is rolling again and he appeared more on edge tail straight in the air and its hairs following suit And that chill of course it was back And my sheets and blankets on the floor againWHAT THE FUCK Im working from home today and every time I walk by the bedroom I get the chills Ive resorted to closing the door until Im not alone It sounds like the wind is blowing up against the windows in that room but from where Im sitting the trees are as still as everEDIT Things are getting weirder or Im just going crazyhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrzlqgoodmorningnotpt,Good Morning,100,nosleep,top_week
TheGroovyTurte,12,21,1raatv,75,So Im not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told if only for my own piece of mind  Im an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously underserved community  The hospital itself is old its been standing since the late s it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium Ive never really encountered anything supernatural but I havent written off the existence of such phenomena  That being said a shadow in the night isnt enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the nightSo when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty well  Id have my admissions Id take care of the current patients without issue  Then one night I got an admission Ill call this patient Jerry  Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any would be physician that trains at this facility  He has a whole boat load of medical issues kidney problems diabetes high blood pressure  He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia Before meeting Jerry I was told hes actually a really fun guy hes always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here  So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen I was a little anxious  The admission was done the orders were placed and I didnt think more of it  He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night  It was around  in the morning when I went back to see Jerry  I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up  When I went in there Jerry wasnt in his bed  Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying not crying but rather whimpering as if he didnt have the stamina to make it a full cry  I tried putting on a brave face and said Jerry whats going on For an old guy Jerry was quicker than I thought and stronger than I would have believed  He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him  They wont leave me alone they wont let me sleep they wont let me eat  He continued on in this line of things the phantom they wouldnt let him do  I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home  As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this I still needed the blood and this wasnt the first time Id dealt with a confused older patient  I helped Jerry back to his bed  Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK  Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient it was something familiar  I tied the tourniquet in place then I cleaned his arm found my vein and went for it  Im not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing I was filling up my vial it was about half way full when Jerry started screaming LEAVE ME ALONE LEAVE ME ALONE He began to jerk violently somehow the needle stayed in place but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerrys body was pulling it back  I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm but the needle didnt budge  In shock I pulled harder my efforts still could not budge the needle  In response I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing  The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being  full to maybe being about  full  After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerrys arm leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise  Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me Can you see them  I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room  I walked back to the nursing station one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming  I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill  With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep  I made my way to the oncall room which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital  I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes  All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerrys eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing and a senile sick old man  The only trouble is since then the shadows Ive seen in dark rooms seem darker the lights unable to pierce them  The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings  Im not really sure what to make of it  In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker the tapping louder and now I cant shake a feeling that Im being watched

floydnimrod,21,24,1rhxtb,114,Id just come from church for some reason Im not sure why Id gone into the church but it was the weirdest service Id ever been too Everybody was there It was a packed house Rich people poor people criminals middle class folk It was all people who didnt normally go to church I looked into the coat room as I walked in and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top Right in a church I was like what the hell Ive never see thatI sat in a pew and looked up There was no minister They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ and the minister was applauding her She seemed happy But the audience was restless not really paying attention not sitting down just kind of wandering around talking to everybody And then I saw a woman I used to know someone I worked with years ago I went to sit down next to her and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me saying she was so glad to see me I wasnt sure if she was sad or drunk or terrified or just lonely but she whispered in my ear offering me sex saying shes always wanted me ever since shed known me I sort of pushed her off my lap thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pickup And then I got up and walked out There wasnt really a church service going on anyway I dont even think it was SundayAnd then for some reason I was in a car with this old lady I dont even know who it was or why I was with her She was old like my grandma Freddie but it wasnt her We were driving down the street She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost I dont think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street almost the size of Portage with several lanes But they all seemed to be deserted like very early on a Sunday morning Im not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset but the sun was low in the sky I think it was late in the day The streets were mostly clear thoughThe lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car I think she was going to ask somebody for directions I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled like the satellite was confused or just no longer there And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds It basically turned green instead of blue but only for a moment and then it was back to normal Everybody stopped and looked upI was still in the car but I leaned forward and looked out the window The sun was over in the west low in the sky And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the suns normal path It was huge And my stomach got queasy for a moment It made your stomach sick because it was so big it actually pulled on you with its own gravity like the moon pulls on the tides but much bigger and everything inside you just got tugged aroundBut it went straight across the sky without hitting When I realized how close it was though I knew it was gonna hit somewhere probably on the other side of the world The gravity of the earth pulled it in and it slingshotted around to the other side somewhere I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old ladys armCome on We have to find shelter Its gonna hit We just abandoned the car in the street and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station or hydro office or whatever it was Im not sure which it was but there were large utility trucks with lifts on them It was also deserted for some reason except for two guys loading one of the trucks We banged on the doors but it was locked up We ran from door to door trying to get in but everything was locked And then I felt a great rumble under my feet It nearly knocked me down Ive never been in an earthquake so I dont know what its like but it felt like the entire planet shivered Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside except there were no hills I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions We were able to stay on our feet though A few moments later the sky in the north went dark If I assume the sun was setting in the west and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a northwest to southeast direction then it was north the black came from And I mean the entire sky Like a wall of blackness smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere from west to east as far as you could see in one huge wall of black cloud And it was coming toward us Well sort of going towards everyone everywhere I guess It came over the horizon like an charging army fast and steady advancingIt hit on the other side of the world somewhere Come on we have to get indoors We wont be able to breatheThe air started turning yellow Ash started raining down and bits of rock and debris from the blast where ever it hit I took a deep breath and held it as I was running I could already smell a weird burning rock smell like sulphur like burnt matches but more metallic Me and the lady finally got into some doors but it was just a little foyer We ran in and shut the doors behind us The inside doors were locked But it was somewhere to hide There was a fire alarm I pulled it not really knowing why I was bothering But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight The sign said In Case of Emergency so I pulled it The alarm went off and we looked out the window The yellow air turned brown and then dark red Then everything went black The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water And all light went out of the worldThe world as we knew it was over Even if we survived life as we know it would never be the same Wed be set back  years reduced to hunter gatherers again living out of caves If we survived the impact that is I honestly dont think anybody would have survived the shockwave Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybodyOf course thats when I woke up,I just dreamed of the apocalypse I probably wont sleep for a few days

Charliesfriend,20,7,1rhapg,80,A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community so I decided to create an account to share mineWhen I was a little girl about nine years old my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas My father had just gotten out of the Army and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world and spending two of those years in active combat zones my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone He couldnt have found a better location for this purpose anyone whos ever followed Interstate  westward through that area knows there isnt much between Topeka and DenverI still remember the day we my mom dad older sister and I moved into that old ranch house It had been built in the early s and being something of a history buff I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition the depression both world wars and everything since The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road backed literally into a hill This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground buried in the hillside Outside the house was a little grassy yard area and across this yard was an old barn We didnt have any horses but my dad held a particular love for classic cars and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare timeMy sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs while my parents took the master bedroom oddly on the first floor My sister and Is rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen and the stairs led down from thereIt was only our second or third night in the house that I began to notice some strange things occurring I was unable to sleep one night and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed The house was incredibly quiet both from being in the middle of a very isolated area and by virtue of being half buried Just as I was reaching the halfsleep stateSLAM I heard a door downstairs slam shut At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it but I couldnt make myself believe that And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core I heard footsteps coming up the stairway I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes so it probably wasnt my parents coming up to check on me I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs and then begin down the landing I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door pause for a moment and then continue on When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room he paused again and again he continued He reached the far end of the landing and then turned around and came back the way he came He continued for what seemed like an eternity pacing around outside my sister and Is rooms I finally worked up some nineyearold courage and crawled to the door I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside I waited until he was moving away from me and I was between him and the stairs planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned I barely cracked open the door and looked out and sawnothing The footsteps had stopped and the whole house was empty and still I was confused and afraid but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed A minute later the footsteps started again back and forth all along the landing Eventually they lulled me to sleep I didnt mention the noises that night to anyone fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko and of being made fun of by my sister But over the next few weeks everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch Objects moved on their own Small things would disappear for days only to be returned exactly where theyd gone missing from It was what I guess youd call typical poltergeist activity nothing harmful or malevolent just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room My family eventually began referring to this entity as Charlie He seemed to be a harmless ghost and sometimes downright helpful Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen The coffee maker had no automatic timer Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something like car keys or the like wed search the house frantically only to turn around and find what wed been searching for laying on the ground behind us And sometimes Charlie would slam a door or walk around loudly or turn a sink on seemingly just to let us know he was there And always those footsteps at nightCharlie always seemed particularly active in my dads auto shop My dad would occasionally find car parts hed been working on had been tinkered with despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there Sometimes tools would go missing only to be returned a short time later Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet When we asked what was wrong he just said Charlie was walking around out thereJesus I thought you all were just hearing things I wasnt sure why Charlie loved that shop so much but incidentally that was where I caught my first sight of him It was a Saturday and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch and asked me to take it to him I eased open the barn door and saw my dad seated at his work bench his back to me And I saw another man next to the car also out of my dads field of vision He was about  with dark hair and eyes He was dressed in what looked like typical s clothing black slacks a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt and topped off by a brown paper boy hat cocked to one side He looked right at me for a second a big mischievous grin on his face and then he simply disappeared I didnt even realized I was still holding my dads sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to realitySo passed the next few months My family was happy on our little haunted ranch Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us and life was good And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting One night in late November however I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could beMy dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka almost two hours away and since my Sister was almost  by then and there was virtually no crime in our rural area my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning Of course to my sister and I it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted watch scary movies all the kid stuff you cant do with your parents around At around midnight I was in my Sisters room with her watching some movie on her TV when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room My first thought was that it was Charlie playing another prank by this felt different somehow Charlies noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home But this noise sounded violent and angry Before I could really react we heard another loud crash and another My sister cautiously peeked out of her door and down into the living room I swear I saw her go white She began trembling and her hand covered her mouth I peeked around her to see what she saw and felt y blood run cold We could just barely see two men outside our from door One of them was kicking it in As we watched a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out and they both entered our home shining long flashlights all over My sister and I crawled under her bed and held each other tight This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt But as the two men began to go through the living room another loud crash came from the kitchen One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut a favorite trick of Charlies The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted Is there anyone in here If you are you better come out now We will find you and we will FUCK you up My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud At the mans words though Charlie apparently got angry We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room I heard one of the men say Whatthe FUCK And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around All at once every door window and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently and loudly Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls across the floor even at the intruders At this point the one in charge just yelled FUCK this and turned and ran out his buddy close behindAs soon as the men were out of the door everything stopped and the house was again silent It was a long long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move She had left her cell phone downstairs and and she needed it to call the police and our parents She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone I followed As we got to the bottom I looked into the kitchen and for just a moment Charlie was standing there exactly as I saw him before with the same grin on his face A moment later he was goneThe police arrived shortly and my parents not far behind The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables and they must have been scared off by a passing car Lucky for us My sister and I didnt even try to tell them what really happened and within thirty minutes both men were caught still fleeing After that night hearing Charlies walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night When he played his little pranks I would always look for him And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smileSeveral years later when I was a junior in high school I was working on a school report at the local library The topic was the history of our town and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my familys ranch I typed our address on the search bar and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks The date of the old article was July   and at the top was a picture of a man about  with dark hair and eyes It was unmistakably Charlie The title of the article read Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child a daughter after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu On the night of July  the article said Mr Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town When he pulled up to the house he found the door had been forced open He ran inside and found a man on top of his daughter The girl was sobbing her dress had been ripped open and the attacker held a knife to her throat In a moment of sheer instinct Mr Davis threw himself at the intruder tackling him of his daughter and as he held the attacker Mr Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor who promptly called the sheriff When deputies arrived they were able to apprehend the attacker who had been beaten half to death Unfortunately he had stabbed Mr Davis three times in the chest Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor,Charlie,87,nosleep,top_week

TheGraveSin,10,17,1rdci1,60,So I grew up on a farm cows chickens horses you name it I usually got stuck feeding and watering the animals while my brothers ran the tractors and threw the hay bales Dragging the waterhose to each and every animals water pan was a pain and sometimes Id catch my younger brother sneaking at the other end of the pasture watering some of the animals I hadnt gotten to yet and it would always make me smile to myself Sometime in the summer our ducks started dying off Id find them smooshed and assumed it was an incident from them trying to breed one another and split some of them up in different pens and thought nothing more of it   Then three days later I found a calf with its body oddly angled and no sure sign of what caused it to die Nothing else happened for about a month or two Then I found the horse laid out freshly dead with sweat beaded all over it as if it had been running all night it was a young and healthy horse one of my favorite and my heart shattered to pieces I was reluctant to go back the next day forcing myself to look at my sweet animals and focus on them instead but they were acting oddly the pigs in particular who were hiding in their makeshift huts and houses not even coming when I did my usual call or dumped out the food I got worried and walked in the pen getting on hands and knees to look inside their little houses as soon as I saw their snouts with a squeal one of them ran into me biting at my arm and face I toppled backward kicking it away and dashed over the top of the pen hurt feelings because they were almost always happy to see me I didnt tell anyone just let it go assuming that at losing so many of my precious pets I was wigging myself out   The next time I went out at this point it was around winter because of the cold I asked my mom to help me with the animals As we were dragging the hose to the dairy cows she stops suddenly and asks whos that I look over seeing the usual figure of my brother and just say oh its just Derek Momma She shakes her head No Dereks at Pauls A weird feeling crawled down my spine as I glanced over my shoulder at the young male figure Dropping the waterhose I stepped in his direction I could clearly see his dirtsmeared jeans and the back of his hair had the same blond curl of my brothers Derek I yelled running over to him and reaching a hand out to put on his shoulder He turned his head in my direction his bright red eyes meeting mine as my hand fell through air I passed out then My mom says that by the time she reached me the figure was gone After later discussion my brother swore on his life that he had never once been in the pasture with me ,On the Farm,77,nosleep,top_week
MissMonstrosity,25,31,1r5z11,55,Hello everyone I told this story to a friend who told me I should post it here in Nosleep Im sorry for any grammatical errors or bad commentary Im not much of a writerAbout four years ago I was a troubled thirteen year old who like most teenagers didnt get along with my parentsIt was just me and my little Brother our Mother who spent more time on the computer then being a real Mother and our Step Father who in most cases acted more like a frat boy roommate then a parental figureAnyway this all started one day when my and my Mother got into an argument only god knows what it was about since we argued all the time  back then All I remember is that I stormed off taking a backpack of clothes and some food with me and ran into the woodsWe live on a huge property in the country and the woods go on for miles and miles in every direction with only a small creek running through it to break up the never ending amount of treesAlot of people might be freaked out by the ominous looking place but I loved it I went exploring out there everyday and I knew those woods like the back of my handI ran to the south west down a large hill that had the creek I mentioned earlier at the bottom of it the creek itself went on even farther than the woods cutting through several private properties and stopped just outside of a town over fourteen miles awayI decided Id follow to town where Id find somewhere to stay the nightWhy not just take the road to town well we lived in the country there were alot of crazy people out here drunks hillbillies prostitutes and a combination of all three I figured if I took the road Id only be asking to get raped or robbedIll fast forward a little about  hours later I finally came to the edge of our propertyThe property after ours belonged to an old man we met him in church a couple times Despite several threatening No Trespassing signs  I wasnt worried If he did so happen to come all the way out here and somehow find me I could just claim to be lost  I was sure he wouldnt be this far out in the woods anyway Here the woods thinned out a little and there were several small fields tucked between the trees I came here before but never went any further then the edge of the fieldsAt this point   the sun was only an hour or so away from setting and I started walking faster to hopefully get to town before nightfall I ran through the creek that separated me from the field and slipped on something causing me to fallIt hurt like hell later I found out I had broken my toe It was bleeding badly and I had to limp the rest of the way through the creek and fieldsI came to the end of the fields several minutes later where a small path either for ATVs or a tractor led through the woodsI never went this far before but I knew if I kept going straight Id get to the town within only an hour or so so I went onAfter what felt like forever of following a twisting path that seemed to go nowhere It finally came to a small circular clearing There was a fence surrounding it with a large sign once again threatening anyone who crossed I thought it was strange we were hours from any house why bother putting up a fence blocking off where no one would ever be likely to go Then again I was going through so maybe it wasnt all that uncommon I crawled under the fence foot still hurting like hell and went on through the clearing I knew I wouldnt be caught theres no way there would be anyone out hereI walked or more less limped through the clearing on the other side there was another small field and just my luck there was a old tree stand in one of the trees surrounding it We have a large hunting community and hunters often hide out in the tree stands that were often camouflaged in the treesI thought it would make a great place to stay the night since the town was still a long ways away and it was already starting to get darkI went up to it and poked my head inside it was perfect Just enough space to lay down and sleep if need be I climbed back out and headed back to the clearing There was a large hill to one side of it I figured if I climbed up it I could see just how far away the town was Ignoring my aching foot I limped over to the hill and right in that moment something hit me on the back of the head It felt like someone angrily poking me or throwing a small  pebbleI turned around quickly expecting to find an angry farmer or hunter no one was there it was probably just an acorn or nut falling from one of the surrounding treesI laughed at myself for being stupid and rubbed at my now aching headFor whatever reason I decided to not try to force my way up the large hill and instead went to the opposite side of the round clearing I dont know why it just felt like something was pulling me thereAbout half way across the clearing I stopped dead in my tracks and gasped I literally uttered  the words Oh my God Before quickly shutting my mouth in fear someone might have heard meThere before me were several grave stones All ranging in height and design The ground in front of some of them was lower than the rest of the ground almost as if the coffins underneath had caved inI stumbled over to the graveyard and bent down to try to read the headstonesMost were unreadable Only one of them had enough words I could make out it looked like two headstones fused togetherThe one on the left read GA Keaton date unreadableThe one on the right said Harriet Keaton   at the bottom just visible was Our angels together in heavenAt this point I turned and ranI blacked out for most of the time I was running I ran through the clearing ran along the path ran across the fields until I was finally back on our property I only slowed down because it was pitch black outside and stupid me forgot to bring a flashlight It was so dark I could hardly see in front of meOnce again Ill fast forward I finally got home after my step father had found me apparently he went out looking for me not to ensure I was safe and guide me home no Only because he wanted to drag me home to make me apologize to my motherI didnt care I happily followed him homeAfter finally getting there I found my brother looking like he was crying and my mom sitting at the table eating dinner looking like she didnt have a care in the world She glanced at me made a face And left the roomOver time I ended up telling her about the graveyard she found it interesting and soon enough all my family knew about the weird graveyard in the woods It became quite a conversation topic in our family before over time being forgottenOne thing I never told anyone though And the reason I went running out of that place like a baby Was because shortly after finding that cemetery I started to hear whispering and among the trees behind the graveyard I couldve sworn I saw something moving Then right after reading what was on the one tombstone what felt like a long boney fingerStarted tapping on the back of my head,A Cemetery in the Woods,86,nosleep,top_week
iwillneverbefree,8,17,1r1p8k,51,Im just your average everyday guy with a job I cook I clean I drink hell I even had a girlfriend before all this started going down If you saw me on the street youd walk right by me without a second glance Its just that I have a job Im a ParamedicI dont do anything important I just help those in need I started doing this because I didnt feel great about myself I always loved helping others and I always loved AampP so I saw this as a logical step I loved every second of it when I first started There was no greater high than when your adrenaline kicked in and your hands moved faster than your mind could think It was ecstasy This went on for  years Every day I fell more and more in love with my job My calling The only thing that bothered me was that overwhelming sense of being in a battle I thought it was normal afterall I was fighting for someone elses life I thought If only I knew how true that statement wasIt started off with a shadow when I walked onto a scene I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me Maybe it was my constant concern of someone attacking me God forbid I got shot while working I should have known something wasnt right when my partner looked in the same direction when I did I should have known better when he just shut down and barely spoke the rest of the night This went on for a while every so often seeing the shadow Things started to get worse however when the whispering startedAt first they were nonsensical Sometimes I wondered if they were even there at all if I was just going fucking nuts But they were They WERE there It only took me losing my first patient to hear them clear as day They were congratulating me They were telling me how great of a job I did I didnt understand then My mind had been turning on me it had to have been Its the stress Its the stress of losing someone I told myself on my way home I sat at home and hit the bottle Hoping that my next shift would be an easy one one quiet shiftIt wasnt quiet I should have known better than to use that word Its bad luck The voices didnt go away They only got louder Every patient I had I could hear them Its their time Shes ours now Let her rest I thought I was just compensating for losing someone I thought I was just preparing myself if I lost another one The more people I lost the more they got more sinister Youre almost ready I havent seen one this talented in eons You cant change fate Come join us I didnt understand right then but I understood it all soonIt was a  year old male His heart stopped I had to save this one he was just a child I HAD to save him We got him to the back of the ambulance and I started my work Things felt odd I felt as if I was in a daze My vision was blurry the lights seemed faint against the road I tried not to think about the voices I tried to block them out I did a damn good job until it screamed my nameJOHN I heard I stopped and slowly raised my head to look at the bench seat across from me It wasnt what you would expect death to be It wasnt a man in a robe with a scythe It was just a man in a suit with black eyes I froze I had to have been insane I needed to tell my partner to drop my off in the psych ward when we got to the hospital His smile was calming It was the kind of smile youd expect a great car salesman to have calming but also sinister His hair was well kept for a man his age Id have to say s or s His eyes like a void of everything that makes us human as if they were a black hole that sucked all feeling out of whatever had the poor misfortune of getting caught in their pathHavent you been listening John He said with a caring toneYou know what you must do You know who youll become Why are you fightingI started screaming at him Who are you What do you want Why have you been following meHe ignored all of my questions He simply put his hand to the child and started rubbing his headYou fought for so long John You know this is your fate How much more pain can you endureWhat are you talking about I yelled at him as the childs rhythm became worse and worseDont you understand John weve been with you since day one We are who you fight every day We are the ones who you ignore to do your job We are youI began to understandJohn you must know something He said looking at the monitor as it flatlined This will also be your fate You will die just like everyone else Theres nothing you can do about itDont you think I fucking know that I yelled grabbing the epinephrine out of my bagJOHN He yelled again knocking the epinephrine out of my handYou need to understand the forces that be When you die John you will become one of usThe fuck I will I said standing up but was forced back down by some unknown forceIts not something you can change John You have so much potential so much promise Weve been watching you from the day you were born and we are very very excited to meet youI stopped fighting I looked into his eyes and I felt something Something I wish I never would have felt I felt at peace It was if all the stress of saving a life was gone It was as if I didnt have to fight anymore It felt like I was being held by my mother again like all was right with the worldI sat there and placed my hand on the child I felt death pass through me I felt the coldness of the nothing reach my heart and sit there I understood now I understood why I am who I am It was as if everything made sense to meYou dont have to believe me Hell if I was you I wouldnt either All that I ask of you is that the next time you see an ambulance look closely for the man in the suit with black holes for eyes Maybe Ill see you too,I work with death,68,nosleep,top_week
iampatheo,11,15,1rcqug,45,  This is my first Reddit post so please excuse my mistakes I live with my parents and my grandfather who is my fathers uncle actually so basically not my grandfather      I am going to jump straight into the problem here because there is something definitely weird going on in our house There have been this series of events which have occurred throughout my childhood which I have always put them at the back of my mind maybe because as a child I didnt look into it enough but I never forgot But with the most recent event I cant help but ask you guys for advice     The first event occurred when I was around  I guess I was probably getting ready for school or something and the only people in the house that morning was my mom and my grandfather Mom was helping me put my tie on  we had a school uniform  and I remember glancing towards the living room which is visible from my room I saw my grandfather walk into the living room after which he proceeded to go towards the balcony and out of my sight I got out my room and I was walking towards the kitchen to get some water Now the kitchen is right next to my grandfathers room and its on the other side of our house As I reached his room I saw him sitting there reading the paper I got a bit surprised because I clearly remembered seeing him in the living room just a few seconds ago and there is no way he could have gotten back here before me or without bumping into me I asked him about it and he said he had no clue what I was talking about So I just put it at the back of my mindThe next incident happened a year back or so It was after  pm and I was locked up in my room listening to really loud music through my earphones while doing some reading I like doing that getting a whole background score feel for the things happening in the book After a while I heard my parents banging the door and shouting at me and I figured they must have been knocking for some time When I opened the door I saw them both standing there with concerned looks on their faces I asked them what happened and they said that apparently they could hear me crying out  for help from my room in a really panicky way and they thought had probably slipped and had broken a bone or something I obviously had no clue what they were talking about and they swore that the voice they heard was mine and no one elses It freaked me out a little But even then I didnt put it together with the incident from all those years back     And now something has happened again last night and this time I am pretty freaked out I was having my dinner in my room as I was watching a movie on my laptop As I finished I got out of my room and headed for the kitchen On the way I noticed my mom dad and grandfather in the living room watching TV As I walked past my grandfathers room I saw him Sitting on a chair by the window The room was dimly lit but it was enough to see everything I did a double take I looked towards the living room and he was still there with my parents  I looked back and he was still there sitting in his chair by the window He was looking at me but for some reason I couldnt see his eyes Not because they werent there or anything but it was as if I was feeling this weird force which was trying to make me look away from there I also got this head rush which you get when you stand up too fast As soon as I recovered from that and my head cleared he was gone from his chair My parents and grandfather were still sitting there in the living room chatting amongst themselves as they watched the TV I told them what happened but they obviously did not believe me and thought I was making it upI really need to know what this is Is this a doppelganger And if so what should I do Is this thing going to be harmful It hasnt done anything harmful so far ,DOPPELGANGER Problem,60,nosleep,top_week
WontThinkStraight,12,11,1rcy69,49,I just had a long overdue catch up with Brad and to check on how Emilys family were doing since their tragedyhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentspclnotes In some welcome news they are now expecting a new child to join their familyBrad had another story for me though one that has kept me awake  the past couple of nights Ive captured it below to help get it off my mindIn a universe filled with choices but with only one life in which to make them regrets become inevitable Regrets for things done or left undone for words said or left unsaidAt that moment when our life is fading and we see it all over again how would we feel about those decisions weve made  Would we be proud of those moments that defined us Those moments alone when we think no one else is watching How we treated those we loved and those close to usBrad was not the only child in his family He also had a younger brother Paul They could not have been more opposites to each otherWhere Brad was brash and wild in his youth Paul was introverted and contemplative And like many siblings their childhood was one of constant warfare with each other Looking back Brad admits that he was an arrogant possessive and obnoxious brat Any of those traits alone would already have given him an excuse to hate on his little brotherBut it was really the fear of the Burnt Man that really started it all As an only child Brad enjoyed the attention and adulation that brought him That changed when his brother Paul was born three years laterAt first Brad had loved the idea of a brother to play with He imagined they would play together and be best friends That idea disappeared when he discovered Paul was a useless baby that only cried smelled bad and demanded constant attention The second year wasnt much better with Paul starting to get a larger share of Brads toys and presentsIt became really bad in the third year when Brad had to give up half his room and share it with Paul He found they had nothing in commonWhere Brad liked being loud and attention seeking with others Paul just babbled and talked with himself Brad loved being outside and active Paul preferred to stay indoors and draw with his crayon setWhat unsettled Brad though was what Paul would draw There would be the usual things every child draws  houses animals trees and family What was unusual was every drawing of their family always had an extra personTheir parents would be there and Brad and Paul all drawn in rainbow hues Right next to Paul would be a mysterious figure drawn in black and redThe family faces all had big smiles but the stranger was a disfigured mess two big black circles for eyes and a shapeless mass for the mouth In every drawing of the stranger he was missing an arm and had red streaks running through all overOver time this stranger began to feature more and more prominently in the drawings Brad and his parents would no longer appear in them  just Paul playing with the stranger inside the house or outside in the yardAt first their parents thought it was just a phase but eventually became concerned enough to ask Paul who that was He told them it was his friend the burned man He had always been there for as long as Paul could remember He never said anything  he just stood there watching and listeningThey concluded it was just an imaginary friend Granted it was a bit more unsettling than having a dinosaur or elf for a friend but at least Paul wasnt drawing some reallife predatorOne night when Brad was  and Paul was  they stayed awake after their parents had tucked them in Brad wanted to know more about the Burnt ManPaul said that he had been in an accident a fire that had burnt his entire body and face It had melted his eyes away and made his arm go missing He was very sadPaul didnt find the Burnt Man scary though He had always been around and never did anything Just watched and listenedBrad told him he was stupid for having an imaginary friendPaul yawned and simply replied that he wasnt imaginary He was in the room with them right now In fact he was standing right next to Brad watching and listening as he did every nightBrad felt a chill go up his spine He had always been a brave child but for the first time in his life he felt fear He looked around in the darkness not sure if the shadows were his imagination or the Burnt Man waiting for him to go to sleepBrad didnt go to sleep that night and concluded that he needed a room of his ownHe could no longer share a room with his annoying brother and his creepy friend But he couldnt admit that he was afraid either so his  year old mind came up with an ideaHis plan was simple  to make it so painful for their parents to keep them together they would be forced to keep them in separate rooms So began their adversarial relationshipThey fought over everything for many years and often physically Each prank they played each other escalated into new rounds of retaliation all to the chagrin of their parents It would take six more years until they moved to a bigger house and they were able to have separate rooms at last before the feuds started to die down the Burnt Man had been all but forgotten by this time replaced with pure animosity for each other But on the first night in their new home Brad remembered waking in the middle of the night and seeing a figure sitting on his bed watching him It stared at him through hollow eye sockets and moaned at him through an open jaw It reached for him with a horribly burnt hand the other hung uselessly by its side with the lower half missingBrad screamed so loud it woke the house and the figure had disappeared by the time he blinked When Paul came into the room to check what all the commotion was about Brad told him he saw the Burnt ManPaul laughed and said he hadnt seen him in years In fact he could hardly even remember him In any case he couldnt see him in the room now Paul closed the door as he left then reopened it quickly and shouting Boo before laughing again and walking back to his roomFor Brad the memory of it seemed very real though It wasnt just the terror but the overwhelming sense of sadness he felt from the encounterAnother incident was when Paul was  and involved in a hitandrun accident He was rushed to hospital in a critical condition and the doctors werent sure if he would survive Paul was lying in bed with a coma with his parents crying around himBrad could could see a figure through the corner of his eye standing by the walls It was the Burnt Man watching Paul intentlyJust go already Why are you still here Youre not wanted Just leave us Brad remembered shouting at the figure He got a severe reprimanding from his parents thinking that he was shouting at his brotherPaul is dying Brad Its time to put your stupid feud behind Were family for gods sake Act like it his father had rebuked while his mother criedThe words stung Brad especially since he couldnt explain that he wasnt shouting at Paul He quietly fumed then stormed outPaul did recover two days later though and was out of the hospital a week laterThat last incident was  years ago The Burnt Man was never seen again by either of them since Brad had become a serious and buttoned down computer analyst since then Paul married had two children of his own and had saved countless lives through his job as an EMT They had developed a grudging respect for each other though their lives had drifted off in different directions over the yearsThe Burnt Man was just another long forgotten childhood memory filed away and never thought of again until recently Only a recent tragedy brought it all back into sharp focusA few months ago Brad learnt that his brother had died while on duty He was on scene with other emergency services dealing with a factory fireA chemical storage tank had unexpectedly exploded near his location dousing him in burning chemicals The flying shrapnel had sheared off his left arm at the elbowPaul was In a life of many regrets Brad now has one more for the list He never did let Paul know how proud he was of him and that despite their differences he loved him as a brotherHe regrets that his last words to Paul werent goodbye but a text message which read You suck Ive shat better excuses than that It was said in jest about why Paul didnt have time over the weekend for a beer but it was devastating knowing it would be the last memory both had of each otherSo every now and then Brad talks to the silence in the room hoping that his brother the Burnt Man is still around to hear Now much older and wiser he no longer fears the Burnt Man  but fears that the only one listening might just be himselfOne that can only observe in silence powerless to stop whatever fate awaits him judging him with regret for the decisions hes made and is yet to makeLinks back to the earlier stories in order A Curious Mind is a Terrible

DickBanditDoneLanded,11,67,1r1zac,42,As a kid I grew up singing songs of joy with my friends Fun songs that made me feel like a child There was one song that I never really liked for reasons unbeknownst to me but that one song would become a living hell during my adult lifeMy wife packed my sons lunchbox with a pizza lunchables It was always his favorite one I had the privilege of walking him to school that cold October morning holding his hand the whole walk We talked about toys games and then the topic of songs came upHey dadhow come you never showed me the song about Josh Jacob Jinglehyper Smith he asked Haha you mean John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt I never liked that song kiddo I replied I thought his name was Josh like mine He added We got to the school about half an hour earlier than the entry time so I suggested we go to the playground located around back Josh agreed and followed me The air felt relatively dense that day I could barely see fifty feet away and asked Josh to stay in sight and have a little fun before school starts I look away at the birds in the trees and Im startled by the piercing cry of my son nowhere in sight I call his name and he says Sorry dad I fell off the monkey bars Ill be fine I sighed and laughed a little knowing my kid was such a warrior I notice Josh riding a swing and laughing with another little boy who also came to school too early I see his father standing on the side laughing and I worry about not being a good enough dad to Josh I start to walk toward the boys and thats when it hits me I wasnt watching Josh play none of the two boys was mine I tried to keep calm but felt the need to yell out his name to locate him I look around the playground and the school bell rings announcing the schools opening The dense foggy air dissipates and Im able to see everything clearly I find a note in the second floor of the jungle gym it reads I know how hard you tried to avoid me I wouldnt want the same thing happening with JoshMy heart sank and my eyes widened as the note dropped on the mulch and made a thud I felt every possible emotion at that one point in time I didnt know what to do where to go who to ask for help so I walked into the school where I come across a corkboard with pictures of kids on it All of these children were abducted by a strange man who walked into the forest beside the school I knew what I had to do I ran into the woods clenching the note he had written John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt I hear a high pitched voice scream from the bushes as I fall to the ground in fear I noticed a building on a hill about a mile into the wild It was a greenish wooden house much like the ones mystery inc would investigate but this was not a game this was my sons life and possibly that of many other children The smell of rotting was emitting throughout the air and I feared the worst for the status of the kids Not willing to be detected I snuck in through a window that was left open and creeped about the dark house with nothing but my signalless cellphone and my dedication I was in the basement floor and couldnt see anything so I turned on my flashlight app I had no idea I was about to come across one of the most horrible sights anyone couldve seen There were mutilated corpses not just any corpses but children kids who I had met through class pictures my wife bought and showed me The kids were decapitated burned sliced naked I was scared for my life I almost threw up one too many times but swallowed it back along with my will to flee I found a wooden staircase that was old and rotting The first step I took on it made a loud creak and there was a groan in the distance I hid behind a giant flowerpot as a huge figure approached the area I was in I could barely breathe as I noticed this man had blood between his fingernails as if he mutilated the children with nothing but his fingers He returned to the room and I followed him from afar The smell I picked up earlier was much stronger than before and I heard muffled cries coming from the room the man walked into Say it with me now kidsJohn Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt His name is my name too Whenever we go out The people always shout There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schm A kid bit a hole through the duct tape on his mouth and was able to scream while he sang I heard the kids name It was GaryThe children were all able to remove their mouth bindings and cried in unison for about ten seconds Then I hear a loud laugh followed by a SHUT THE FUCK UP At this point I was enraged Nobody has the right to scream at kids like that nobody I barged in grabbing this freak by his backlength hair and slamming his face into a table with limbs on it What did you just say to those kids you motherfucker I yelled oblivious to the children in the room Youre gonna pay for all your shit you son of a bitch I said Well thats just too damn bad He added I didnt know today was the day Id be found Its such a shame youve missed your playdate with your sonhe was SUCH a nice boy He said laughing his head off at the sight of my expression I was cold I was numb My son was dead I unleashed my fury on the man not holding back at all I knocked him unconscious and tied him down to a giant piece of metal I broke both his legs and made sure hed never walk again then I released the children many starving and ready to go home I tugged the slab down the hill and walked alongside the children toward the school The police had previously raided the woods but never came across the house in the entire year he had been performing the kidnappings I called the school and notified the authorities of the serial killer I had slayed and I wanted to make sure he was arrested and would suffer his whole life for what he did to my wife and I She was hysterical unable to perform for almost a whole year We cancelled any holidays and vacations and mourned a year away We finally concluded that our son was happy in a better place with the rest of his friends Although my wife and I never had any other children I became teacher at an elementary school in another state and was happy knowing I had kids who were fun to be around and nice to me One Monday morning we have a new girl come in and I ask her to introduce herself Shes laughing and shes shy and she wants to whisper something in my ear Ill introduce myself if we can just play today She says I promise her along with the class that well have a free day and she introduces herself and makes friends I start to like this girl because I never had a chance to have a daughter and always wanted one She was very sociable and was the class clownShe stopped coming to school for a week and out of curiosity I called her parents to ask about her sudden disappearance Her mother was crying and I couldnt understand her so her father came to the phone I told him about how the class missed her and he told me about a note that was left at their door one afternoon It read Go through her drawings I asked the dad to give me a minute while I did just that HE was in the pictures Every drawing she made had him hiding in the background There was a folded piece of paper that was thicker than the rest Little did I know it wasnt school paper it was skin Pressed and cut to replicate a note I thought by now youd figure out I was never human I got on the phone to tell the girls father the news but all I heard was a demonic maniacal laughter I felt a hole in my chest as the phone line went dead followed by three beeps and elongated static,His name is my name

Brodiche,28,16,1ra24j,35,The Eighth CrusadeOn the outskirts of the large city known as Canto a small cathedral stands unscathed by the horror happening not twenty miles away There were some smaller towns outside of the city but most of their residents fled as soon as the vague news reports of cannibalistic citizens came flooding in In the end those who were smart enough to run at the first sign of trouble were the only ones who made it the hesitant died along with the rest of the city However this small cathedral was different It was located in the middle of nowhere and had been long abandoned and forgotten by everyone aside from the city itself the closest town to it was almost an hour way and a small dirt road was the only thing that even hinted that there was another world past the miles and miles of flat plains The glow and black smoke from Canto can be seen in the distance  Short flashes of lightning filled the air just long enough to illuminate a figure on top of the cathedral his legs swung over the edge of the roof and head leaning against the lighting rod The faint glow of a cigar intensified as he put it to his mouth With a small grin played on his lips he gazed dreamily at the cityWhat a sight Obliteration has never looked so divine He whispered to himself Images of a crumbling Jerusalem played through his head Well I guess you cant get much more divine than thatFeeling a little foolish for talking to himself again he took one last drag of his cigar and flicked it behind him The man noticed that there was a thin layer of ash that had settled on to his body Slightly irritated by this the man glanced at his watch while getting to his feet ruffling his short black hair in an attempt to get as much ash off his head as possible His long black coat blew in the wind as he brushed it off The temperature was dropping fast it wouldnt be long until the rain began to pour The man wondered if it would be enough to quench the flames of the city The Vatican ordered complete destruction they wanted nothing standing of what they thought to be a heathen city The man wouldnt feel accomplished if the flames were so easily disposed of Glancing at his watch again figuring he had roughly another half hour before the he was picked up and debriefed He leaned back against the lightning rod and lit another cigar daydreaming of the day beforeOne bite one citizen and his work was done His mission was to just get the ball rolling nothing more Being as potent as he was his victims often became immensely strong They were puppets sure but also unstable The more of them that were roaming the streets the more dangerous the mop up was for the church The man was frustrated that he only got one snack he was tired of the left overs from corpses and the donations from Italian blood banks He was craving prey with more life to it one he could enjoy stalking before the killThe Vatican dispatched him and a helicopter to the abandoned cathedral Along with being the drop point the house of God was also were he was supposed to rendezvous with the evac crew His orders were to simply enter the city light the spark and watch God cleanse the Earth from the cathedral You zealots are no fun he would tell them Im doing Gods work for you lazy ass holes the least you could do is let me off the leashThe hungry man could not help but feel disappointed when they were offended They preached how the last crusade was such a failure due to the fact he had so much freedom the mobs of the powerful undead nearly completely consumed the Holy armyIt pissed him off that they never got over thatHe resolved that it was never really his fault humans were frail weak creatures They are easy to corrupt in every way None of them could handle the thirst and they tore everything apart Turning their victims into for lack of a better word zombies The Pope himself preformed the unnecessary but ritualistic blessing before he set offVai quarto Locke e fornire i nostri nemici a DioDeliver them I shall He sarcastically whispered to himself with a smirk The helicopter was taking off it was time to go to workLocke could not stop thinking about his one victim regardless of whom it was he planned to savor every last second of his feastThe man found himself seeking a challenge In the back of his mind he knew he wouldnt get one but the fantasy of a dangerous prey kept his thoughts occupied as he made his way towards the glistening city With the pace he was traveling at it wouldnt be long before reached the edge of Canto his long strides covered more distance faster than a highend sports car going ninety on an open freeway The cool night air was refreshing to him its not often he is allowed to roam out in the open like this He slowed down a bit to prolong this finite feeling of freedomBeing cooped up under Vatican City for so long had begun to take its toll on Lockes sanity Other than living off nothing but the scraps of Roma he had no real connection to the outside world Its not like he longed to live amongst the humans no the thought of that made him sick The only reason he could stand the Men of God back at the Vatican was because they were as far away from human as possible Hes seen them put on human masks sure seen them absolve the masses with a crooked smile seen them preach peace and the word of God to a thousand ignorant faces No no behind their masks they are every bit a monster as LockeThe city was drawing closer massive sky scrapers were lit up in a brilliant fashion A sense of intrigue radiated from surrounding smaller clusters of lights What were the humans doing at this hour Were they working overtime tucking the children in late night binge drinking at the local bar They were all so very ignorant of the malevolent fury of God that was about to rain down upon them Sure it looked pretty from a distance but Canto was the antithesis when viewed up close The Vatican made it clear to Locke that this was not a city that deserves pity even though he never considered giving it anyways he asked to be briefed on the citys situationCanto was dying almost all whove entered abandoned all hope for it when they saw what a hell hole it has become Corruption plagued the citys central government all of the representatives power focused on how to make the wealthy more capable of shitting on the poor As a result crime was abundant Drug trafficking prostitution child labor plagued the down town streets Whole families were often caught in cases of indentured servitude as the wealthy put it where even the children would have to be at the beckon call of the privileged doing strenuous and dangerous work that led to more than a few deceased children Anyone who cried foul ended up dead too it was just the way it went And it was reason enough to cleanse itLocke reached the edge of Canto he could now hear the grumbling sounds of the suffering city a siren blared unceasingly somewhere among the throngs of buildings Looking at his watch the man whispered to himselfTime to light the matchUpon entering the city Locke found to his disappointment that there was no shortage of easy prey The homeless aimlessly wandered the streets practically half dead already prostitutes looking vulnerable as ever He was slightly surprised however to find a couple of security guards having a smoke outside of a large ominously lit building A young woman dressed in rags stumbled past them she was appeared very exhausted and in need of medical care The guards just looked upon her and laughed asking the woman unrepeatable questions When she didnt respond to their cat calls one of the men grew frustrated and ran after her She let out a quick yelp of pain as he put his cigarette out on the back of her neckIn a very swift motion the girl whirled around grabbing the guards wrist and pulling him close The mans face was within an inch of hers his expression showed that of pure pain She had broken his wrist In a split second she revealed a small revolver put it to the mans chin and pulled the triggerThere was a bright flash then a spray of crimson red The mans body crumpled to the newly painted sidewalk with a softball sized hole where his skull used to be The woman was already on the other guard before he was done unhooking the strap to his sidearm Landing knees first on the guards chest she pinned him to the ground Grabbing a firm hold of her preys head with both hands she lifted up his skull and brought it back down to the concrete Over and over again she did this until the guard was pulverized into the sidewalkIt was all over that quickly She stood up without a sound her face expressionless except for a small smirk that crept on the edge of her lips she bent over to pick up her revolver that lie next to body of the first guard She shot Locke a quick glance and disappeared around the corner While the look she gave him was quick it was more than enough to excite him She had piercing brown eyes that screamed strength and short dirty black hair that was almost just long enough to veil her left eye Locke knew her just by that single short glance He knew her struggles knew her strength and knew her will to surviveHe knew he had found his preyThe building the two guards were once protecting let out the piercing wale of an emergency siren snapping Locke out of his mystified state It was then he noticed the streets were completely empty not a piece of human filth to be seen Whoever the guards were protecting called for backup and he had mere minutes to escape A thought crossed his mind and made him almost consider revealing himself to the approaching authorities before pounding them into dust Not wanting to risk compromising the mission Locke reluctantly retreated into a dark alley way He scaled his way to the roof tops from there and began the hunt for his new found prey The mystery womans scent was still live and growing stronger as he strides across the apartment building rooftops Lockes mind wandered back to the two guards how efficiently and violently she dispatched them Two full grown armed men could not handle the slender girl half their size Where can a human learn to kill like that Without mercy or emotion just pure unadulterated instinct After searching for a short time he came across her entering a dimly lit liquor store only to return moments later with a bag clenched in her fist The hunger was starting to get to him it was a ravenous gnawing that made his whole body tremble with anticipation He knelt down on one knee and gazed down at her from the roof tops Across the street from where Locke sat perched he saw her lean against a brick wall and begin chugging whatever was in the paper bag Locke felt his heart sink he had to stop her quickly or that alcohol will kill all the fun What was the fun in feeding from intoxicated prey He let out a small sigh and leapt off the building and descended to the street below The woman let out a small yelp as Locke landed safely in front of her A small cloud of dust and filth from the city escaped from under his feet leaving a small clear circle around where he landedFor a moment she just stared at him as he rose to his feet Only a dim street light illuminated the empty street the only thing she could make of the man was a pair of piercing red eyes that glowed like the moonThere is something magnificent about the moment you make yourself known to your prey spoke the man His voice had a crisp raspy tone to it full of anticipation and a hint of sensualityThe womans eyes widened at this not out of fear however it was more like she just received a jolt of electricity the grip on her bottle tightened She put on a smirk and spoke with an authoritative tone  Listen Ive had a long day I already have had to deal with two assholes today she lifted her hands almost defensively to reveal that they were caked with dried blood I caved both their heads in before they learned their place maybe I should take my time with you so I can really make a statement around hereThe man cocked his head a bit to the side at this threat amused and intrigued by her intensity He opened his arms wide as if to bow and took a step forward The woman reacted quickly and swung the bag at Lockes head The sharp crash of the class mixed with the sound of cracking bone traveled all the way down the street The woman expected the perfect stranger to be on the ground bleeding begging for his life like she has seen so many other men do However the man was still standing Aside from a small shard of glass that was lodged in the left side of his face he was completely unfazed by the vicious attack Locke licked his lips as the remaining alcohol from the bottle trickled down his faceHmm Im not much of a whisky man I prefer a more  he paused for a moment as he watched the panic in his prey begin to rise  exotic spirit He began to chuckle to himself in all reality the whole situation was darkly humorous to him This is the most pain hes been in in years and that is saying something His chuckle escalated to a howling laughterThe woman wore a look that held a combination of shock and excitement Even though she was beginning to panic a smile spread across her face Not once in her entire time in Canto has she met a man who could last more than  minutes in fight with her much less one who could so easily brush off a whisky bottle to the headShe watched as the mans laughter grew his bloodshot eyes screamed madnessIts time to put you down you crazy sonofabitch she said with a smile She slowly removed the revolver she used to kill the security guard the aged blood glistened in what little light was available The sight of the gun just seemed to incite a stronger laughing fit out of Locke The woman extended her arm and placed the barrel of the gun into the mans open mouth and pulled the triggerAgain there was a quick flash His head snapped back with full force but he remained on his feet never ceasing his laughter that grew into the howling of a demon He lowered his head fixing his blood red eyes on the womanHe was able to stop his laughter long enough to respond to the horrified look on his preys face Whats the matter baby doll You seemed surprised you cant dispatch me as easily as those two security guards Locke began to laugh again Honey they are nothing compared to a true monster     Locke took one last look at his victim then opened his jaws to reveal several sharp teeth The hole left by the bullet can be clearly seen as he made the final move on his prey                           The man wiped his mouth and looked down at his meal The womans eyes were glossed with fear but there was an eerie smile that still crept on her lips as she stared blankly into the night sky Locke allowed the womans essence to dissolve and flow throughout his body Fresh blood from a living victim holds a piece of that persons life and personality Anyone who takes that essence inherits a part of that persons life All their thoughts feelings information becomes a part of the predators body and soul Veronica He whisperedThe womans body began to violently shake She was beginning to reanimate Locke felt a slight pang of worry in the back of his mind A human of her caliber would be a serious threat as a vampire everything about her will be augmented and enhanced Locke looked back at the shaking body Give those zealots hell for me VeronicaTurning around he began to make his way to the edge of the city the sun was going to be rising soon it was in his best interest to get back to the Cathedral as fast as he can He had lit the match Canto will be devoured by flames by tomorrow night Locke finally said with a smile                                The enveloping darkness cascaded across the night sky Leaving the silhouettes of clouds drift overhead like veils of moving sentinels suffocating the very light out of the stars The scent of moisture and smoke hung thick in the air The sound of distant thunder boomed across the sky echoing into the midnight horizon A light from below slightly illuminated the world trails of thick black smoke were dressed in the light painted on by miles of inferno It was as if the gates of hell opened under the earth releasing and delivering throngs of angels utmost nightmares unto Gods domain The pounding hearts of a million terrified saints could be heard as the sky boomed again Below the heavens true evil incarnate devoured the world Sky scrapers wore flames from head to toe fire danced on the water under decimated bridges streets were in chaos destroyed vehicles littered the crowed avenues Exposed hands and limbs peek out from under of overturned cars burning corpses are

youngsterjose,3,10,1rd8lb,37,My mother once told me a story her sister had an encounter with the paranormal that eventually lead to her suicide this is that storyMy mother had a sister once I remember my earliest memories of her she was always so depressed and I always asked why was she sad She never had an answer My mother told me it all started one night when she came home from work She was walking the streets around midnight heading home when she noticed a man walking behind her It wasnt the first time she had been followed by this man Only difference was this time he tried to talk to my aunt He asked are you happy with your family arent you tired of living in a house of religious fools She was scared and asked who are you and my mother told me as soon as he stepped out of the shadows my aunt saw his face he looked rather normal except for his long hair and ember red eyes He smiled and said your people call me the devil and she started to run She ran as fast as she could Eventually my aunt got the house of my mother and she explained what happened My mother tried to calm her down my aunt was breathing heavily and could not control herself Soon enough she passed outA few days pass by and my mother sees that my aunt has a serious problem She didnt go to work for about a week and she felt as if she was not safe at my mothers house So she moved back to my grandmothers house They were extremely religious and for some reason my aunt felt safe at her house The same night she moved back in to her mothers house something happened that drove her into being institutionalized It was around  in the morning and my grandfather and grandmother were fighting My aunt knew she was awake because she could see her mother she was in the kitchen and she was looking through the crack in the door she suddenly felt something brush up against her arm Her breath taken away her eyes wide open she turns around and sees the man claiming to be the devil He says tell me whats wrong I know I know somethings wrong let me take you away from all your troubles she screamed as loud as she could until her mother and father came into the room they turned on the lights and she kept staring at the empty space next to her bed My grandmother started yelling at her are you crazy do you have any idea how late it is why are you screaming she kept going and going until my aunt finally screamed the devil hes after me mom my grandmother was religious still is but for some reason she did not believe my aunt and they put her away in a hospital for about a month or twoWhile in the hospital my aunt told my mother what she saw in there They had to put her on several medications before she stopped seeing the man Every now and then she would try to fall asleep in the hospital while the man watched she said she heard him bragging you know theyll never believe you or you know they cant see me When the lights went out she closed her eyes She could hear his threats she could hear him mocking her life She always kept her eyes closed she did not want to see his silhouette even less his ember red eyes She described him as a physical being yet at the same time he did not exist At some points she thought she was arguing with herself until she realized the voice was overlapping her voice her thoughts She had nightmares almost every night in that hospital Around  month goes by in there and she pretends to be fine they let her out a week or so later My mom did not hear of her for about  months after she got out of the hospital My mother was worried and she sent out search parties she called cops Yet she never found her Turns out she was hiding in the woods She didnt want see anyone my aunt told my mother that she never gave in I dont know the way my mom told me I can only assume she was lying She told me how she lived in the woods for a few months living off whatever she could find She explained to my mother how he never left her side he was always there talking to her he did not want to let her go My mother told me that the last thing my aunt told to her was something this man the devil said to my aunt  i want you she ended up killing herself a week after She was weak and brittle and was basically a walking corpse A few members of the family came to her funeral not many though thats what my mother told me My grandmother did not go She was embarrassed of her daughter and the fact that she killed herselfA few months later after the funeral my mother gets off work around pm its still light out so she thinks why not visit my sister she needs it so she walks to the cemetery It was almost sunset and my mother told me she sees a man placing flowers on her gravestone My mother has never seen this man before and she starts running towards him as he walks away she starts running faster He disappears into the woods and just before he did he looked back and my mother saw his ember red eyes She told me some things in this world happen that cant be explained and that was one of those things,My Aunt,47,nosleep,top_week
REALreptus,7,25,1r8gsb,34,I was about  living in CA at the time and like any other  year old kid I was best friends with the boy that lived down the street We often spent the night at each others houses but when we spent the night over at his house I would always try to get him to agree for us to sleep out in his huge treehouse we would stay up till dawn eating candy chips and playing playstation until our eyeballs hurt I always asked him if we could sleep outside because the first and only time we ever slept in his house I saw this ghost The ghost himself was a tall man wearing a black coat with a big black hat that sort of looked that that cool hat that Hugh Jackman wears in Van Helsing and he didnt have a solid or not solid form I know that sounds weird but it was like he was there but wasnt at the same time I guess the best way I could describe it would be like really thick black static in the shape of a really tall dude wearing a cloak and hat Well my best friends little sister would always talk about this guy in the hat I think the exact way that she referred to him was The guy in the hat but we were to busy doing our own thing to ever listen to her to us she was just my friends annoying little sister that wanted to follow us around and do what we were doing Well that night while we were playing video games I glanced down his hallway and at the very end of it there was the man in the hat but I had only glanced and when I did a double take he was gone so I just ignored it That sort of glance and disappear thing happened like  more times before we went to bed Now what happened next is what made me never want to spend the night in his house again We fell asleep just fine no nightmares no spooky visions before closing our eyes but around am no not exactly am I was young and scared and didnt look at the time so Im just guessing it was around am every single radio in his house turned on at the same time and at full volume and it wasnt music or even just static that played it was this really deep and low pitch rumble that came out at full blast It didnt say anything I dont even know if it was a voice or anything all I remember is that it scared the living shit out of me His mom got up and shut off all the radios and yelled at us cause she thought we did it as a joke or something and wouldnt listen to us when we said were where both sleeping when it happend My family moved away about  months or so after this and I havent heard from my friend since I dont know anything about the house or the land or if there was a murder there or whatever its just something that happened to me as a kid and something Ill never forget,I was about  when this happend at a friends house,59,nosleep,top_week
childrenofsamhain,9,5,1rhdoj,34,My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child Until recently he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters Sarah and Emily Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three Within the first two years living in the house Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary It wasnt until his daughter Sarah was around two years old that he started to notice she talked to herself Jamie thought nothing of it she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway whispering and giggling Curious he asked Sweetie who are you talking to Sarah replied The woman standing in the hallwayIs she your imaginary friendI guess Amused he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall whispering quietly Whats your friends name he asked her Her name is Helen Mary she said And what are you two whispering about Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped Im not supposed to tell you Suddenly the front door opened downstairs and they heard Claire come through the door Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her Jaime didnt think about that again for a few weeks Over time the two noticed that Sarahs interactions with Helen Mary became more frequent but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily Jaime was at home alone with Sarah He heard her playing upstairs chatting away with her imaginary friend when suddenly he heard glass breaking He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway holding a hammer She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces There was glass everywhere Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits When he returned to the living room he asked her directly Sweetie why would you smash all of our family pictures She looked at him Helen Mary told me to do itWhen Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends Jaime told her about the incident The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes She gasped silently at the sight When they returned downstairs to the kitchen they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior Suddenly the color ran out of Claires face and she looked at Jaime Theres no way she could have done that aloneWhatThere is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herselfJaime was confused I told you I caught her with the hammer She told me that she did itBut it wasnt until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him But some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground How could she have reached thoseHis mind was racing She must have moved a chair or somethingShe was adamant There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it and you would have seen her carry one upstairs rightJaime was silent He didnt have an answer They went to bed that night without any answers The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking Though he didnt have much time to think about it as two weeks later his second little girl was bornEmily was two years old in the summer of  and one afternoon when Claire was at home alone with the girls she heard Emily alone upstairs whispering She called up to her Who you talking to kiddoThe woman standing in the hallwayClaire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister Then she spoke againShe doesnt like you MommyWhy doesnt she like me Claire responded surprised I dont know Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent Until one night last monthJaime had put the kids to sleep around eight oclock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after Exhausted Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him He turned to see what was wrong and saw it His  year old daughter Emily standing beside the bed with a hammer in her hand Blood poured from Claires forehead Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand He turned to his wife She had stopped screaming now and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face She was going to be alright but she did have a deep cut to her forehead Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room He went and checked on Sarah who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed He told her that everything was alright and closed her door He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway and he finally asked her Emily why would you hurt MommyShe told me to DaddyWho told you to The woman standing right behind you She told me to hurt Mommy And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered And she told me to hurt you too DaddyThey moved last week ,The Woman Standing in the Hallway,39,nosleep,top_week
blkmagick,8,7,1r8old,32,My father was in the military which meant that we moved around a lot as I was growing up One of the places we moved to was Pensacola FL We moved there right before th grade started for me and we lived in military housing so we got to live in a two story house for the very first time I was excited I got my own room and my own bathroom right across the hallway Things were great until after a year of living in the house when things started to get strange I was home alone talking to my boyfriend on the phone when I heard a large crash in the kitchen I slowly walk in to see what happened and one of the cabinet doors were wide open and bowls were all over the floor I quickly pick up the bowls and put them away freaking out I was in there just five minutes earlier and everything was closed there was no way for the cabinet to open on its own I ran up to my room and locked my door until my family came home When they returned they asked why bowls were all over the floor in the kitchen A week after that incident I woke up suddenly out of a deep sleep gasping for breath I looked at my doorway and I see a girl standing there She was wearing an old white nightgown stained with blood and she had long black hair Her throat was slit and hastily stitched up along with her lips being stitched together Her eyes were gouged and missing and her hands were chopped off Thinking it was just my imagination I closed my eyes and reopened them only to see she had moved closer With each blink the closer she would get so I threw the covers over my head and prayed that she didnt touch me I ended up falling asleep and awoke in the morning with her nowhere to be found Over the next year she would appear every other week just watching me I got used to it eventually because I thought it was just a chronic bad dream and she didnt do anything to hurt me It wasnt until after we moved to back to Michigan did I get really scared My sister and I were talking and sharing stories about our house in Florida and she told me something troubling She mentioned that if she had to use the restroom in the middle of the night she would always use my parents bathroom in their room instead of the one across my bedroom I asked her why and her response wasBecause I would always see a girl in white standing outside of your door and it scared meKnowing that I wasnt the only one that saw her terrified me because I knew it wasnt just a dream I still wonder if she appears for the new family thats in the house and who she is and what happened to her I have to say though Im just glad to be out of that house,The Girl in White,39,nosleep,top_week

WILLingtonegotiate,11,6,1rdxhm,29,Well to start things off I have a hard time convincing myself that any of this is supernatural Just extremely weird somewhat scary It may be due to the fact I worry about my families safety more than anything Well I will start from the beginningWe moved into our new home around the end of August We resettled here in San Antonio due to my wifes employer requiring her to live here  I say new home because it is just that a NEW home The neighborhood is new as well All the homes are brand new the oldest being around a year old We love the area Awesome neighbors rural setting though stores still within walking distance We know absolutely nobody in this town so we have pretty much stuck to ourselves in the short time here so far We live in a  bedroom house with our three childrens rooms upstairs and my wife and myself sleeping in the master bedroom downstairs Our room is literally  feet from the front door I say this because my story revolves quite a lot around that very front door  Around our third night in the new home is when it started DINGDONGGGGGG The second part of the doorbell sound was separated by about  seconds I dont know why I find that eerie   DINGDONGGGGGG DINGDONG DINGDONG DINGDONGThese three were quite rapid taps on the doorbellI must have woke on the first ring but did not quite have my mind working yet much less my body I open my eyes and hear the long drawn out sound of the doorbell being pressed firmly Then three rapid taps My room is completely dark only lit by the blue lights of the alarm clock This same clock showed me at this moment it was  am Wtf I thought I immediately started fidgeting in my drawer for my handgun its a Glock  with an extremely bright light attached just under the barrel It would be quite handy in a few minutes  I grab a magazine slide it in and chamber a round With a flick of the switch the super bright beam illuminates my room and my clear path to the front doorAs I sleepily stumble my way to the front door I hear another rapid ring of the doorbell followed by a deep loud booming knock  I check through the peephole and can make out the top of a mans head as if he were leaning on the door listening for any type of movement coming from within my house I place my weapon on the door around where I figure this persons head to be and I speakWho is it I shoutedMy question was greeted by only what I can describe as the loudest silence I had ever felt wash over meAgain I shout Who is itAnd I hear him for the first timeIts me Daniel replied the dry calm yet exhausted voice of the man outside my door I do not know a Daniel I replied sternly What do you want I askedIve been left here I do not know where I am and I just need a place to sleep Replied the oddly calm voice just inches away from the barrel of my gunYou have  seconds to leave my property or I will shoot you where you stand I said this with a very loud and booming command In retrospect this seems harsh and I am not proud of it It was after am and I was worried for the safety of my family I mean no good person would do this type of thing to a stranger rightI start to count  just then I look out the peephole and no one is there  the  was noticeably quieter than the previous two in the countdown I have a bathroom just off the foyer and its window has a clear view of the front door  I peer out of it no one there I think to myself okay he got the point Oh shit what if he didnt and this asshole is now taking revenge on my wifes car or worse my baby truck I decided I would need to go outside against my inner monologue telling my white ass to stay insideI enter my room to grab my shoes and got a shock as my wife broke the silenceYou are not going outside after that She exclaimed She must have heard the entire thingDo you want this asshole screwing with our cars I askedI could care less you are NOT going out there She again rattled offBaby go back to sleep I will be fine I assured herI get my shoes on go to the front door and that is when I saw something so  simple yet extremely terrifying The door had been unlocked this whole time I do not know why but this had a huge effect on my nerves at the moment that it was noticed I check the bathroom window once again a quickly snap open the front door while sweeping every bit of the front porch with the barrel of my weapon the beam from its attached light painting my yard as if it were the broadest brush in the pale Nothing I step outside and onto the wet grass I check the side yard closest to my door and then start towards the driveway The vehicles looked fine as I could see them clearly due to the very bright street lamp illuminating my driveway No sign of Daniel I start to check the other side of my home when I hear it Thinking of it right now sends chills all the way down my body Im right here Replied Daniel in a scratchy but clear whisperThis was so chilling at the time that I could not bring myself to turn around right away It felt as if he were inches from me Right behind me staring I feel a little embarrassed to say it took quite a lot of courage to turn around but when I did I was surprised Daniel had not been directly behind me but about twenty feet away sitting on the curb beside my driveway facing away from me His silhouette small and twig like There was a lot of light coming from the street light across the street yet he seemed strangely dark As if he were able to escape the lights grasp ever so slightly I remedied this with the light beaming from beneath my pistol When I illuminated him it was not what I was expecting Maybe my being terrified at the moment had me thinking irrationally I was expecting an old bearded ghost of a man waiting for me to peer into his cold dead eyes only to grasp my soul and rip it out through my throat I know too many movies right This was a noticeably unkempt young man but not dirty more of a grungy type of look going on He was wearing a vertically striped orange and green striped tight fitting sweater he was african american and seemed to be in his early twenties He sat there seemingly in no hurry to turn around and greet me legs stretched out into the street hands placed palm down stretched out behind him fingers noticeable grasping at the blades of grass between them What do you need I rattle off with an understandably shaky voiceOnly what I asked for He replied again way too calm for the situation I suggest you get up and move on before I call the police I say I crinfe now thinking of how I reacted to this young man That will be fine would you do that for me would you call them for me He spat back as he peered slowly over his right shoulder at me his eyes closed tight seemingly due to my extremely bright light beaming into the back of his headSure do you fucking realize how close you were to being shot man I askWhy on earth would you shoot me I could have walked into your home without ever knocking right He said this the way a mother would say it to her child when revealing she knew a secret the child thought nobody knewAlright move the FUCK on dude NOW I shouted but noticeably terrified nowHe rose to his feet seemingly in one movement Turned to me his hand stretched out as to block the beam of light so he could open his eyes and look at me He opened his eyes which were noticeably bloodshot and just looked at me staring as if he were asking me to lower the light which I did As I did this he showed me his hands first palm then the back of his hands like a magician would when assuring his audience he had nothing up his sleeves He brought his hands to his face and covered it while rubbing it quickly as someone would while washing their face He slowly lowers his hands to his side and then looks straight up into the sky and then slowly down towards me He smiled and said in a hushed but very deep voice Call them motherfuckerI raise my weapon back up and start to back into my driveway towards my door every few steps I make towards my door he makes one towards meCall them motherfucker He screams As if he knew what the outcome of the call would beTake one more fucking step and it will be your fucking last I shout my finger fighting the urge to squeeze of a round into his torsoHe stops in his tracks cocks his head at an angle and presents a very dramatic frown Followed by a snarl His face seemed to twist and contort while staring at me with the most anger I had seen on a human face everI get into my home grab my phone a run upstairs to a window to get a view of this motherfucker while I call the police My wife was already up there she must have been watching the whole thing I quickly dial  while ushering my way to the window As I peer down at him he slowly looks up at us still snarlingCall them motherfucker His scream muffled a bit by our walls but still noticeably louder than beforeI get the operator on the phone never breaking eye contact with DanielI explain everything to the operator as they assure me she has officers on the wayShe calmly starts to ask for more details What is he wearing physical description what has been said did he physically attack me was he still there did he have any weapons do I have any weapon The questions seemed to go on and on She then saysSir you should be able to see the lights from the unit arriving can you see it She askedYes I exclaimShe then asked for me to stay inside until the officers knock at my door I immediately head down stairs and there is the knockPohleece A male voice shoutedI opened the door and was greeted by an officer The cop was about mid s portly and visibly sweaty You called in a disturbance He askedYeah did you grab him I repliedHell no is he still here He snarked Well he was ten seconds ago I saidWe both walk out into the yard where we had stood No sign of Daniel I explained everything to the officer as I have just done to all of you He seemed to believe it all and was also a bit shaken Damn thats some crazy shit He said with a look of astonishmentYoure telling me I replied He retreats to his car for a few moments and comes back He explains that a family had just reported their  year old son missing Their son was african american tall and most importantly his name was Daniel He explained further that Daniel was a diabetic and they worried he may be going into some sort of diabetic fit Everything started to fit perfectly There was a reason he was so irate and up and down This wasnt a maniac it was a young man that was simply ill My emotion went from scared for my family to scared for this young man As we are standing there in my yard the cop and I We hear itCRACK CRACK CRACK CRACK CRACKFive very noticeable gunshots rang out Followed by my neighbor a  something asian widow

into my home and stay in there  It turns out Daniel saw the lights about the same time I did He must have quickly ran to my neighbors and ran through an unlocked door My neighbor found him standing in her living room naked and apparently slamming her cats head into the wall She said he had the cat by the tail and was swinging it violently into the wall blood splattering everywhere She retrieved her handgun and shot him  times running out her door immediately afterI was told he was dead before he even hit the floor She hit him with three bullets One through the neck one through the thigh and one the fatal one through his temple I met the young mans family who actually was pretty hostile towards me They wanted quite surprisingly to sue my neighbor for wrongful death or some shit I cannot judge them as I do not know what they must be going throughOh yeah I forgot the craziest part After the police officer ordered me back into my home my wife and I found something that send chills down our

BumpinRapTapes,10,9,1r0hla,26,So I got a call from a telemarketer nothing weird about that really  But before I hung up the automated voice started spitting out stuff like my address age stuff like that  And then my social security number  Then a list of my room mates  And then I was concerned  I waited until the machine stopped expecting some numbers to press for more info or whatever so I could find out whats up and get myself off their call list  All the lady robot said though was The Intermed company thanks youReasonably concerned I started doing some research after ignoring a bunch of message board sites  I finally found what I think was the Intermed site in like the fifth page of results  This is all it saidIntermed is at the forefront of the organ trade market and thought processing innovations  All our services are backed with industry leading research and proven by numerous customer testimonials  Many of our customers are satisfied to the point of frequent return and we pride ourselves in maintaining our client pool  Products and services offered by our company are backed with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime maintenance all available with a phone call  Hereditary conditions of the mind and body are often the only thing holding you back from reaching your full potential  Our team of researchers and technicians are here to offer you a remedy to any and all imperfections flowing through your bloodline at a price you wont need to think twice about  Never again will the flaws of your fathers keep you from the life you deserve  Even the best and brightest are far from perfect and we strive everyday to make you the perfect human beingNothing else  White page black text  Thats it  I decided to backtrack to the message boards to see what I could find  This led me to some random sites and eventually I found a few message threads of people sharing stories similar to mine  A weird robot caller with way too much information  One guy got the call in the wee hours of the morning and totally laid a boner kill on a sweaty night with his lady  They all seemed to be on the same hunt I was except for one username that I saw pop up on a few of the sites he called himself ASimpleCipher  All this dude did was sing Intermeds praises how he and his friends had used their products and services to tremendous avail and would recommend to anyone  All very cheesy and all seemingly marketing plants  Since that was my best lead I decided to make an account on one of the thread sites and try and get in contact with himI sent him a rather aggressive message which mayve been a mistake looking back  But regardless and unsurprisingly I got no response  I decided if worse came to worse Id just deal with it when it came up  I put the whole thing in the back of my mind  For a few monthsThen ASimpleCipher responded  Heres a copy and paste of our correspondenceMe  Hey man its really obvious you work for intermed youre not fooling anyone  I want to know who you are what intermed is and how you got so much of my information  And I want MY private information deleted from your database and I want off your call list  Immediately  I will not hesitate to get a lawyer involved if this goes any furtherASimpleCipher   I appreciate your interest in my company Ben  As always customer care is a top goal at Intermed  My representatives tell me that based on market research you would be a prime candidate for our products and services  As a courtesy we like to know as much as we can about potential customers so as to provide the best quality care possible  Like you I once felt a terrible weight in my life one that rendered me incapable of reaching my full potential as a human being  When doctors could not help me mend the flaws given to me by generations past I took matters into my own hands  As it came to pass that effort is what gave way to this current business venture  You may hesitate at terminology like Thought Processing and Organ Trade but let me assure you the danger begins and ends at the television screen  So if I may Id like to draw some common ground between yourself and I  We do share many similarities  As a young man I was plagued with severe asthma like yourself from my mothers side of the family leaving me unable to compete physically with my peers  This lead me to more intellectual endeavors as I began to mature into an adult  Cruel as fate is however I soon discovered Id inherited a more severe form of my grandfathers autism  His genes riddled me with social anxiety and I was thus outcast from much of any community I was ever a member of  In spite of my flawed genetics I was only more driven to clear the blemishes of my being  Nothing I vowed would hinder my quest for perfection of the perfect human being  Given to me from my lineage however was the savvy and cunning of generations of businessmen  Years centuries it seems passed while I honed my craft and built my empire  Once one is outcast from society one develops a strong callous to sympathy  Under a mutual agreement of confidentiality between you and I I will admit to using almost every associate of mine as merely a means to my own end  Well that end is Intermed  Intermed is my true brainchild as it were  I will also admit to misleading you a bit giving the facade of a full staff under my employ  Let me assure you I am fully capable of operating this venture on my own  Let me also assure you your personal information is safe and sound as I said I only aim to ensure the best service possible  Never miss a detail is a creed I operate underEnough business however  Even a jaded outcast such as me has need for camaraderie  During my time working in the shipping industry I found myself in Northern California in the early s  My business associate at the time was a rather unstable man  Every bit of his free time it seemed he would study the art of coded language ciphers cryptograms whatever one may call them  Strangely he got me very interested in the art and it has since become a favorite hobby of mine  Of course his were much more complex than anything I cared to attempt he was also versed in astrology and loved to incorporate knowledge of the stars into his little puzzles This earned him quite the sinister reputation after we parted ways  On the other hand I preferred to leave little clues here and there woven into my business dealings  Now imagine what fun it would be if someone figured out my little puzzles  All that work of building a persona of mystery  Unravelled by a thread Id left loose for some cunning soul to pull  Really I thought someone wouldve found it by now  Even after everyone Ive tried to sell Intermeds services and products to it is you cunning lad who has finally made contact  Very clever indeed  Of course you saw my companies website  I admit it is a bit sparse a work in progress  Reducing my mission for Intermed to a single paragraph however I did put in a bit of extra effortI have been rambling though I do apologize  Thank you for inquiring about my company I hope my response has eased any concerns you may haveIntermedI really dont know what to make of this guy  It really cant be some prank the guy knew I had asthma as a kid  How  I have to say that Ive never experienced such an air of creepiness from pure text  Something about the way he composed his message was off  I dont know  I cant make a lot of sense out of any of this  I stopped my investigation there being as I have seen too many horror movies and dont like the idea of rabbit holes  Its been a few months since and I havent heard anything from Intermed or ASimpleCipher  I check the thread site every now and then  I did go back and check out the Intermed website again  Im really not one for puzzles I cant make anything out of it  So Im submitting it here to see if someone is more cunning than me  I hope so  Anyway that about wraps it up sorry for the length Ive been staying in lately as my asthma has been returning so Ive kind of been alone with my thoughts,A Simple Cipher,35,nosleep,top_week
NeonPaint,12,7,1ra0o4,24,I need someone to help me I need to actually be able to go to sleep and not worry about what Im going to wake up to I need it to stopThe past few days have been enough to make me pack up and check myself into the crazy house It would have to be better than this I work at a nursing home Its not a luxurious job for sure but this nursing home makes my job interesting Its haunted I know it sounds stupid but it really is We have a shadow that haunts one room and our residents will act in ways that will set you on edge I guess the most recent example is Dessy I obviously cannot provide you her real name but this is a nickname I have given her myself Dessy is a cute little old woman She is the grandma you wish you could have Weve always had a pretty good companionship A couple weeks ago she changed Her appearance and her personality completely shifted Her eyes become sunken in hair was constantly messy when it used to always be well groomed teeth started to turn a nasty yellow and her feetdear god her feetthey looked like they belonged to a creature who only resembled a human in the slightest way The best way I can explain her feet is that they looked like long fingered hands with jagged finger nails they didnt look like they belonged to some little adorable woman of  She started saying things to me There was one conversation that has stuck with me Dessy do you want to go to the dining room tonightFuckfuckyou little whoreExcuse me Why are you saying that Honey you can eat in your room I just wanted to make sureHow does it feel whore Little slut you fucking slut you whore you SLUTYou need to stop being mean How bout we go into the bathroom and you can go before dinner At this moment she shuffles into the bathroom with me and I grab her pants to pull them downYou fucking slut Does he do this to you Does he put his hands in your pants Does he fuck you with his hand He fucked that little virgin ctvirginwhore slut fuck youwith his handvirgin ct ct ct I went white as a ghost I was close to Dessy but this old woman never knew anything about me other than my age my name and that I wasnt married I never spoke a word to her about anything sexual but she knew things My personal life isnt something I want to share but her mentioning those last words did relate to me in a very personal way I looked at her as if the devil himself were standing in front of me And then she smiled I cant explain to you guys the smile this woman gave me how it made me cringe how it made me sick Fast forward from that moment to a few days ago Stuff starts happening to me at my house It began with scratching One night I heard scratching coming from the walls then it was above me in the ceiling then back to the walls I didnt think it was too scary until it started to follow me around the house If I went into the kitchen the scratching would follow I couldnt get away from it But I soon realized there are much scarier noises out thereThe moaning is what followed and its been driving me to the brink of insanity Every night I hear this awful moaning Like someone is in this house crying out from a pain I can never imagine I get up I search for who ever or what ever it is If it sounds like its coming from the living room I run to the living room but as soon as my feet hit the carpet the moaning is now in the kitchen It plays with me Toys with my mind and makes me run around here on an endless hour consuming search of where it is coming from If I even want to know where it comes fromThe sound is so sad but it feels unmistakably evil to me I cant explain it but when I hear it I know its a cruel joke I know people say that they are sensitive to spirits all the time but I have always felt like I have been I cant sit down and talk to them like all these psychics out there but I will get random thoughts or names or feelings If a spirit is around I usually can get a name and maybe a fact or two but this has no name nothing What it does have is a moan that makes me instantly nauseous and it has a smile I havent seen it in its entirety but I got a glimpse of something that has made sleeping and living here nearly impossible One night when the moaning was louder than usual I went on the pointless search again trying to find it and figure out a way to stop it When I walked into the living room I saw a shadow and it had a smile on its face that made me throw up right there It made everything in me want to come up in my throat After I cleaned up and calmed down I realized that the smile was familiar to me Maybe thats why it caused me to get sick it could have been that my body knew instantly where that smile had been before Sweet Dessy showed me that smile that day in the restroom in her room She has never smiled at me like that again but I cant handle the thought of seeing it again whether its with or without a faceThe moaning and that smile haunts me It keeps me running around my house every night because I want it to STOP I havent had a real nights sleep in days  Im exhausted and Im working a full time job on a quarter tank of energy Things I usually love to do I dont have the energy to do I always liked to post comments on reddit but its been a couple weeks since Ive even done that because the thought of actually reading a post and commenting is too exhausting its pitiful I need someone to tell me what I can do Any ideas will help ,Maybe Im losing my mind,31,nosleep,top_week

theunlockeddoor,2,10,1r1j47,24,I work at a public library and I really need to write about this  Yeah boring LibrariansBlah I know  This is probably going to be tldr and dull  I know Im supernew to reddit but I really need to get this out of my system and Id feel weird posting about this anywhere else  So mock me for my noobness but I really need to talkAnd aside from sexy librarian sterotypes you ought to know that the people checking books out from behind the desk have to deal with all sorts of people  People checking out books about livestock and winking and grinning at you too much and women tearyeyed avoiding your gaze checking out books about abuse or divorce  Were sort of like bartenders but without the convenience of bouncers  So when I tell you that meeting this one particular guy kept me up at night you ought to know that its not because I have a simple dusty job This is a story about  person I met through my job  Its also a story told to me by that person  When I came in to work one morning my boss was wandering around the workroom looking disgusted  She kept going between the bathroom and her desk trying to work but getting nauseous every so often  Apparently when shed rolled up in the parking lot that morning shed found something on the pavementA wet set of denturesWe all laughed at how weird that was and set the things gingerly on a pad of paper towels in the backroom  No way were we putting a pair of raw dentures in the lost and found tub  We forgot about them before lunchLater that day though this guy came in  I ended up knowing him as Irmas NephewHe limped in and asked if we had any books about dentistry  I told him I didnt know where to find them off the top of my head and proceeded to do a search on the computer  As I typed things in and scanned our holdings he kept staring at me  His eyes seemed too large and white popping out against his skin  He kept chewing his lips and the sides of his cheeks  It was so fierce so intense and obsessive it looked painfulThen he said Teeth  Cmon gimme anything about teeth  How they grow  And trailed offI was rattled but I managed to scribble a number down on a scrap of paper and gesture towards the nonfiction section  He hobbled offTwenty minutes or so later it was the top of the hour and my turn to do a walkabout  Walkabouts are a thing our library system made up to make sure nobody is being harassed or molested out in the stacks  Were supposed to check all the blind spots in the building every half hourSo I was doing my walkabout when I spotted Irmas Nephew sitting on the floor between two rows of books  He glanced up at me stood and as I was moving away caught me  His hand on my wrist made me nervous but I looked back at the circ desk and saw Vikki watching us like a hawk  Somehow this made me brave  He told me he needed my help that these books werent helping  So I asked him what else I might look up for himNo he said I need to talk to you to someone to someone to anyone  My aunt she  And he trailed off eyes buggingSadly money doesnt reach superfar in the library world and I hadnt been trained on how to properly treat a mentally ill patron  As a fail safe I went with gentleness since he had a hard grip on my wristSo I asked him to talk to me looking back over my shoulder at VikkiThis is the best version I can write of the garbled story he told me  I could just say And then he told me a spooky story but that wouldnt explain why Im jumpy I apologize that this is long but Im trying to get this out in an accurate wayIve got an Aunt named Irma and she pretty much raised me  Shes like my mother but shes been gettin on gettin on you know and recently shes been forgetting things  I need these books for her  Shes got a problem  A real strange thing goin onLast summer she got all her teeth pulled  Got dentures instead  And she hated them said they always felt funny in her mouth and I TOLD HER wed go get them refit recast but shed still hate them  Shed just spit them right out onto the carpet and glare at me with her mouthskin all sunkin and puckered up  Im the only one of the family that visited her anymore  So that meant she blamed me  I was the only one around to be hateful to  FuckIn June she started doin this thing where shed say she lost her dentures  Whenever I went over to see her shed lost them and Id scold her because dentures are damn expensive  Pardon me  But shed say its no problem and grin big  Id look all over turn the house upside down and not be able to find them  Shed say Theyll turn up in notime and wave her hand at me like this  The weird thing is that they would  Id come over again and shed have them back in  Clack them at me and laugh  Everytime  Clack clack clack  And laugh  Clack clackShe uh she just kept losing them  I tried talking to her neighbor down the stairs Lucy to try and help her out  Lucy is a nice woman and said shed check on her when she got the chance  And she did good  When I hadnt been able to visit in a few days Id get a text or call from Lucy lettin me know everythings alright with Miss Irma  Only I got into a car wreck  Was laid up in the hospital doped out of my brain on pain killers for whoknowshowlong  Doctor said Id broken my thighbone  I didnt see Miss Irma for a long time  I think I got a call from Lucy at some point but its a foggy  I remember answering and Lucy just murmuring murmuring something I couldnt understand  It must have been the drugs  It must have beenSo eventually Im better and I go over there  I try knocking on Miss Irmas door  She never gave me a key but she always bustled up and let me in  I knocked and knocked and she didnt come so I got nervous you know  I went over to Lucys then to see if she had a backup key or could call the building manager  But I when I knock on her door it just kindawhooshopensI call her name but nothin  So of course I go in cuz maybe they both in trouble  But Lucy is nowhere  Her apartment is just empty  Except just as Im leaving I see something pink on the floorHere the guy paused licking his lips again  It seemed to me he was winding up his courage or working past something particularly horribleIt was teeth maam  Dentures  A top and a bottom both  The top was kinda falling off the bottom was at an angle  Like theyd just been dropped and left  I knew Lucy didnt wear dentures so this scared me a lot because Miss Irma might be wandering around lost with her dementia  Shed started forgetting my name  She could be anywhere doing anything if she was spitting her teeth out againSo I run  Run and find the janitor that sometimes cleaned up the stairwells and he looks at me like Im crazy  He says I thought your gramma moved out last month I say No sir you are mistaken  She cant have gone nowhere  And he says Well I aint seen you nor her in that time  And I argue with him but eventually he comes with me and unlocks the door   Inside Miss Irmas the tv was on but she wasnt in her chair where shed sit for hours and watch tv  I mean shed sat there so much it had left an impression her shape  But that wasnt all she left  She also left her teeth He was giggling a bit hysterically at this pointNo not the ones in Lucys place  These were different  These were more  These were MORE  All over  Pairs and pairs of false teeth were lying all over Miss Irmas apartment  They were on bookshelves and on the kitchen table  The biggest pile was around her chair  I was confused at first  There was no way she could have collected all these teeth by herself  I certainly only bought her the two pairs  She didnt have no friends to bring her sets of teeth teeth teeth teeth teeth  And they were different too  As in some were little  Like tiny white baby teeth just little gappy chips  And others were big and wide and long  And some of the sets I dont know how they could fit in a persons mouth  they were full of fangs and tusks andAnd it makes no sense  I can only come up with one idea  She was on her own for a month except for Lucy  I know Lucy didnt bring her all those teeth  The only thing I can think is that she was growing them back herself  That every time she had lost and found her dentures before shed just thrown them away and grown a new pair in her mouth  Then that set would fall out and shed grow more  And then they must have started growing strange in her mouth  And shes gone off somewhere wandering wandering I cant find her I dont  I need help for herI peeled his hand off and somehow got out of there  I went back and handed him some paper I think had a number for psychiatric help on it  Really I went back to the staff bathroom and sat against the wall for a while breathing and feeling really strange in my stomachWhen I left work I had to pass the set of dentures my boss found in the parking lot that morning  I found myself staring at them ,Sets of Teeth,34,nosleep,top_week
Chenigin,8,11,1r6b7r,22,When I was ten my parents divorced Soon after I moved into an old house in Orange County CA with my mother and stepfather This house had a nice floor plan but needed major work With all the remodeling being done to the house it was not uncommon for my step father to walk around at night to check up on and see how the house was holding up One night I was laying in bed when I heard heavy footsteps outside my bedroom window My room was located at the side of the house Me being young and naïve I automatically thought it was my step dad I heard the footsteps walk into the garage and enter the house via the garage door I knew this was the time to go to the restroom because well their was an adult and he could protect me from my fears of the dark When I heard the footsteps walk past my door I slowly opened my door and called out my step fathers name At the same time I stuck my head out my door and saw the back of a boot I never saw before turn the hallway corner This made me reconsider how safe it was to go take a leak I heard a sound in the kitchen the distinct sound of the drawers opening and a hand shuffling through its contents After what seemed like an eternity I decided to call out to my stepfather again this time slowly creeping out of my room so I can get to the corner of the hallway As soon as I started to edge forward I heard the heavy footsteps make a b line straight for the front door I started to pick up my pace so I could get a good view of who it could be When I got to where I could get a good view of the door I saw something I would never forget The door slammed shut and the lock turn to the lock position As if someone had the key and was locking it from the outside By then my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I ran to the door to see if I could see who was in our house When I opened the door I saw nothing No sight of someone running away no evidence of anyone ever being there in the first place Just  year old me standing in the dark Suddenly the fight or flight instinct kicked in again but instead its the opposite instinct fuck Im ten I am by myself in the dark someone just broke into the house I slammed the door shut and ran into my mothers room My stepfather right away called the cops and propped a chair to the front door and the garage door so even if someone had the key they could not open it The cops showed up and didnt find a single thing No footprints nothing My mother turned on me and said it was just my childish imagination making up things I started to doubt myself after the years Chucking it as what my mom said my youthful imagination I am  now I dont sleep walk nor have I ever If it was a dream I never had one like that ever since If anyone has any ideas on what I might of experienced please I am all ears I always wondered what other people would have to say about this Glad to have found Reddit thats for sure ,Still think about this all the time,33,nosleep,top_week

BiohazardTyrant,3,9,1r4rao,21,So to begin I was eleven years old I believeMy father had brought me to a friend of his house Or rather farmI was excited because I had befriended the son of my fathers friend for stories sake I will call him James James had a older brother who was a year and a half older so I was eleven James was twelve and his brother thirteen We had all played around the barn and fields plenty of times before This time though it was a celebration of some sort I wish I could remember why but anyway they had been in this house on this farm for about half a year Tonight was the big party as in the most vivid thing I remember about that night The cut off pigs head Literally just cut right off and sitting on a support beam about shoulder high to the adults The body was dangling from a chain for a while until they skewered it onto a metal pole and roasted it whole over a fireI really wish I could remember why they were doing that but sadly I cannot In any case me James and his brother were just running around like we always did like idiots They had all of the farm as a playground and plenty of space to play We began by walking over to the stalls where they kept the horses and cattle The sheds were HUGE and seemed to be endless to a younger kid as myself After about a half an hour of walking through corridors left and right in the dark we started hearing noises but not normal ones Like chains being hit on metal and slammed into the ground then grunts We all took off running following James brother who quickly let out out to the closest exit None of us knew what the sounds were because of the fact the farm had been out of commission for about thirty years Nothing alive should have been in there We quickly made out way back to the farm house the big one where all the adults were partying and tried to talk to them about it but of course they had all had a drink or three and ignored us laughing it off as childish imagination For some reason Some stupid god forsaken reason James said we should go back out and just play in the field where there was a little light away from the adults and we listened Once the three of us were out there it turned into a I dare you to go out in the field gameWe each took turns going farther and farther out into the night Finally we all ended up ignoring the occurrences from earlier and started playing hide and seek Bad idea Very badJames and I were hiding in the tall grass near the side end of the barn and his brother came running out faster than I have ever seen anyone run screaming bloody murder to get away as fast as we could get to the adults James and I ran to him and stopped dead in our tracks quickly seeing why he had been fleeing There we were James his brother and I all standing still like sacks of meat staring to the treeline where we saw it There were three if I remember correctly faces All white and elongated just weirdly shaped about six feet off the ground and then came the true horror the glint off the blades they were holding We all ranFaster and faster we ranI turned around two times and I regret it to this day for the fact they were even closer than I thought blades outstretched trying to mince us up and drag us back into those hellish woods We finally made it to the adults The only thing I remember after that was that damn pig head cut off and just sitting there I could see the spine and every last vein we tried telling the adults but they just laughed None of us left the main barn after that for the rest of nightAbout a week later my friend Chris came over and had the worst part to share with me He had been having these night terrors of these creatures tearing at him and chasing him through his own new homeThen he told me his family had left the farm and moved to the cityThen he told me why He was attackedThen he showed me and lifted his shirt up showing me a scar which I know he did not have before because we used to swim together all the time He never had a mark there a week before But now across his stomach he had a fully healed scar of about ten inches going from left to right like he had been gutted But the scariest fact like I said was that it had not been there one night then he woke up with that kind of scar His family moved because of that that day And never returned to that farmI have long since lost touch with him he became very paranoid after that and I just cant forget thatFigured I would share it with the community I do hope if any of you take anything away from this if you see a creature with a white face long arms and a huge blade by a treeline Run just run And try to forget about it,A tale of a Farm and three young kids,30,nosleep,top_week
JordanThirstExile,11,33,1r857m,21,It started with the roses Ever since I was a little girl I loved them I loved the scent of them and the colors they came in I loved them so much that my mother had planted a few rose bushes outside our house so when it bloomed I could sit and stare at those beautiful roses They bloomed in shades of white and pink but my favorite rose was red like satin It reminded me of my mother and the way she always drew roses on her letters Fast forward to the time I was  years old I was never a popular girl by far but I wasnt unknown either I didnt have long blonde hair or blue eyes but I had talent a slim body and an obsession for roses All my friends knew how much I loved them Theyd buy me perfume in a roseshaped bottle or a dress with red roses on them for my birthday  I made the best out of what I could in high school being a short brown haired greeneyed girl It was the day before homecoming when the boy Id secretly been in love with asked me to the dance with a white rose I swooned and he took me to the dance the next night I of course in a rose dress and him in matching colors He had brought me a white rose corsage to match my dress We danced all night and we continued to date until high school ended After our senior year we went our separate ways and stopped talking But this didnt bother me I hadnt time to waste when I was busy with my rosesIn college I had been taking Art classes in my third semester when I got a call one evening informing me that my mother had pasted away in the hospital The following Tuesday we attended her funeral My father had picked out the colors We buried my loving mother in pink roses because she was a former cancer survivor and we were blessed to have her as long as we didFor the months following my mothers death I became deeply depressed The only thing that eased the pain from losing my mother were the roses When they bloomed in the spring my sprits suddenly lifted The roses were my life and I dont know what Id do without them  years go by and I ended up meeting a nice guy who joined my ecology class His name was Dylan and we immediately hit it off He gave me everything a girl couldve ever wanted and treated me like a princess I loved him more than anything in the world We talked about moving in together and buying a house after college We talked about getting married and having a daughter named Rose for my love of roses His handsome blonde hair and chiseled feature would make a beautiful babyWe went through college and eventually graduated together and got married We lived in a small townhouse in Vermont for a long time after that After trying many times to have the baby I so desperately wanted the doctor came to tell that I was infertile Dylan tried to tell me we could always adopt always have a child if I wanted but I didnt It wasnt fair If I couldnt have a child that was my own flesh blood how would she share the love of roses like my mother did with me Again for a long time I became mute I could not eat or sleep Dylan became very distant and we hardly spoke Everything we had was gone Nothing made me happy anymore Nothing would until I had a baby rose I would look out at our garden and wait for them to bloom but even then the roses did not make me happy It was the next winter before I found out I knew something had gone wrong because all of the roses had turned over black instead of falling off and dying Dylan had come home late that night and seemed very stressed I decided that night while he slept Id go through his phone He had  missed calls and a text from a girl named Lisa The text readYou HAVE to stay home tonight She wont stop crying unless youre here LisaWho wouldnt stop crying Did someone care that much about my dear Dylan to cry when hes not there I remember him saying he worked at the office with a girl named Lisa so I decided to send her a text replying Get her to stop crying I cant be that important After that I waited for a reply for several minutes before I got a reply backOf course youre important to her love Youre her daddy And she needs you here Just take off work this one nightWORK SHE though HE was at WORK He was supposed to be at work all day And WHOS daddy was she talking about I carefully went through his address book in his phone and found her home address I silently walked downstairs and out the door grabbing a hoe from the garden before leaving in the carI knew the black roses meant something was wrong I returned a few hours later with his baby in our car I left her there while I waited behind the house About an hour later I see Dylan walk out the front door to leave when he suddenly stops when he sees the child in the car with the windows up He screams ALLISON Is THAT the things name So it IS his At this point I was furious As he went to unlock the door to retrieve the child I pulled him backwards so he fell into the garden I picked up the hoe and shouted ALL I WANTED WERE THE RED ROSESThe hoe dug into his head once and I felt all the love Id ever had for him release into the small tiny bits of pieces that were once my loving husband When I was all through I tossed his body into the cellar along with his companions At least now the black roses are blood red once again A beautiful thing the roses are Little rose lives with me now and she has just enrolled in preschool She loves the roses as much as I do but her favorite ones are the dead petals So pretty she said Even after theyre dead I always agree with her on that Sometimes she asks where daddy is and I must tell her Simple Prim Rose ask the petals,It Ended With Roses,54,nosleep,top_week

cmd,4,4,1r2xzg,20, unexplainable experiences are not completely abnormal for me Every house or apartment that Ive lived in Ive seen or heard something that would make a lot of people hide under a blanket or leave the house all together The man at my window was one story of mine that never fails to make whoever I tell shudder so I figured Id share it hereIt began when I was  or  years old We lived in an older house but not one that would instantly stand out as creepy or unusual We didnt live in the middle of nowhere but rather on a street lined with houses on both sides of the road It was a fairly quiet neighborhood the kind where the rare car that came down the street would often break up a game of football or hockey that was being played by the kids that inhabited almost every house It wasnt perfect but it was great I was a very happy child One night I was plagued by a very odd yet equally terrifying nightmare I dreamt that I was in my bed in the room that I shared with my older sister I sat up and looked out of the window that was next to my bed which sat in the one corner of my bedroom flush against the wall The window overlooked the back yard and in that yard stood a man He wore a long black coat a widebrimmed black hat that hid his face from me and a black suit On his shoulder there sat a very large black bird with red eyes I stared at him for what seemed like forever before he looked up at my window The only features of his face that I could see were his eyes which were a deep red just like the birds Just as he made eye contact with me the bird left his shoulder and flew straight at my window When the bird got to the point where it would have inevitably smashed through the window and probably eaten me I woke up I was on my side facing my sisters bed that was situated in the exact same position as mine but on the opposite side of the room I stared at her as she slept soundly terrified and unable to go back to sleep I decided that the only way I would get any rest was by looking out my window and proving to myself that the man wasnt really there so I rolled over and sat up My curtains were already pulled to the sides of the window since my bedroom was on the second floor of a house in a decent neighborhood  we didnt really worry about anyone trying to peep on my sister and me The second I looked at the window he was there Even though he was impossibly directly outside my window  close enough that he should have left fog with his breath I still couldnt see any features of the mans face except his blood red eyes I did what many children would do I laid back down and threw my blankets over my head I eventually fell back asleep despite being scared out of my mindThe man visited me several times a month for several years after that always just staring at me through my window during the darkest parts of the night When my sister moved out I started sleeping in her bed  across the room and away from the window I didnt see the man anymore One day I was cleaning my room in preparation for my friend to sleep over that night I knelt on my old bed still there for when we had guests  to clean the window I pulled the curtain aside as a teenager now I valued my privacy and saw a handprint on the glass It was bigger than my own but I didnt think anything of it I had assumed one of my friends had left it there I sprayed the cleaner and wiped it away with the paper towel but the handprint remained A little grossed out I went over it again a little harder to scrub the print away It was still there That was when I realized that despite not seeing him anymore I still received visits from the man with the red eyes The hand print was on the outside of the window,the man at my window,24,nosleep,top_week

irinax,11,8,1rf7xn,18,Previous post herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrcopwhoisthiswomanpartThis night I had a friend over Its not related to the woman or this story at all  it was planned much earlier I needed some help with my new place so shed help me and sleep over because we had no idea how much time it would really takeShe had to leave really early before  AM so I thought I can just sleep until  and then goBut as soon as she went out I felt something weird As if theres someone still with me Someone watching me I just knew someone is thereKind of like when I lived with my parents and I just KNOW theyre here even though the door of my room is closed And I know so I have to get up and checkThats how it was So I got up to check Nothing I couldnt see anything but I could still feel it I figured the feeling would go away when I look around the apartment and see that theres nothing there It didnt It just felt like I was chasing after something and it kept getting away Like when you try to hold onto something really slippery I felt helpless and very hopeless in that moment It was much deeper than just not being able to find something I felt was there  it was just an ingeneral feeling of misery and despair not related to something specific So I figured maybe I was just getting sick maybe I was too tried too stressed maybe its really nothing and I went back to bed I fell asleep really quickly Then the doorbell rang I woke up It felt like I slept for hours and hours but in reality it was only like  or  minutes I went to open the door guess who it was The womanYeah I was terrified and for a moment I thought  Im done Its over Byebye cruel worldIt  wasnt  regular fear like youd be afraid when you know theres a reason to like a gun pointed or an angry dog It was more like fear of the dark you dont really know what exactly you fear but its still scaryAnd just to make it clear once again  she doesnt LOOK scary She looks normalShe speaks in a normal tone with a normal voice But theres just something about her that makes me want to get away but in the same way intrigues me  I feel that I HAVE to knowSo I was really holding back the what the fuck are you doing here you mad bitch rant that was forming in my mind I just greeted her instead because seriously what good could come out of getting pissy Not like that would help nowShe says hi Im like uhumm yeah hi And then she tells me she just wanted to visit me to see how am I doing hows life etc etc So Im like wtf you saw me yesterday and the day before and the day before She ignores me She asks to come in but I tell her I was just planning to get out I have things to do so  I wouldnt be a good host right now She says she doesnt mind it all I say I feel embarrassed about having such a messy home Maybe when I fix it I know  she knows Im lying But I just HAVE to say that I cant tell her the truth She just walks in and I immediately escort her outAnd the truth is I just DONT want her in I cant let  her I know she cant do anything more than she could do in the hallway or from the door or in the park or in an alley or anywhere else really but I just didnt feel like letting her in and still dont I know it was rude as fuck but so is trying to force someone to let you in their house at  in the morningShe keeps trying to get me to make her coffee or breakfast or something And the pushier she gets I get less afraid more angry She then asks me about my old town my friends family my new friends my new place what am I planning to do here I dont tell her shit I just ramble about unspecific things getting more and more angry She makes me feel dizzy Not in a Ohsoniceandcute way In a very bad way In a Icouldpassoutorevendie waySomehow I get through the conversation and then she just suddenly stops talking and stares at me Youre really not going to let me in I explain to her again that Im going out now and the place is a messSo she glares at me and nods AlrighttttI really thought she was going to attack me  I was really waiting for her to try to hit me or stab me or whateverBut she turns around then she turns back to me and says See you soon Maybe Ill come again tomorrow I tell her itd be better if she just lets me invite her when Im ready for visitors when I can actually provide a good stay for a guestBut friends name stayed the nightI get terrified again  bitch how the fuck do you know but I just say that friend is helping me with the apartmentShe nods again And then she says bye see you And walks away Turns around once again stares at me and says I still cant figure it out Thats why I just have to come back like you had to interrogate me at the park And then walks down the stairs I try to stop her but she ignores me Wont talk anymoreNow the thing is nothing about her except the knowing my greatgrandmother part seems supernatural otherwordly She seems like a silly but creepy lost cause And if it wasnt for my grandmothers warnings and the woman claiming to know Magdalena Id even consider her a cute wackadoodle But I still have NOTHING to explain WHY my grandmother appears to fear this woman and NOTHING to explain HOW could she a woman

considered telling it hundreds of times over but the sheer magnitude of it has always stopped me With six months of therapy under my belt I figure its time I know now that I wont be free of this thing until I write it out Settle in because I cant tell this story in ten thousand characters or less Ill be lucky to get through it in twice or three times that Its hard enough to sum up everyday life and this story is anything butI had a recurring dream when I was really little I would wake up in the dream and standing beside my bed was the most beautiful lady I had ever seen Long straight hair and long flowing gown both of the purest silver like captured moonlight She would smile at me so sincerely so lovingly as she sat down beside me and began to speakThe words were comforting like a lullaby but I couldnt understand them Though she spoke quietly her voice seemed to echo through the room through the universe backwards and forwards in time begging to be understood by my adolescent brainI always tried to stay in the dream as long as I could but eventually I would drift back off to sleep in the dream and wake up to my mom gently rousing me for breakfastMy mom died when I was seven and the dreams stopped Well I prefer to say she died She was murdered I hate that word Its so cold it falls off the tongue like shards of glassMy mom was a health nut protein shakes weight lifting yoga the whole lot Above all she loved to jog We had several acres of untamed land around the house She always woke me up about an hour before dad went to work so she could go take a fortyminute run through the forest and along the creek it befell dad to make me breakfast and get me ready for schoolThey found her by the lake south of the house And hanging from the old weeping willow in the middle of the pasture And scattered across the countryside in a tenmile radius around the house  but that was mostly after the funeral All told the casket had about twothirds of a person inside when we finally buried her They never found her headWe used to be a close family  me my sister my mom and dad  Losing mom and losing her the way we did splintered us Dad lost himself in his advertising job My sister turned inward and fell into drugs and alcohol when the kids our age figured out how to get ahold of it Besides his job dads other mission was to keep his girls safe from all harm and he took that one even more seriously Leanna got it a little easier since she was four years older I was taken out of school Dad hired a tutor to homeschool me I wasnt allowed out after dark I wasnt allowed out without supervision Unless I was being taken to town for some reason I wasnt allowed to range out of eyesight or earshot of the houseI started writing obsessively Mom taught me how to keep a journal as soon as I could hold a crayon I still have my very first one the pages are filled with scribbles in different colors and some pages are nearly colored solid I guess I thought that good writing should fill as much of the page as possible I remember how unabashedly delighted mom was to see every single entry I guess writing is my way of honoring her memoryI took moms death hard but it was a long while before I really understood what it meant that mom was killed Dad told me that a very bad man had taken my mom from us that she was dead that shed never come back All things considered he handled that conversation pretty well Nothing could have softened the blow though My mommy was gone I loved her and wanted her but Id never see her again She was dead and death meant people were gone forever We werent a religious household so at that young age I was coming to grips with the fact that mom didnt exist anymore There was a hole in my world It was like that feeling when you go to grab something like a can of Coke without looking at it and you end up swiping at the air because that can wasnt where you expected it to beI healed in time For several years I was just chugging along going through the motions numb to the outside world Closing myself off was easy the outside world mainly consisted of our house and the clearing around it My dad was mostly an authoritarian figure when he was home always vigilant but never available My sister babysat me when dad was gone though she usually left me entirely to my own devices She was homeschooled too but she could drive sometimes she would simply leave me at the house and go off to do Big People stuff That Big People stuff as Ive written consisted mainly of shooting up with her friends or scoring more dopeShe had been chasing her high for ten years straight when I turned eighteen Leanna had been living with her junkie boyfriend for a couple years She was never able to hold down a job for very long so she would spread her legs for a dealer until he let her move in That was how she kept up her habit When that didnt work out shed beg dad for more money and find another dealer to fuckIt was a miserable shady life for her and she would have kept going until it killed her And it didMy dad got the call at four in the morning on a Tuesday I remember waking up blearyeyed to see him looking like death warmed over I had only seen that tortured look on his face once before and I shot straight up wide awake when I saw it that nightLeanna I saidHe nodded My heart sank into my stomach and stopped beating She was living in the city a fortyminute drive away A long miserable fortyminute drive away Neither dad nor I spoke a word He sat stoically knuckles white on the wheel crying silently I might as well have been dead myself I stared at my lap taking in nothing thinking nothing feeling nothing Where my heart had been was a gaping holeDad led me by the hand into the funeral home and sat me down in a chair where I waited motionlessly as he went to identify the body I heard his wracking sobs as he came back to get me some time later I reflexively turned towards the sound The funeral director and another man were practically holding him upright as he stumbled across the lobby They took me up and walked us to a private area with a couple of couches where we both collapsedI sat on the couch mindlessly pulling at my hair gazing at my father as he poured out his grief He had always been a reserved man but the dam had finally broken We had no family but ourselves Mom had grown up in a foster home and had no love for the people she called her fake parents My biological grandma had a stroke and passed in her sleep My grandpa followed not long after as old widowers are wont to do I never knew either of them If we had any extended family we never knew themI halfnoticed the little hank of hair tangled around my hand I hadnt felt it when I ripped it outDad cried for a long time eventually slumping sideways into his couch When his voice was gone and his sobs came without tears he stood up He seemed to be carrying the weight of a thousand suns on his shoulders At his slight nod in my direction I stood up myself and we walked together to the car He pulled out a rumpled piece of paper and his phone and dialed a number We were at a motel fifteen minutes later We went to sleep in our clothesThe next few days were a blur There were arrangements to be made and that was dads job I went to town and bought us clothes and toiletries to keep us going while we stayed at the motelThe funeral was a small affair back home We laid her to rest in the plot next to moms Dad and I were the only mourners A minister said some words we each tossed a handful of dirt on the grave and it was over It was overWe stepped through the doorway and into our home Quiet pervaded the empty space the sort of quiet only found indoors Clocks ticking a gentle hum from our air conditioner our breathing and the stecatto hitches as one or the other of us suppressed a sobWe stood alone in an empty house our bodies kept upright through some force of habit or instinct in the absence of warm blood flowing through our veins My sister had imparted some vitality into this place unbeknownst to us even after our mothers murder As our Leanna died so died the house I might have turned to see the land itself had withered without so much as a shrugDad pulled the door shut and the click of its latch impossibly loud against the quiet signaled the start of our new life or merely the end of the oldI glanced at the clock almost noon The gears in my brain began turning cast about for something to fill the time until bed and found nothing It then latched on to the only activity left and my feet carried me to the stairs with sliding steps They balked briefly as if puzzled by a reason to lift off the ground more than half an inch and then continued A minute later I fell backwards collapsing onto my purple comforter My toes brushed the carpet from time to time but that didnt matter Nothing did Apathy sang me a lullaby and the world faded awayMy staggered footsteps echoed through the tunnel meshing with the steadfast crashing of many feet behind me Searing hot agony blazed through my side I had to keep running I had to reach the end before I snapped upright eyes unfocused drenched in sweat I bent forward reflexively and threw up bile into my lap I sobbed and choked on my own vomit I coughed until my throat was raw until the vessels in my eyes popped and then collapsed sidewaysGood morning worldPart

quietgrl,12,8,1rchof,19,I had moved to Minnesota months ago in order to get away from some strange phenomenon happening to me in Philadelphia since May  I dont know what to call these things ghosts phantoms spirits However my friends and family arent judging my experiences as real accounts of the paranormal they believe that Im slowly losing my mind And sometime I wonder if thats the case too if Im simply falling into to some form of schizophrenia I decided to share my stories here so maybe I wouldnt have to feel much like a freak or that Im going crazy Or maybe I just dont want to feel alone with this Well I had a week to relax again without anything strange happening to me However I had that feeling again that things werent over and was just getting started I am anxious all the time ready for the next creepy thing to happen to me and Im not even sure if I can call my life living anymore I rarely sleep I barely function at work and Im losing a lot of weight from the lack of eating My only distraction these days seem to be stupid videos on the web and chatting with the cute neighbor named Charlie I dont share with him about my experiences because I dont want him to look at me with those same pitying eyes that my friends and family give meAlthough last week I did dare to ask Charlie if he had noticed anything strange in the neighborhood He gave me a funny and confused look and I had to try my best to explain what I was asking without really explaining the truth of my situation Oh I said waving my hands as if the movements would untangle my nervous words You know I mean do you notice anything weird or any weird stories from others in the neighborhood I was trying to figure out if I was the only person who had a ghost following themNo Charlie said shaking his head slowly in thought And then his baby blue eyes lit up Well yeah If you mean if there are any weirdos here yes we have a few like anywhere else I am a bit weird for example Nah I blushed towards him Youre not weird at all You seem very normal to me And very cute I wanted to add but I kept that thought to myself Well after a while of nothing happening to me I didnt exactly catch onto the next bizarre incident right away It must have been nearly am in the morning when I heard a man singing loudly outside If it hadnt been for CottonEye Joe Id been married a long time ago Where did you come from where did you go Where did you come from CottonEye Joe At first I was a lot annoyed for having my sleep disturbed by the most unlikely song but then it was kind of funny that someone really seemed to like this song and thought it was a good idea to bellow it early in the am Then another thought came to me that it may be the voice of Charlie proving me wrong about my earlier opinion that he wasnt weird It sounded a little like his voice and I couldnt help but wonder if he was drunk off his ass and having a bit of fun tonight I rushed from my bed and peered out the window my eyes slowly adjusting to the darkness outside The only thing I could see was a shadowed figured of a man non descriptive as he shambled towards the direction of the pathway between my house and CharliesI giggled to myself before heading back to sleep knowing that I would tease the guy tomorrow about his choice of song I slept peacefully as the night faded back into silence The next day I did run into Charlie a silly grin on my face I told him how I spotted him in a chorus of Cotton Eyed Joe stumbling towards his house at am in the morning He gave me the most confused lemon face that I ever saw on a man and replied Well I dont know who you saw but it wasnt me For one thing I was asleep at that time dead to the world And second of all I hate that song I dont even know all the words to it let along could sing the chorusHmm I said a bit confused now because I swore it was his voice that I had heard Hey he smirked I did tell you that we have some weirdos among us right It was probably Mr Roy who lives about two houses down from us All he ever does is drink and he only seems to leave his house during the night to avoid conversation and eye contact with any of the neighbors I wouldnt be surprised if he had a few too many last nightI agreed with that explanation for the time being but I wondered if Charlie was somehow covering up an embarrassing moment that I had caught him in The next night the singing happened again this time at am with a loud chorus of Where did you come from where did you go Where did you come from CottonEye Joe I rushed to the window and again I could only see a shadowed figure shambling towards the pathway and disappearing around the corner leading to the front of the housesI felt uneasy about the movement of the shadow as it didnt seem exactly like a humans walk at all and very unlikely for even a drunken one It was a combination of stops and jerks forward like someone moving a puppet on a string And sometimes the shadow seemed to jerk too far ahead causing the figure to appear a couple of feet in the matter of a blink I wasnt sure if I was just overly tired and seeing things or maybe not I decided to go back to sleep and forget about itThe next night I was awaken by the man singing the song loudly again this time at am I had left my floodlight on before bed a light that illuminates my driveway I eagerly peered out of the window hoping to see the guys face this time whether it would be Charlies or the weird neighbors This time the figured shambled directly in the path of the bright light and still his face was nothing but a shadow There was no hint to any of its features just a shadowed figured that belted out Where did you come from where did you go Where did you come from CottonEye JoeI was frighten shutting my curtains and hiding under my blankets I slept with my bedroom lamp on for the rest of the night just like a little kid Later in the day I asked Charlie if he heard the singing man last night or any time this week He did not And again I felt as If I may be hallucinating these thingsLast night I heard the man singing again this time at  midnight And I refused to leave my bed and look out there not wanting to see that shadowed figure shambling by moving many steps ahead in the matter of seconds I figured it was all in my mind that it would go away if I just ignore it Thats when I heard the creak of one of my floorboards at the end of my bedI sat bolt upright and could see the shadow standing at the foot of my bed Its darkness seemed to stand out much bolder than the darkness of the room a silent silhouette of a man who just stood there and said nothing for a while I was too afraid to move or to call out to my sister who was asleep in the nezt room I just stared at the figure barely breathing waiting for it to move or flinchIn a voice that was deep and demonic it sang out Where did you come from CottonEye JoeAt that moment I lost my shit and began to scream as I flipped out of my bed and hit the floor with a huge thump I began to crawl my way towards the door of my room but that thing it grabbed my ankle and began pulling me back towards it I kicked flailed around on the floor and cried out No no no no Let me goMy sister burst into the roomflipping on the lights her eyes wild and her voice wavering Whats happening The shadow man was gone and I broke out into tears still very afraid but so relieved that it wasnt there anymore After some moments of hysterical sobbing I was able to tell my sister what had happened I thin this time she believed meI dont know if the whole thing was just a horrible nightmare or if Im somehow hallucinating However that grab from the shadow man felt a lot real I can still feel the memory of that grip on my ankle a rough and cold hand that eagerly wanted to pull me in towards it I cant sleep with the light off now,Cotton Eyed Shadow,27,nosleep,top_week

Myzrath,5,7,1r5zd8,17,I came from a universe where things twisted and changed at the mercy of my infinite will But here everything was the same Every day I awoke encased in meat trapped in the same skin Id loathed for so long I interacted with the same people I hated and wondered why I couldnt have been born across the ocean My will and infinite vision was no use here No matter how vivid my dreams were they were meaningless and intangible I spend endless nights staring at the mist and midnight skies longing to revert to my true form I dreamed of another existence that was so real so overpowering that it choked out this disappointing joke  you call reality Things are woven into the fabric of your world that you will never see or comprehend And I longed to see them againI came from a place where I never had to question sanity because there was no such thing There was only the boundless infinity of thoughts I was nothing yet I was everything I had no body and I had no pain For vast uncounted ages I soared through the bleak darkness of space savoring the isolation and the pain it brought My soul was seared by the fire at the hearts of stars and my dreams were inspired by black holes sucking entire galaxies into oblivion I wandered for eternity but suddenly it was overAnd I awoke in this prison of meat wondering why the stars were so far away I wondered why I had these new emotions like hatred and longing I was jealous of the other meat puppets for having better skins to walk around in Or for living in a nicer house or fucking a better looking slab of meat Slowly I began to forget everything And only in dreams can I remember true freedom the boundless infinity where I once roamed as a collection of particles calls to me and soon I will returnI came from a dimension where my dreams desires and fears were nonexistent I had no one to envy no one to despise I was a subatomic particle with the fury of a dying star and now Im trapped inside a walking corpse waiting to dieI am not a human being This is just a dream and soon I will awake,Arcturus,24,nosleep,top_week
schizoidvoid,5,9,1r72xt,16,The introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroductionPart   ConvergencehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsruhthesilverladypartconvergenceThe vomit had soaked through the covers moistened my legs and cooled by the time I decided to move The clock read Too Early I had slept for nearly sixteen hours Whatever Once my mouth was rinsed and the bedding had been bundled up and tossed in the laundry room I padded into the main living room to watch infomercialsDad was up at six I didnt notice him until he slumped back into the couch beside me He was the first to speakMorning he said quietlyMm I agreedHow long have you been upSince fourI came in to check on you several times Looked like you were having nightmaresYeahYou were crying Tossing and turning I tried to wake you up He pulled up the sleeve of his robe to show me some scratches You uh thought I was a bad guyMy eyes misted up as I drew my knees up to my chest Words began to spill out Im sorry Dad cut me off Shh Its fine I know you didnt mean itHis voice was so gentle The authoritarian figure that had watched over me with a stern gaze was gone The fierce strength behind his eyes was broken and this man had no fire left All at once the protectve shell of numbness cracked and shattered I wanted my daddy Without a word I crawled over and laid my head on his shoulder Two weeks ago this act would have been inconceivable Two weeks ago Leanna was alive Some shred of rational thought in the back of my head noted with muted shock that the roles we had played every day were nothing more than an artificial construct an act we played out every dayDad wrapped me up in his arms and we cried together until I lost track of time altogether Inevitably the tears stopped flowing though neither of us made a move away from the other for another hour Who was left to prop the two of us up but each other We sat watching infomercials one after the other neither of us really caring for anything but the hypnotic power of the glowing screenMy stomach growled I remembered that I hadnt eaten In the same breath I realized that my head was pounding I clutched at my stomachEggs okay my dad murmuredI nodded still bent overDad lifted his arm from my shoulders and stood up In the span of that motion the weight fell on his shoulders again and he walked slowly to the kitchenI scarfed down the eggs unceremoniously and thanked my dad After that I retired to my room and spent most of the day at my writing desk staring at a blank sheet of paper I took regular breaks to stare out the window at the trees waving in the windEventually the sun sank below the treeline and I began nodding As I did my heart skipped a beat Would I wake up tomorrow tangled in the sheets fearing that unknown terror at my heelsIn the end I told myself that it was irrelevant Sleep is inevitable I still couldnt shake the feeling of impending doom that I might face that terror again As I slipped under the covers I cast about in my mind looking for anything to ease my fear A memory came of a lady in silver The dream I had when I was little Suddenly I missed that lady I couldnt recall her face but the feeling she brought with her was clear as day when I thought about it She made me feel safe protected warmTears leaked from between my closed eyelids I missed my mom I missed my sister I wished I could dream of that lady just one more time Nothing was more important I dwelt on her memory and the aching desire for that little bit of relief spread through my body until I craved her like a starving girl that smelled pizzaI fell asleep thinking of nothing else And then I woke upShe was standing at the edge of my bed and she was beautiful an angel wrought in the finest purest of silver And I didt hurt I stared at her and she was beautiful and she returned my gaze a quizzical look on her perfect face And she was beautiful Her hair and gown flowed behind her in slow motion defying gravity She opened her mouth as if to speak then closed it and paused and lowered her gaze Her eyes drifted back up to me and Can you see me Her voice was the choir of heaven the sweet whispers of a thousand mothers cooing at their newborn children It echoed through time and space it echoed within my mind and my heart lifted up higher higher until the echoes died away I found myself smiling tears of joy misting my vision blurring it into a shine of silver against the darkness of my roomI could only nodYou can understand me Her accent was stilted as though she was deaf I got the feeling that speech was mostly unnecessary for herI collapsed as the sorrows heartbreaks and betrayals of my past bled from my soul all at once A moment later I was at peace I sat up in a fluid motion turning to the silver lady before meYes I was hoping Id dream of you Im so glad youre hereThis is no dreamI laughed How could this be anything elseI do not know But I promise No dreamI considered this for a time while the lady waited motionless save for her gown and hair Some part of me knew that nothing this apparition would tell me would ever be a lie Nevertheless  Alright Ill just stay up all night then That should make it pretty obvious I grew serious Will you stay with me Can anybody else see youYou called me Not sure how Usually death calls me But no one will die here I dont understand You know death You should not see me nowMy jaw would have been hanging open except I seemed incapable of registering surprise that could overpower the warmth radiating from the ethereal lady in front of me As it was I responded Hmm a sound less consideration than contentedness Well what are you I said after a lengthy pause She responded with a pause of her own dropping her gaze and softly stroking her chin And then I felt a whisper in my mind the gentlest touch of wind as something made its way inside Her eyes lit up and I felt her happiness She could communicate without speaking I suddenly knew and this way was much faster more precise I tried to think back at her and she didnt respond A look of confusion passed across my face and then I understood that Id have to project myself back for twoway communication Telepathy wasnt nearly overpowering as the sound of her voice or maybe I didnt have anything left inside me to soothe and fix I realized that I had a thousand questions and we began to converse to an observer it would appear as though I was having half a phone conversation I can only summarize our exchangeShe didnt seem to know what or who she was She had no name She simply popped into existence one dayWhats your earliest memoryDarkskinned brutish people in caves A woman being raped while her child watched A fleeting moment blurred before her world became darkness a state she termed sleepHoly shitShe came and went and sometimes she was in many places at once Rarely she was everywhere The last time that happened she described lots of people starving or shooting at each other Patches on shirts and overcoats triangles and stars The holocaust She was everywhere thenHoly shitMy jaw was in fact hanging open now You were everywhere In the entire universeNo not the entire universe Just the earthThe oceans too All the landNo Only where there were peopleWhy do I feel so much better when youre aroundShe shrugged lines of sadness creasing her face like cracks in polished diamond The tragedy of her expression threatened to break my heart as though I was watching a snake eat a kitten Suddenly I saw myself as a child myself and my mother I knew this to be the last time I would see my mom alive The silver lady was embracing her weeping tears like liquid pearl I could see a swirling darkness surrounding the two of them there but not there The more closely I examined the miasma with this second sight the more sinister it became I began to see through it as though it was a portal to another dimension of gnashing swirling teeth and rotting flesh I felt a cold alien intelligence invade my mind and then I was a bug under a microscope My mind was aflame with pain and disgust pushing through the dull opiate warmth of the ladys protection The demonic thing was plotting yearning and I could taste its desire with my own tongue My vision began to fade to black and I was immersed in inky singleminded hatred of unfathomable depth Time lost its meaning and then I was back in my room unsure if a second had passed or a centuryThe lady nodded filling my mind with her own and I understood I had seen the hunger in the world a faceless timeless entity whose only purpose is to consume and destroy And before me stood the force of lightDawn broke through my windowThe introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroductionPart

schizoidvoid,2,5,1r9u3h,14,This is shaping up to be a big project which is good for me and hopefully for all of you as well Turns out ten thousand characters isnt nearly as much as I hoped it would be Thanks to those of you who have commented on parts one and two Here are some links to get you started into my storyThe introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroductionPart  Manifestationshttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrxtthesilverladypartmanifestations Part  SpiritshttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrcvthesilverladypartspiritsI remember a story arc in Greys Anatomy where the ghost of a doctors dead lover followed her around and only she could see it Thats when I stopped watching the seriesI was eating cereal watching reruns of Scooby Doo I couldnt recall cereal ever tasting better and I couldnt recall Scooby Doo ever being so entertaining But thats how it goes when the embodiment of good is sitting beside you on the couch giggling musically at the television Today was a day of firsts for the both of us Dad walked in at some point looking haggard as I had ever seen him His eyebrows shot up when he saw me curled up on the couch neatly groomed and with color in my cheeks I gave him a halfsmile equal parts enthusiasm and sympathy Make no mistake I hadnt forgotten my sisters death but no therapy on earth could have matched the aura of the silver lady I stood up smoothly walked the three paces across the living room and wrapped him in the biggest hug I could muster He was apparently speechless but when I looked up at him I saw that the worry lines around his eyes had softened a littleI reflexively looked back over my shoulder at the silver lady and she expressed her joy at my desire to comfort my dad I smiled at her and then glanced back at my dad who was looking at me quizzically now I brushed my hair back over my shoulder and smiled at him againWere going to be okay DadHe only nodded and wandered off He had taken time away from work to grieve and so he had not even dressed himself In the silence that followed I looked around I had to laugh and then I was shocked at the inappropriateness of my laughter Sitting on the couch was a ghost that only I could see a ghost that magically took away all my pain and trouble Yeah I must have snapped Two deaths was one too many My laughter had drawn the ladys attention She looked at me and frowned a little I shook my head at her incredulous and turned away Things like this didnt just happen to peopleI was grateful though at least I didnt get the ghost of deathly melancholy or something There wasnt much of an earthly nature that could upset me with her around That and the fact that I had an entire day to kill considered I decided I might as well make the best of it Everyone grieves in their own way I suppose Jurassic Park was showing and I figured Id go see it The movie wasnt for several hours though and so I grabbed up my things and went for pancakes at IHOP The silver lady sat across from me and I couldnt help but laugh The entire restaurant was going about its business and yet here sat a figure so obviously paranormal as to be hokey like a ghost bride her hair and gown blowing in a wind that only she could feel She noticed my disdain and expressed a mild indignance within my mind I shrugged it off and asked her what she could expect from me but quickly shut my mouth and looked around when I realized that I looked like a total schizophrenicI still had an hour to kill after breakfast so I decided to spend off some of my allowance though it had been meagre from week to week I had saved up almost a thousand dollars over my sheltered years I drove down main street and visited several little boutiques built into the slightlyrenovated shells of old department stores and hotels from the towns conception way back at the turn of the century Several tops caught my eye and the lady waited patiently as I tried each one I asked her what she thought of them from time to time but she didnt seem to have an eye for clothes having probably worn the same ghost dress for hundreds of millenia I was just wrapping up at the last store preparing to break another fifty dollar bill when a little girl in front of me in line turned aroundShe smiled wide and began tugging on the hem of her moms skirtMommy MommyWhat is it honey the woman asked a little exasperated but apparently feeling indulgentShes so pretty mommyThe mother looked at me and smiled and I smiled back Yes shes very pretty hon Now come on weve got to get to the bank She halfwalked halfdragged the girl out of the store the girls eyes were locked back over her shoulder that cheesy grin still on her faceI would have felt flattered except the child wasnt looking at me She was looking five feet to my left Right where the silver lady was standing My heart dropped right onto my stomachA sense of surprisingly smug satisfaction filtered through my mind simultaneously with a surge of grief and longing Satisfied though she may have been about my reaction the silver lady desperately wanted to follow the girl Suddenly I was along for the ride as the silver ladys desires became my own in our shared headspace I paid quickly at the checkout counter and trailed along behind the mother and daughter as though in a daze We walked out into the sunlight and I sneezed as my eyes adjusted Their car was parked twenty paces from the storeBy the time I had halved the distance between us they were pulling out And then shrapnel was everywhere I dropped to the ground reflexively and was peppered with safety glass Truly in a daze now I staggered to my feet and wandered it felt towards the smoking ruin in front of me Their little blue sedan was wrapped around an old steel truck I walked up to the passenger side window got as close as I could despite the truck and felt a warm breeze blow past me The silver lady was in the car then embracing the husk of what had just been an adorable baby girlBlood trickled from every orifice in her head Her skull had split open from front to back stretching her face oddly and she was staring vaguely off into the distance blinking outofsync one eye and then the other A couple arterial spurts sprayed the chrome bumper of the truck One moment there was a girl fighting for life and the next there was a lifesized gory mannequinI never got used to that part when life leaves the body the body ceases to be a person and becomes a shell inanimate as though it never breathed or laughed or ate or drankSound returned to the world and I heard choking gurgling screams Oh my god oh god no my baby oh god no My legs went out from under me I sat down hard on pavement kicked my legs until I bumped softly against the curb The silver lady was crying againI dont know how long I sat there but the next thing I knew the street was lit up with red and blue lights The din of sirens was crashing through my skull I was nearest the crash when it happened and so I had to give a statement I must have done well enough at it because the police let me go with the promise that I come in later to write everything out The driver of the pickup was clearly drunk and he must have been going twenty over the speed limit I made my way back into the boutique with stuttered steps and asked for a phone My dad was there in ten minutes flatI stared out the window blankly all the way home held aloft solely by the presence of the silver lady Dad tried to get me to speak several times but his words were a dull chatter in the back of my mind I closed my eyes as the tears began to roll down my cheeks I curled up inside myself and felt a welling spring of warmth rise inside of me as the tightness lifted from my chest I fled into it covering myself with the warming blanket of the silver ladys loving embrace like a child afraid of the dark I breathed deep and opened my eyes My gaze was drawn down to my own body My skin had taken on a silverwhite glow and an opalescence like polished marbleI glanced over at my dad wondering if he was seeing this My heart skipped a beat as I took in the dark sicklyhued vapor sticking to his skin like lake fog on a cold morningSarah Sarah what is it he asked seeing my face tight with shock and alarm His voice was jarring I could hear new and unfamiliar tones of worry and sadness layered within it But I couldnt respond I was busily looking around at the world which had taken on an alien cast The flora radiated crystalline hues and the sky boiled with color like something alive I could see the air itself buzzing with activityThis is the true world I thought to myself in a voice wholly not my own We seem to have  merged I felt my inner eye flipping through my memories and thoughts like the pages of a book each moment replayed and recast in the new light of a foreign perspective Simultaneously I felt my mind open to a tome of memories not my own as though a hidden eye within me had opened for the first time So much suffering so much death I was a failure For aeons I had tried to stem the tide of pain and misery that ran rampant across the earth like a plague but all my efforts amounted to a drop in the oceanI was being shaken My mouth tasted of ozone Dad had stopped the car and I realized I was doubled over and screaming Dad was near hysterics trying to get a response from me My voice shaky and otherworldly inside my skull said Sick  stomach Home Please take me homeThe introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroductionPart

Benlightenment,1,5,1r3pbk,15,So my auntie used to work for a millionaire Not the best kind though the kind who got the millions by being lucky in the national lottery He only won about  million or so but it was enough to get him a fancy ass house and to hire my aunt as a housekeepergeneral helper womanHis house was a kinda halfnew project There was an old bit of land with an old house sat on it just outside the city they lived in which he bought up and then built his house around that one And then his garage and a private gym he wasnt clever with his money and my aunt was stealing some too which she went to prison for eventually but thats another storySo in the end the guy pretty much bankrupts himself on silly business ventures and cars He has to sell the house At that point I was staying with my aunt for a week or two for a little holiday so she asked me if I wanted to come along while she had to clear some stuff out Me coming from a crappy little town jumped at the chance to have a nosy around a millionaires mansionOnce we got there my aunt took off into the kitchen which is where Mr Millions was his name was Lee really They basically said I can have a wander round play on his Dreamcast that was a mega thing for me at the time and just dont mess around with stuff I shouldnt UnderstandableSo I wandered off walked through a few of the mega living rooms with leather sofas and stuff It was all pretty old but I think that was more just because hed bought it to look that way I sat down and messed around on the Dreamcast for a bit but got bored playing Quake and decided to go have another wander He had a swimming pool but I didnt have my trunks so I was kinda lost for something to do I figured Id just go down the other end of the house where I hadnt been and see what else he had kicking aroundSo the house itself was a pretty standard layout You know the mansion in Resident Evil  The entrance hall kinda looked like that only it was dark colours and wood rather than white Upstairs was basically just one long landing corridor which had loads of doors off it to bedrooms and stuff At the very end was a doubledoor which Id never been through Given the way the doors looked I assumed they were part of the old house which hed kept so I went to have a lookInside was a pretty tiny room considering the house Probably couldve fit two or three double beds in there at most One side had a couple of armchairs and a little table and the rest was like a little library with a couple of bookcases free standing and the opposite wall to the chairs being a full bookcase wall which was amazing to me at the timeI figured there had to be something in here I wanted to read so I went up along the wall of books just having a look what was there It was all pretty standard stuff that youd expect to buy just to fill up a bookcase Dickens Austen that kinda stuffNow from where I was I couldnt see the doors anymore cause the bookcases were in the way So not paying attention when they slammed shut I squealed like a girl and jumped almost out of my skin Given the size of the house I figured it was either the wind or someone closing the doors not realising I was in hereIt wasnt though To this day I still have no idea who did it I say who rather than what cause what is crazy but both the doors were shut tight But that wasnt the odd thingOn the doorknobs was a book that had been placed there balancing So yeah my gut is already going a bit weird at this point cause thats just odd The cover had bright colours though so I assumed it was someone playing a prank As I got close enough to read I saw what it was a kids book Innocent enough Except for the title I See YouIt was some kindve of Peekaboo book for kids but that didnt matter at the time As soon as I read it my blood froze and I ran out of there like a little bitch I still dont know whether it was one of his family or not The house has been pulled down since though from what my auntie told me the half that he built around is now a protected building so its still there in pieces She said it was haunted too but that was only after Id told her the story Its about  years on now and I still dunno what happened that day Given that my aunt was thieving from the guy its not like I can ask him either,The millionaires library,20,nosleep,top_week
lamenteddreams,4,7,1rgqu8,15,I love the dark I really doI dont mean going gothic and pagan and all that but I do like the dark I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos researching diseases and the supernatural and writing storiesAnyways Ive recently come across a quote from a game called Knock Knock And let me say its utterly terrifying for not just the player but the watcher too Theres nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the gameYou thought about it and now it is inside Knock KnockThat quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and Ive seemed to have come to a conclusionThe mind isnt wrong Reality is And with that imagination often holds more truth than what we acceptThink about it When you were a small child things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind In fact there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood Also when you were a child you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they lookedAnd when you thought about these things you didnt want to turn around Why Because what if for the slightest moment you were right All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness the sinking feeling of being watched out of all those times what if this was the moment you were right Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didnt want you to know until nowBecause honestly we used to think the Earth was flat Then that it had the sun revolving around us So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there nowThis is my theoryI shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house The police showed up and they took her to the hospital She had three slash marks down her back resembling that of almost a wolf She also had multiple bruises on her neck They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episodeThis could be true but I dont like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theoryYou thought about it and now it is insideThis is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible When I asked her what happened she wouldnt tell me who only that it got inside She just had this empty look in her eyes something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice When I asked how she just said I thought about it and it came inKeep in mind I never told her about the quote at all Those were her own words So this is more than unsettling for me It may be possible that this theory spooked her enough for all of this to happen but I dont like the coincidencesWhat do you think,The Theory,22,nosleep,top_week

funnyguy,2,6,1r3dcj,12,When I was younger may family moved around a lot  One of the places that we lived in was a town in New Jersey  We were only there for about  year but the events that occurred will leave a lasting mark on me for a life time  In order to protect the identity of people names will be changedDuring the summer when I was around the age of  my family moved to New Jersey  Upon moving I quickly befriended my neighbor James  James and I began hanging out a lot and soon he started introducing me to some of his friends  I soon became friends with these people and joined their little friend group of   Pretty soon school started up again and I began meeting fellow class mates  I made a few new friends but I mostly stuck with James and those peopleOne day during school I left class to go to the bathroom  Upon entering I noticed that someone had clogged the sink with paper towels and turned on the water  Luckily I got there before the water started flooding over so I turned it off cleaned up the sink and went about with my business  When I got back to class I told Henry one of the people in my friend group about what someone had did  He began to chuckle and told me I was funny  I asked what he meant and he turned to me looking confused  He asked Wait you dont know  I said I didnt know what he was talking about and he told me he would explain after schoolAt the end of the day I went to go meet Henry so that he could explain to me what he was talking about  I walked outside and saw James Henry and Tim the other member of the group waiting for me  I asked what was going on and they said they would explain  They told me that about  years after the school was built before any of us were born a boy had been killed in the bathroom that I had used earlier  They told me that he was being bullied and the bullies thought it would be funny to give the kid a swirly a swirly is where you hang a kid upside down put his head into the toilet and then flush it  Any way what the bullies did not expect to happen was the kid to drown  The bullies thought he was just being a pussy so they left him on the ground  The body was later discovered later in the day when another kid went to use the bathroom and saw that he was not breathing  The bullies got into some huge shit and were expelled and got into some trouble with the law  After that there had been strange occurrences of toilets or sicks being clogged strange noises being heard toilets flushing on their own or even for some people seeing a little boy soaking wet standing in the middle of the bathroom  The school had been putting it off as tricksters trying to scare younger kids but people honestly believed what they saw  At the end of the story I told my friends that they were bull shitting me but when they kept trying to convince me so I got frustrated and went homeThe next day in the school the guys were still on me about the whole murdered kid and how he haunts the bathroom  I didnt believe a word of it and started to get really mad at them  We got into a fight and I didnt speak with any of them for a while  About a month after our fight Henry left to go use the bathroom  He was gone for  minutes and the teacher asked me to go check up on him  I agreed and left go see what was wrong  I walked into the bathroom and saw no sign of Henry but only a small puddle of water on the ground  I figured that this was just some elaborate trick that the guys had set up to try and scare me  I started saying out loud Really funny Henry but you can come out now cause what ever youre trying to do is not working  Thats when I heard a slight whimper coming from one of the stalls  I opened it to find Henry curled up in a ball on the ground soaking wet  I knelt down and started shaking him and yelling for him to get up but all he did was lay there whimpering and slightly rocking back and forthI ran to go get a teacher and then brought her back to the bathroom  When we arrived Henry was no longer curled up in a ball but now standing up in front of one the mirrors just staring into it  The teacher ran over and asked what was wrong but he just stood there staring  She started to pull him away and he look at her and said NoI need to stayhe told me to staythat im going to join him  The teacher asked who told him to stay and then after another second of silence Henry burst into tears and said The boythe boy tolled me  For about the next week Henry did not show up in school and James Tim and I got worried so we went to visit him at home  When we got there his mother answered the door and when we asked how he was she said that all he does is stay up in his room and when ever they asked him to leave his face changed and he said he was to afraid  We went up to see him and when we got up there all he did was look up at us and then look back down at the floor  We asked how he was doing and he didnt answer  After a few minutes of silence Tim blurted out So what happened Henry  James and both gave him a nasty look and he just shrugged  Henry looked up at us and said that he saw him  We asked what he was talking about and he said he saw the boy  That they had stared at each other for about  minutes before the boy started walking towards him saying that he had to stay with him and join him  Henry started to back away but that only angered the boy as he lunged at Henry  Henry said that he was all of the sudden drowning in the toilet and he heard his name called and so he sat up and then collapsed to the floor  I then entered the stall and tried to get him and the rest we already knew  We all sat there in silence before with out a word got up and leftHenry stopped coming to school and after a few months we heard that he had moved away  We stopped talking about him because we refused to believe what he had told us  As the school year came to a close my parents informed me that we were moving again  I was upset because I would be leaving my friends but also slightly relived  I stayed in touch with James and Tim but over the years we grew apart and the whole long distance thing stopped working  The last I had spoke to them they said that they hadnt seen or spoke to Henry since that day we all went to see him  I hadnt seen Henry either but to be fare I was purposely trying to avoid him  I grew up and one day while reading the paper I saw a story about a man who had drowned in his own home  His name was Henry Goldmen  I figured that this couldnt be the Henry that I knew so long ago  But there is still apart of me that wonders that maybe Henry was telling the truth and maybe what ever tried to kill him the first time waited years before trying again but this time it succeeded  ,The little boy in the bathroom,18,nosleep,top_week

angelcot,3,1,1rh91p,12,Hi rnosleep This is kind of embarrassing to post but heres a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid I was a pretty anxious kid and a lot of weird stuff happened to me Nothing paranormal though Theres more than just these stories but I thought Id at least start with thisEver since I was a kid Ive been afraid of windows Thats not saying much though I was afraid of just about everything else too But growing up my house was full of big windows Floortoceiling windows in the family room two sliding glass doors in the dining room a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because shed get depressed if it were too dark in our house I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size Every night I would pull them closed then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasnt able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye My bedroom window looked out on the backyard I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall Id cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains still pinned to the wall From a young age I had problems with insomnia My mom struggled with it too I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasnt asleep at    in the morning I remembered feeling envious that I didnt have someone to do that to I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers room and lay on their floor hoping for sleep to come Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains werent drawn completely closed When I was  I moved from my room which overlooked the backyard to my brothers room and my brothers separated and took over my room and the office My new room was at the front of the house If my curtains were open someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door During the day I didnt mind it I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman At night it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly My mom was sympathetic but didnt know what to do about it A year later I was moved back into my old room and my older brother moved back into his I stopped vomiting every night I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows One night I must have been about  or  I was up late as usual listening to Ralph S Mouse on tape for the billionth time I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me so I got up to refill it I was already wary of windows so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen Id often see things out of the corner of my eye something moving or something that could have been the shadow of a human but would later try to convince myself it was nothingEven with my head down something outside caught my attention A car parked in front of my house I lived at the very bottom of a culdesac so we didnt have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves The car had its headlights on and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car Looking at my house I dont know if they were looking at me but my paranoia told me they were I stood there for a long time forgetting about my glass of water I didnt look away Paralyzed until my mom came in the kitchen Shed seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up When she noticed the car in front of our house she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more although over the course of a few months Once they switched their headlights off and stayed for what might have been  minutes Although my memory might be exaggerating I still dont understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out The third and final time I saw the car the person got out of their car They were tall and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasnt able to make out their face When they started to walk around their car and I assume towards my front door I scurried back to my bed I never liked sleepovers as a kid Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains Having friends at my house was just as stressful Usually wed sleep in the family room because it had a TV in it It also had the floortoceiling windows Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows When I was about  years old I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends It was after  so my friends were starting to fall asleep I knew I still had at least two or three more hours of being wide awake I was laying on the couch swaddled in my blanket The TV was still on but Id turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible Usually I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows But that night my cat caught my attention meowing and hissing at something outside I cautiously looked out the window worried about what my cat might have seen out there Just another cat skittering in front of the window Relieved I looked out at my dark backyard Was that it There was a man in my backyard walking around Even with the distance I distinctly remember he was frowning He had his hands in his pockets I did not know this man I woke up one of my friends whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard She stirred quickly obviously alarmed and looked outside She saw him too Im not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what but he turned to face us Neither of us made a move not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep not even to look at each other or look away There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room right in the middle of the wall of windows The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt He smiled at us Not a deranged smile not a smile that looked too wide for his face Just a calm warm smile He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob I was never very good at reading lips I stared straight ahead unblinking not responding I could hear my friends breath heavy and shaking He spoke the sound of his voice muffled through the glass Open the door A pause he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned Im visiting your parent Let me in My heart was beating out of my chest I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little anxious yearold body and got up off the couch For a moment they man at the door looked relieved I ran out of the room screaming for my mom I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving and the rest of my friends starting to stir I told my mom what had happened She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my stepdad looked out every window for any signs of the man All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up I cried and stayed the night in my parents bed although Im pretty sure I didnt sleepIn my moms bathroom there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard The glass was distorted though so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it You couldnt see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window If you stopped to press your face against the glass you could see in or out but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard I remember my mom shrieking one night running out of the bathroom saying shed seen something through the glass A rat climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroomI always liked my moms shower more than the one in my bathroom My bathroom didnt have a fan in it so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from Psycho too and Id always shower with the shower curtain pulled open and Id get water all over the floor My moms shower had a glass door that I liked much more even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower Once when I was  I was showering in my moms bathroom because my parents were out of town My brothers were home but were playing video games in the family room I would keep my head down when I showered in my moms bathroom Even if the windows glass was hard to see through it was still a window and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at Every once and a while I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety To tell myself nothing was out there Cautiously I looked up to satisfy my anxiety Nothing was out there I told myself My gaze met the window There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass Through the foggy wet shower door I couldnt see anything All I know was that it was somebody I screamed and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there they couldnt see me A few moments later I heard my brothers knocking at the door both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up Whoever was out there was gone A few weeks later my friends and I were playing in the side yard There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in and pretend we were characters from XMen or Sonic My friend called my attention to something in the grass over by the window of my moms bathroom A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of  ,Windows,13,nosleep,top_week
Marksman,3,4,1rftnd,11,Have you ever looked in a mirror and you were a little off put by your expression Or looked at yourself in the mirror and realized that the person looking back at you is youI walked beside my friend and as we walked we talked I cant remember what we talked about but all I remember is this bland superficial conversation about nothing in particular Conversations like these bothered me they didnt seem real to me just like sounds verbal things that hold no real meaning And as I thought about our conversation I wanted to make it more real for me to give our little talk some depth and just before I asked her a meaningful question I tripped I startled awake rubbed my eyes glanced at the clock but the time didnt register in my head I realized that I needed to go the the bathroom I shuffled over dragging my feet to be sure I didnt trip or stub my toe flicked on the lights squinting from the brightness relieved myself and turned on the faucet I ran my hands under the cool water threw some water on my face picked up the towel and wiped my face off As my eyes adjusted to the light I looked at myself in the mirror and my reflection was smiling at meI considered that I may have been dreaming or hallucinating but my cold damp hands and the pain of the bright light was all too real I did what I would usually do when in this sort of disbelief and rubbed my eyes some more hoping I was still just a bit drowsy But nothing changed I looked at myself and was quite curious I felt my face with my hand to see if I was actually smiling It certainly didnt feel like it Normally this would creep the hell out of me I would on any other occasion scream or run away but I just stared at the reflection looking into my eyes as if they werent mine A genuine happiness I havent felt that way in far too long I felt calm But suddenly as though something dropped to the ground the feeling of calm had broken like a shattering vase a feeling welled up inside me A tightness in my chestLike someone had just punched me it was one of a gurgling frustration I would be happy if it werent for this stupid house things are constantly broken and this wretched family it all torments me every day of my life Thats when I heard the voice of my father from couple days earlier Because I said so the words resonated in my mind I could feel my teeth gritting the sound made my skin crawl but the reflection just kept smiling backtaunting me The shrill sound of my mothers voice beckoned in a continuous annoying ringing in my earI shook my head to clear my thoughts but the ringing was still there I peered over at the clock and looked at the time    Its lateI couldnt possibly sleep now I was simply too stressed I had school tomorrow but I had to deal with thisLet me sleep I muttered half to myself half to the voices and that face in the mirror This was when I noticed the mirror had stopped reflecting my actions and just was a still image of myself smiling I became angry at this point What is wrong with you I said to it hoping it would stop Just go the hell away I growled through my teeth Feeling rather violent I stared back into my eyes trying to counteract that incessant grin with my anger No Its mouth didnt form the words but the sound just streamed out of it The ringing got louder and louder I tried to cover my ears but it felt like it was coming from inside my head the voices began circling me and taunting me and that terrible ringing Then it all just stopped Was it over I just wanted to go to sleep so I could continue my broken life It started laughing a laugh that sounded unmistakably like my voice But it was a sound I had never made before a sound like true laughter this was new to me It bothered me I was envious Why cant I experience that kind of happiness He bothered meI had enough The voices all faded away but the mirror kept smiling STOP I yelled as I punched the mirror the blood was quick to run down my arm and the few pieces of mirror were stuck in my hand I could feel them scaping at the bone The remnants of the mirror on the wall reflected nothing but my angry scowl and bloodied arm I stared at my hand It didnt hurt but I could lightly see the reflection of my own face in the bloodied shards It still smiled IT STILL SMILED NO I slammed my hand against the counter the blood spilled all over the room on my shirt and faceAnd so it happened Blake had snappedthough In his own mind he was trappedBroken and confused he wanted to dieBut all he could do was simply cryThe lights flicked off his mother shrieked in the other roomscared as though she could feel her impending doomHis father had been up all night drinkingWhile Blake was pondering and thinkingThe sound of the window outside smashingrang in his mind terrifying echoed the crashingNOW OF ALL TIMES Blake shouted furiouslyWe enter Blakes house to a horrid scenethe smell of blood nothing was cleanThe sanctity of his mind and house violatedwith adrenaline and fear his pupils dilatedSprinting to the kitchen he grabbed a toola knife very sharp for he was no foolNot afraid to risk his life with nothing to live forThis life And the criminal he did abhorCreeping through the house to find the thiefHe heard a loud scream though very briefIn his parents room he finds the two mangled corpses the floor already soaked in blood His parents had been completely mutilated each had been stabbed numerous times now slumped on the floor eyes still open A figure stood overtop the lifeless corpses that were once his parents hunched over with a bloody knife in hand the tall man was half visible in the moonlight that came through the window His skin fair and pale his face was itself a conundrum it was an inexplicable quality His face looked off Like an optical illusion where all you can do is stare and ponder His fingers were skinny the joints looked massive in comparison He looked almost inhuman but he was unmistakably a man Awkward echoed in my mind perhaps for lack of a better word as he edged toward meYou didnt I said to himYoure welcome I stated in a soft warm voiceto Blake who accepted my words without much choiceI followed him back to the kitchen as he put the knife downThe blood dripped from his hair as heavy as a crown Its done its over He quietly muttered to himselfWe can sleep now He put the knife on the shelfI climbed back out the window never there was a messas Blake walked he had no more stressHis house unviolated but his mind still taintedto this new life he will never be acquaintedMy wits came back to me Cold blood streamed down my arms I walked calmly to the bathroom and looked at the cracked and bloody mirror the counter was a mess Between the cracks I see my face depressed Sad to the point of a complete bleak The frown That was more like it That makes more sense to me no longer that disgusting smile I saw a tear on his face It was of blood Feeling around on my face I felt a drop of blood Blood on my face Then I felt something that I did not expect A smile My mind twisted Reality as I knew it broken demented distorted I looked again at my hand The shards of glass still glistened in the light even covered in blood I saw a piece of bone fractured I glanced again at the clock  When did that happen I said as recollections of what had just happened streamed back into my mind Did I wake up my parents when I hit the mirror Then reality hit me in a particularly cruel mannerFor a moment dead silenceMOM DAD I yelled as I sprinted across the house into their room There they lay Bloody and mangled bodies multiple stab wounds on both of them in the torso the chest the legs the knees even the faceI hugged them soaked in their still warm blood Yelling at the top of my lungs IM SO SORRY IM SO SORRY Like a pin dropping the tick of the clock in their room brought me to how real this wasBut only one thought reverberated in my mind This is going to totally ruin my day After about  minutes the blood grew cold and the corpses began feeling rather stale I walked around their room looking for my next days lunch money and as I was walking out I slipped in a pool of blood With a loud crash I continued to lay on the floor for quite some time I silently muttered to myselfDammit now I need to get some new clothesI began pacing toward my room taking off my shirt frustrated by this inconvenience I threw it on the floor and it made a sloshing sound Maybe I can wash it My mother had done my wash up until now I took a shower and put on some new clothes Clean at last I walked back into my parents room I stared a little while Maybe  or  hours It was so Peaceful This shouldve happened a long time agoWhen I remembered that it was time for bed I began laughing Laughing as I never had before in my life Overjoyed More genuine than any laugh I have ever had Time for bed I dont have a bedtime anymore No one to yell at me No one to tear my mind apart I laughed and laughed until I heard my alarm clock go off in my room Oh time for school I said with a grin on my faceBut without my parents here to test me this was no raceMe This house was now my place Im here to stay for I had left quite a trace,Reflection,15,nosleep,top_week
Dectrek,2,5,1rbx7r,12,All my life I have never believed in luck Its just some stupid phrase coined from the minds of jealous or selfabsorbed people saying Arent I the greatest I just won  off the lottery Im so lucky or Can you believe that he just won  grand off the lottery that son of a gun Now just because I think that luck is a bunch of crap doesnt mean that I gamble Oh I gamble alright I gamble until Im rich and drunk at the same time Ive been to Vegas with my friends Ron Jerry and Max a ton of times and they always say Wow Rob youre so lucky and Ill either ignore them or Ill be too drunk to hear them I was addict when it came to gambling but one night that all changedIt was another Vegas trip with the guys I had lied to my company telling them that I was going on a business trip and they had completely bought it I even was able to use company money to pay for the trip We checked into our hotel room and decided that tonight we were going to live like there was no tomorrow I played craps until I was running low on money so I went to the blackjack table and counted cards until I was well funded for the rest of the night We drank and we drank and we drank until we could barely see anymore I started to black out so we went to the streetsNow the next events were blurry and I dont remember all of it I think what happened was that my friends were telling me that I lucked out at blackjack when one of them said something about me cheating I got all offended and started taking hits at him and I think we got in a fight Next thing I knew I was in an alley and was starting to black out probably not such a good idea to have had that much to drink and thats when every turned blackThis is when it happened First everything was dark and I couldnt feel anything but then I heard voices They were cheering all around me that sounded like something exciting was happening and then I got the sense of feeling back I was lying on my back and there were voices all around me cheering as if it was a football game Then the lights went upI was blinded at first but as my eyes adjusted to the light I saw thousands of people sitting in stand around a stage that I was on I was laying a colorful wheel something you would see on the wheel of fortune and I couldnt get up Beyond the crowed was darkness and the only light came from a huge light bulb that was about  yards from where I was laying A man was standing on the stage and was holding a microphoneLadies and gentlemen please give a warm welcome too our next contestant Rob JohnsonThe crowd went wild and the wheel started to spin slowly at first but it gained speed quickly I was beginning to feel sick when I heard Jerry press the button when youre ready and the wheel began to slow down As it slowed I heard the man on the stage yell Lets see how luck our contestant is too which the crowed started to yell out colors that they thought the wheel would land on The wheel stopped on the color green and the crowd screamed with joy All around the room the color green was shown with the words Bad luck on them I was deeply confused when I heard Well it looks like Rob wasnt too lucky stay tuned for our next contestant too which I blacked outI woke up at the hotel in bed where I instantly began to contemplate what happened during the night I came to the conclusion that it was all just a dream and that my friends found me in the alley that I passed out in They had driven me back to the hotel where I slept the rest of the night away and was now waking up from a drunken dream Ron came into the room where they asked me if I was ok and what I was doing in that alley too which I replied that I just had had one too many drinks They gave me some water and then told me to get ready for breakfast The rest of the day was ok up until we went back to the casino at night I was losing my fortune at craps again so I thought I would count cards at Blackjack again to refund my lossesMy count revealed that the next card too be thrown was going to be a four and I had  points on the table He had thrown  aces kings queens jacks  and so on and so until  to which he had only thrown three I knew that there was no possible way that I could lose so I went all in He picked up the next card and laid it on the table and what I saw I couldnt believe He had laid down the ace of spades which I distinctly remembered getting three games ago I just sat there in disbelief as he ranked in all of my moneyI ran to the atm and took  dollars out of my account and ran back to the blackjack table where I counted cards until that was all I could think about but every time my calculations revealed what the next card was It was always a card that made me go over  I kept running to the atm and running back to the blackjack table but I always lost My bank account was swept clean that night all of the money that I had worked hard for year after year was taken away from me in a few hoursRon Jerry and Max all said that it was just bad luck but I couldnt believe what happened that night It had been a terrible night but not as bad as what happened when I feel asleepI was back on the wheel and everything was exactly the same as the night before except I got a new color This time I landed on purple which lit up the room with the word Truth When I woke up it was the next day and my friends came in and brought me too breakfast That day my company found out I lied to them about the trip when all of my bank account money disappeared and I was fired The bill for the trip was sent to me but I knew I wouldnt be able to pay for it That night I was back on the wheel being spun again for a new colorThis continued for ten days each brought a new horror such as pain or divorce to which I was beaten up by some muggers and then divorced by my wife On the eleventh night I was standing on the stage with the man holding the microphone Lets give it up for Rob Johnson everyone The man yelled and the crowd went wild I was ushered off the stage and was taken into a room with the guy who had the microphoneNice job Mr Johnson He said The crowd loved youWhat was that I asked I demand you tell me at once what is going onOh Im sorry you must be very confused Im Chris Armstrong and I run this show You see whenever someone new comes along we take the number of big sins that that person had committed in the past  hours and we have them face the wheel and its consequences that many times You had  total major sins in that past day so you faced the wheel ten times You sure put a show on for the audienceSins I askedOh yes you committed theft gambling murder you name it You cheated at blackjack you became drunk you beat up a few people and you committed more theft We havent seen a suspect like you for a whileI dont remember anything like that I snapped at himThats probably because you were drunk when most of it happened Dont worry though youll have plenty of opportunities to make up for them laterThis is when a thought occurred to me he said I committed murder but I didnt remember doing or who I did it tooWait who did kill I asked suspiciously You dont know I thought it would have occurred to you by now Lets see if I can make you realize who You got into a fight with him after you left the casino You hurt him pretty bad and in your drunkenness you killed him When he came here we thought that instead of making him face the wheel why not have him push the button that stops the wheel from spinning It was an attraction that brought in a larger crowd than usualThats when I remembered him saying Push the button when youre ready Jerry and how I had gotten into a fight with one of my friends about me cheating at blackjackI killed Jerry I asked in horror but then a new though came into my mind Wait if Jerry is dead and he pressed the button to stop the wheel then does that mean ImYes you are dead Chris said as if he knew exactly what I was about to ask You died of alcohol poisoning when you passed out in the alley The past  days have been a simulation Mr Johnson welcome to HellLucky me,Lucky Me,17,nosleep,top_week

TreasureHouseofDoom,16,62,1r396v,13,Channeling Aunt Lucias strength and wit remarkable as both had always been I felt myself fortified for what lay ahead but that didnt mean I was completely unafraid  Fear and anxiety are nearly interchangeable in certain situations and shedding them completely is not always the wisest approach  Composure maintained I dealt now with redirecting the bases of these emotions into something productive and controllable  I remembered my mothers fearlessness the way she seized every opportunity to create and do good the inner power she exuded This I channeled too  Sisters in unison one living and one passed on to strengthen me I was sure I carried now a shield of sorts  Across the miles as if she knew the battle I faced I could almost hear my mother say Keep your head up Julianne  Stay focused  Do good work  This was her mantra and as far as I knew it had never failed herLaughter rose from the study again and I was about to step through the door open myself to the onslaught when I caught the fragrance of chocolate on the air warm wafts from just beyond the door from the foyer to the hall  I heard the voices of children conversation and giggling just beyond that too  Instinct told me this is where I was needed most  Dulcie wanted me to follow her into the study and in her realm there was no telling what might happen but Marys presence was just ahead of me and it was possible I would have the opportunity to observe more of the events that had led to terrible schism between friendsDoors shut and power out the hall was dark and the musty odor of rooms not allowed to breathe hung in the air  I tried but couldnt recall if I had smelled this odor the night before  The chill and dank fragrance felt captive too as if I were stepping into some forgotten time and place  It was completely possible that I was that I had discovered some portal that Mary had provided one  Passing doors I heard the sounds of the once living in other spaces the turn of a music box in a nursery the zip and knock of a trestlepowered sewing machine probably a Singer like the one my mother used as a plant stand at home the coos of a baby and the lullaby her Mama sang  These memories vital and vibrant empowered me too  There was good energy about this place and I allowed it to circulate now through me  Three doors I passed to either side and I was just about to open the door to the kitchen when a fourth door to the right opened slightly  Through the slim space provided I heard the singsong voice of Dulcie coy and friendly beckon Wont you come play with us Julianne In the background the festive tones of a calliope rose and fell and I found myself reminded suddenly of a wonderful memory from my childhood  My siblings and I had been treated to a day at the North Carolina State Fair where my mother had introduced us to a man she knew from antiques auctions  Hed shown us the most glorious old calliope and hed had a real pet monkey named Clayton the Scoundrel  These are the old tricks of angry spirits to tease some memory out of us exploit and make it vile distract good people from good works  I knew this but I longed too for simpler days days when my sister brothers and I were among familiar people in a familiar place days when we were too young and innocent to recognize the darkness in others  Julianne familiar voice from the kitchen prevailed and as I reached for the cool brass doorknob I knew immediately whom I would find on the other side  Aunt Lucia tears stung my eyes but joy filled my heart  Three years she had been gone on the other side only her voice to guide me so much more than most others ever had again of a loved one but now she stood in front of me poised pretty powerful  Emanating from her in golden beams was the very energy she had radiated in life How can this beAunt Lucias smile was warm invitation into the kitchen  Forgive me but I worried you wouldnt get the fudge just right And she laughed at me as others of our family often did  I was neither a baker nor a cook but she is a Kook my sister might have saidThese young ladies have just introduced me to Vassar fudge And now I saw Mary at the island in Seths ultra swank kitchen measuring out white sugar  Across from her stood Dulcie her expression perplexedMiss Lucia wouldnt it all be better with more sugar and perhaps a little more cream she asked but Aunt Lucia only laughed sweetlyWell Sweet Dulcie she began as if she had known Dulcie Moseley for years why dont you tell me  Isnt it a Moseley who sent this recipe to you from Vassar and didnt she help to invent this sweet confection Aunt Lucia had such a way with children always  Never ask a yes or no question she had often told me Always engage a child  If necessary be wrong so that they may be right I remembered this as she winked at me over Dulcies golden headWell no Maam My Aunt Mae did send this but she isnt a Moseley shes a Baker on my mothers side and she and Mary burst into laughter as if her aunts being a Baker who sends fudge recipes was just about the funniest thing theyd ever heardOr she could be a Boiler or a Cook Mary giggled  I watched in some awe as the two girls exchanged looks of pure love deep respect and as my Aunt mitigated whatever memory might endanger this momentary union Now she turned to me expression earnest voice so soft I practically had to read her lips to understand her words Mary is a pip and an angel but theres deep sorrow about her and Dulcie really is a sweet girl good and kind but the anger that rages in her spirit is pure fire You must handle this all very carefully cautiously and you mustnt lose either your temper or your controlThis was the way of the women in my family  Always theyd presume that the younger women were ready for anything too that we could accomplish anything we set our minds to that our minds over mattersathand would sufficeHow did I get myself into this mess I said out loud and Aunt Lucia raised finely sculpted eyebrows as if to ask You mean you dont know and suddenly I was reminded of the walk through the cemetery the prank gone too far the Ouija board Id promised my mother Id never usedHow you came to be in the middle of this is no longer the issue What matters is how you plan to get yourself out And her insistence that I must disengage myself only after my promise to Mary was satisfied was implicit  There really was no other way  Now she only mouthed without even a hint of whisper Dont bring home any hitchhikers and I understood her warning  There are people who live their lives under the shadows of dark sad spirits hitchhikers who will never find their paths home To be under such shadow would be detriment not only to me but also to anyone who loved meBut what do I do I asked Aunt Lucia  And perhaps some answer would have come if only I had been strong enough to hold this lively memory open longer  Instead I felt the collapse of these exhausted spirits in front of me and in moments the vision in the kitchen they had never known had faded  Only red and black trim against the swank white and stainless of the kitchen Seths mother had designed remained or so I thought at first but as I investigated more closely I found the buttery print of a childs right hand smudged where Dulcie had stood only moments before Moving closer to it I thought about tearing a paper towel from the roll that stood upright just beside the sink to press it down for some evidence of this impossible reality when suddenly it combusted to tiny flames and the sizzle against the stainless island carried the salty tingle of tearsThe nature of my gift is such that I cannot press spirits to reveal themselves and even if I could I dont believe I ever would  Instinct dictates that as little engagement as possible is always the best mode and its a rule by which I live my life whenever possible  But I knew Id have to take a more proactive stance to accomplish what we allMary Dulcie and Ineeded and for that Id have to examine the house I thought back to the night before almost literally decades ago considering the journey along which these girls had brought me and the things Seth had told me about the house  I knew for instance that his father had discovered a secret compartment in the study that old photos and tintypes had been stored in the tin handkerchief box found in the wardrobe that stood in his parents room that the hall was part of an elaborate addition to join the kitchen to the rest of the house and that the Ouija board was strictly taboo in the Jefferies household just as it would have been in mine I knew too that the kitchen was not built in  when the house had been and that the original kitchen must have stood just past the rock wall in the farthest portion of the back yard  I did not however know where the Ouija board had come from originally and now I wondered if it had been in the house when the Jefferies had moved in or if it had come into the house with themId have to go to the study to begin my investigation  The notion sickened and worried me but I gathered myself for the inevitable  My mother had long taught me that the most direct way to gain protection from spirits that might harm you was to go to the Big Guy himself  Some might laugh at this but faith was and still is much more than a crutch for me and anyone who believes in the fires of Hell must embrace the comforts of Heaven too  Opening the door to the study I pushed it open so that the door knob bounced lightly against a chair just to the left of it  Colder air pushed into the space right in front of me and I shivered as if I were outside in a snowstorm  Dulcie was here now I knew and she had been waiting for me  Our Father who art in Heaven I began voice bold and strong Hallowed be Thy name The chandelier above the Dr Jefferies broad mahoghany desk swayed slightly at first and then began to spin from the center reminding me of the whirlaround at the park Thy Kingdom Come Thy will be done And now Dulcie laughed with much more depth than a child might have cold echo of the anger that was eating away her soul interrupted to say Im not the Devil Julianne Im only a little girl afterallAnd I strengthened myself for the tantrum I felt welling in her On Earth as it is in HeavenLook at me Julianne And it was all I could do to not make direct eye contact with her but I did see that she was as pretty in what came close to flesh as she had been in the picture innocent and sweet looking and completely mesmerizing in her charming presentation If I had not known what I did if I could not recognize the hate that burned her from the inside out I would have reached to hold her stroked her golden ringlets played dolls or drawn with her just as I would have my own little sister but there was no denying the tenacious embers of her eyes even as I avoided contact with themGive us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us And now her laughter was maniacal sad and laughing all at the same timeForgive us our trespasses she mocked and who is the trespasser here The question hovered between us and then seemed to take on an energy all its own as the accessories on Dr Jefferies desk and the loose items throughout the room rose and began to spin as if convection of Dulcies anger moved themLead us not into Temptation I continued spirit emboldened with every word of the prayer I had known by heart ever since I had been a toddler but deliver us from EvilAnd Dulcies angry laughter swelled to a cackle that rattled the house but then it fell too as the little girl so consumed by anger became increasingly exhausted as I continued for Thine is the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory Forever and Ever AmenI knew the entities that had exploited Dulcies sorrow and loneliness were not dormant and would not give up so easily  Stronger now I added Dear Heavenly Father Give me strength for the challenges I face and cast all unkind mischievous or evil spirits from my presence  Wrap me in your loving arms to protect and fortify me  I ask these things in your name AmenAnd now the room became silent its energy subdued and the objects that had spun around me lowered then settled in relative proximity to where they had been to start  I breathed deep solace and was happy to find new warmth about the room and to detect the spicy scent of candles burned perhaps days ago in the air  For the time being this was a study almost like any other  Now I set my task to discovering its every secret free from interruption for awhileThank you for reading each of these parts that explain an amazing event in my life If you havent been following please find other portions at these

know what to sayMy story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house i lived in a room with my two brothers kyle  at the time and Dylan and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room The first incident occurred after about a year in the house our street was built on a graveyard and happenned in our room it was an ordinary day before it happenned woke up ate breakfast went to school nothing out of the ordinary however when i came home from school that day there was something odd about the house I couldnt quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong But being a kid at the time i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed After my mom turned out the lights and left the room i began to drift off to sleep after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound kind of like if you dropped a frying pan i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed I looked over to Dylans bed at the other side of the room he ws still asleep I began to question if i had actually heard it at all feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake we had a bunkbed Kyle was on top as i was climbing the four step ladder i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground waking up Kylewhat are you doing he saidi heard a noise so i wanted to see ifsshh he stopped me mid sentance and focused his gaze to the back of the room The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan who was still asleep But this figure was definately not human It was at least  feet tall its head was overpoweringly large compared to its beyond anorexic body Its fingers were  inches long minimum From what i saw it wore nothing but it very well could have as it was late at night and i was still half asleep Then the image that will haunt me forever It whatever it was turned towards me and Kyle It just stood there staring at us for what felt like forever it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real I looked at him and back to Dylans bed whatever it as when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylans bed I looked back towards Kyle who was already asleep again and decided to go back to sleep myself not knowing if what wed seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or notWhen i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if theyd seen or heard anything last nightthey didnt So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladderTo this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that nightMy second experience was only four or five years ago a couple of months after moving to Australia We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not it was a pretty average day when it happennedI was  and I was once again in bed at the time I was sharing a room with Dylan  at the time Kyle  was in a room across the hallway Jenny  was the next door down and my parents room was at the end of the hallway It was about  at night and we were all just about asleep My mom and stepfather at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise so it ws just us kids I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed so i opened the door to check I headed towards the kitchen once i reached the living room about halfway to kitchen from my room i could see into the kitchen i slowly emerged from the wall no one thereweird i thought so i headed back to my room but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife I jumped quicker than id ever jumped before Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed I did the same without the laughing I was back in my room now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen I called outKyle go to bed idioti am you fuckwit he said as he emerged from his room half asleepwell then whos upstairs i askedIts probably just a possum in the attic or something dont worryI regretfully closed the door and went back to bed But as soon as i did loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway along with heavy thumping on the walls they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was i shit you not the same tall black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago I practically shat myself It stood there for a couple of seconds but if felts like hours then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room I dont know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room nothing there it vanished again I dropped to the ground in shock just as Kyle open his door and screamed WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT Its back i saidWhats backthe thing i saw hunched over DylanI stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to AustraliaMy most recent encounter with our old friend was last year Wed moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things Wed been living there for about  months and my friend from primary school Jordan was now living in the complex too It was around PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house I was playing my ipod at the time Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan who surprisingly caught it and returned fire but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force We all just stood there speechless not knowing if that had really just happened Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to doThat night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed i was making a late night snack Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs same height same scrawniness same long fingers only this time it was a little misty like a shadow and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairsI am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is all i know is that my mother has become a clairevoyantI know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed the figureFor the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see himher again i will not hesitate to report the time date and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of itfor now redditors i bid you farewell,An old friend of mine,15,nosleep,top_week

dwsrf,3,7,1r8d9t,10,I was reading posts today and was reminded of something that happened to me when I was a kid  It was an average summer day and I was somewhere in my mid to low teens couldnt drive yet  Since it was summertime school was out and like most kids I spent it with friends doing whatever seemed like a good idea at the time  Usually we would go play in the woods or ride our bikes around  That day I decided to call up one of my friends and see if he wanted to hang out  So I picked up the phone and to my astonishment the line was dead  I didnt think much of it because I figured maybe they were working on the lines around my house or something  His house wasnt very far from mine only a mile or two so I decided to just ride my bike over and see himWhen leaving my house the first thing that surprised me was that I didnt see any people or cars around  It was summer in a residential neighborhood so there should have been kids out playing and people going about their daily lives  Again it seemed like a coincidence  As I was riding I remember thinking it was eerily quiet  There was no wind that day which is odd enough in and of itself but the air seemed almost stagnantBeing a kid it didnt seem like much of a problem and at the time it just seemed like a small thing  What I remember most now is that not only were there no people going about their daily business but there was not a single sound from nature  I could hear my bike tires on the road and the sound of the crank and my own breathing but there were no other sounds  No birds no dogs no chirping or buzzing of insectsI got to my friends house and knocked on the door Nothing  I knocked again  NothingThat was just plain odd  He had several other siblings and even though his parents worked I remember thinking that there should have been at least one of them there  At that point I decided that something was definitely off  I rode my bike back to my house as quickly as I could and went up to my room and shut the door  Several hours later my sister came home from work and I went down to talk to her  She asked how my day was and I couldnt bring myself to tell her about the strange events of the afternoon because I figured that it must have all been a coincidence and I was reading too much into it  I went outside and everything seemed normal  Wind blowing kids playing dogs barking  To this day I never figured out what was going on but it was like someone turned a switch and turned off everything but me and then flipped it back and everything was back to normal  Never though much about it until I started reading nosleep  Maybe someone else has an idea of what went on,The day with no sounds,17,nosleep,top_week

bebadhavefun,2,4,1r3ema,11,Hey guys well Im a new user but Ive been reading NoSleep for about a year now though I never felt like sharing my supernatural experiences until now In time Ill post more but I feel the need to start with something that brings tears to my eyes to this dayIt was mid and I was on my winter break my mother was working her night shift and I was alone in the house with my little brother who was  years old at the time At around  AM I started to feel sleepy so I turned off the computer and headed to the bathroom to grab some toilet paper in case my flu got worse during the night As soon as I get to the bathroom I notice two things The first outside it was raining incredibly hard and the second the dog had followed me to the bathroom and was whining softly while he waited for me to come out Being a recently adopted dog Weve had him for a week or so back then I didnt think much of it Maybe hes afraid of the rain I thought as I headed out and closed the doorThat was when I saw it A couple of meters to my left through the half open door that leads to the garden something that made me question my sanity It was acreature I guess Taller than the door frame covered in thick light brown hair that walked in two feet I saw it for a split second before it hid behind the wall I thought I was hallucinating even though Ive never been skeptical so my first impulse was to open the door to see what the hell was that It was the moment my dog got in the way between me and the door shaking whining and showing his teeth at me to keep me away As I said we hadnt had Morrison for too long and I didnt want to get bitten so I backed off to the kitchen trying to wrap my head around what was going on Suddenly the sound of scratching on the walls made me jump It seemed to come from everywhere and Morrison started barking at this I made him shut up and in desperation I grabbed the biggest knife I found in a drawer and stayed there in the middle of the kitchen shaking because of the cold and the situation I wasThe scratching faded in the rain and for a moment I thought everything was alright That until the door swung open and slammed back shut making me jump and run to get the hell out of there and lock myself in my brothers room with the dog still holding the knife tightly I remember hearing soft bangs on the door outside that started to get louder and louder each time and I just covered my ears praying to anyone who could hear me for it to stop But it didntWhen it became too much for me I gained enough courage to go outside and put a couple of chairs against the door just in case When I came back inside leaving every light in the house on a few minutes passed by before I heard a loud bang outside the room I knew that whatever it was was trying to get inside so I opened the bedroom door and looked down the hallway The chairs I had put against the door were knocked down and the door was wide open I could only shake my head in disbelief as I came back to sit on the edge of my brothers bed holding the knife that seemed to be useless by thenI dont know at which point I fell asleep but my mother woke me up at around  in the morning and asked why wasnt I in my room and what was all the mess with the chairs in the hallway I told her she didnt believe me and Im pretty sure Ill never know what the hell was that thingPS Sorry about any mistakes on the writing of this story english is not my first language ,Ill never know,15,nosleep,top_week
IntricateVenom,9,5,1r2dyl,11,Ive known that I have had this ability since I was six Actually it all started when I was sixI can see spirits I see them sometimes like normal people but they have a sort of glimmer to them In all of my encounters I have never been to speak to one but they dont need to their expressions tell me all I need to knowAs I said this all started at the age of six My mother and I moved into an old house that was built in the s There was another house next to it that was a complete mirror image of the one I lived in The history was that the houses were built by two twins One twin was a good man while the other had a sadistic side He was a murderer and he alone had killed around  people in his house which was the one I lived next to To this day around  people have been murdered in that houseAnyway one night I was in my room staring at the ceiling I have insomnia so its quite hard for me to sleep when suddenly I got this immense feeling of anger and fury However the feeling wasnt coming from my house or even from myself but the house next door I got out of bed and looked out the window and I will never forget what I sawStaring out of the window across from me was a man who had to be in his late s His face was contorted into a meanful scowl He was wearing old tattered clothes He was staring right at me right into my very soul Then almost instantly he vanished I started to cry really loud and eventually my mom came running in I told her what had happened but she didnt really believe meFast forward to  Ive been seeing spirits all the time but only when Im tuned in This is the best way I can describe it Its almost like tuning a radio to the right channel Ive found that once I tune in I can see spirits in all kinds of forms and shapes However one night when I was  I found that i can see more than spiritsWhen I was  my friend and I were big into the paranormal and we liked to go to graveyards and such to see what we can find On this day we decided to go to one of the most haunted graveyards in our state  Dice Roads Cemetary There have been lots of people encountering things there so we decided to go Apon arriving there I become overwelmed with a sense of dread sorrow anger sadness and everything inbetween Besides that it looked pretty normal We did some walking some voice recording normal shit and finally we were standing outside the car talking when it happened It was around  in the morning when I saw a shadow move I clicked on the flashlight and moved it over to that spot yet nothing was there I decided at this point to tune in and see what I could find When I was certain I was tuned in I opened my eyes and immediately wished I hadnt In the graveyard floating were a pair of blood red eyes and they were staring right at me They were full of hatred scorn and just pure evil Time seemed to have stopped and I just kept staring at those eyes I couldnt look away Then all of a sudden they rushed forward with lighning speed out of the graveyard and directly through me What happened next is a bit fuzzy I remember feeling all sorts of emotions and having many intricate thoughts Then everything goes black The next thing I know I awake to find my friend knelt down next to me shaking me He said that I had uttered one word before i fell DestroyThe entire ride back i was physically sick to the stomach and had a massive headacheIve never gone back to that place and never will Im  now and Ive gotten a lot better at controlling what I see These are only two of the many stories I have to share but I felt these were thew most important I just wish that I could forget some of the things Ive seen I also hope others are like me and see where Im coming from Im going to keep working on it and use this ability to possibly help othersw in the future ,My Ability,16,nosleep,top_week

SprightlyMonkey,2,7,1r98ph,10,Most people no matter what their age cant really remember many things before the age of  barely anyone can remember most of their life before the age of  I know that my earliest living memory was when I was  when my younger brother was born Its odd that after it all of all the things I couldve remembered its that which is stuck in my mind When after it all I was left with but a notepad with three notes A URL an address and some jottings And thus I take it upon myself to inform you of all that Ive learned in these past few hoursI dont really know who I am any more Im a tall gangly male with long black hair and the only name I have to go on is the pseudonym Im using to convey this message I know that once I was interested in psychology and philosophy These things mixed together to form a fondness for one thing in particular I slowly became obsessed with working out how memories worked why we had them and how they formed Of course you have the scientific answers but thinking back they dont really provide you with much explanation Very very few people if any can remember their birth perhaps the single most important events of your entire life and barely anyone can remember it Dont you think it odd that whilst we remember inconsequential things like our first tooth falling out or how you grazed your knee when falling off your bike you cant remember being born People will put it down to a theory called Childhood Amnesia where adults find it difficult to recall early memories as children havent got fully developed limbic systems But how come there are exceptions to this ruleOf course the answer is I dont know Or more rather as horribly ironic as it is I forgot I know that I did research this I did a load of it In as much detail as I could It was a personal project of mine one I know Id been working on for a long time Again God knows how long I forgot that too It all feels like an eternity ago now considering Ive forgotten it all I suppose that its my own fault considering I brought myself into this I went perusing into areas one shouldve left untouched as far as this transcript can tell me And that has landed me deeper in whatever mire I find myself in than I can assume most others ever have And that scares me Not because I fear for my life definitely not I am literally nothing now with nothing to my name but this notebook and what I am writing here I suppose you want to know what the jottings are Well theyre in two parts The first parts are like stage directions with little annotations in handwriting I can only assume is my own describing the setting presumably so I can find my way back there The second part is a statement A saying or a speech or something So without further ado I shall do my best to relay this scriptI am sat at a bench at my local green Its a cold dark winters evening with heavy air hanging over me Across from me stands a man who is much better equipped for the cold than I Hes wearing a large overcoat with the collar rolled up around his cheeks and a small hat stuck atop his presumably bald head He looks about  the only reason I can tell being the soft amber hue from his cigarette betraying his wrinkles lined with a rushed stubble with awkward tufts slightly bushier than the rest The wisps keep rising up and obscuring my view of his glassy eyes If I didnt know any better I wouldve said he had been crying but thats silly He stands a good inch or so higher than me and makes an effort not to slouch Whenever he speaks to me he addresses me very carefully and politely referring to me as Sir or Mister and making sure to annunciate every syllable as if a single mistake would betray him This makes his speech slow but not staggered he has no difficulty in speaking properly but he is deliberately taking care He isnt particularly stocky but nor is he lanky Hes a perfect medium Hes addressing me gesturing for me to approach him Hes ushering me on now waving his hand as if to say for me to fall in behind him I do so Hes leading me to a flat the address is written here but for your protection I shant be putting it in until I can confirm its safety Its very well kept  rooms All doors are shutHes gone into the room straight ahead of the sofa Im sat on shutting the door behind him Im not sure how but I dont think he noticed thisThis next part is not in the same handwriting as above Its very intricate certainly whoever wrote it took their time There are however mistakes Very obvious mistakes but I cannot figure out what theyre for I think that that may be why I am writing to you now to see if you can assist meDearest Curious Inquirer It is my solEmn duty to regretfully inform you that you have gone far enough in your scour for the true workings of the human mind It is a sincere wasTe of a life lived too litTle for me to have to extingUish but you leave me with no other option You simply have discovered toO much The real worry that I have is that I may have intervened far too late However there is no use in dwelling upon these mistakes They are mine and mine alone I was charged with the protection of your Blood and that is a duty which I can onLy suffer for so long Our exIstence is insufferable at times I can only imagine how yours must be liVing without such core memories so many thIngs that you must hold so dearly important Of courSe you meaning you alone Everyone else is too ignorant to go out and look for that which has been taken from them Theyre Content with the answers theyre provided with acting as if there isnt exemption to the socalled rules One shoe it would appear does not fIt all I truly wish I could reward your innovation I honestly do In as many years I have desired a chase such as this Something I can truly be proud of If you remember one thing which is highly unlikely I want it to be that your childhood is something you have to keep Once its lost its lostThe infinite possibilities of a childs mind is often labelled as immature but tell me can an adult construct a story from but a pen paper and some squiggles Do we consider men like Picasso to be immature and simpleminded How can something so infinite and yet so delicate be incomplete You mislabel it as immaturity when in fact childlike wonder is a blessing A blessing lost to age because it no longer suits you It doesnt fit the world youre entering That is why you are stripped of it We act simply as you askYou brought your lack of memory upon yourself Persist in finding it at your own perilYour SaviourIf you can find any information on

stopped fainting and would be safe at home alone He told me that the first night he couldnt sleep The man in the bed next to him would groan throughout the night in agony He didnt know what was wrong with him but it was too late for a nice chat so he remained silent The second night wasnt much different but Liam managed to sleep for a few hours from about am until around am He hadnt faint for a while and felt he was getting a lot better hoping that he would be able to go home soonLater that day the man in the bed next to him awoke Hi Im Jim He introduced himself What are you in for My brother explained his ear infection and that he had fainted and fallen into things and asked why Jim was hereWell He began I dont really know I was only in here for a broken leg initially Then I fell ill I think theyre keeping me hereWhat How Liam asked When I was close to recovery I told the nurses that I felt ready to go home Later that night I woke up to see a nurse leaving my bed She didnt see me but I noticed that my leg felt funny I think she did something to it I dont know what but the next day I fell terribly ill with pneumonia This was nearly a week ago and im still here not getting much better Dont tell them when youre ready to go home just go His face was dead serious Liam was a bit worried about Jims story but assumed he was a bit crazy and paranoid about the nurses He ignored Jims advice and told the nurse that he was ready to go home He felt the disappointed gaze of Jim fall upon him as the nurse walked awayWell Good luck Jim sighed I hope they let you out Thanks Liam replied The nurse later returned and confirmed that the doctor would look at his ears the following day That night Liam had another restless night Jim was groaning again but Liam was beginning to grow used to that Suddenly the groaning stopped The silence of the night was instead met with the screams of JimAARGHH STOP GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME DONT YOU DARE PUT THAT NEEDLE NEAR ME FUCK OFF the curtain was closed around him Liam couldnt see what was going on He was too scared to speak The curtain swiped open Liam pretended to be asleep his eyes slightly open He saw a nurse leave Jims bed Jim was laying in his bed holding his legs AAre you okay Liam whispered What the fuck just happened I told you man The nurses are keeping me here They saw that I was getting better again and she just stuck a fucking needle in my leg again Im not getting out of here any time soon Jim replied He revealed his leg to Liam  there was a small hole with blood dripping out of it He had indeed been injected with something Liam laid down in shock Jim decided that now the attack was over it was safe to sleep When Liam awoke the following morning Jim was gone Liam asked a nurse where Jim was and the nurse apologetically replied Mr Morris passed away late last night How could that be He was well enough to hold a conversation with Liam just hours earlier to his apparent death The injection It must have been the injection I visited Liam later that day and he told me of the events He begged me to sign him out and get him home that day He was desperate He was not in safe hands there after all I tried to sign him out but the doctor assured me that it was in the best interest to stay one more night to ensure the infection had completely cleared I reluctantly agreed I visited again the next day and Liam was in a terrible state He was pale his face was sweaty He even had a temperature he was in a much worse state to what I had seen him like the day before The doctor told me it was just a side affect of the medicine they had given him Liam told me otherwise They attacked me Kate Thats the only way i can describe it I was pretending to sleep late last night and a nurse came in She rolled me over and prepared my leg for an injection You know what they do they wipe it with some sort of liquid I startled her when I asked her what she was doing She told me it was just procedure I asked her to stop and said that id rather not have the treatment She got aggressive Called another nurse One held me down while she injected me I screamed but nobody came Now all of a sudden Im ill Im not getting out of here Kate Im going to die in this bed Just like Jim He began rocking back and forth as I tried to comfort him He was soaked with sweat I asked his doctor what was wrong with him and the doctor told me it was pneumonia My heart sunk It was just like Jim Liam was right  he wasnt safe here I needed to get him out Ill be back tomorrow to get you out of here I told Liam They wont let me today and now that they have a clue that I want to get you out theyre all watching me I was almost escorted out when I shouted at the doctor Tomorrow I can do it quietly when im not being watched so closely Liam agreed The following day I returned to the hospital Liam told me the nurse had not returned that night I put him in a wheelchair and took him to the toilets I gave him some clothes that I had collected from his apartment and he changed I asked a nurse to bring me any belongings he had left with the desk stating that he had asked me to take them home for him The nurse agreed and brought me his things without a word We escaped and I took him home Before leaving we slyly stole the sign out clip board and Liam was able to sign it He was legally free Three days later Liam was found dead in his apartment The pneumonia had gotten worse and without treatment took his life He left a note It read I was taken into the hospital with an ear infection I left without said ear infection but with bigger problems I was abused I have made a realization either the secret injections being given are procedures to keep population down or they are ways to make medicine companies money After all they make money through our illness  they dont really want us to recover I would not advise anyone who is not dying to stay in a hospital  definitely not alone There you will never truly be in safe hands,In safe hands,19,nosleep,top_week
AfterYourHeart,0,11,1r7cv5,7,This is an update from herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrpodeadendsOk I have a little bit of time Im not sure when theyll be back so I have to be carefulThat day the day Pugsley died Joe and I talked about it after Sophia had gone to bed He swore he didnt leave the window open He always had an encyclopedic memory remembering the tiniest little things about just about everything so I believed him I know I didnt open the window I also know that when I left to pick up Sophia I had to undeadbolt the front door Joe quickly went down to check the back door Also locked We decided to just drop it and we went to sleep If I remember correctly I didnt sleep well that nightI wish Joe would come visit me They said I could have visitors occasionally if I was well behaved It sure does get lonely in here I mean there are others but man do they have issues Id rather just keep to myself At least I have my art They even let me try to sell it well rather they let an art gallery try to sell them and occasionally someone buys one I plan on putting these letters in the back of one whenever this is finished Hey Maybe thats how youre reading this If so thank you for buying my art I hope you enjoy itI remember the day I painted my daughters eighth birthday portrait I had never tried such a thing before but she was so beautiful that I had to at least try Her hair was blonde and getting quite long She liked to straighten it She had the look that screamed head cheerleader queen bee but I always hoped she grow up to be a scientist or an engineer She was so smart With her smile she could get away with murder She was missing a few teeth at the time and a few more were still growing back That just made her even cuter Looking at her was like looking into the heart of your childhood She always made me feel young I loved going on adventures with herThe day I painted her I needed her to sit still for a while and I wanted to try and make it fun for her I wanted to paint her smiling not bored out of her mind The first step was music She loved music and she loved to sing She was pretty good at it too Then I came up with a great idea I got her her own easel canvas and paints and figured we could paint together Id help her figure out what she wanted to paint and get her started and then Idl paint herJust thinking about that day helps me almost remember what its like to be happy We had so much fun We listened to music sang and danced a bit painted she decided to paint me back and talked about just about everything She told me all about her new school and the friends she was making She was such a people person People were drawn to her and always wanted to be around her Looking at her it astounded me how quickly she was growing When did she get so tallAt the end of the day we did our reveal I showed her my painting and she showed me hers I have to admit I was pretty impressed by hers Looks like artist could be added to the list of things she could be when she grew up We decided wed hang them together in the hallway once they had dried I wasnt quite ready for the day to be over so after we cleaned up I took her out to eatJoe got home after Sophias bedtime I proudly took him to the spare room to show off our paintings I turned on the light and Joe laughed I screamed I explained to Joe that I didnt do this That when Sophia and I had gone to dinner it was just a normal portrait That someone else mustve come in and painted over the original painting altering it He stood silently staring at me for a moment Like he was trying to figure out if this was some kind of weird prank He then kissed me on the forehead told me we would figure this out later and went to watch a movie After he walked away I turned back to look at the paintingWhoever had done it had blackened out her eyes They had also paled her skin and given her deep circles under her eyes It reminded me of a picture I had seen when I looked up blackeyed kids I made the mistake of looking it up at work and the picture had stunned me so badly that I immediately drew all the blinds and curtains in the place and covered all the windows I am usually not that much of a chicken but for some reason that picture had a serious effect on me and now there I was staring at my daughter turned into a blackeyed kid I quickly destroyed the painting I never showed it to Sophia She had been so excited to see a painting of herself The next few days were her scheduled days to stay at her dads so I decided to try to repaint it The duplicate was pretty good Not quite as good as the original but it was pretty closeThe next morning I went to check on the duplicate and it had been ripped to shreds I showed Joe but he shook it off This time he was convinced that it was some kind of joke He swore he wasnt falling for it Then he went off to work I sat and cried for a while burned the painting and tried one last time This time I hid the painting and this time the painting stayed safeOk Its almost meds time I better hide this again I hate the meds they give me They make me feel so weird I dont even know what day it is anymore,Dead Ends,18,nosleep,top_week
NightOfTheLlamas,4,8,1r6rmn,11,There are few things that drive me mad I dont even understand why they get me so worked up in the first place Im not OCD or anything of the sort Its just that I cant stand things such as the sliding door when it is open It should be closed at all times The door is just a small problem compared to my shower It drips At first I could turn the shower handle and the dripping would come to an end It was inconvenient at times because I would stop whatever I was doing to shut up the drip drip drip Sometimes my food would burn slightly or I would miss a phone call cause I was busy pushing around the handle to end the sound I really dont mind though because it ended that cursed dripping and thats all that really matters to me It got worse When I turned the handle to end the sounds it would start up again randomly later I would be watching Netflix or reading a good book when I hear drip drip drip It doesnt ever end All through the day the shower leaks water out in a steady rhythmic beat It drives me crazy After a week or so I couldnt handle the sounds anymore I couldnt handle the drip drip drip I bought a new shower head thinking that would solve the problem After setting it up I blew out a breath of relief The dripping would finally end now I ate dinner that night happy I closed the open sliding door before settling myself on the couch with my laptop I was on Netflix and about half way through my show I heard something Drip drip drip Covering my ears with my hands didnt stop the sounds from making their way to my brain I could still hear it I tried everything I could think of I called the plumber but that did nothing I wrapped a rag around the shower head That worked until the rag started to drip from all of its water build up I also took the rag and placed it at the bottom of the shower hoping that it would mute the dripping sounds This worked yet it didnt I could no longer hear the dripping but I could feel the drops of water slamming against the rag In the end I just spent as little time in my own home as I could There was no way to be bothered by the shower if I wasnt even inside of the house This worked until I had to go home and try to sleep Which ended up with me not getting a wink of sleep I would stare up at the ceiling with my eyes unblinking just listening to the shower leak I would pray in my head that this torture would end somehow  I stopped sleeping in my home I hated going to that place Whenever my feet hit the floorboards of that house it was as if at that moment the shower started to leak again I slept at a friends house She never asked questions as to why I wished to stay with her That was something I was dearly grateful forIt has been a few weeks since I started to live here I havent felt this much peace in a while I was heading to the kitchen for a glass of water It was almost midnight and the sky was pitch black As I walk down the halls towards the kitchen I freeze To my left was the bathroom door Through the wood I could hear a soft drip drip drip ,Drip Drip Drip,19,nosleep,top_week

BOATSSnHOESSS,2,1,1rdzvd,10,So when I was  my love was having a bonfire on Saturday nights Although one thing did change thatI live in way out in the country part of town so having a fire was usual hearing coyotes were usual and that sort of thing So this night me and my friends decided we were going to stay out in a tent tonight so me and my friend allen went in my house to get blankets and food This is when I knew something was wrong a sudden sense of dread came over me as we returned outside to my friend Ryan and Cory running towards us screaming bloody murder Cory explained what he had heard he said something made a noise sounding almost like a panther I went back to the fire leading the pack when i turn on the spotlight i luckily grabbed just in case and began sweeping across the woodline thats when i spotted it It was a grotesque pure white creature with hollow black eyes staring at us I was petrified out of fear My friends ran away back into my house I stayed I couldnt move an inch Then it began crawling at me on all fours but there was something wrong with it Its arms were almost backwards on its arms Then it screached at me Ill never forget that horrible sounding scream It made me think of death Thats when I decided I needed to get the hell out of there I began running back to my house unaware of where the creature is I looked back to see it crawling right behind me Thats when i saw its face and claws Its mouth was filled with jagged sharp teeth and the claws were not animal like almost like someone carved bone into a razor sharp knife I gained speed and jumped over the fence at full speed causing me to fall I got up and screamed and starting waving my arms as if the creature were a bear then I realized it was gone I walked back home and told my parents They didnt believe me thoughBut to this day  years later I have no clue what this creature was or wanted,Louisiana Demon,11,nosleep,top_week
kenandmforever,1,2,1rc5s5,9,Hey guys Longtime lurker first time posterI guess I finally have something to post about Everythings just been wrong the past few weeks I miss her so much I know this isnt a therapy subreddit or anything but I was just thinkingmaybe if I can get these thoughts out theyll stop bothering me Its just I should have been paying attention you know I should have seen something was wrong But I didnt and now shes gone and its all my faultI guess I should start at the beginning She was my first serious girlfriend  Ill call her M to protect her privacy Last thing I would want is her family finding out Im talking about this on some site for thousands to see Anyway M and I worked together at a tutoring place on campus It was my first job and I was nervous but she helped me figure everything out M was really shy  she could almost never meet my eye and her voice was superquiet  but really sweet once I coaxed her into talking I got the impression she didnt think too highly of herself whenever I tried talking to her about her major or anything shed change the subject All I really got was that she was a Bio major and she was working on some research project about some new cestoda whatever that meant But she liked hearing about me and my major  English Ive never been scienceinclined  and laughed at my jokes and everything so we had a good timeAfter our shifts were over wed go to the Subways down the street sometimes I would always offer to get her something but she always turned me down She would just watch me eat while we sat together It always made me feel kinda bad especially since she was so small it was like eating in front of an African kid or something But she never seemed to mind so I got over it We became good friendsEventually I asked her out for dinner and a movie I cant even remember what we saw  some remake horror flick about mindcontrolling carnivorous worms or something  but we had a good time We were laughing through the whole thing and she kept pointing out the impossibilities and throwing all her science knowledge around I dont want to sound weird but I found it pretty hotBut by the time we got back to the car she had stopped smiling She said she didnt feel too good like she was sick or something She said she wanted to walk back to her apartment  she lived just off campus and was really big into fitness and everything  but it was like twenty minutes away and in the middle of the night so I drove her home She got out said goodnight and that was it No kiss nothingI went home thinking I had blown it but when we had the same shift again she was really happy Kept saying shed had a great time and everything So we went out on a few more dates I let her pick what we did  she never wanted to go out to eat but she did teach me how to ice skate and we went on a few hikes even some k runs Those were the worst but it was worth it to see the way she lit up At the end of each one I kept wanting to kiss her but she was really sheepish about it Every time I went in for one shed turn her head or peck me on the cheek before I could She was always embarrassed about it and apologized but I figured she just wasnt ready she didnt seem the type to have done a lot of dating herself That was fine I wasnt going to rush her into anythingThe first time we kissed was like three weeks after we started dating  and I wont say anything but wow At this point I realized I was completely head over heels for this girl She was smart she was funny and she liked me which was different from most girls We started going steady after that  and thats when everything started changing The signs that something was wrong had been present before but they really should have become apparent afterwards God Im so stupidShe started wearing big baggy clothes to work  huge stifling sweaters that sort of thing I wondered if one of the guys at work was hitting on her or something and making her uncomfortable but they were all either huge or really friendly and I didnt want to ask She would shake sometimes too like she was cold even when she was being swallowed up by these enormous shirts Id hug her and shed lean into me but it was like I couldnt even feel her underneath the clothes She started eating a lot Like I mean a ton When we went to Subway now shed put away two footlongs like it was nothing I took her out to a few ritzy places but the portions were always too small so we would end up getting burgers or something afterwards I didnt really mind  it was nice to see that she felt comfortable enough to stuff herself around me I guess We were kissing a lot more too which was of course awesome Because of her I was into hiking and stuff now so I felt great Everything seemed perfect Maybe thats why I wasnt noticing the signsI stayed over at her place a few times as things got more serious but we never went too far She was still embarrassed about that sort of thing I think  but that was fine I could wait Her couch was still infinitely better than my dorm bed anyway and her fridge was always heaped with food  mostly meat granted but Im no vegetarian Despite all her eating though she seemed to be getting thinner Her face was paler and she was more withdrawn Sometimes she would just stare into space for half an hour at a time not saying anything only to shake herself as I touched her or called her name a few times She started calling into work sick and when I visited her she would just be curled up on her couch heaped in blankets the remnants of some sandwich or a pizza box scattered around her I started to get worried but I wasnt worried enoughOnce when we were making out for a moment I felt something more than just her tongue in my mouth The feeling didnt really leap out at me  it was just a sort of niggling sensation swallowed up by everything else that was going on  but I kinda stopped and she drew back and looked at me with curiosity I swallowed ran my tongue around my mouth a few times but decided I had just imagined it Then she asked what was wrong and something flickered in her eyesI dont mean that in a poetic Englishmajory way I mean I literally thought I saw something tiny dart through her eyeI freaked out needless to say but she was just confused She said she didnt feel anything and even when I shined a light on her eye to see for sure there was nothing there I thought I was just going a little bit crazy so she went to bed and I stayed on the couch I shouldnt have dismissed it I should have taken her to the doctor Damn it why didnt IThings got worse She stopped coming into work entirely and I began taking time off to go make sure she was okay Her staring into space was more pronounced than before as was her shaking When she got up and walked around it was disjointed like she had forgotten how to use her body And she kept asking for food all the time At first it was just sandwiches then it was hamburgers then it was just the burger itself Then once she asked if I could just give one to her rawI was taken aback disgusted but she just looked so pitiful shrinking into her bed with all her pillows and everything fluffed up around her So I did Well I cooked it a little but it was still plenty pink in the middle when I brought it to her She ate the whole thing gave me a sleepy smile and fell asleepI went back to my couch silently freaking out It was all too weird for me Id never heard of anything like this Id heard about feeding a cold and starving a fever or whatever but this was ridiculous I decided I was going to take her to the doctor the next morning whether she wanted to go or notBut when the morning came she wasnt in bed I could hear the shower running in her bathroom Frankly I was a bit surprised she could even manage to walk that far as weak as she seemed But I decided Id give her some space if she was showering maybe she was feeling betterI decided Id go and make myself a sandwich When I came back the shower was still running which was weird It had been more than thirty minutes  I had ended up making myself a second sandwich and had eaten a hot dog too I was just weirdly hungry Anyway by now I was a little concerned I had no idea how long she had been in there before I had woken up and she wasnt the kind to take really long showers anywayM I called opening the door a crack You okayNo responseMStill nothing God the sound of the water hitting her is still in my headI stepped inside The steam was almost blinding there was a window she usually opened to let most of it out but it was closed MI pulled back the curtain and there she was sprawled on the tile blood pooling around her fractured skull her eyes gazing sightlessly upwards as the rain pelted her naked body But that was not the worst part The worst part was that she looked like a skeleton I still remember those pictures of the Holocaust victims we all see in high school where they look more dead than alive that was exactly what she looked like She was so painfully thin it was a wonder she had managed to walk on her matchstick legs at all Her ribs looked like they were about to poke through her skin But her bellythat was round and full like the distended ones you see in those images of African children on the charity commercials I knelt by her but of course there was nothing I could do She was long gone She must have collapsed and hit herself on the temperature knob on the way down It didnt look as though she had struggled at all she would have died almost instantlyI stayed there for a long time just staring A few times I thought I saw her stomach move  but of course that was crazy It was just the way the water hit her Then in a daze I left I called   even though it was far past that now obviously  and explained what had happened The lady on the phone promised to send a cops and an ambulance my way immediately even though there was no needThen I sat down and made some baconI cant even really remember what happened when they arrived There were just people swarming all over my house suddenly Two big cops started asking me questions I dont really remember what I said They kept asking me why I was eating and I just kept repeating that I was hungry over and over One said I needed to go to the station with them so I didWhile I was there they wouldnt give me any food not even a bag of chips no matter how much I asked They kept asking me how I couldnt have known she was starving how I couldnt have known something was wrong over and over and over All I could say was that I didnt know Shed hidden it all from me with her huge clothes and thick blankets I kept saying if I had known I would have helped her I would have saved her Now I know she was too far gone for that of course I hadnt seen the signs in time and it was too lateEventually they let me go Later in the day someone called her apartment but I didnt pick up A doctor I think or maybe a coroner They left a message Something about her stomach It sounded important but I couldnt bring myself to listen again I wandered around her apartment for hours touching everything that had belonged to her as if it would bring her back As if I could take back her mistakes and mineShe must have had some sort of eating disorder I guess Looking back the way she acted when we first met sounds like classic anorexiabut then it must have changed into something else I dont know Maybe she was eating a lot and then throwing it up  Ive heard about that on TVSometimes I cant help but think back to her stomach how swollen it had been how deformed I have no idea what could have caused that But it doesnt really matter now does it Shes dead and its my faultIm sorry guys Theres not a whole lot else I can say The past few weeks have just been awful They kept it out of the news but somehow people keep asking me about it anyway wondering why I didnt do something why I didnt see I dont know Ive just been living in a daze since it happened like I cant feel anything at all Nothing seems right Sometimes my hands kinda jerk on their own when Im just zoning out I keep waking up in the middle of the night feeling like Im starving but I think Ive been losing weight Grief probably Ive heard it can do that to you I really dont know I just kinda wish it would endAgain Im sorry This is a lot to dump on you all but I just have to get it out Im going to

RayAllenLovecraft,0,8,1r7jhu,8,A rather peculiar incident happened not too long ago on a cold rainy night  It was a little past  am when I left my friends house  Its a old Victorian house in a once thriving town  As I was driving down the empty road I saw a taxi cab in a left turn lane  I was able to see its lights from about a mile away  The green glow shined through the mist and created this aura on the surprisingly empty street  This is not uncommon in a large town such as this but the thing that puzzled me is where it was turning into  The taxi was turning into a mental institution for the criminally insane  This event happened to startle me because it was so early in the morning  I continued to drive home wondering why someone was being released so early  The next day I went to school  My school is only a stones throw away from the mental hospital  As I walked out of my last class I saw a familiar glow  It was that green taxi again  I didnt think much of it being a college I see taxis picking up people all the time  As I hiked across the parking lot and got into my car I noticed it was still there  I didnt really pay much attention to it because classes can run pretty late maybe someone was taking there time walking through the campus  As I tore out of the parking lot I noticed it wasnt there  Maybe the driver got pissed and left  I met up with some friends from class at a Mexican restaurant down the street  As we were waiting for our food I told them about the coincidence that happened the night before and what just happened in the parking lot  My friend whose family had lived in the area for a long time told me more about the mental institution  He told me about how they once tested drugs on the patients and preformed lobotomies up until the s  The room was dead silent  Luckily our food came out shortly after the disturbing conversation  When we finished eating we talked more about it  I was becoming obsessed with it  Why was it there so late Who where they picking up  Was it the same taxi Our conversation was cut short when the bill came to the table  We were too busy counting our singles and change we are college students to be talking about the mental hospital  We stepped outside and had a cigarette before we would part ways  We were standing in a empty parking lot at around  pm when we noticed something out of the ordinary  We saw the green taxi picking someone up at the restaurant across the street  It was just parked there  We abruptly said goodbye and got into our cars  I drove home without stopping  The next night at dinner I told my parents what has been going on  They didnt believe that a green taxi has been following me around  Days and days passed and I continued to see the taxi again  I was getting really paranoid  I started to take days off of school to avoid seeing it  My parents were deeply concerned with my behavior and suggested that I see a psychologist  I mustered up the courage and drove there myself after all I am a college student  I couldnt concentrate on the road  I was afraid that I would see it again  I was so bent out of shape I accidentally ran through a red light while making a right turn  I heard somebody laying on their horn  I was shocked to see who I pulled out in front of  It was the green taxi  I raced to the psychologist  I ran as fast as I could into the office  The councilor was frightened by my actions  She took me into her office to hide me from the other patients  I told her everything She was gravely concerned with my state  She suggested that I be admitted  My heart dropped I started to break out in a cold sweat  She left the room to make a phone call  I assumed that she was notifying my parents that I was being taken in  She talked to me for a few more minutes until she got a call  Once she hung up she told me my ride was here  I was puzzled  She walked me out of the building and told me she called a cab  I froze  I looked out the glass doors and saw the green taxi parked in front of the exit  I broke out into a violent fit thrashing and resisting  I was not getting in there  Two security guards restrained me and started to drag me in the cab  We were driving down the same street that I first saw it on  We got into the left turn lane and entered through the opened gates  I gotta cut this short  My computer time is up  The hospital only gives you an hour a day I hope you enjoyed the story  Take care,The Green Taxi,16,nosleep,top_week
hornetandthefly,2,10,1r1jea,7,I had two glasses of wine while my clothes were in the drier and fell asleep on the couch around eleven I woke up at threethirty with all the lights on it was raining out I love falling asleep to the rain I tried to drift back to sleep despite feeling completely awake I never felt the sleep pass over me but eventually I began dreaming In my dream I was giving my manager a ride home It was dark and quiet in the city and I was jokingly pretending to be asleep while I was driving I had my head leaning back on the head rest and my bottom jaw was slack so my mouth was open But then I felt that I was stuck that way So he started nudging my right shoulder to make me wake up I felt panic in my dream Thats when I came out of that dream and back into my living room where I was asleep on the couch My mouth still agape my eyes still closed I was short of breath That is when I realized that I still felt the nudging sensation Now however it was coming from behind the couch cushion against my right shoulder I could feel and hear the cushion pushing me back and forth on my couch It then felt like I was fully awake and the nudging stopped for a second I took a second to let myself feel afraid The nudging began again but now there was an orchestra of movements all around on my couch The cushions under my feet were being pulled upward in short little beats and the left side of my pillow was doing the same thing I felt and heard the blanket next to my right ear moving like it was trying to tickle my face and ear I allowed these hallucinations to feel real and as soon as I gave in to their reality I felt the sides of my pillow begin to curl up and over my face My heart began racing my breaths were shallow and I still was unable to move or wake myself up The pressure of the pillow on my face increased until it felt like I couldnt breath I was sinking into my couch the pressure was on my entire body now I knew I had let my fear fuel this hallucination for too long I took a giant gasp of air and woke up I didnt know how to prove to myself that I was truly awake so I stayed sitting upright with the lights on and opted out of sleep for the night ,My dreams wont let me sleep,17,nosleep,top_week

schizoidvoid,2,4,1rc47v,7,Thank all of you whove been with me so far I am actually really grateful to have an audience weve been chasing the white rabbit for three days now Lets get weird shall weThe introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroductionPart   ConvergencehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsruhthesilverladypartconvergenceFuck that You need a hospital said my Dad as he arced the car across the road onto the shoulder and back into the opposing lane headed to the center of town I was smushed against the door and then the back of my seat as he gunned the accelerator giving the engine a run for its money and losing traction briefly in the process My heart hammered in my chest and shocks of adrenaline coursed through my body This was it I was dying My mom my sister both dead Now it was my turn Two minds swam around inside my skull like binary stars poised to collapse together They took turns rocking back and forth faster and faster each feeling the pull of the other as they battled for control of my body Faster and faster approaching singularity vibrating my perspective like an engine in a car numbing my face and fingertips Black encroached upon my vision as I drowned in fresh air and then all was darkness appendix looks alright Given her recent loss and the trauma she must have experienced witnessing the crash its likely she had a panic attack Has this happened beforeNo never I opened my eyes I inhaled Sickness and death coated the inside of my nostrils I pictured my sinuses and lungs darkening as though I was inhaling smoke from an electrical fire Yellowed fluorescence glared down at me from the ceiling Misery seeped into my pores and tugged my heart in several directions at once Someone nearby was about to die and so many were sufferingI heard beeping and someone yelled for a crash cart Right on timeI was alive and I was myself But the definition of myself had changed I felt distinctly like one person yet knew that I consisted of two beings We had fused together the silver lady and I and I was equal parts both I examined my skin its ghostly sheen A greenish corkscrewshaped worm drifted over my bed briefly silhouetted against the glow of the fluorescent lights and sighed dreamilyWell that was differentOh thank Christ youre awake my dad halfsobbed lurching toward my side and away from the doctorIm fine Dad I think I had a panic attack A small purple leechlike thing with white spots had attached itself to his face while I was talking and slurped at a tear that had just trickled past It shivered ecstatically and began purringI thought you were dying I just  it would have been too much he said brushing another tear off and inadvertently dislodging the leechkitten thing It screeched and flitted away with a farting noiseI consulted my expanded library of memories  from when I was the silver lady Strange and very hungry creatures loved to gather at hospitals They fed off the dying the vulnerable the grieving It seemed to be a drug for many of the darker things in the world I mused to myself that fire was used to keep those pests away before it was used to cook meat People were so much more in tune with reality before language let the mind shape perceptionThe doctor checked me over and kept me awhile for observation Dad and I left with a small prescription of Xanax and a referral to a local therapist I knew I wouldnt be needing either now but also that it would reassure my dad to go I couldnt think of anything I wouldnt do to make him feel better and mentally shruggedI wanted to go pick up my car but Dad would have none of it His tone told me that hed rather walk through Hell than let me out of his sight right now and I couldnt blame him We went straight home and I stared out the window in fascination A herd of giant spotted fuzzy caterpillars were crawling across the road on the way out of town wiggling phallic appendages on their backs quivering with the motion We rolled the car straight through the middle of them and several popped with a glurping sound like balloons full of soft pulpy pudding A tall lanky semitransparent humanoid was licking the red paint on a stop sign several miles later with a blue fuzzy tongue the size of my dads knobby hands It paused when we pulled up and stepped over to the car in two long strides I was slightly embarrased to notice before it stooped over that its wrinkly penis was the size of my forearm I stared into one set of its chameleonlike eyes and smiled its other eyes were flitting around and examining the car It licked the window leaving a slimy trail that lingered until we were nearly homeThe vast majority of the spiritual wildlife that hides in plain sight is harmless or mostly so I knew Extremely weird and illogical yes but for the most part its interactions with the world we know are trivial Hardly surprising that we dont see much of it considering the human desire for an orderly world was a tiny sixarmed ape just fucking my ear canal or did that song get stuck in my head on its own No no earfuckers here no sirMy dad and I were both exhausted when we reached the house I broke off to the kitchen while dad meandered to the living room I popped open the freezer looking for my jumbosized tub of neapolitan ice cream and was greeted by a tiny pixielike critter with the head of a fly It burst out of the freezer and shook its tiny segmented fist shivering hard enough to affect its flightSorry I thought at it as though I had been telepathic my whole life Which technically I suppose I had beenDamn right it thought back It shot me the middle finger and buzzed off phasing through the solid glass window and toward the treelineYeah spirits are like that sometimesI grabbed my tub of ice cream and a spoon because this was not a day for diets I marched into the living room and plopped down beside my dad who was just settling down himself He turned the television on and it was set much louder than it needed to be I jumped and so did the shadowy figure in the corner It began screaming bloody murder Shocked I mentally yelled at it to quiet down but I apparently didnt get through Dad almost immediately turned the television down but the figure only screamed louder and my ears began to hurt I silently tried to reason with it for fifteen minutes to no avail In exasperation I asked if it wanted some ice cream and to my great delight it quieted down I took the tub back into the kitchen shadow man in tow and scooped out a spoonful of icecream into a little saucer which I sat in the sink I wasnt really sure what it was going to do with frozen dessert but I didnt really care as long as it was quiet about it I grabbed my bottle of Xanax off the counter and tipped a couple into my palm because it was most definitely a day for anxiolytics I tossed them back and swallowed dry and then went back into the living room taking my tub The living silhouette stayed behindDad left the station on the news until it mentioned the crash and then he channel surfed for awhile Between the sedatives and the ice cream I wasnt paying much attention I whittled the strawberry down to almost nothing and then half of the chocolate before I realized I was really full and put the tub back up The shadow man was gone and the ice cream in the saucer had warmed and melted I mentally shrugged for the second time that day which reminded me I needed to set up the therapy appointment I grabbed the sheet of paper with the name and number on it called and scheduled an appointment The earliest they had was about two and a half weeks from then and would probably last an hour and a half and could I please come early to get the paperwork filled out I said I would and thank you very much then hung up I wrote the appointment down on the fridge calendar so I wouldnt forgetI chuckled softly to myself I was Alice falling down the rabbit hole I needed a shaman not a shrink but I doubted either one could help me and I thought back to the memories of my mothers death of the wound in the world that had taken her away from me I saw it over and over again each time the person was different and so was the setting The memories stretched back to antiquity to the times before the written word before hatred took the form of words at all I knew that specter so well To call it the devil would be misleading To call it evil an oversimplification I felt righteous fury well up inside me a gift of the silver lady a pure singleminded longing for cleansing fireAnd then I felt the distinct impression that somewhere dark and far away an eye had opened and turned its gaze on meI heard the voice as an echo carried on the wind from across a great chasmMy Sarah How youve grownThe

know why they think Im so dangerous I swear Ive never hurt anyone in my life nor would I Thats why Im writing this Im hoping that if I write it all down someone anyone will read it and understand my

missing Who knows maybe Im just writing this all down to help myself understand but where do I even begin Well I supposed I already mentioned the day everything changed so I may as well start thereSadly for a day that sent my life into a quick downward spiral to hell I dont really remember much about it Not the date Not the weather I could barely tell you the month I can tell you this It was night well I guess it could have been really early morning I was working third shift at the time and I know I was at work I was cleaning I was cleaning the bathrooms more specifically I had just gotten done with the upstairs bathroom and was getting ready to clean the downstairs bathroomBefore I go on I should mention that at the time I was working in a foster home for teens with mental and physical disabilities Since I mainly worked nights my main tasks were light housework some dinner prep for the next day and mainly stay awake and make sure nothing happened to the boys during the night It was a pretty easy job as there were only two boys at the time one  and one  who for the most part slept through the night Anyway where was I Oh  yes That night I had finished cleaning the upstairs bathroom and was about to go clean the downstairs bathroom when I noticed the light in the garage was on Thats weird I knew when I got there at the beginning of my shift that I walked up the driveway and as it was already dark out I would have noticed if it were on and it would have bugged me until I turned it off Im a stickler for not leaving the lights on I know that I was deep in thought as I walked up Maybe I was so distracted that I didnt notice I have been known to wander off in my own little world from time to time Then again maybe my boss left it on after I had already gotten thereI decided that I better go check it out After all protector to the boys was also part of my job and the phone was on the way to the door I grabbed the phone dialed  and put my finger on talk ready to push it if something went wrong Since its a landline if I do call and cant talk heaven forbid dispatch will still be able to know the address and send a car out to check I crept slowly to the garage door Ill admit I was terrified I probably should have called anyway just to be on the safe side I made it to the garage slowly opened the door and peeked my head out Empty I gasped as I released the breath I didnt know I was holding Still holding the phone just in case I checked the back garage door Locked I let out a small chuckle as I started to relax and I headed back into the house making sure to lock the garage door and turn off the light on my way back inCrap I noticed when I walked back in that in my stupid terror I had left the bathroom light on Sigh At least I could use the exercise I joked with myself on the way back down the hall I think I was still feeling really foolish for how worked up I let myself get When I turned into the bathroom a scream of terror got trapped in my throat so hard that I passed outI came to on the bathroom floor I was a little achey in a few spots but considering how hard I mustve fallen on bare tile it could have been way worse Lucky for me my head landed on the bath rug next to the shower although there was a bit of a ringing sound in my ears It either went away or I got used to it quickly  because after a moment I didnt even notice it I slowly got up and checked out what startled me into fainting for the first time in my life The mirror had writing on it I looked closer The writing was orange Orange marker Washable Weird Why would someone choose orange marker That just seems like an usual choice I mean I know there were markers in the linen closet next to the bathroom but who would look in a linen closet for writing utensils I mean its just not what I would expect writing on the mirror to be written withWow I cant believe I can get so sidetracked even at a time like this Focus Mirror Orange marker weird Writing Maybe one of the boys did it Well of the two only one of them was verbal and literate His bedroom was just down the hall The other boy had his room in the basement It was a fully finished basement that was remodeled specifically for him He had pretty severe Autism and didnt speak or write I checked my phone Not that much time had passed while I was on the floor I decided to go down the hall and check to see if Gabe was still awake I knew that if he had written it hed be giggling in his room waiting for a reactionI opened his door and turned on his light He was sound asleep Even though he was faceup he didnt even flinch when I turned on the overhead light Now trust me as the person who took care of him most nights and got him up and ready for school in the morning I could tell when he was faking sleep I also knew in general how long it took him to fall asleep There was no way he wrote thatI walked back to the bathroom After looking again I couldnt help but think it couldnt have been Gabe His hand writing is atrocious The handwriting on the mirror was fairly neat feminine almost and slightly familiar Again I couldnt help but shake off a weird feeling and again I should have called  I guess I didnt want to be the one that had to call the cops while working which I found stupidly embarrassing So after a quick yet terrifying search of the house revealed no one else and all the doors and windows locked I cleaned off the mirror first reading it one last timeMary had a little lamb little lamb little lambMary had a little lamb and she threw it out the windowThe window the second story windowI couldnt help but say it in the singsongy way that my grandpa had originally taught it to me It was a silly twist you could put on the right part of any nursery rhyme to make it even sillier He taught it to my sisters cousins and I to keep us entertained on long car rides Sometimes wed pass it along to any friends who happened to have come with although we quit doing it by time I was  or  so I dont think I was friends with anyone any longer that would have learned the song with usI watched TV in the living room for the rest of that shift trying to distract myself It didnt work at all and I jumped out of my skin at every noise When my boss got there I blamed illness on my incomplete chore list She believed me as I had never before not finished them and she wished me better as I hurried offWhen I got home I curled up with my fiance and somehow managed sleep Then again I always felt safe in his arms When he got up to leave he quietly kissed me goodbye As he slipped out the door I slipped back to sleepI remember I woke up before my alarm For some reason I was cold I peeked one eye open and noticed Pugsley was gone Oh well He sleeps when daddy sleeps I cant expect him to sleep when I sleep too I also noticed that Joe had left the window open again Man I hate it when he does that Now I get to lay here and debate whether or not its worth getting up and closing the window before my alarm goes off I decide quickly that if I close the window now I can still jump back in bed and snooze for a little bit longer before the alarm but when I got to the window sleep was the last thing on my mindThere on the sidewalk below was Pugsley The dog Joe Sophia my daughter and I had gotten together upon getting this new apartment Joe had been so happy about having our bedroom on the second story As I looked down many thoughts flooded my head One more than the rest the window the window the second story windowI put the dog in a small box then double bagged the box with plastic bags and put it in the garage freezer After all I still had to pick up Sophia from school I would try to figure out what to tell Joe and Sophia on the way thereTheyre coming Crap Theyre coming to check on me I have to hide this I dont want them to find it If Im never able to continue just know one thing I AM NOT CRAZYUpdateI was able to get out at least one more

WELVAERT,5,10,1r17ja,5,EDIT Some spelling mistakesHey guys Im going to tell three real and inexplicable occurrences that have happened to me so far in my short life Still a teenager These occurrences involve a sound or a sight being there that wasnt really thereI cant really explain anything that has happened here but I would like to share Here it isThe first time this had happened to me I was very young around  years old I was a confident little fellow and after a day of playing with my brother and such I decided to sleep in my sleeping bag on the rd floor of my dads house aloneSo as I am about ready to start dreaming with the moon out far and it being past my bedtime I suddenly hear a man whisper to meThe first time I had no idea what it said completely unclear So I freeze in pure horror until again he whispers to meIt still didnt say anything understandable but at this point I was calling out for help from anyone in the form of some weird exhale of a loud shriek That is really the best way to describe what I was doing I was afraid if I called Dad it would know I was trying to get away and it would hurt meSo then it whispers to me a little louder Noo no its okay shh shh as I scream for my dad as I remain frozen still from fear of moving a muscleMoments later my Dad rushes in to comfort me as there was nothing there I tell him what I heard and even having it being the breakfast table conversation the next morning my Dad was sure it was just my silly little childs mind playing gamesI slept in his bed that night I knew what happened was real it was so vivid and I still remember it all of these years laterThat was my first time experiencing something so inexpiable and supernatural the second time was during the middle of last SummerSo me being a stupid little fellow me and a friend of mine decided to stay up for  entire days straightIt was terrible in the first day we could barley keep our eyes open But coffee and monster pulled us through until the  hours were near overNearing the end  as we are in the last hours of sleeplessness I had walked in to my room and closed the door to do something that I dont recall It may have been to change clothesAs Im changing I started to hear the moaning and groaning of a person outside my windowI took a good look outside and saw no source of sound It didnt get louder when I had opened the window eitherI had then started to hear my shower turn on but when I opened my door to try and confirm someone was showering the noise stopped I had opened and closed my door a few times and the noise stopped and started along with the doorSo I finished whatever I was doing went in to the hallway and told my friend what happened  and that it was time to sleep I was exhausted and confused as hell maybe too tired to completely understand the fear I maybe should have been condoning But who knowsSo now comes for the most real and recent occurrence this only happened  weeks agoSo it was a Monday night with school being off for Tuesday I managed to get my dad to drop me off to meet up with some girl to meet up with Around  at night when he dropped me offThe night played through and it was eventually time for me to go Around midnight when I left  But luckily for me my ride fell asleep on me Mom  More of my fault for staying with her so lateSo I didnt want to make her parents take me home or make this anyone elses problem other than mine So me being very tired thought Eh Ill just walk it wont take THAT longSo I started off on my little long as fuck  adventure I walked and walked and about  minutes in around  AM Im walking by an elementary school in my neighborhoodEveryone I have told this to has not believed me So if you want to talk shit in the comments please dont waste your own timeThere was a leaf bag at the end of the street that connects with an intersection but I swear to my life the leaf bag had limbs was moving and was on a bikeI stared directly at it for moments at a time and it continued to ride the bike It rode the bike moving its limbs but it was not going anywhereSo I just kept walking Now pretty freaked out I start seeing black figures fly across my field of visionI just fucking ran because of that past the elementary school until I came across a giant parking lot for the church nearbySo I took a breath for a moment or two then I saw someone maybe  feet away It was a pretty normal sized person but it was wearing a full black coat I could see nothing but black on itThat just horrified me I ran even more because of the adrenaline rush seeing that thing gave me When I stopped running I could feel my pulse beat like drums It was so irregular and strange it would thump a few times stop for a few seconds and thump a few times again I never saw that someone againI was very close to home at this moment so I finished my  hour walk that lasted from AMAM within the next  minutes or so The moment I finally made it home was amazingI cant say I know what was going on that night or any of those times But I can ensure to you that these things all really happened I just cant explain how,It has happened  times,15,nosleep,top_week
Cremewagon,1,5,1r15us,9,Im  years old and I have been suffering from chronic sleep paralysis for about  years now  I figured this would be a good place to recount some of the experiences Ive hadChicago   I was living with my girlfriend in a very tiny basement apartment  The apartment was dirty and had low ceilings  In our bedroom we had a bed and what was probably meant to be a closet in the corner of the room only there was no door on it and no light fixture  This corner of the room was always dark  My sleep paralysis dreams have always been vivid in the extreme  Every detail is captured exactly how it would be as if I was awake  It truly is impossible to tell the difference My first incident at the apartment was one night when I fell asleep to my girlfriend watching Bridezillas in the other room  I could see the light from the TV flashing under the doorway and hear the audio  Something was very wrong  I could sense a presence and I knew it was in the dark closetcorner of my room  It had not revealed itself but it was there  There is no fight or flight response in my very worst experiences  It is just distilled terror  I cannot move cannot breathe cannot scream  Thats when it comes out of the corner  It moves very quickly  Skittering almost  I can see flashes of pale skin and long dark hair  It is on the bed in seconds I can feel the weight of it tugging on the covers  Then it is on top of me  I cannot breathe and I am face to face with something so evil that it is seared into my memory  It is a woman only she has a tiny face her eyes are lambent green and she has draped her hair over me trapping me right next to her face  I can feel tiny puffs of stale breath on my cheek and the weight becomes unbearable  I scream and wake up  This happened a few times always the same woman  Sometimes she would crawl out of the corner and across the ceiling before dropping onto my bed  Sometimes she would just morph out of the shadows and appear on me  This happened numerous times at this location and then she just stopped showing up  After a year we moved to a slightly larger apartment a few blocks away from the Belmont stop  Sleep paralysis was very rare for me at this point  We had lived at this place for about two months when I had another episodeSecond Incident  I had just finished watching The Pixar Story on Netflix and had paused it on the credits and fell asleep with the lamp on beside me  I had fallen asleep on my recliner so I was sitting up which is strange because all of my other experiences I had been on my backWhen I wake up I see a massive being sitting next to me  To put him into scale I am sitting in the recliner and he is sitting on the ground  The top of his head is level with my chin  This would put him around  feet tall standing up  Not only that but there was an aura of power that was palpable and just emanated from it  Heit is resting there it is the color of black marble  I can see beads of perspiration on the skin  Whatever it is it is absurdly muscled and well defined  Every possible muscle is nearly bursting out of the black marble flesh  I can see the jugular vein in its neck beating with the pulse black blood pumping through the spiderweb of veins under its skin  I know now that it is a male  His eyes are closed but I know they are completely yellow if they were to open  I know that if I wake him I will die  I sit there and watch him he does nothing but breathe in and out as the perspiration rolls off his body  This goes on for fifteen minutes or soWhen I woke up from this one I had a deep sense that I had encountered something from another realm  That is really the only way to describe it  It was too real  Nothing in my room had changed The Pixar Story was still paused and my lamp was still on  But the presence of whatever I had just seen lingered for a long time  Another interesting thing about this one that sticks out  Ive never seen him again  He just showed up once  Which I thought was odd because something as vivid and unique as this entity seems like a perfect thing for the mind to hold onto and conjure up again  But its been close to four years now and I have not seen him a second time  I hope he never comes back honestlyThird Incident  And now my last one  This one happened three days ago  I live in an apartment in Licoln NE now and this is the first time it has happened here  I was laying on my side when I woke up for some reason my phone was on and the clock is showing  am  I live in the basement unit and there are orange sodium lights that shine into my room through the blinds  One of the blinds is slightly lifted because my roommate set her coffee there while she crocheted a scarf earlier  Her knitting stuff is still on the chair  At this point I start panicking because I cannot move and I know what is happening  There is a tapping on the window  Really quick light taps followed by some scratching  Like a cat is trying to get inside  The orange lights start casting some strange shadows on the floor and I can see something moving outside the window  It is moving with intelligence trying to figure out a way in  There are tiny puffs of humidity on the window too so I know something is breathing on it  At this point Im seriously trying to wake up because this is going to get very bad  It moves over to the far right part of the window and starts tapping and scratching again  Then it unlatches the window and opens it  A frail looking arm slips in  The skin is either dark dark green or black and slimy  The rest of it slips and it looks strangely catlike only minus the fur and it glistens in the orange of the sodium lamps  It just kind of sits there and stares at me with large pure black eyes  Then it runs at me only it moves without grace like stop motion gone wrong  I manage to turn my head and scream  When I wake up I am moaning quietly  What bothered me about this one though is that my phone was on and showing  am when I woke up  My phone had no reason to be on the only thing I can figure is that I bumped into it during the episode  So yup those are my stories and yes having these experiences have made it difficult to fall asleep some nights  Ive got a lot more of these experiences and Ill probably share them later but this is enough for now,I suffer from chronic sleep paralysis,14,nosleep,top_week
thedarkhalf,5,1,1rhyj5,7,You know that feeling when youre all alone and hear your name whispered Maybe youve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop Had things go missing only to reappear in odd places Maybe youre like me and you lie in bed at night only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around nothing Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately tickling you You check and nothing was there Im sure your parents tell you its nothing from a young age perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination They probably deep down fear its a ghost or apparition Even they couldnt know how much worse it really is  Stop deluding yourself Its not a cobweb Its not the wind Its not nothing Its something far more sinister an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention Some of you Im sure will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house Its such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do its the spookiest part of a generic horror movie because those suits in Hollywood havent seen what these creatures are really capable of If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their voices Im sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because its real form is so terrifying youd probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear a zombieesque state youll never awaken fromand that would ruin their fun too early If you dont die instantly seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and Ive heard of cases where insides have been liquefied skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every poreThe first time I awoke to one in my room with me it was after Id given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention I had thought it was cool I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg followed by more spindly legs followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs Yep a giant spider bigger than a horse came into my room I tried to scream but that just resulted with me hyperventilating then vomiting all over the floor It strode in all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away but it held me down with its two front legs piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devouredwhich I was  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn I lay in bed delirious desperate muttering for help My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me I passed out shortly after from fear blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later believing to have all been a dream I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals birds mostly wrapped up in what appeared to be spiders webs discoloured drained of their blood and insides All dead I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself dried blood caked on my body and face puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts my stomach my legs and in my hair The second night I encountered one of them they took the form of my uncle I lived with my uncle for nearly  years while my father was travelling almost every week for business I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods He didnt know what his brother did to me That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me He crawled onto the bed and tied me down I struggled but when I did he beat me with his belt like he had started doing when I was eight years old I fought as hard as I could tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl The torture that night lasted for many hours possibly days I try not to remember it I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago when my uncle died This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me Theyve only grown stronger with every drop of blood with every scream and with every hopeless sob Ive given themTheir true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that wont instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane yet they like to take their time with their toys The dreams for me started after those incidents I have seen what those beings really look like andjust thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking unable to stop retching The other day I wasnt careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train In my dreams it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world but it all feels real Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this tormentbut what if when I die I get sent to their realm to be their plaything forever Its not just the occasional brush against my skin the odd floor creak and the rare moment of is someone calling my name Now I feel them on me at all times their rough sharp skin cutting mine scratching me violating every single part of my body Their voices scream and howl at me maniacally taunting and laughing at my neverending misery Even when I shut my eyes I still see them their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts of spirits Yes it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering isnt it You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive you open your mind and let them in Dont Whats out there isnt human it isnt some person with unfinished business whats out there wants you to think that to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper That creak outside your room That faint sensation on your flesh I hope not because now you know whats really there and theyve always known about you,Dont give them attention,8,nosleep,top_week

frankthompson,2,7,1redk6,6,There exists for all people a point A point where the quantity of coincidences exceeds what one is willing to accept as coincidence For a skeptic this point is rather high while for the naive it might very well be one Long have I thought of myself as a skeptic particularly in regards to the paranormal A scientist by trade I never accept any evidence that is nonrepeatable Nor do I accept theories based on small numbers of events I feel the need to preface my story with this short paragraph so that when I present my experiences you understand the viewpoint at which I approached themI grew up in a small house occupied by many members of my extended family As such rare was the moment in which I was ever alone in a room Save time spent in the bathroom someone was always within line of sight College was much the same having shared a rather small suite with three other students Being alone was not a sensation I encountered until my late twenties having had to live a rather spartan life upon discovering my chosen vocation left work opportunities few and far between typically tackling this issue by living in small apartments with many other individualsI was  when I obtained my apartment My apartment no one else had any claim to the space It was a two bedroom apartment one bedroom utilized as my home office and the other for sleeping I landed a job with the CDC and even though the cost of living was higher than what I was used to in the Midwest the pay was more than enough for me to find adequate living space within my budget I was ecstatic at first but my enthusiasm rapidly dwindledThe first nights were difficult I often thought I was hearing noises within the walls and after a few days I took to leaving the television on across the hall This helped me sleep a bit but the noises continued Eventually I was content to drown them out with music at nightI had lived in places with rats in the walls and old buildings that creaked many times before but somehow this was different These werent the intermittent squeak of the floor nor the persistent chewing and skittering of a rat swarm Odd rhythms with inconsistent breaks filled the nocturnal orchestra Irregular beats consistent sounds expressed in patterns I could not follow The predictability of the music I played over it clashed heavily with the everpresent undersoundAdditionally the noises seemed to get louder the more ambient noise was present I first noted this phenomenon on a Saturday night when a rather eventful occurrence must have left the patrons at a nearby bar incredibly excited when they took to the streets at last call I was awake finishing a manuscript when their merriment took to the streets and rather than notice the commotion caused by the inebriated I first became aware of an inexplicable uptick in the level of sound coming from within my home This noise was what broke me from my concentration and only after it did so did I become aware of the people outsideI began experimenting with the sound Recording it manipulating it The volume increases linearly with the volume of other sounds based on some rough audio analysis I took to sleeping with ear plugs and silencing all other sounds in my apartment such as to appease whatever is making the noisesI presented the sound files and my analysis to a coworker in confidence after some time I had little to fear regarding questions of my insanity as I had taken some video footage as proof of the location and timing of the events He was intrigued but insisted it was most likely something mundane My theory that some sort of creature or creatures were reacting to the ambient noise levels was rapidly rejected and I felt rather silly Still something was occurring and he offered to come help me seek out the source of the noise on the following weekendWe grabbed dinner that Saturday evening and he and I retired to my apartment shortly after sunset It was a rather pleasant outing and I was fairly certain that he was interested in me beyond what I had suspected initially Still though the point of the evening was locating the source of the noise and that is what we set our minds to upon entering my apartment Or rather that is what we were planning on setting our minds to when we arrived The noise was disappointingly absentHe stayed for a few hours more however and we watched a movie When it got rather late I saw him out after agreeing to see him again outside of work I did rather enjoy his company and his presence seems to have kept the sound away I went to sleep rather giddy for what the future might hold between us and slept more soundly than I had since moving There were no sounds that nightI kept busy on Sunday barely setting foot into my apartment While the previous night was pleasant it quickly faded into memory as I went about running errands and keeping the rest of my life in order I had more energy than I knew what to do with and I meant to make the most of it I was drained by the end of the day but I had accomplished many tasks that I would otherwise have continued putting off I dined alone and went to bed early Predictably the sounds returnedThe sounds remained a constant in my life for some time and while they were present I simply put up with them Eventually the previously mentioned coworker wound up spending the night for different reasons I hadnt even thought of the sounds nor had I mentioned them to him again since that first night With him there they were again absentAfter a few more months we moved in together him and I living in my apartment When my lease ended we moved to a larger place and had been there around a year without incident This week however he left for conference that due to a few projects at work I was unable to attendThe noises began the night he left three days ago I recognized them instantly and was unable to sleep I immediately set up an audio recorder as well as my laptop recording video and sound They were louder than ever before and clearer I spent all of yesterday reviewing the recordings and analyzing the files from before comparing now and then Several aspects remained consistent between the recordings and I am certain that they are the same noise This time however I captured something different The recorder I use for work is a new one and seems to have picked up more of the sound than my laptop and other device I can understand it nowThere are voices Alien and unsettling voices as though someone taught a pack of cats to speak in disjointed sentences Snippets of conversations that make no sense frequently referring to me by name They know who I am they seem to be following me and it appears that they like me in some twisted sort of way The creatures want me to know Im not alone They dont want me to be sad they want to make sure I know theyre there that theyre watching meI slept in a hotel last night to get away from them I couldnt sleep with whatever they were nearby and hadnt slept the night before I couldnt sleep much last night either though It was almost too quiet I had to turn the TV on before I could fall asleep I went home this afternoon intent on discovering more A few samples of broken sentences was hardly enough evidence for me to base any conclusion on and I needed to shake the feeling that Ive gone crazyI borrowed a few more recorders from work and set them up around my home At least one in every room The plan was to discover where the noises were coming from based on where the voices were loudest and clearest They started shortly after dark predictably The sound files were sent to my laptop every few minutes and I compared them on the fly Consistently they are loudest in whichever room Im in or in whichever room has the highest levels of ambient noise dishwasher and microwave created this pattern The clarity however seems directly linked to my location and my location only The longer I stay in a place the better I can understand them I can hear them right now I know what theyre saying I dont have to be alone again I dont have to be alone ever I just have to let them inI dont want to be alone I guess thats why I have this hammer now I just need to let them into the house so they can be with me so we can be together The more I listen the better it sounds I can hardly remember why I even left last night why I would ever want to be aloneIm going to let them in now I need to find out what they are If I come back Ill post the audio and update If I dont well someone will find the recordings The recorders will be missed in rather short order Wish me luck At least I know someone will know what happened to me if I go missing,Lonely,13,nosleep,top_week

freezessmyblood,5,5,1r9hka,5,So I am a firm believer in the natural world and I really have never believed in ghosts or anything like that before But lately I really dont know what to think Ill start from the beginning about a year after we moved into the new house My room is one of the biggest in the house with a good sized walkin closet I have always had these fleeting thoughts about a ghost or some sort of spirit living in my house I get that feeling that someones watching me regularly especially at night My room is also very cold almost all the time though it wasnt when we first moved in Lately though Ive been noticing strange things going on with my closet At first Id leave the room and find the door open when it hadnt been when I left or Id find the light on or off when it had originally been the opposite I always just assumed I hadnt noticed the door being open I just really didnt want to believe that anything was wrong But then the closet lights started going out I know that really isnt anything special but every single bulb wed put in would go out within a day We all just thought there was something wrong with the socket for the light so we just stopped putting them in Last night something I cant explain happened and I dont know what to make of it I awoke early in the morning at about  AM and I stood to turn my television off As I turned around from the tv to return to my bed I saw that my closet light was on I didnt think anything of it I just walked towards it to turn the light off when I noticed two dark shadows blocking the sliver of light under the door I thought my brother must be in there because we share a room and I was still fairly groggy from waking up so I slowly walked towards the door to try and whip it open to scare him I grabbed the doorknob and flung it open Inside was a woman standing right up against the doorframe and she was so pale Her hair was limp and pure white and she was dressed in these white clothes that hung from her loosely As soon as I saw her I froze and we stared at each other for only a second before she screamed the most horrifying piercing scream Id ever heard and the light blew out and she was gone I slammed the door shut and ran to my bed which unfortunately is right next to the closet I stayed there for a while until I mustve fallen asleep because I remember her staring down at me I awoke in my dark room and there she was standing over my bed just staring at me I was paralyzed with fright and I couldnt move She just stared and as she began moving her face closer to mine I finally shook the paralysis and yelled She slid back away from me as though she was levitating and disappeared Im terrified to sleep tonight because I dont want her to visit me again Her face is burned into my memory it was the most unsettling thing I have ever seen I dont know what to believe anymore,My room is haunted,10,nosleep,top_week

JUVIEMAKER,2,1,1rhq9j,8,I have a nose for things No seriously all my life Ive had a very strong sense of smell and I dont mean for the average person I have an abnormally freakishly ridiculously absurd sense of smell Its been that way since I was a kid Heres a prime example when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother god rest her soul every month in Daytona Beach for the summer My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood I would always leave my Grans house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats One Saturday after a day of playing outside when kids used to play outside I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air but something wasoff There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent It was kinda tangy bitter sorta nutty just all around unpleasant Being so young I couldnt quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didnt like it Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgustGran  Whats the matter baby Come sit at the table and have a slice of cakeFive year old me I aint eating that cake it smells funnyLet me just interject for a second  Now if your family is old school like mine you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elders cooking Especially if that elder is a family member you just dont do it That is unless you want a black eye ribs broken missing teeth you get the pictureGran Girl get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of youOh geeztheres that tone You know it you know it well That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off You know that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives youre delicate childlike mind nightmares for a month or your whole life Yeah thats what I was hearing right about then But still I was adamant I would not eat that damn cake That smell It was just too potent Now you might be thinking whats the big deal Surely youve smelled worse things than that cake before which is very true At that point in my life Id smelled worse things before WAY WORSE but Id never been subjected to eat those things either Also the stench of that pastryit was just so very not right I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong and that cake was definitely wrong Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throatGran Come over here and take this plate nowOkay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble Even if my grandmother didnt kill me I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify With every step she took it grew more and more intense Girl you better take this cake she yelled holding the plate out in front of her I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away No I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip I dont want the cake granny but my pleas of desperation came to no avail My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm Suddenly she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction tilting my face towards hers She looked down at me with an awful glare Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Grans wrinkled sockets Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before You will eat this cake She shouted through gritted teeth Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece I had never seen this side to my Gran before My once sweet devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes I had never known terror like this My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade But you know what There was something else I was more fearful of Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devillike grandmother there was still something more bloodcurdling more utterly terrifying than herthat fucking cake NO echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman Her arms flew in the air letting me go in the same instance and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenlyCRACKThe sound of my grandmothers head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that I bent down and looked into Grans half opened eyes They werent black any more Theyd gone back to their normal brown again Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red To make a long story short the police were eventually called My Grans weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it Needless to say there were lots of screams Oh and youre probably wondering what that smell was right I actually didnt find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was I was pouring it into my foster parents coffee one morning when it finally hit meCyanide From the smell of it Gran probably couldnt have used too much either Maybe half a teaspoon give or take totally undetectable to the average persons nosebut not to mine So thats what that was go figure  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs My foster parents passed away later on that day I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really dont  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me Was it because of what Id done to Oscar her cute little Maltese I mean if Id known the oven wasnt a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently I was only two at the time Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommythat really was unfortunate I didnt want to hurt her but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed But anyways thats neither here nor there Im an adult now and those days are long behind me Im actually on my way to my boyfriendsexcuse meexboyfriends apartment right now Im visiting him and

FUCK,7,3,1rhjmk,8,So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared I mean thats how I even know about this subreddit because I like reading it And thats one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the  year old son was the one who had it happen the most I went through every scenario I could think on the way there Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children The son was as I said earlier  and the girl was  they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such I took a note about it but didnt dwell on it that much We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV Point of view cameras strapped on and started our investigation My Uncle took the upstairs our colleague took the first floor And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walkytalky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely  plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness It answered backMy instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly You know who I am I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here It chuckled again before I heard a small sound Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message My uncle did that a lot he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out I also saw a candle and a small match book and thats when it hit me My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head This was a three kings set up I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice My voice whisper right into my ear  Do you know who I am now I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened I just held out my camera to him and he took it Before he watched it he asked me why I didnt call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did He looked at our colleague before watching the recording After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in and it was as I thought It was a set up for  The three kings I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was He didnt so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket  and it has been used recently The bucket was full of water  My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation We went back home and I have decided to type this up Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house  I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them ,What have these people done,11,nosleep,top_week
deanjp,2,0,1re04y,7,When I was about  years old I started making home movies with my cousin Ben and my friend Mark My parents had bought me a new video camera for Christmas that year We filmed a ton of crappy short films some original stuff but mostly spoofs of existing films such as The Ring Saw and our personal favorite Dr Giggles This was probably because horror films were so easy to make All you needed was the biggest knife in the house and some ketchup packets Now it was midOctober nearly a year since I got the camera and we were getting tired of filming at my house and in my backyard We wanted to go somewhere exotic So we walked around the block where a small patch of woods stood next to the exit ramp of a highway that cut through my town This is where we would shoot our next film we decided The basic plot was supposed to be two hikers are killed by a mad man with a baseball bat When we had finished all of the planning which wasnt much we didnt write scripts the sun was starting to set This is what wanted We werent going to shoot a scary movie in broad daylight We made our way to the woods I carried the camera which had a light built into it Ben carried the baseball batmurder weapon an oversized bright red plastic thing that looked like something out of a cartoon and Mark carried three cans of tomato soup and a can opener in his backpack This was the basic layout of the area from the street of the block I live on there was about  feet of grass until you got to the woods The woods stretched for a little less than a mile parallel to the street The thickness of the woods varied throughout but reached a maximum of about  feet On the side of the woods opposite of the street was a small grassy ridge that made up the highway exit rampWhen we got to the woods we looked around for a spot where we could start the film There seemed to be somewhat of a trail running through the middle of the woods We decided we would walk the trail until we reached one end and start filming from there I turned on the light of the camera as it was completely dark at this point We started walking There was garbage everywhere Gas station fountain drink cups candy wrappers old tires The place was a dump I guess were not the first ones to pass through these parts I said jokingly Is this where garbage trucks dump their loads This must be Oscar the Grouchs summer home Ben said as he gestured to a small red tent we were approaching We all burst into laughter Anybody home Mark yelled Its Burt Ernie and Big Bird here for a visit The tent came into full view and I shined the light in its direction  Suddenly we all shut up A pair of big black boots were sticking out of the door of tent We stopped as if paralyzed My legs werent moving and neither were the legs in the tent I realized I was still shining the light directly on the tent and quickly pointed it at the ground Ben whispered Lets get outta here They started backing away leaves crunching beneath their feet but I still stood there terrified I dont know why I was so scared It was probably just some poor bum sleeping out here in the woods But hadnt he heard us coming his wayCome on man lets go Mark quietly begged me I finally got control of my legs As I was backing away curiosity got the best of me I pointed the camera at the tent No boots I couldnt breathe for a moment Then I ran Mark yelled at me What What I didnt respond but they ran with me I didnt know where I was leading them I just wanted to get away from there out of the woods away from whoever was now roaming around outside of his tent I spotted a pair of headlights driving on the exit ramp and decided to head that way We got out of the trees and caught our breath near the ramp guard rail No more cars in sight I told them what I had seen and we agreed that we didnt want to go back into the woods We would walk along the ramp until we got to the street and then walk back to my house from there We were just about to leave when Ben asked me where the camera was Shit I must have dropped it while I was running I wanted to just leave it but I knew my parents would kill me if I told them I lost it The three of us walked back down the ridge being as quiet as we could and keeping our eyes peeled for any sign of the cameras flashlight which I couldnt remember ever switching offWe had just entered the trees when I saw a dim glow just a few feet ahead of us I walked up to it slowly and as I bent down to pick it up another car slowly curved down the ramp its headlights illuminating the area for a moment In the brief second that the woods were lit up I saw a pair of big black boots sitting just two or three feet in front of me I almost cried I choked on my own breath and looked up slowly expecting to see a man attached to the boots but there was no one It was just a pair of boots neatly sitting there I was confused but that didnt stop me from running out of there with my friends as fast as I could gripping the camera tightly with both hands We reached the ramp followed it to the street and went home Needless to say we stuck to filming at my house from then onAbout a month later my mom and I were driving home from my aunts house after Thanksgiving dinner We got off on our usual exit I searched the trees for a sign of the red tent but couldnt see it We were stopped at the traffic light just off of the exit when I noticed an old beggar standing on the corner asking passing cars for change The street was full of cars but he eventually fixed his sight on our car I tried not to look at him but I couldnt help it Finally I realized he wasnt staring at our car He was staring at me I looked closer Black boots He was wearing a pair of big black boots Before I had time to think my window started rolling down Quickly I looked at my mom who was handing me a dollar bill she had just pulled out of her purse Give this to that poor man its Thanksgiving for heavens sake Ill slow down when get up to himI took the dollar from her as if in a trance and looked back at the beggar He was smiling at me with brown and yellow teeth My heart was beating fast I couldnt breathe again His eyes stayed fixed on mine We inched toward him as the cars ahead of us slowly turned right My mom stopped the car next to him and I cautiously held the dollar out to him Happy Holidays he said smiling Happy Holidays my mom replied as I sat there speechless his eyes never leaving mineEven as we drove away I could still see him in the side mirror standing there in his big black boots Staring and smiling,Big Black

OsamaBinHiding,3,1,1rhxdo,6,Last night was like every other night for me Have dinner on my own in my small yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV Around  or  oclock I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was  oclock Where did the time go I thought It had only felt like a few minutes However this was a normal occurrence for me The world kind of disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me I cant break out of itI had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought Fuck I better try and get some sleep See I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city So it isnt uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head I wouldnt consider myself someone who doesnt get scared easily but when youre familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window  you tend to grow some thick skinLast night wasnt like any other night in my flat though As I mentioned earlier I was alone My flatmate  lets call him Evan for the sake of the story was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but hes away a lot so Im used to spending a long period of time on my own My usual night routine of showering brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something My drawers were all pulled open To most people this is probably nothing  but for me it wasnt normal I suffer from borderline OCD and everything especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order I hadnt left my flat today either Im too tired for this shit I thought and went to bed Its weird though isnt it That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe like nothing can hurt you I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safeWell not anymore for me Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards  no biggy right However as I drew closer to conscientious I realised that these creaking sounds werent coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bedAnd thats when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed ,Last night,7,nosleep,top_week
TaylorBonaseraSr,0,2,1rhb2e,5,I can explain why Im so afraid of mirrors or anything that could reflect light even a glass door Its so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible She broke my mirror the first time just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces It was such a pain to have to clean all that up I got at least five cuts But she didnt care At the very least she didnt laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster At least she was nice enough to check herself for that Anyway I got my mirror replaced She didnt break the bathroom mirror again but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it I dont understand how she did it its pressed up right against the wall Shed have to ram her body sideways She didnt even have any visible cuts She told me she was sorry and that she would try not to do it again I believed her and she was true to her word But soon enough I hear the crashing again But this time its my door The majority of my glass door has been smashed through but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo No one lives here that has a body shaped like that The other times I checked her she didnt have any cuts on her but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital I had to sit there and watch her but she couldnt explain what had happened When the doctor asked neither could I because I hadnt been there Its strange how selective she is she wont smash into anything except mirrors or glasslooking things Anywhere there isnt this kind of stuff nothing bad happens She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it She talks to me about it so often I feel like Im beginning to share the feelingIts starting to unnerve me and I dont want to live with her anymore But I cant break the joint liability contract She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection so I did But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks Im not lookingOne day Id had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room It couldnt hurt just for a little while when she couldnt see She wouldnt notice But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection I saw her standing there So close She was so ugly She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face She followed me here to my own room I couldnt turn around There was no point I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldnt keep a straight posture She was laughing at meBut Id heard that laugh somewhere before And Id seen that face before too It looked so much like my own She must have heard my thoughts because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection I couldnt stand the sight of her face anymore it was so scary Itd been such a long time since Id spent so many minutes just staring at her I had to take control So I bashed the bedroom mirror in balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skinItd been so long since Id last done that Now every time I look I can see her feel her I see her staring at herourreflection through my eyes,My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep,top_week

TreasureHouseofDoom,12,75,1r7ztj,3,Dr Jefferies study lay before me energy cleared and house relatively empty but delving into other peoples personal space isnt as easy for me as it may be for others  Always my parents have cautioned me and my siblings about the dangers of disrupting others heirlooms cherishables and privacy  I knew for instance that each of us has deep connection to those things he or she treasures even if we are not personally aware of any sort of psychic ability and that some items carry with them certain protections  A locket passed from mother to daughter for instance may have compound energies susceptible to unleash if disrespected  Bring into this potential release of energy against an interloper a variable such as a holy relic or other spiritually imbued item and forces not easily rectified are to be expected  But more profound than these fears of conflict beyond my control was the deep seated notion in me that all people those among us and those just beyond ever beyond are entitled to their privacy respect beyond measure peace  Id done a pretty good job of jeopardizing such peace and now it was time for me to make things right but maybe too I would be able to bring more than satisfactory comfort  Perhaps this predicament would be remedied with two little girls finding their way to BlissWhatever Bliss is I heard someone say over my shoulder  Just to my left was a door that I presumed opened into the first room to the right of the hall  Foreboding consumed my thoughts only a moment before I pushed it out of my mind and far from my heart  Mama and Aunt Lucia would have called the voice Naysayer and I knew far more than I needed about its powers  The only power Naysayers have is antipower I remembered my mother saying Theyre the weakest link on a dark rusted chain  When all else fails Naysayers speak to hinder what must be done for Good I must have been very young when I heard her say this and I wasnt even sure she had said it to me  Truth was respect for privacy aside I was a bit of an ease dropper by nature and as far as I knew she had been speaking to a friend or relative   But the information this reminder over time was powerful strength to me  I pushed the Naysayer from my mindThere are two very important techniques to remember as one sets her mind to investigating scene and history  First proceed in an orderly and logical manner as often and well as possible  Turn over every clue for deeper consideration but remember to return every item examined to its proper place whenever feasible  Second follow instinct and revelation as each presents itself  Order and Logic have their places but in highly energized situations short cuts sometimes arise  Consult your inner voice in regards to each and if that voice is true and strong in most situations trust it nowHaving been involved in vintage house restoration through my mothers real estate dealings I knew a thing or two about the sorts of places used as secret compartments  Knobs on banisters loose boards trim and façade might function as easily concealed opening for places to hide cash or jewels even the sorts of things others might never suspect had any value at all  Quick inspection of the study revealed a few components that might serve in such a fashion  Among them were medallions at the corners of the door and window frames along the elaborate builtin bookcases and to the left and right of the fireplace attached just beneath the mantle shelf I presumed such opening would reveal a deep but narrow space  Two doors three windows and an entire wall of shelving equalled  medallions  There wasnt time to waste so I decided the best method was to eyeball each for lopsidedness or failure to sit flush in place  Any looseness might indicate wear and tear surpassing stationary use Using the chair instrumental in bringing the ouija board to our attention to begin with as stool I set myself to this task but came up short when I discovered each of the medallions at the windows and the doors paint sealed  And the medallions along the shelves were all flush  Glad not to have wasted too much time in this pursuit I set about removing books from shelves five at a time flipping through each carefully feeling the plank of the shelf beneath and the wood behind to detect any anomaly  This was time consuming but revealed nothing out of the ordinary  By now I was becoming dejected and increasingly worried  The sun lower in the sky I saw beams of it peeking past the drapes at the center of three tall windows  Now I pulled each to its corresponding side let midafternoon light push through  At first I only warmed myself in this wondering why I hadnt bothered to bring more light into the room to start but now I noticed something I hadnt before  With my back to the door it would have been virtually impossible to detect    From the outside of the study the door was virtually mundaneheavy oak painted white thick framework medallions at the corners nothing more But from the inside a fretwork panel of heavy design was fitted to meet the top of the door from corner to corner as if a transom window were hidden behind it  And now light pouring into graze the top of the desk in the center of the room hit a finely polished desk set ricocheting to the fret work and passing through  From behind tiny glows of red and ember were cast against the white paint gingerbreadExcitedly I carried the chair across the room stood on top of it hoping to budge the fretwork  There was no such luck at this height  I looked for something sturdy  to make me taller but there wasnt anything else in here suitable for that Id have to grab a stool Id seen in the kitchen earlier  It troubled me to leave the study unattended and I was not unafraid to travel the hall to the kitchen again  The energy pushed from this room might have concentrated along that dark corridor andtired as I wasI worried that my resolve might be weaker now   The best path I decided was through the front door and around the side of the house and besides I could use the fresh air I thoughtOpening the front door surprise of warm air pressed against me  For the better part of the last twentyfour hours chill had held me in its grip and now I basked in the warm mugginess of a typical Alabama fall day  Storms on the way someone said from the front walk and when I looked down from my place on the porch the broad smile of a tall man greeted me  It didnt occur to me to wonder what he was doing here and perhaps I already knew who he wasMiss Lucia shes a fine woman she told me you might need a few things and I walked to meet him with a firm thankful handshake His grasp was strong and for a moment I pondered whether or not he might be just some local with a keen sense of what most couldnt see some bright energy my aunt had detected from the other side but his overalls and flannel shirt were oldfashioned even by farm standards and the glow emanating from him spoke of peace and tranquility not found here on EarthNames Big Roy Miss Julianne And Ill help however I can You got to know I love both those little girls  Not one of thems an angel but neither is they a devil And I was glad to find his grip strong now if only for a moment  He mustve been a real force in life to bring such energy to me nowIve found a fret panel above the door in the study Big Roy I said  And I need a ladder and maybe a hammer to remove itBig Roy looked down for a moment considered the peace of Heaven against the Hell of Life perhaps then spoke  No Maam  What you need is a No Goodell Brothers screwdriver Reaching into a pocket at his hip he pulled out a relic to share with me   I made that fretwork for Mrs Moseley put it up to hide a few things His dark marble eyes clouded and he looked past the house to the back yard  I followed the path his thoughts traveled and suddenly we werent in the front yard anymore  Ahead of us stood the original kitchen rock wall reminder of the boundaries between two converging worlds  Within two little girls working on some secret danced across the windows in silhouette  The smell of fudge was heavy again and laughter wafted too on convected breezeThatll be Vassar Fudge Big Roy said  Never could stand the taste of it  Mrs Moseley wont like it in the house not since the fire  But I swear this place always smelled of barbecue and chocolate after that He shivered tear at his eye and I placed my left hand to his right arm felt the sinew hard work makes the strength of spirit hard life breeds the exhaustion such projection brought from him His memories were clues I could not cast away but feeling the drain it made on his soul saddened meIs this the only way Big Roy I asked sincerely but he only smiled sadly back at meWhatever it takes to bring peace Maam Such is the nature of love and sacrifice and now I committed the lessons Big Roy taught to memory heart spiritHis pulse quickening at my fingertips I felt the rush of energy course through me inflate my heart  Now was the time to prepare myself for the sort of vision that could drive some to madness and just as I realized this heat burst against my face like revelation of Armageddon  Closing my eyes for only a moment I turned now to see the pretty kitchen erupting in flames  The shrieks of little girls trapped inside overwhelmed me and now Big Roy ran toward the house as he had that day so many years ago relived horrible moments to break a window  And there was Mary falling through to fall into his strong arms but she reached back scrambled to retrieve her sweet friend the girl who might have been her sister always  Big Roy pulled her more tightly to his chest held her against the struggle she made and ran from the porch the pop and sizzle of pine planks harmonizing backdrop against the excruciating rising melody of Sweet Dulcies screams Puddle of sweat and tears I prayed for strength to continue as wails echoed through me  And now I felt the whistling brush of silk against one cheek and the coarse scrape of wool against the other as two mothers ran to collect babies only one to have her arms filled with a bundle of love ever again  Big Roy passed Mary to her Mamas arms and now he rushed to pull Mrs Moseley from the porch just as the pretty gingerbreaded roof above it collapsed in spark and flame  Salt of sweat and tears at my lips I wretched as the fragrances Big Roy had describedbarbecue and chocolate engulfed meThank you for reading each of these parts that explain an amazing event in my life If

LadyVengeance,2,3,1rdv1z,3,I woke up stretched my arms and got upIt was midsummer already warm and sunny and the birds outside were twitteringI dont know why but I was in a very good mood I took a look out of my window a very peaceful neighborhoodMy neighbors were working in their beautifully manicured gardens I used to greet them but around  weeks ago they started to give me this strange look when I walked by It was obviously weird to them that I was trying to be nice to everyone Ive never been like that but I think I finally realized that life is more than just regrets lies and all that bad stuff that happens every day I mean I got a new job after  years of unemploymentI went straight to the bathroom and brushed my teeth I caught myself humming which I normally dont do But whatever I did I couldnt miss the feeling that I forgot something and I couldnt remember what it wasMan you look awesome today I said to myself and I gave my reflection in the mirror a wink Just like I said I felt good I went downstairs and headed to the kitchen I decided to prepare breakfast for me and my parents just because I felt like itGood morning everyone Good morning darling My parents sat there in front of the TV watching their favorite show They recently started doing that getting up early and watch TV I stood there in the kitchen and asked Scrambled or fried and they would answer Whatever you like sweetie pieSo what are you guys doing today Will you just stay here and watch TV again We should enjoy the wonderful weather as long its warm outside but Im really sorry I think I cant join you guess whyWell I have a new job as a barkeeper I think it will be a lot of fun but I have to hurry now before Im too late for my first day of work I know you dont like this and you would rather want me to have a normal job but I cant change it Itll do it for nowI was really excited I opened the door took a deep breath and realized that Mrs Cartridge from next door was watering her flowers I waved to her with a big smile on my face and there again she just responded with that distracted glance I dont know what this neighbourhood was up to but I could tell it was no good They didnt even like me from the start As soon as we moved into this house you could tell that these people didnt want you to stayI still can remember this one Halloween I think I was about  years old and Ive always been a big fan of horror movies My parents wouldnt let me watch them but I did it secretly when they were asleep So I wanted the best costume ever I only wished for a hockey mask and something similar to a machete I wanted to look like Jason from the horror movies My parents werent really happy about it but it was Halloween so what I really enjoyed scaring the other kids even the older ones There was just one problem about it for one kid this wasnt as amusing as it was to me He was so scared that he literally pissed his pants and of course he told his father about the incident He rang at our house and told my parents that they would regret buying me such a costume they should better take care of me and my strange hobbies and that I wasnt even close to normal What a stupid thing to say when you dont even know me Guess what he did the Halloween after He grabbed me threw me in his car and drove to the nearest lake It was at the end of October and damn cold outside He ripped my clothes apart and I really tried to fight back but this man was about  feet tall and very muscular He forcefully put my head in the water I thought I would die that he would drown me in that damn lake But he dragged me up again and asked me Who is scared now huh and then he would continue this over and over again He left me there naked freezing gasping but I felt nothing I was empty I went back home all the kids were laughing at me but I didnt care I just wanted to get home and get some rest I never told my parents about what happened that day but I could tell that this was just the beginning of it allMy relationship to my parents was never that good We argued a lot we insulted each other They really pissed me off sometimesGo and get a job already Stop sitting around like a lazy bugger I wish Id have never been pregnant with youHarsh tones rough times but in the meantime I started to understand their worries and doubts Maybe thats why our relation was getting better now every day I got up off my ass and did something I looked for a job Im cleaning the dishes from time to time because my mom started to rebel and stopped doing anything in the household Thats also the reason why it started to smell so bad in the kitchen I now was a busy man I couldnt clean the house all day long I had better things to do I dont even know if my parents liked what I was cooking for them They didnt eat at all sometimes they only tried one fork saying to me You did a great job honey but we arent hungry I know that my cookeries werent the best and they just wanted to be polite and nice So I had to throw away almost all of the food The leftovers started to moulder and oozed a disgusting smell Im a messy person I dont really give a shit if my room looks untidy or the dishes are dirtyMy first day at work was really exciting Ive worked as a barkeeper a few years ago I was still good at mixing drinks and serving them I really enjoyed the atmosphere in that bar It smelled like old wood and some of the lights were broken and therefore it was quite dark in there Most people who came in here were at least  years old The few women that found their way in here were prostitutes looking for a cheap jag I envied them so much you earn money having sex with other people And they made good money out of it You can judge me but I have my own opinion about that topic If I was a girl I would do exactly the sameSo and youre the new barkeeper here What a hell of a man you are such a lovely face You shouldnt even be here darling one of the prostitutes hit on me But I really like it in here Dreary places always attracted me And on top of that I got to know you my dear lady My names Adora Pleased to meet you So whats your poison We really enjoyed each others presence and talked a lot about her job about her family in Texas etc She asked me to come with her after my shift had finished One thing led to another and we ended up in her bedroom I waited til she fell asleep and sneaked out of her apartment I rather sleep in my own bed than somewhere else I was hoping that my parents were already sleeping but when I got home I saw them sitting in front of the TV It was am in the morning did they seriously stay awake til I got home Just to shellac meIm sorry that Im so late I hope youre not Its okay honey Dont worry I felt relieved I ran straight upstairs into my room and lay down on my bed with a big smile on my face My life couldnt be any betterI woke up stretched my arms yawned and took a look out of the window It was raining but still warm outside I strolled into the bathroom and brushed my teeth I recalled what happened yesterday and a smile lighted up my face Having finished brushing my teeth I headed downstairs to prepare some breakfast I greeted my parents delightfully and decided to make some pancakes The only problem with that was that all the clean dishes and pans were gone and so I had to scrape the mouldering leftovers off of them I know thats not really how you should do that but I had to hurry otherwise Id have been late for workI hope you dont mind that I used the dirty dishes to serve the pancakes on Ive got an idea Maybe we should go out for a ride tomorrow you both havent left the house in weeks now Dad I know you hate your boss but maybe you should consider going back to work next weekSo whats the plan Maybe we should drive to the lake and go fishing Thats a good idea Its been years since Dad and I were going on a fishing trip together I went to work and there again in the right corner sat Adora with her two friendsYou nasty boy sneaked out of my bed last night I thought we had a lot of fun We did I just wasnt comfortable sleeping in another bed than mine I hope youre not angry with me No its okay cutie Do you have plans for tomorrow Maybe we could stay all day long in my bed and do  you know  dirty stuff Im sorry but I promised my parents that were going to the lake for a few hours but maybe you could join us That would be great I dont really know honey Im not that kind of person you should introduce to your parents Dont be silly Were just chilling at the lake for two hours and afterwards we can do whatever you want Well then if its just for two hours Im okay with thatI was excited like a little kid on Christmas Eve I helped my parents to get in the car Adora said she would wait at the lake so that my parents didnt get to know where she lived because it was some kind of embarrassing for her showing her poverty When we got there Adora approached the car opened the passenger door and bursted out with a high pitched screamWhat the fuck is wrong I asked her Ohmygod With tears in her eyes she ran off What the hell was that I dont know that freaked her out that much Im sorry guys I really thought she was something special Its okay honey Dont be sad For everything theres a season Maybe she wasnt the right one for you Thank you MomDad I love you We love you too son Maybe we should go home for today Im not really in the mood for fishing right nowI drove back to our house and now there was Mrs Cartridge again She was cutting her rose bed When I opened the door to help my parents getting out of the car she dropped her garden shears and clasped her hands over her mouth She looked like she saw a ghost People these days just annoyingWe were sitting in front of the TV and watched one of my favorite shows I felt comfortable spending time with my beloved parents I cant remember the last time we just sat there without arguing being a family again Suddenly I noticed piercing sounds of sirens from outside Police cars stopped by near our house What happened Was Mrs Cartridge in danger What if something happened to her I would never forgive myself I could have helped herThis is the police Open up They pounded wildly against our front door What the hell was going on Open the damn door Otherwise were coming inWhat No I gave in and opened the door just to check out what the hell they wanted from us They bursted into our hallway and pushed me aside All of them were armed There were about  or  police cars parking in front of our house What the hell was going on Did Mrs Cartridge call the police Why One of the police officers went into the living room and yelledOh my fucking god guys two dead people in the living room Man thats fucking disgusting The police officer came back and gave me a disguised lookYou crazy motherfucker Get him the handcuffs on He might be dangerous What No Im not dangerous I was just sitting there with my parents watching TV This is not a crime You have the right to remain silent when questioned Anything you say or do may be used against you in a court of law You have the rightAll I heard were the sirens and all I saw where the lights everywhere I felt like I was in a movie that this wasnt real They cant arrest me Ive not committed any crimeEstimated time of death  weeks ago Thats why the neighbors complained about the smell The cause of death is currently unknown but what we can say is that they died an unnatural deathI just wanted to have a normal family without any rhubarb Ive never loved my parents that much as I did the last  weeks It was so calm and

Lnzy,2,1,1rdoii,6,My Grandmother made porcelain dolls filling her golden years and every inch of available shelf space in the modest desert home she shared with my Grandfather with small breakable people They were all dressed in elaborate frills and lace hand crafted bonnets and daintily painted faces They never scared me as a child as you would think a house full of unmoving glass eyes would Instead they compelled me to play and to dream For my fifth birthday Grandma gifted me with a pair dolls I named Lilly and Lanis They were twin baby dolls dressed in bright pink and blue corduroy overalls I took them everywhere and they filled me with the assurance that I would be a fantastic mother One day as I helped Grandma clean out her shed I knocked over a piece of wood that smacked int the wall A panel of the wall popped off the nails holding it in place and tumbled to the ground with a clatter Through the dust tinted air I spotted a large metal tin inside I instinctively went to reach for the item when my Grandmother slapped my hand away and quickly replacing the misplaced board securing in place with a heavy tool box Leave it be she told me sternly The next morning as we readied to leave and return home I slipped away and back to the shed With some effort I was able to push away the tool box and the board fell away with a sweep of my hand I quickly pulled the tin box out and opened it an unbridled urge to know pulling at me It was a doll Its dress was of a deep maroon lined with soft black velvet ready for the deepest of winters Its face white and pale as any porcelain was in fact made of wood Her eyes had been covered with a red ribbon Before I could examine the doll further the sound of my mothers voice jolted me back to reality and I hastily shoved the doll my bag When I got home I sat on my bed with the doll pulling my fingers through the wiry black curls The red ribbon was tied with an impossible knot so I went to the kitchen and fetched a pair of scissors Stripping off the ribbon I beheld the deep amber eyes of the wooden doll for the first timeand I felt a twinge of unease It was only after seeing the dolls face in its entirety that I realizedhow wrong it looked The eyes seemed to focus straight at me with unnerving intensity not the vague dead gaze of Grandmas other dolls The eyebrows were painted a tad too narrowand the sides of its mouth drooped ever so slightly The doll lookedangry I put the doll back into my bag and set it aside A few nights later we received an abrupt call in the middle of the night Grandma has passed away suddenly of a heart attack While I changed my clothes I looked up and noticed the items my dresser had been disturbed My pink bejeweled box of assorted costume jewelry and nick knacks had been pushed aside and in their place sat the wooden doll I stared at it for a moment trying to think back to when I had placed it there My mind was a jumble with thoughts of my now dead Grandmother and windowed Grandfather The doll was insignificant So it was only later after I had returned from a long day of mutual grieving with relatives that I notice the expression on the dolls face did not appear as severe as I remembered it when I first beheld it I chalked it up to being my own imagination and let the thought escape my mindA few days after the funeral I came home from school to find Lilly and Linus the dolls Grandma had made for me broken on the floor and in pieces Their brightly colored overall slashed I wailed at the sight of them and tried to put the shattered faces back together tears of anguish at finally having a real sense of my loss It was not just the dolls themselves but the glow of warmth from my Grandmothers touch seemed to have left them She was not coming back And I cried Above me I did not notice the vague smile on the wooden dolls lips I cried myself to sleep that night It was windy and the loss of my dolls had left me in little mood for food or entertainment I cuddled up with my well worn Little Mermaid blanket and eased into a dark nothingness without dreams I awoke abruptly during a particular powerful current of wind as it pushed the tree branches into my window I sat bleary eyed in the dark for a moment when I heard a soft sound of what sounded like foot falls They were soft and rapid seeming to come from under my bed I assumed it was my kitten Gizmo So I laid my head back onto my pillow and waited for sleep to return A clatter startled me back to alertness only a moment later and I looked around my room One of the doors to my closet which always remained closed because monsters you know was open a small crack Immediately my little brain began to race with thoughts of monsters with teeth and long claws and wide black eyes Almost as if to answer my thoughts there came another clatter from the closet I jumped out of bed grabbing the nearest piece of armament available to me a plastic princess light up wand I held it close to me as I approached the closet As I drew nearer I heard a most discerning noise as the closet door began to creek open A giggleI ran toward the door slammed it closed with all my might and rammed the princess wand between the handles of the closet doors just as they began to shake violently I pulled away and bolted out my door and down the hall to my parents room I slammed their door closed locked it and swan dived into the warm confines of their down comforter While far from happy with me they did not throw me out The next morning my Dad asked me what had scared meTheres a monster in my closet I told him He smiled patiently at me and got up to dress for the day He looked at the door and shook his head unlocking it and stepping out into the hall and paused looking down After a moment he looked back at me with tired eyes and asked Did you forget your toysConfused I looked over the edge of the mattress down to the floor where my father stood Just in front of the doorway to my parents room were the shattered plastic pieces of my princess wandlaying at the feet of the wooden doll with her mouth stretched into a wide grin ,A Time for Playing,7,nosleep,top_week

along thinking about his friend hadnt been at school and he was a little worried he never missed one day He was walking when he walked into a lady she had things scattered across the ground he knew he should help her pick the items up He picked up the last of the items across the ground and he looked up and got a good look at this woman She was in her midforties or early fifties she had black hair was white brown eyes and her face was a little wrinkled He didnt even realize what he picked up when he handed it to her It was a knife covered in what looked like fresh blood when he saw that he started to back away She smiled and said Now dont run dear youll only make it harder on yourselfHe opened his mouth to scream but no sound escaped He turned and started running down the street trying to escape the woman with the blood stained knife He ran forward never looking back and he finally saw a house and he ran up to the door and found that it opened Grateful to this he bolted inside and closed the door He peeked out the window to see if she was following still he noticed she had slowed down and was laughing Hopefully shes just a crazy old woman who likes to scare kids for a laugh He panted quietlyI dont chase kids for a laugh He heard beside him He looked up and there stood the woman he opened his mouth to scream but she quickly covered it Now now dear be quiet itll be easier He

the smell that was lingering with the chicken like smell hit full force and it was so putrid he almost wanted to gag But he had to be nice to this ladyHe forced the spoon into his mouth the meat tasted like none hed ever had It didnt taste like chicken or anything else It had an odd salty taste with a metallic taste to it kind of like blood Wait that knife He tried to spit the soup out but she forced his mouth shut and said Now swallow dear She forced him to swallow the broth and he felt his eyes grow heavy she put something in thHours later he woke up the bed not his own and the room was different Please tell me Im dreaming where am I anyway She came in and the memory hit him He tried to get up but he was strapped to the bed He tried to scream but there was something knotted in his mouth like a rag Well Ive never had anyone to talk to but Ive always wanted someone to tell my secrets to you know Be able to be understood and all that She sighs He couldnt talk so he just laid there staring at her silently pleading for her to let him goYou know that soup I put special ingredients in that there soup It has my special red broth with my special meat I have to get it in a different way than any other meat Youll see how I do that lateror actually maybe very soonHe tried to fight against the ropes holding him down but she merely chuckled softly Dont fight dear I just

time I show you She untied him from the bed and said I shall lead you to your new living quarters She led him through the kitchen and into a dark roomThe smell inside was putrid he wanted to gag but the rag in his mouth kept him from doing so The lights in the room turned on and he saw the most gruesome sight He finally opened his mouth and screamed though his attempts were muffled by the rag The room was covered in dried red there was meat hanging up the freezer cool enough to keep it fresh like all other big freezers with meat in them But this wasnt ordinary meatit wasHe didnt finish his

kailey,0,7,1r8ylh,2,So about a year and a half ago my family moved into an old farm house that was built near the end of the s My whole family absolutely hated it there but I was oddly drawn to it and loved it I have no idea why On the first night we stayed there my best friend stayed the night with me because the first night is always creepy no matter what Now supernatural things were drawn to my best friend She could sense them and they always came to her Once she stepped foot in that house she wanted to leave But of course she refrained from telling me until after I moved out She also didnt tell me about what happened while I was asleep Before we went to bed we decided to watch a movie Then we just left it on the main menu and went to bed I guess around  AM she woke up to a bang in my room From where she couldnt exactly tell But it was definitely my room Then the tv went out to that gray and black fuzz and really loud for about  seconds then went back to the main menu She said she was shaking from fear She refused to come over anytime I invited her after thatAgain she didnt tell me about any feelings or anything until after I moved outIve always been interested with the supernatural but nothing of the sort is drawn to me Im kind of happy about that kind of sad But I mustve been the most interesting for whatever was in that house because it was drawn to me and it made it clearThis house had two bedrooms upstairs two bedrooms downstairs It also had a living room that was recently built onto it so it had separate air condition and furnaceIt was midwinter and the furnace on the original part of the house wouldnt work At all We got it checked out probably  or  times and they couldnt figure out why it wasnt working My sister and I had the rooms upstairs but she couldnt handle the cold so she ended up sleeping in the living room with the separate furnace so I was alone on that floor Around the second week we were there I was getting into bed with my  blankets and multiple pants and sweatshirts because of how freezing it was when suddenly I heard a huge BANG on my door This freaked me out so I just grabbed my bible and prayed for whatever it was to go away until I felt better Then it started happening every single night when I got into bed Eventually it didnt bother me Like whatever was out there was just wishing me goodnight or somethingIn my room I had a guitar and keyboard One night around  I woke up to the sound my guitar strumming Assuming it had fallen over I got up to pick it up then when I got there it was still exactly where I left it Confused and a little freaked out I just decided to go back to bed Then the next night I woke up to light I sat up and saw my keyboard lighting up like it was being played Then I got even more freaked outThe bangs along with this demon ghost thing playing with my instruments happened almost every nightDuring the four months I lived in the house I went into a depression Which is really only weird because I never have before or after I didnt do anything I slept all day I didnt eat I was mean to everyone I really hated myself and I contemplated suicide Also I had a migraine Not multiple migraines A migraine that literally never went away the entire time I lived there I tried multiple different prescribed medicines and all of them just made it worseThe weird thing is practically the day I moved out it all stopped I wasnt depressed anymore My migraine went away I was just happy againAfter realizing the coincidence I looked up some stuff knowing that there was something in that house Depression can be form of possession Not as bad as all the stuff you see in movies with them becoming demons and doing back bends and crap But Im positive that whatever was in there attached itself to me And by the way it made me feel it seems like it wanted me to hurt myself This story might not send chills down your spin like some others do but I cant even think about it without being terrified And the weird part is I have to pass that house everyday and Im still drawn to it It feels like home ,It feels like home,9,nosleep,top_week

xDrAlpakax,0,6,1r3mwk,3,If it were any other day I wouldve just walked by completely unaware and uncaring of what would happen if I approached this what I percieved as a man The simple chain of events that occured that day were miniscule and unnoticeable to the naked eye but differentiated the outcome of my life If you can call this life its a prison My personal holocaust Hell Whatever you call it can not be descriptive enough to effectively describe the torture inflicted every dayLet me start by saying I was just a normal kid from the suburbs Imagine a white kid and you had me  years old  pounds  need I get more descriptive I was unnoticeable from the crowd of what seems like millions of other identities that were more important more athletic and more human Not that Im some alien in disguise thats not what this story is about Im just saying that well I didnt play nice with others Id always get into fights at school and in trouble at home But I had a single core group of friends that I could rely on Andy Sam and Marcus That just happens to be where the real story begins when all of us planned a trip up to a cemetery a few miles up the road from my house that had an infamous reputation around my neighborhood Legend had it that there were a few unmarked graves placed in rediculous formations that no one could identify No one knew if they were human corpses or not So I guess thats why we were going up there to solve the mystery solve the puzzle Why and what were these graves When did they get there We left on Friday evening and started walking north to the graveyard The walk there involved the normal teenager conversations youd expect from a couple of rejected kids with no one else to talk to No weird signs chills premonitions nothing Just like we were walking to school Completely normal Normal tell me again what that is I havent caught a glimpse of normal in years Help meWe were nearly there and of course Andy has to stop to piss Like we didnt just leave the house an hour ago Why couldnt you hold it damn it Andy there was probably a public bathroom near the cemetery we were ALMOST THERE As he walked to the woods the rest of us realized that we could see the cemetery from where we were so we yelled at him and told him to catch up to us when he was done As we approached the gates some ravens flew away Actually they didnt fly away necessarily They flew towards us like we werent as dangerous as what lied ahead of us Of course none of us thought anything of it they were just startled birds right Maybe they were I dont know anymore For all I know we all imagined it An illusion created by some other being form your guess is as good as mine We entered the cemetery and walked through the aisles internally mourning for their familys losses Not that we knew the people six feet deep or anything but it was weird its like I was dealing with the deal of a family member or close friend they werent my emotions to bear but they were given to me regardless After we seperately collected ourselves we made our way the the main attraction per say  It was a giant stone monument in the middle of the open area we were stading in It was an angel that was kneeling over a grave and quite honestly it was creepy  We walked up to it and inspected it Its faded color rain stained tears on its face and sheer size were intimidating to say the least but we set up our stuff in front of it because there were no other places to stay After we got done we decided to look for the unmarked graves we walked all this way for We went left first and planned on walking counter clockwisr around the entire place until we found it Left Why left every choice was the wrong choice why not right We started walking past countless graves and once we were walking for a good  minutes and couldnt find anything I felt a hand on my shoulder I looked at Sam and Marcus and they had the same ghostly shocked face as I did They both felt it too We all whipped around to find a man in normal black clothing jeans a black tshirt and jacket and a black hat We came to the conclusion that he was an undertaker or groundskeeper or something and we calmed down a bitWhat do you kids think youre doing said the manSam replied I err we apologize sir We were just looking around to find some weird stuff I guessWell you shouldnt be here youre not safe at night No one is I think well be fine theres just a bunch of dead people Whats the worst that could happen Sam saidYoure looking for the unmarked graves arent youI said How did you knowFollow meWe all thought this guy was weird but weird at most He was scrawny and greasy Not the kind of person you would normally carry a conversation on with But we were all curious and had no idea where we were going At that point something came to my mind wheres Andy I told the man that we had to wait for my friend but he said that he found him earlier and he was taking us to him so we can regroup We hadnt seen him walk back in but we followed nonetheless  He led us to a secluded spot in the woods where we couldnt see the rest of the graves where I surprisingly saw Andy standing unharmed it seemed As we approached him he murmured something which was undecypherable from the distance we were We stepped closer sensing a disturbance as if we were being pushed back mentally but physically we were moving forward like a magnet We got closer and closer and realized that his feet werent feet anymore They were what can only be described as roots binding him to the earth and not letting go His eyes had turned to complete blackness reflecting the darkness that now described his soul There was nothing we could do we tried and tried to get him out of the ground but we couldnt do anything  He was rooted too deep What happened to him We turned around to get help from the groundskeeper but he was gone Andy started to make noises from behind us we thought it was Andy We turned around there was nothing I mean nothing Arid dry barren ground in the dark night Andy was gone the trees were gone graves everything Just nothing I turned to find Sam and Marcus and they were gone Just me alone I began to walk to find some sort of shelter or safehaven or some sort to get out of this place My shoes began to fall apart about an hour into the journey forcing me to take them off and walk barefooted I then walked for a few more hours on my raw bloody feet just hoping for water even a drop So thirsty but I found nothing The last thing I remember from the desert was laying on the earth praying to whoever to get me out  Then I passed out I have no idea how long I was unconcious but I woke up in a small grey room that had a single window on one of the walls I mustered up all the strength that I had to somehow crawl over to it I had will to find out where I was and I did I looked through the window and there was me On a medical table Tubes running from my arms some red some clear some green All alone in this cold metallic room A man walked into the room from a deadbolted door on the right side of the room It was the same man I had seen in the cemetery He walked up to my body and started inspecting me from head to toe looking for something I dont know what After he finished his search he looked up and turned around And stared at me Through the window I am real You will never be again This is the reality and you are trapped inside of your own mind able to go wherever you wish do whatever you want But you will only feel when or what I allow you to Your flesh is mine If I prick out your eyes I may still allow you to see But you will feel the empty cringing pain constantly If I cut off your leg you can still walk But you have to deal with the torture Forever Until I end your pathetic little life which is what it has always been Pathetic  You should thank me actually for now Ive given your life some purpose You serve me nowAnd this is when I looked back at when I was at the cemetery Me Marcus and

LittleMM,0,10,1r2ocz,1,This story happened when I was in collegeMy school is in another town so I had to live in student suites by myselfMy family is not rich and since I have a mild heart defect I always feel weak and dont have enough energy to take a job after class So in order to release at least some of my parents financial burden even though Im a girl I always chose the cheapest dorms to live inIve been living in four different dorms during my college days all very old and small one of them might even be actually haunted but this story is not about any of them at least not fully related Its about something elseOn my way to school theres a juice stand I always stopped by and buy a big cup of freshly squeezed juice after class Oh I forgot to mention I went to night school and school ends at  pmSince I buy juice from them almost every day even on my off days I became quite familiar with the owner and will chitchat with him while hes making juice for meOne day when I was waiting for my juice as usual I noticed that theres something on the ground at the corner of the road not very far from the juice standIts a glass milk bottle with one single yellow flower in it A fivepetal flower with a very short stem and no leavesI was curious and asked the juice stand owner  Did someone died there He answered  I had the same question but not that I know of Since its not such an unusual thing I didnt give it too much thoughtBut after about two weeks I started to notice something oddThe milk bottle was still there and the flower kept staying freshBut theres not even water in the bottle It should dry out pretty quick without waterI took a closer look and confirmed that the flower is not an artificial oneThat means someones been changing the flowers frequently if not dailyI got more curious and asked the juice stand owner if he saw anyone came to change the flowers his answer was noIts actually quite sad to really think of it Its probably someone very dear to the person who brought the flowers that accidentally died there Maybe by a car crash or maybe even a murderI talked about these wild assumptions carelessly and then I said goodbye to the owner with my fresh juice in hand I went back to the dorm my room is the first one on second floor when I was stepping upstairs I could hear two girls chatting and giggling theyre my classmates we took different classes so we didnt meet at school today we were supposed to watch horror video in my dorm today and I totally forgot about it When I reached the second floor I saw them standing in front of my door The guy living next to me saw them at the entrance and let them in They love watching horror videos at my place because the creepy environment offers an extra  ambience We were just talking about how creepy your dorm is  one of them said with a cheerful tongue Even this hallway seems haunted why is it so dim  Added by the other Thanks guys for trashing my lair for me like its not a dump already I smiledThen we watched the video together its overall just another eventless nightThe next day after school when I went for my daily juice to my surprise I found that the bottle of yellow flower was gone It was still there on my way to school Did you see who took the flower  I asked the owner Thats odd I didnt notice that its gone  He answeredI couldnt stop thinking about the yellow flowers on my way back to the dorm I couldnt explain why I was so obsessed by it I was so curious about the mysterious person who brought the flowers and why nobody ever saw himher even when obviously the flowers have been changed so frequently I was walking carelessly with my mind wandering somewhere else and the next moment a scene stroke meThe yellow flower Its there Near the entrance of the parkSomeone moved it there but whyIts not likely that someone died there too is itIts been curiouser and curiouser but I couldnt think of it anymoreThe midterm is approaching and Im only half way doneCant waste my parents money for a bad exam result Yes some of my classes still give exams Thinking of it I walked faster across the parkTheres no one in the part except me and the street lights are so dim they seemed dimmer than usual One street light flashed when I walked pass it I swore towards it  Great now even youre trying to scare me you asshole Then I turned back to the roadThats when I noticed something near the bench about  feet ahead of me suddenly I felt a chill down to the bone the bottle of yellow flower why is it thereDid someone put a bunch of flowers here and there on random spots OrI had to find out so I backtracked to the park entrance no flower there that one was gone So what does it mean Someones moving the bottle around for what And most of all how did I miss himher Theres only one way in this small parkIts not like I could do anything about it so I eventually carried onThis time the same bottle of flower appeared again in front of the convenient store right across the street of my dormPeople were passing by  no one seemed to care and I thought  Why should I  Its obviously none of my businessSo I entered the dorm building and went upstairs but started to think how the bottle of flower seemed to  followed  me the chills came back I almost reached the second floor but I froze at the staircase My body went all stiff I couldnt move my pupils probably dilated like a panicking catIts thereThe bottle of yellow flower sitting there in front of my doorA hundred thoughts flashed by  maybe someones playing a prank on me maybe its a joke but its not funny and by Whom and How I dont wanna know anymore Im moving out of this place I know its nothing to do with my dorm my dorm is fine its not haunted its not the issue but whatever Before I realized I already ran out of the dorm building and was on the way to my friends house and I didnt even remember how I got downstairsI couldnt stop mumbling to myselfI dont know if its a prank or not I dont care I know theres nothing wrong with my dorm its the cheapest but nothings wrong with it and what kind of sicko would do such thing to me Who would it be Who could have knownIts not possible cause I was pretty sure the dorm was empty that day its Saturday and everyone else went home except me That cat it was an accident I didnt mean it but its not possible No one could ever know I dont care Im moving out right away

Motleigh,1,5,1r09ur,3,I was about  or  living in a ranch style house in Southern California when I had one of the creepiest experiences of my life I was sleeping in my bedroom with the door slightly ajar My bed was tucked into one corner of the room The head of the bed was against the same wall as my closet door The closet door was a large sliding mirror The door to my bedroom which was an average door was at the end of my bed When entering the bedroom one would have to walk past the end of the bedSome time in the night I woke up I dont know why I woke up and I dont remember anything in particular waking me The room was lit enough for me to see my bedroom door swing open about a foot I did not see a person open the door I did notice something crawl around the end of the bed and crawl up the side of the bed towards the head of the bedMy first thought was that a dog was coming in but when the thing reached the closet and slid open the closet door I was certain it was not a dog My best description of what I saw is a person crawling on all fours I saw a dark silhouette from the corner of my eye crawl past where I was laying in bed After the closet door slid open the mysterious being crawled into the closet and closed the closet door behind itself I was so terrified that I could not move I laid frozen from fear on my back in my bed until I feel asleep I was too scared to move or scream I was awake for about an hour unable to move before I dozed offThe next morning I woke up slightly confused but I immediately slid open the closet door I was not as afraid because the sun was shining outside and I felt that if it were going to harm me it would have done it already Inside the closet was my usual mess of clothes piled up on the floor There was no monster or animal in there anymore I did forget to check under the bed though,Scared Stiff,8,nosleep,top_week

Foundations,0,0,1rhbzy,3,Read Part  here httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsyngvconnectedIt has been a little over a year since I last wrote  just over a year since the last nightmare  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured that as Dr Lough suggested getting it out of my head and into a journal would helpI read back over my last and only journal entry as I tried to describe the nightmare  It is so chaotic and scattered yet Im unable to find any other way to convey the details  That is the terror of the dream at its core  utterly chaotic  Jerking from one sensation to the next the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion  All of this in layers of sleep  waking to the comfort of my mothers figure only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out with her eerie voice echoing through my bodyYoure connected nowEven now in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages Im struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper  Each detail seems to tie into the next only to fall apart when I try to see the whole  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr Lough could make  Is this what schizophrenia feels like  I have no way to explain it  It is as though there is a novelists grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding  Im fairly certain this entry and perhaps any subsequent entries will be just as erratic  I just cannot force these thoughts togetherSo much has changed in the last year it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me  I have a son now nearly  months old  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father the changes to my life the responsibility it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious  I cant help but think it must have played a role  It has been a blur so many other things seem to have fallen into place  Though they are exciting it seems predetermined somehow rushedOver the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in  I knew I would live there once again  returning it to ownership in my family  though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly  Rachels grandmother died leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together  It was Christmas Day the day she died  I guess her last gift to us  Three months after my son was born we were moving back into the mountains back to the walls I had called home as a boy  One thing I feel for certain this home is the source  The nightmare started here always took place here was always fueled here  Im beginning to remember things or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this houseAs a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase which opened onto a hallway always with my head down staring at my feet  Left at the end of a long hallway was a guest room  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them  Right across a short landing was my bedroom  I had trained myself to never look left at night  as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows  If I would look up I would become stuck in fear with the reflection  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass  My feet became rooted in place the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me  The nightlight would flicker in then out each time causing my shape to jump forward as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness  I never remembered breaking loose turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep  I would wake up in my bed hours later staring at my hands inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare I learned I kept my head down and did not look to the leftOur first night in the home that muscle memory followed suit  After turning off the main floor lights I climbed the staircase  My son was sleeping against my chest his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder  My head was down as I crested the top step turning to the right towards my room which was now his  As I neared the bedroom door his forehead left my shoulder  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head  I didnt need to look at his eyes I knew  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand reaching down the hallway to the windows  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door,Connected Again,3,nosleep,top_week

dagronBorn,1,1,1rcebp,3,For some reason or another the paranormal loves my family No matter where would move or what kind of cleansing ritual we would perform something would make itself known The earliest account that I can personally remember is from the age of five when my family and I had recently rented out an old house in desperate need of repairs My father struck a deal with the landlord that if they were to bring the rent down considerably he would fix up the place which would in turn up the property valueThe house sat on a few acres of land and had toolshed in the back of the property which contained an old sealed off well this doesnt play into the story at all like the ring or some shit like that The house was a small single story home that was separated into two halves by dividing wall but were connected via an old red accoridonstyle doors that had been faded with time The left side of the house was cold Always cold even in the heat of the Texas summer we moved in There wasnt much to the left side of the house except for large sitting room and and old restroom that was filled with old junk that had been left behind by the previous tenants I can still fell the cold upon my skin and the invisible eyes that seemed to stare from every corner of the room Needless to say I never ventured into that room unless I was heading out the front door that just had to be on the left side of the houseThe right side of the house wasnt that bad I never remember it feeling uncomfortably or eerily cold and the feeling of being watched wasnt there The right side of the house contained the living room kitchen my parents room my younger brothers he was just about two years old at this time room  my room and the tiny bathroom we all shared  For the first few weeks everything seemed normal like this was going to be the first place in a long while we wouldnt have to pick and move suddenly my family was like a roaming pack of gypsies when I was younger never staying anywhere for too long But oh did we have another thing comingThe first unexplained phenomena I can remember was the soft sweet voice of a woman who I would sometimes mistake for my mother calling my name I would bound into whatever room my mother was in to see what she wanted only to find out that she had not called for me I brushed it off thinking that I was just hearing things that werent there just a case of a childs overactive imagination Until it kept happening Every God Damn DayThe second thing I noticed were my toys I had fixation as a child to set up all my action figures along my room on whatever ledge was available Window sill Check Dresser Check Makeshift step pyramid like display created from VHS tapes You bet Whenever I would leave my room to visit the restroom or get a drink from the kitchen and then come back to my room my toys would either be facing the opposite direction I had placed them or they would be knocked to the ground with enough force to actually break more than a few And like the voice I tried to explain it away until I eventually started to place my toys in a shoebox under my bed so that they would be safe I still miss all the brave action figures that I lost to that house Rest in pieces my dear friendsThe next few occurrences I witnessed firsthand and they involve my younger brother Cody my brother would be heard giggling and laughing and cooing in his room and if you were to check on him to see what was so funny the rocking chair in the room would cease to rock as if someone saw you come in and stopped rocking And if you attempted to remove Cody from his crib he would scream and cry and reach for the rocking chair When he was older but still young enough to remember he once asked about the ugly lady with the pretty voice who would sing to him and make him laugh One night when we were all sleeping soundly in out beds my father gets in from a long day of construction work only to be greeted by a crying toddler in need of a diaper change My father went into Codys room picked him up and set him down on the changing table After cleaning up my brother and laying him back down in his crib my father was free to go to sleep himself The second his head hit the pillow though he heard a commotion coming from Codys room He gets up grabs his  and checks it out thinking an intruder may have used Codys room as their entrance point Instead he is met with diapers strewn all over the floor There was a shelf above the table that my parents placed the diapers and wipes on and the diapers were stacked neatly enough were they wouldnt tumble He thinks nothing of it stacks them a few less this time and them proceeds to head back to bed Then he hears it again He walks back to the room to find the diapers on the ground again My father stacks them up a little less this time then goes back to bed This same routine happens for the next hour and half at one point he had put a solitary diaper on the shelf only to have it thrown on the ground soon after by some unseen force It was them that my father knew it was time to move againThat next week we rented a uhaul and began packing We had just finished packing and moving everything to the truck and my dad was the last person coming out of the house Everyone else was outside myself included My father had large box he as carrying out to the truck and was passing through the accordion door when something pushed the door shut on him hard enough that it took it my mom and myself to pry it open He at first thought I was playing some kind of joke on him but was even more fired up to leave once he learned I had been nowhere near that doorThe last I heard about that property was when I did a google map search only to find the parking lot of a WalMart I always wonder if they have a problem in the baby aisle Specifically with the diapers ,First they want us gone they they dont want us leave,4,nosleep,top_week

ephique,0,0,1rikrx,4,I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom dad and big sister We were a normal family neither happy nor sad somewhere in between I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs It was also some sort of medicine for me it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes You see my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting I hated it I hated hearing her yell at my poor motherDuring a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad making sure that I didnt have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up I remember jogging most of the route home since my dad sounded so serious It gave me the creeps to say the leastI jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house The kitchen was the first room youd see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably something had definitely happened My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch he told me to sit down as wellI was scared and curious at the same time Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didnt bother caring too much about any of my sisters business so I could figure out that this wasnt about my sister I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say as if he didnt know how to explain something to meFinally after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time He said Your mother and then he needed to grasp some air and he continued Your mother has passed awayI was eight years old and I couldnt grasp that concept I didnt understand death or that my mom was eternally gone I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards godknowswhat I remember thinking how unfair this was I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly he didnt know what to do and he was in shock at the timeMy sister continued crying she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didnt actually care to know at that precise moment She was just being desperate and no one could blame her I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there I thought that was why she was crying so much I didnt shed a single tear I kept it all inside Of course that didnt mean this incident didnt haunt me for years I never stopped thinking about my mother The aftermath of my mothers death is what has been shaping my life the recent years My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital Something I didnt even think existed when I was eight This resulted in that I didnt get to meet my sister very often my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it and I didnt blame him I was guessing that my sister wasnt doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by something that troubled me I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad It felt so dead and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died We didnt do anything I literally spent all time at home in my room making or playing music Me and my dad didnt even greet sometimes when I came home from school it was depressing My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mothers death something that Im about to get intoYou are probably wondering how she died by now and its a legit question to be asking The best answer I could give you is that I dont know My dad has always told me she died of liverfailure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me It didnt add up my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didnt drink I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasnt mature enough to hear the truth In addition to this whenever I asked my dad about this matter hed get heavily upset Nowadays I never ask about my moms death nor do I even bring up mom as a topicYears went by and I ended up being fourteen It kept going like I just described I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house My dad did work he had the nighttime shift at a local bottle factory Im not joking he actually made glass bottles for a living He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job You guessed it the bottle factoryI was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen My school was the type that had an afterschool library that didnt close till  pm I didnt need any of the books or supplies that the library offered I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa Either way I hadnt seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldnt see her again for another two When I arrived at the house the front door was open This is odd I thought Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mothers old jars Its never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door around the lock I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone ready to call the police This is when I heard something coming from inside the house I was dead scared to say the least this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse I didnt know It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor trying to move it It was so dark as well I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights I started to slowly pace into the house walking towards the noise This is where I had to make a decision was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark I picked the former I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window It was my sister naked My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital I switched on the lights in an instant She had redecorated the entire kitchen in the dark Of course it all looked hideous and random she didnt know what the hell she was doing I remember being in a slight discomfort I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life I also hadnt seen her for a good couple of years at all She didnt look very comfortable either she looked like she didnt know who I was and was wondering what I was doing thereI uttered Linda out loud that was her name She didnt respond she just continued standing there looking at me Dont you remember me Im your brother I still couldnt get any feedback out of her it was as if the wheel wasnt spinning at all I wasnt sure what the protocol here was not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured Id try to call dad before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered Dont call dad This is when I realized she couldnt be completely empty inside after allYou dont want to call dad She continued  I had no idea what to do I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place Luckily my dad got home at that point not coming from a finished shift at work He had a good five hours at least left I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation My father ran into the house as fast as he couldThis is when something I didnt expect happened he told me to leave He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house I asked him where I was supposed to go he told me to wait in his car Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didnt think twice about it I ran out to the car As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts I had no clue what the two of them were discussing although I never saw my sister move her lips so Im guessing my dad did most of the talking After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car he joined me inside I remember asking why he didnt bring Linda with him Dont call her that name he shouted in response I was so confused at this point Dad started the car and drove me to my only friends house I didnt see him very often though I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point I didnt really create any friendships I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friends doorbell his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight I didnt even know what was going on to be fairWhatever he told them worked I got to spend the night at my friends place Tims place to be exact It was pretty awkward I remember I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish We got to be deskmates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester so we werent very close It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after I guessed that made it easier for my dad leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to He did but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tims parents both trying to justify me as Tims best friend I dont know Tim didnt have many friends I guessOn the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me as if I was mocking him I remember how desperate he looked as if he had no fire left in his heart He uttered the words Do you think I wanted any of this as he grabbed his hair in regret All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances and Im not blaming you when Im saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours Is what came out of his mouth next I tried to comfort him telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not I really didnt have a lot of cards in my deck at this point I mean my dad was basically losing itWhen we got home he told me that he was sorry and that I should go up to my room I did go up to my room but I got to tell you I was starting to get very anxious about my dad I really wanted to know what the hell was going on I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online I couldnt sleep so pulling an allnighter was my only real option I was reading A Brief History of Time for a science project in school I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes I figured Id go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway I saw my mother standing just outside looking right at me for a fraction of a second Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night I kept thinking about it as I couldnt sleep She looked deranged scared and raw The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white s movie I kept begging for the sun to rise up I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what youll see I might have been fourteen but I can openly admit that I was dead scaredIt finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said I think I need help While holding the glass of juice as if he wasnt sure he was going to drink the rest of it I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasnt sure that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf he thought that could give him some relief I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea jokingly adding that its better than hanging around the house doing nothing He looked offended when I said that something I didnt really understand since he obviously worked all night so that would justify him sleeping through the daysI understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died Well its hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liverfailure I mean it was possible Imagine if it was true and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me Thats the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thingHaving that explanation out of the way I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf I just walked into his room unexpected A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room it looked similar to an office which is nothing hed ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory He was actually sitting at his desk Not only that but the desk was flooded with paperwork of some sort maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day something he could manage from home I didnt ask I had a big enough question for him as it wereI dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured Id sit on it It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable better than standing up anyway Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying You want to know about your sister and what happened the other night Dont you This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt bringing up mom here would have been a carcrash I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me Your sister is not right in the head shes in a mental hospital I couldnt believe he hadnt figured out that I would have known this by then Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didnt know He explained the context telling me that she couldnt take our mothers death A tear started climbing down his cheeks and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine and then I left the roomI realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business I had no idea how Id ever get the truth about my mother out of him When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again the image of my mom started crawling back to me The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway was my mind playing tricks on me I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before Night landed again I hadnt spoken to my father again that day I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought Id see my mother again We all know you can imagine things in the dark kids do it all the time Its as if your mind fills in the gaps but that incident the other night was different I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that Id open the door to the darn hallway and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer Im not going to lie I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out there was no sign of my mother I turned on the lights and went back into my roomStill not wanting to go to bed not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured Id listen through some of my older songs I had loads of them most of which werent very good however I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good especially not at writing my own songs I guess I was decent at playing other peoples songs I basically went through my songs in chronological order it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs Knowing that this wasnt an overworked track yet it was made just days ago and I hadnt gotten around to mastering it yet I figured I wasnt going to give it more of a thought That was until the neurons fired that track was made the day I couldnt sleep the day I saw my mother in the hallway Being a bit gullible I figured that Id give it a go using my acoustic headphones I tried everything I played the song backwards I cut out bass middle frequencies high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples I couldnt hear anything suspicious just that white noise I was a bit disappointed at the same time relieved Although that white noise shouldnt have been there nothing in my room could have made a noise like that I didnt want to overthink the situation so I ended up hitting the bed Later that night as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before slowly dozing off to sleep I hadnt been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when youre in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder I continued lying in bed trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch for the blink of an eye just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again just as the light went on The same stare same face still that black and white filtered look from before I got so shocked I fell down on the floor the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant I wasnt sure what to make of this and I definitely didnt want to tell my father about what I had seen knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldnt let me sleep I just couldnt sleep at all I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become Whatever this all meant and needless to say I didnt get any sleep that night eitherI met my father in the kitchen the next day he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his workcrew later that afternoon I was happy for him he deserved some time out of the stress After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added Have you been thinking of your mother lately As if he could read my mind I told him that I was always missing my mother and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately He stated that he thought I had I had no clue why  Short after that he left for playing golfI kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing In fact I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed how could it have been on I had no idea Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk it got me a slight reminder on how he hadnt gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company I dont know how Id describe it better than that After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address I remember wondering why dad wouldnt show me something like this Daddy why didnt you visit me last weekend I thought you were coming back I was waiting for you Im sorry if I made a scene I thought something had happened to you I ran to you because I wanted answers no one has answers here Ive been getting visits lately why cant you come to me at the same timeI fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five yearold in this state On afterthought I guessed my dad didnt tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasnt in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges Although thinking about it that doesnt sound ridiculously different than a mental hospitalThe rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of workrelated things and records of local policeinvestigations Why would my father be looking into cases of murder pedophilia rape and almost anything you can think of It wasnt really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up I knew he had a friend in the police force that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them I didnt even want to know at the time I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadnt slept in far too longI apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that Im dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there Im only taking precautions to make sure that Im telling it right If Im finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work which made complete sense It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar This time I wasnt using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time I wasnt worrying about that I was thinking about my mother showing herself again Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itselfNot too long into that night I started feeling sick of being indoors for so long and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing I remember being on the sane side of the fence thinking critically and trying to find solutions not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell I figured Id take my bike down to a local gas station not more than ten minutes from my house I wanted some chips candy and maybe a couple cans of soda I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off I got there faster than I thought I would It wasnt cold outside either it was a pretty smooth night After grabbing some generic brand of chips Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left I didnt spend much time in the store but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen With no bike feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home Something out of the ordinary happened after this and I wasnt even sure if I was seeing things at first I was walking on this huge open road I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road It was tied together with the forest behind our house It was the type of road that didnt have any traffic other than truck drivers passing once every couple of hours at night I didnt want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what youd imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear I assumed she was looking for me she was definitely staring at me I continued walking not necessarily fearing my sister It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her that she would never have done anything to hurt me As I approached her she didnt give me any response what so ever she was just staring at me in a lightblue scrubcoat looking lifeless I had reached talkingdistance I couldnt believe this was happening It felt surreal like one of those scenarios you cant be prepared for in real life She had started to shake a bit I couldnt tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous I asked her if she was looking for me out there and if she had escaped the hospital She didnt respond I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me as if I was a threat to her After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it She started to slowly bring it forth it was a plastic bag From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasnt heavy or dangerous for that matter I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag then she started to stretch it out to me I took this from your house the other day Im sorry I think this belongs to you Jonathan I do realize that I never told you my name it is indeed Jonathan I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even she seemed to be so out of it I remember grabbing the plastic bag she wouldnt let go of it too lightly either it was as if she still wanted it After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence she wouldnt stop staring into my eyes during these Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad Shortly after she started walking towards the forest as if she knew where she was heading I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dads car acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister I didnt even know if I wanted him to catch her or not she was purposely running away from him He dragged her into his car and they both drove away heading the direction he was originally going This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times Something wasnt right I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasnt anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school but that doesnt change the logic of it He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thingI ran the rest of the way home trying not to drop anything I still had all the items I bought at the gas station I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did I had no clue whenever he would get back and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me I couldnt spot my dads car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house I didnt bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything I made my way back to my room as fast as I could I dont really know why but I locked the door after me as if there was something to fear I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me I never really thought of something until now and that is how my sister could have found me It must have been a coincidence or she had been following me for a while knowing she couldnt approach me in the store I dont knowI looked into the bag it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever for example there was a roll of tape in there I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos most being after mom died The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks they werent even dry I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag There was only one thing left in the bag an usbstick I took the stick out and threw away the bag Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasnt sent to the hospital yet but it was pretty much pending already In fact most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away On one of them its my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing she actually wasnt acting too badly the first couple of weeks I guess she didnt process our mothers death until later or something Another photo is of dads old car he had to sell it in order to compensate for our familys financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had my mothers candle business He loved that damn car with his entire heart we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter x behind them It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking I figured my sister must have had done this for what reason I was about to find out I kept staring at the first picture it was the one I told you about earlier the one of my fathers old car It was a Pontiac from the early s and it must have cost him a fortune I never had any particular memories of the car I remember it spending most of its time in our garageI kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadnt use the car more he obviously loved it The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper for selling it of course I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat It wasnt very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent She had the same drainedout appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room and this was taken after her death I couldnt believe what I was looking at I remember dropping the photo out of shock so many thoughts started circling inside of my head I have my whole story theres a k letter limit on reddit NoSleep Ill post it as soon as I can ,I want to tell about my mother,4,nosleep,top_week

InsanityInABottle,0,1,1rgw03,2,Extra Extra The Piggy killer is at it again Yelled the paperboy holding a darkened paper above his head screaming the same phrase over again as if it was no big deal I walked towards him and asked him How muchOnly ten cents sirHa Must be a pretty good story then I said as I fumbled for a large dime I handed it into the boys hand its gleam bouncing the light of the sun veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper quickly turning from the boy hearing How about a tip sirHow about you wipe your ass with the metal Ive already given you I said back to the boy who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers As I walked along Heros Avenue I kept the paper open reading it over again In large font shouted Piggy killers new victim with a picture of a woman apparently known by the name of Jessica Turrow She wore a large smile on her face as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast I presumedThe article read The psychopath depicted as a man with a pigs head on worn over his own face has struck again Witnesses described him as large while wearing a reddened trench coat then finally a bib which read the term KISS THE COOK slathered neatly against his chest in gore He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn We had identified the victim through a ring found on the hand of the woman who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description contact the police immediately or you may be his next victimI laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another threading the needle on the two way street not large enough for two cars to fit onI walked towards the police station which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop a brothel and a printing office A police car drove by its loud horn sounding flashing red and white reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes I walked into the station the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose A man screamed from across a large waiting room looking down at the paper then looked up and said Oh Its the wonderful Flynn Of course my dear come come I walked past him glaring at his smug face and then opening the door into my officeA man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me He smiled and said Well hello sir I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killerThe pig oneY wait there are moreI believe there are just they might not like attention as much as our friend hereWell thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer coming out of his lairThe man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk arranging them appropriately So if you look at these pictures it was for when he first got into the business holding small weapons all identifiable all related to the cutting of meat Then as you look to the left these are the later pictures which are of him coming out holding bodies on his shoulders sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself all the while in his pig mask But he seems to be getting careless He cam outside barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo his face seemed veiled in something Something sticky something gruesome But if you look closer you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face Large hooked nose eyes clouded in blue teeth sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouthHa So youre basically implying that youve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it I beginning to suspect youre the killerBut that would be silly Why would a crazy give himself awayI dont know why dont you tell meI believe this conversation is getting a bit heated I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought Id tell you where Ive seen such events Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on  Bellcove Street Well theres your place Sir said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag which smelled of defecation and nickels I watched as he slammed the door then sighed and sat down on my desk rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter updating the information Ive received from the manMysterious man visits police station says he has a lead on the piggy killer As you all know the notorious killer has crossed the line now Enough to even be called a serial killer What a sick bastard he is I continued being as pessimistic as possible updating the paper then grabbing my camera as I finished the article Typing in my name finishing with my name saying Written by Flynn CovetailDarkness was beginning to shroud the air perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment Light rain was spattering against my window racing down to the bottom of the screening only to fall against an umbrella below As I left my office throwing on my coat I screamed to the man in the front desk Going out tooh lets see Bellcove Street If I dont come back Phone someone I said with a laugh while walking outsideInstantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on Western Lagoon highway as the frivolously worthless people would say I walked down towards the street which was naught but four blocks from here I passed by Dontells Donuts Redgars Rotisserie and Salams Spices all involved in the fattening of desperate cops as only fattening diners were located near the station so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against usI reached the butchers place which had been looted to hell by the anarchists who were just a group of thugs that didnt do shit to overthrow the government The door had been pried off its hinges yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe Within the butchery the first thing I noticed was a bed a homeless man sleeping on itI simply ignored the bum and walked around searching for anything considered suspicious I walked through the door smelling the bums shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could I looked through the shop behind the counter I found several rusted knifes which were corroded to the counter which was a wooden rotten thing with three cutting boards lining it all of which nobody needed The front of the shop seemed completely normal but I listened to the bum waking instantly screaming Whos there I will kill you if youre trespassing on my property I laughed and screamed to him I suggest you run out of here or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor running towards meI quickly turned backing up against the wall my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE I shot to the side of the man who quickly bolted for the door a rat following closely behind him I sat for a minute catching my breath while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion As I stood I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my headHa Damn fool didnt even know what he had coming Shouldnt have fucked with my grandpa shouldnt have yelled My ears hurt Are they ringing Why the FUCK am I here I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face the pigs blood leaking down my neck warming me keeping the cold away I looked at my setup which was simply the back room of a butchers shop a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a roomBlood dripped into wooden bowls Id gotten from the shop the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling Pigs cows chickens even a few deer but the most stubborn of prey the pigs The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling their wrists cut their feet missing their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths The damned pigs that walked the streets reading their stories about who About me The beautiful man who is dealing righteousness to the crazies to the rich Though they think that theyre so safe in their leather homes they should be the ones making chairs their dried hides need to be a part of furnitureOh what an inventor I will be But the best part is nobody looks twice at the photographer Nobody looks at whos behind the camera they only care about the picture And I am finally the one in the picture Flynn the little anus that believed he owned the whole world because the police were backing him up NO NO NO YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCHI whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express I raise him in the air catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck This selfconceited asshole needs one thing A hook curving through the cheek wrenched from his cheek He thought I was the killer NO THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORDOh My friend is waking up Finally a new toy to play with Oh what a joy he will be Oh no What will I say to him I guess Ill just wing it I guess Ill just talk to him  Where will I display this beauty Ooh The police station Mmm how delectable would that be To show the pigs that even their weapons cant defend them from me THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME I am a hero I love being a hero and dont try to talk me out of my heroism I AM AMAINGMy eyes slowly opened to find a man in a pig mask the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on its face I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts Why does my leg hurt Where the hell am I Oh youve awakened spouted the pig its squeaky voice ringing through my ears I screamed Help me Help HES GOING TO KILL ME Now thats not how you treat a guest is itFuck youOh language language my dear friend If you even try saying something like that I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend MrSqueaks over hereI looked to where he was pointing which was a large column in the room a decomposing rat nailed to the pole Somebody is going to catch you They know where I amOh I believe they do if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say said the phsyco with a smile He pointed at the ceiling which had two hooks on it chains hanging from them and a headless man blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness into a wooden bowl Why are you doing this to these peopleOkay okay story time Oh yay stories FUCK OFF GREG THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINEI looked at the pig with doubt pain shooting up my leg throbbing slowly into my brain SO let me tell you why I love my job okay Okay So when I was twelve I thought Im going to take pictures of weddings Im going to take pictures of people in love because everyone elses happiness is mine He said this while pinning his right hand against his heart which contained an extra few layers of flesh sewed against his own along with a tattoo stolen from his victimOkay so anyways What do ya know Im doing that now I am a photographer I love people being happy SO I one day was at this one glorious wedding full of lovely people I had started talking to a woman and a little oh what is it called Fetish of mine was developed As we were in bed I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know I have a few other kinks I wrung my hands around her delicate throat stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth I felt the rush as eventually she started to fuckin bleed WHAT A WHORE She began to cough up blood she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched did I realize how wonderful blood tastes Rich creamy delicious blood coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps I invented ways of sucking people dry licking them dry Well at first I was only an amateur but as I got better Oh BOY did I start to love my job Every wedding became a slaughter every wedding gave me a new friend because after all nobody cares

ReiKoroshiya,0,0,1rgsca,2,Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me outhow about I start at the beginning that seems easier Well back in elementary I was that kid the kid that really no one liked I had a friend here and there but thats about it I was basically a social outcast I never really got my work done I still dont Note that I was a very very angry child and no I was not spoiled if thats what your thinking im the oldest of  kids who had been and are growing up in poverty but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheapI had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the rd grade I found an author by thename of RLStine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interestsA few of the simple things had scared me and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind I dont remember much about my childhood at allI dont know why I cant but thats just how it is I do remember bits and pieces though not anything like birthdays mind you Here Ile give some examples I rememberwhen I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away Years later I went back and found it and of course it wasnt scary anymore Another examplewould be when I saw a witch in my closet but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back onOnce he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the roomand they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently about it I cant remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldnt understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bedI got top bunk Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years not much reallythey dont seem to want to talk much about when I was younger I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of mekeep in mind I dont remember that about going to church as a matter of fact I dont remember going to church at all hmmm well skip forward to middle school where I hadactually made friends I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny I could barely even go a week without at least one detention Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too nowdrugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I meancertain ones that is the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do smoke drink etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and thereis no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I cant afford it and because of that im drug free Not to muchhappened in middle school only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so ifsay I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it I also talk in my sleep which sucks ass The vast majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be homefree I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldnt consider it a nightmare I got my own room in the basement which was nice and well my brother he was how do you put it Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that Electronic malfunctions had started occurring like waking up to my radio playing static my alarm clock started to malfunction etc I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear Skip forward to highschool in the th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a changeI read the hell out of creepypastas and found some really cool narrators for them listening to those was very enjoyable I didnt read scps often and I found a very long series called the holdersNear the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didnt have a bad feeling to it the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any senseJump forward one more year I had flunked my freshman year because I dont do my work On those professional tests that they make you take SATs or some shit I did insanely good on those like I should be an A student overall Now i reside in alternative ed Im  right now I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead ofBaptist a few months ago Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymoreThat thing I actually saw it I fucking saw it it was short like about a foot and a half tall I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleepwith my blankets over my head Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it Ithink it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day It might have seen me and it might be watching me type thisIt is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really really dark everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around itIf anyone knows what this might beplease tell me,My Life,2,nosleep,top_week
highchairchildren,3,1,1rgqmu,2,Im looking for any input If anyone has had experiences like this is there a way to stop itSo this started about two years ago In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling like something bad was going to happen all the time  I was anxious always alert and never at rest I hardly slept primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer Then I started seeing thingsWhen I say seeings things I dont mean like hallucinations well not really Im not crazy There were never any voices and there never have been It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes Mostly accidents  It happened once while I was sledding  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about  ft or so where it met a busy road Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by There was blood everywhere I snapped back to reality and looked around Everything was fine There was no blood nobody was hurt just kids sledding around having fun I continued to have random visions for the entire year They varied in severity The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash  As I was seeing it I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed begging me to stop  I snapped back and couldnt speak I teared up and thought I was going to puke  I ran to the bathroom washed my face sat down on the ground and cried I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life I got up and reentered the kitchen finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldnt come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldnt afford Then it stopped As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than Id had before  It stayed away for a while I mean really a long time  I was vision free for an entire yearI was prompted to write this because I had another one the other  The first in over a year but I am scared I dont want it to start again  The most recent one was more subtle  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain  Then I flashed back and it wasnt there I hadnt even cut myselfI know this must sound crazy like some Final Destination bullshit  I swear to you I wouldnt have posted it if I didnt have hopes that someone could help  Any input is welcomed,Can anyone help,3,nosleep,top_week
gogo,1,4,1rdw2r,0,You know when you are really young youre afraid of the dark You get a night light to make it better but there is always that sense of fear Is it simply because its dark maybe theres a monster in your closet or maybe its just in your nature Sure your parents tell you its nothing and when you get older you grow out of it but there is always something in the back of your mind that makes you afraid of it Maybe your claustrophobic of the thought of the darkness surrounding you consuming you to the point where you are trapped not seeing the light again Maybe your afraid something is watching you sleep Someone who you dont know just watching waiting for the right time to do whatever he or it wants to do Kill you Kidnap you to a horrible place maybe Then you think its all in your head and its just fine Until you hear a noise and you see the door opening and you dont even remember seeing whatever it is ever in your life its a tall dark humanoid staring at you with bright eyes It reaches its hand with such long fingers at you and it comes towards you It puts its hand over your mouth leans towards you it says shhhhh and it reveals a hideous smile  ,The Dark,4,nosleep,top_week
cavs,7,2,1rd3m8,1,The following is a recount of a dream I had last night  This is my first time posting here and writing something like this so Im sorry if its poorly written or riddled with mistakes  Also Im awful at titles  Thanks for reading I struggle to stay awake at my deskGo home cavs theres nothing going on todayThank you  Why was I even here today its SaturdayGrumbling to myself I drag my feet to the car get in and turn the key  Nothing  Just great  Well at least its only about a threemile walk home  I pocket my keys and think about grabbing my rescue knife for just a fleeting moment  Its not the best of neighborhoods but I should be fine walking home  Leave itAs I make my way down the street passing one unspectacular building after another I notice an attractive woman walking a few steps ahead of me  I smile to myself and try to remember the last time Ive been with a woman  She glances back notices me leering at her like an inexperienced teenager She slows down  Is she smiling at me Hey there youre looking a little down  Whats wrongNnothing Its a wonder I was able to stammer out any sort of reply  Shes gorgeous why talk to me  Soft face with bright blue eyes that I could only stare at in wonder Plump lips coated in pink oily lipgloss  Her jet black hair billowing lazily in the wind  That damn smile  Well I was looking to have a good time and youre more than welcome to join me hun  For a price Oh now it makes sense Well screw it why not I nod my head in reply and agree  I follow her mind wandering onto moreprimal needs  I should have been paying attention to my surroundings noting the darker and more abandoned area where I was being led  Were walking up old brittle concrete steps that must have been laid down decades ago before I think clearly again  Too late to take note of my surroundings now  The iron railing I grasp is cold and worn down but rough from all the years of exposure  The air is thick heavy and smells moldy  How can someone even breathe in thereWe enter the loft  Was there something on the door  Did she give me a name I cant remember anything What was I doing here again  My view suddenly shifts to something out of an old video game  I get a birds eye view of the place Its all pixelated bit graphics  One other woman was walking around but I cant make out any of her features  This isodd  I feel a light touch on my shoulder and the whisper of soft words stealing my attention away from everything else to once again focus solely on her  Her breath was warm causing shivers to tremor throughout my body  My view violently shifts back to my own eyes  I look to the beautiful mysterious woman with nothing but a blank look in my eyes  Make yourself comfortable on the bed over there  Well have to wait for our bodyguard to get her before we can have any fun  He cant make it until the night so until then relax I should have found that last statement weird  What time was it  Wasnt it dark out when we were walking here  Why do we have to wait for a bodyguard now  Im already here  If I were to do something wouldnt I have already done it  Forget it  I flop onto the bed and lay down on my back right leg extended while the left is pulled up as if Im mirroring the number four with my legs  The other indistinguishable woman joins us  She cuddled up next to me on my right side further emptying my head of what little rational thoughts I had left  That sweet voice was back in my left ear talking to me as if I was the most important person in the world  When did she make it onto the bed  Wasnt she just standing by the doorway  She drapes her unnaturally soft leg over my left leg and blithely draws random designs onto my chest with her fingertips Alright baby relax well be having fun before you know itI cant wipe this stupid smile off my face  I close my eyes for what seems like a moment  When I open them something is wrong  Very wrong  The room that seemed so inviting is now dark and cold  I cant see a doorway just an empty shadowy space that seemed to stretch open like a hungry maw twisting my vision as the room seemed spin uncontrollably  My heart pounds in my chest  I look to my right where the other woman once was  Shes gone  The familiar weight is on my left but I cant move my leg  I need to get up  I need to leave  I cant be here anymore  Get off me  The form next to me shifts straddles me  Her arms are straight each palm flat firmly planted next to my shoulders  The long black hair is in my face  I can feel it faintly brush against my skin  I try to move her off of me but she wont budge  Im pinned down like a helpless prisoner  She slowly begins to raise her head  I notice her once beautiful eyes are now shut  Bulged gray eyelids are all that I can see  Her entire face is now dull pocked with blemishes  I start to breathe heavily close to hyperventilating  The head continues to rise  Wake up  Oh God wake up Sometimes wrong  I try to move again  My legs wont work  My arms wont work  I cant tear away my eyes from her dead leaden face  I start to scream  My eyes snap open  Im home in bed  I still cant move my legs  Theres heavy pressure on my chest and I cant stop breathing heavily  Theres a slight outline of a woman above me face now unrecognizable  I can still feel her hair on my face   Get it off  Was she laughter at me before I woke up Roll over  Turn on the TV or light or something Anything  RelaxrelaxIm never sleeping on my back again   ,Lookin for a Good Time,3,nosleep,top_week
Johnvincent,0,2,1rbvri,1,The closest thing I have ever documented to a legitimate ghost is a photo that my aunt took last month My family mother three aunts five cousins and six or seven secondcousins went to visit my grandparents on their farm in Cairo New York The little sparsely inhabited town is about  miles north of NYC and about a three hour drive from our home on Long Island Ive been visiting my grandparents up there for years now and have been visiting the farm every summer since I was born and winter too since my grandparents moved there permanently after they sold their home on LI about  or  years back Im very comfortable up there even though nights are sometimes a bit eerie due to the streetlights being either nonexistent or widely spread and the nightly barking of wild dogs in the woods surrounding the houseAnyway Im going to try to keep this brief To the story nowMy aunt and her boyfriend are recently engaged and my aunt used this little opportunity to bring up her boyfriends parents who are Italian immigrants with them to meet my grandparents This was the first time they ever met in person and the two couples seemed to hit it off quite quickly It made sense because my grandfather is Italian and pretty much thought that my aunts boyfriends parents were really nice and intriguing people I suppose The time passed quickly and before anyone knew it it was  AM My aunt and her boyfriend decided it was time to take his parents down the road to their rooms at the Bavarian Manor The Manor is a  year old Inn that spans many acres and boasts gorgeous lakeside rooms and a peaceful atmosphere As well as some pretty spooky vibes now and then when the hour is lateSo my aunt and her future husband took his parents down the road walked them to their rooms and then back down the stairs and started to head back through the lobby when my aunts boyfriend stops Hey this is weird Did you feel thatMy aunt looked at him puzzled No What are you talking aboutHe shook his head I dont know I think I just felt something pass us Something coldMy aunt said at that point she actually did feel a little cold and this scared her She wanted to leaveWait he said Lets just take pictures Just one each me and you of the lobby and if we dont see anything well get out of here I just have this weird fucking feelingMy aunt just looked at him and agreed to do it because she just wanted to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible So she took a picture And then he took a picture He looked down at his and frowned Nothing he grunted What about youHe looked over at my aunt and her face was utter stoneWhat What are you looking at He moved closer and peered over her shoulder He shivered as he stared down at the phone and saw thisImgurhttpiimgurcomSAEOfThey then sped home and showed everyone who was still awake the photo Everyone seemed to have the same reaction Complete and total shock No one could believe their eyes and as a family of believers in the supernatural we all felt a little shaken to have this even if it is but a shred proof from a source in our own family who we know is honest and has no reward to gain in something like this She just snapped the photo And thats what came out in it I still get the chills thinking about going back up there again which Ill be doing next week the day after Thanksgiving and for the whole weekend Id be lying if I said I wasnt preparing to venture over to the Manor to do some Hunting of my own For reference heres the official website for The Bavarian Manor httpwwwbavarianmanorcomAnd heres an article that a fellow Redditor wrote based on my account with the photo included httpwwwhauntedreliccomghostinthewindowatthebavarianmanor,The Lady in White at the Bavarian Manor,3,nosleep,top_week

began to do bad in school my grades were not the best My mother had worked so hard for us and all i could ever think was about how lonely i felt I had my brother at my side but it always fell lonely My heart had become a cold hard rock always wanting to be loved but unable to   years had already pass and i still remember how it felt cold and yet so comforting It felt like it understood me and yet it felt so cold I had always being a rebellious kid always speaking my mind out Never accepting what others thought is the right thing I had developed my own acceptance of reality i had to grow up fast and i was surprised at how childish the decisions of other kids were i laugh at them i saw them as lowly living creature But those were my supposed friends Always lonely no matter where i went i

worthy of someones live i had done something real bad that night Me and my brother were locked up in my old house It was a flat with  rooms it was old and falling to the ground there were cracks all around the windows were holding up somehow My ant was really angry at me and my brother she had always threaten us saying that she would lock as up in that place The place was were i was born it was the place where i had grown up it was the place where i saw my mother cry every day Since the new house was built there was no need for me to go to the old house There was nothing there after all All empty and always so cold  This night was no different everything was so dark the only light you could see was the moon light i could feel a chill going down my spine i could feel my heart feeling been comforted i felt like i belonged Since we moved to the new house i couple of years ago that place always scared me Every time i went there i always left runningi always felt like something was always

see the moon and the starts thousands of them yet it was so dark and as always so cold We screamed so much we felt as if our energy was being sucked in my something  I felt week and light headed  It suddenly got colder and colder it was past midnight after all it only gets colder Suddenly we hear something scratching the door as if it wanted to get in and couldnt It fell desperate my aunt had the key and only her could open the door There was no other way of opening it There was no key sound nothing everything fell as if space had been altered somehow No key sound and the door just opened No words nothing no one said anything Me and my bother was left the room as if nothing had happened as if it was something we been used to seeing We were walking side by side and he stayed behind I cold had touched my shoulder i touched its had and i felt a cold metal around his finger I never got to hear his voice but i new that he told us to just go and he will come later after he closes the door The night was cold and my heart didnt feel cold anymore i just fell so much sadness i no longer felt lonely although i always kept wishing to have someone who would love me for who i am We walked down to the new house it was two story house the biggest house in the whole town It had big windows As we saw walked down we looked at the window a shadow rush upstairs the night was quiet and we never heard doors being opened or close I didnt fell scared it was as if i knew who it was and i knew nothing wrong or bad would happen to be or my little brother Me and my brother were the only guys living in that house and my aunt was staying there that night it was her turn to sleep over her sister and her used to take turns everyday to take care of me and my bother There were no men living there and there never was I never gave it much thought All the entrance doors in the house were locked he had to climb our way up to the second floor to get in the house When we went into the room where my aunt was she was sound sleep and didnt wake up till the next day After  years i finally met my mom and finally met my dad I told them what had happened that night I told them about the ring i told them about him  At first they told me that it was probably my aunt trying to teach us a lesson but she wasnt that tall no one can be that cold and no one in my family wore a ring  later on i asked my mom again and she finally told me that i while ago my one of my uncles used to sleep there when he was drunk He was tall man was married and never had any kids of his own One day i still remember hearing that they had found him death in his room He had hanged him self living everyone of his family wondering why he had done it No one knows till now Without knowing me and my brother had called him had

JBalz,0,11,1r42ha,1,Two winter breaks ago my mother was claiming that she was seeing demons around the house for sometime now she is very mentally unwell My brother got into an argument about it They were upstairs while I was downstairs at the completely other end of the house My brother just shouted theres no demons in the house when I started to notice a rattling sound We have these French doors that we hung stain glass pictures and animals on My dog started growling under her breath looking at the door I walked over to check it out The only one rattling was a stained glass picture of Jesus As soon as I got to the door the picture fell to the floor at my feet I jumped back and a chill ran through me The picture did not break I put the stained glass back up and tried shaking the door in different ways but I could not even get it to rattle an inch I didnt tell anyone for awhile because I didnt want to encourage my Moms fantasies I swear to God that it actually happened to me and was the weirdest experience in my life,True ghostdemon story,12,nosleep,top_week
EyeHuxinfiniteplus,5,0,1r1irm,1,httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsnpkhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsnaxitheworstthingieverheardSo a little over a year ago I posted a couple of different things that happened to me back in  There were a couple of things that happened between here and there that I never got around to posting too Anyway here I am Over a year later in the hopes that someone can help me because something similar has recently happenedSo while the other stories took place in NC this all happened in MD It happened about a week or two before Halloween And all of this was very close together and it all happened at my girlfriends house in Baltimore Arbutus area for the locals Her mom and younger brother have been living with her for almost a year now until her mom can get back on her feet due to some unrelated personal issues Im only bringing this particular thing up in case someone may find it relevant Her brother is  Mom shes over  if not right at  NowAfter dinner one night we were all sitting around the table talking I excused myself to go shower I have to get up at  in the morning and generally just shower the night before work so Im not in a groggy rush So Im in the shower and theyre doing whatever it is they do as far as I know I remember and never will forget probably the feeling of something tap me on the shoulder It didnt necessarily feel like a finger I pushed it out of my head almost immediately thinking I had brushed the wall or a towel or something And that was it That was all that happened in there I got out dried off and put on some clothes and left the bathroom It was quiet in the house No chatter no tv and no video games I just assumed everyone went to bed and headed upstairs to the attic bedroom my girlfriend sleeps in It was dark minus the flickery light that turned out to be a bunch of candles in the middle of the floor My girlfriend and her mother playing with a Ouija board They asked if I wanted to play and I simply refused Part of me wanted to leave because those things make me uncomfortable as it is But I just layed down on the bed and tried to sleep Mostly watching them Mostly feeling uncomfortable whenever one of them giggled about it or laughed and said it was stupid which bothered me quite a bit They were done when after the second or third try mom turned the disc or whatever its called upside down and said she was done They put it away and that was that It dawned on me later that whatever I felt in the shower would have happened about the time they started with their ouija seancesSo a few nights later Im back at her house I havent heard of anything and honestly put the whole thing out of my head That night I woke up at almost the exact same time she did I looked at her while she looked forward to the head of the bed and immediately screamed And not like a jumpy something at the movies jumped out at me scream Pure terror I pulled her close and cradled her and didnt see or notice anything I turned on the light Nothing was there What she described to me was so horrifyingly familiar She said at the head of the bed not  feet away stood a figure Not actually standing though More like bending over and reaching out for her She told me two days later what actually woke her up was she heard something talking in the room that said in a whisper what should we do with her Thats when she looked up and everything happen I did make a mental note that it was after  oclock The only reason I noted it is because after calming her down realizing I had less than an hour until I had to go to work She got up and left when I left The reason I say this one in particular is horrifyingly familiar and wanted me to come to you with this in the hopes someone may be able to help me figure something out is if youll read the story at the top  its almost the same thingNow Im an atheist I havent prayed in years And my girlfriend knows this Im not against it Ill pray along to be respectful if the family is praying at dinner or at a funeral But one night she woke me up shaking Telling me that the room didnt feel right And she was scared She asked me to pray with her Like she wanted me to say a prayer for protection I didnt know how to react but this was extremely out of the ordinary for her So I went with it And after a minute of reaching into the back of my head for things to say she started breathing slower Calmer She let me finish then thanked me and said I think it worked She laid down and eventually we both fell asleepThe only things other than little squeaks and creaks which could honestly just be the house being a house and making house noises was when she was downstairs trying to sleep I guess She didnt sleep in her room for a while unless I was there and as I just recently moved to night shift thats been a lot Anyway she said she heard her brother upstairs leaning in the chair which he does while he plays on his laptop So she sends him a text A simple stop leaning Not a minute later the text comes back and says Im in bedThats all I know or have heard for right now Ive spent fewer nights there since all that happened Her mom burned sage in the room or whatever the cleansing plant is sage right Said some prayers And Im hoping thats it,So this recently started happening again,1,nosleep,top_week

bassslapper,0,2,1rh8lh,0,You think me cruel No Ive only learned to act on what Ive been given Ive learned to deal with my problems in my own way No one understands this but me it seems This is for ME I dont do it for them But they cant understand my need He cant either I must make me Make him understand How did he get here I wish I came back I want him back WHY WONT I COME BACK WHY IS HE HERE ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORPast this the note is unreadable spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people Not that Id really want to read much more anyways I already know what happens Well not really know but I can feel it Who wrote it I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson if hes even my uncle What is this No clue A note obviously but beyond that speculation reigns Where did I find this My new house in a drawer Nothing is inherently terrifying about that  Oh except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there I just missed it before I keep telling myself I half believe it A few pills later and Im not worrying about it anymoreBefore this I didnt even know I had an Uncle Drewson let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely but now enacted demise With a heavily estranged family growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility one loses track of aunts and uncles It was in a familiar neighborhood a spacious three bedroom so I was in no way eager to turn it down As a poor regularly unemployed person Id been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldnt afford anywhere else I thought itll all be worth it one day the day I make it in the world I can pay all these people back tenfold The day I make it yeah right A consistent  and more pressingly free  living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes So I was moved in within a couple weeks Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life I was contentYou know when you think back to something embarrassing stupid or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger brasher days Once you recall it it starts eating away regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts till you would give the world to go back and change it or at least erase the memory Imagine that only you cant remember what it was youve done Its simply gone from you The more you try the less you realize The less you realize the more you regret The more you regret the more you try Thats whats happening to me ever since I moved here But it even goes past that Its the sudden feeling youre being watched from barely out of sight And at the same time a crushing loneliness in that feeling I pop a few more pills Of course Im not being watched Theres no one else here If you think youre being rather clever figuring this out ohnosomeonesbeeninthehousewithyouallalong I was most certainly the only one here Anyway this was about the time I found the note If it was this Drewson what is he talking about Who does he want back What is his need Do I even want to know the answer to any of these Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do personal preference notwithstanding Putting it all to the back of my mind I chop up steak for dinner I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef particularly where matters of slicing andor dicing are concerned I once worked a sushi bar as a side job to pay the bills and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe like you see in commercials Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customers eyeball Maybe Im not quite as proficient as I thought I grab the bottle of pills and take a few I dont really like thinking about that time in my lifeIm digging through my drawer later that same drawer when I stumble upon another discovery Instead of a clue it only deepens my mystery A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board I carefully remove it and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses I think this will perhaps answer some questions about the note and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusions implications As per your previous assumptions I couldnt be farther from the truth I secure the stick in its dock View files Two folders Reminders and Media Reminders is empty media contains one subfolder Vids I open the folder Two more memories and triggers Memories is empty I open triggers Im confronted with one video file shotinthedarkwmv Its  long I press playBefore I continue if youll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this Im a massive horror movie fan and I like them brutal The more blood and guts the better I like truly graphic heart wrenching stuff and I very rarely squirm at it Three seconds into shotinthedarkwmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out The scene Im immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs There is a single light source on the chair but I can faintly make out a figure in the background Then without a word the mans brains are ejected out his face accompanied with a thunderous bang Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life likely flooded by fear but life I dont have too much time to process anymore Im preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket I think it must be fake but I know its not Ive got to tell someone about this I think the police someone Yeah Ill talk to the cops Then over my subsiding retching I hear a familiar voice utter Are you sorry now in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler Something in that voice is chilling Something I return my gaze to the computer screen where the barely visible figure now stands in full view

InsaneFang,2,2,1rdykh,0,It was a very dark night I opened my eyes in the dark and I watched the shadows stretch over my room The trees moved in the night air and made the shadows in my room move and form together and look like monsters I watched the shadows which actually do not help to watch for they only offer uneasiness to the human soul and you find no comfort If I hadnt watched those shadows I wouldnt have noticed the slight movement that didnt go exactly with the shadows It was dark and I felt I was probably seeing something But I thought I saw a dark shape in those shadows It moved like the shadows but it moved slower and I thought I heard the soft scrape of a boot I watched the shadows ever moving I felt fear grip my heart I felt there was something there just watching me silently in those darkest shadows I wanted to hop out of the bed and rush out the door but I feared that if my feet touched the floor then that thing or something else would surely get me I heard a sound from behind me and being in the frightened state I was in I about fell out of the bed Clinging to the side of the bed tangled in the blankets and sheets I felt like I was about to die I looked up for the source of the sound and it was just a tree branch scratching the window I felt relieved at this and I kind of relaxed forgetting about the thing in the shadows I pulled myself back into my bed turned and saw a darkened shape at the end of my bed I felt the fear shoot through me again I felt no thoughts nothing only the cold dark fear I watched as the shape moved ever closer to my bed I felt paralyzed as if I couldnt move speak or let alone do anything The shape moved ever closer I felt a sound coming from the back of my throat but it never escaped my lips My mouth did not open nor did the sound fully come out The shape soon climbed slowly onto the bed and moved closer to the lumps under the blankets my legs I felt myself start to tremble but I still felt like I was super glued to my bed I wanted to close my eyes maybe it was a dream It kept climbing up my bed and I felt something off of it lightly slid against my leg I felt myself tremble and shake even more Soon the face was just inches from mine I felt its hot breath on me and the smell that emitted from its mouth wasnt that great either I wanted to turn away maybe get some fresh air but I felt still frozen It took one of its hands and pointed a finger at me Though I could not see very well it looked like instead of nails it had sharp claws It took the claw and lightly probed my face The pain of the claw protruding my skin was unimaginable It didnt feel like a cut from a knife or such It felt like someone was burning my face It took the claw and ran it down my whole face and the fiery feeling intensified Then I woke up trembling and drenched in cold sweat I was thankful that it was a dream But something about that dream made me still sit there terrified for my life I looked out the window at the cold moon shining its equally cold glow into my room making shadows Those shadows made me dwell more on my dream and I closed my eyes but all I could see in my mind was the dark shape crawling up my bedand then the unimaginable agony that came from that claw cutting a gash into my face I suddenly had the need to feel my face I reached up slowly my hand slightly trembling fearing that it wasnt a dream My hand finally connected with my face and from instincts I flinched but there was nothing there but cold sweat stained smooth skin I shuddered a sigh of relief I knew there was no getting back to sleep so I decided I might as well go downstairs and at least drink some tea or coffee maybe even milk Maybe itd calm me down I slid out of the bed and headed slowly down the stairs The silence was a little unnerving as I walked down the creaky steps The dream still haunted my mind I tried to shake the feeling that it gave me away but it just wouldnt fade from mind I finally reached the kitchen and turned on the light I opened up the refrigerator and pulled out the jug of milk I poured some into a glass and slid it into the microwave and heated it up Once done I pulled the warm glass out and I headed into the living room and turned on the TV to try to forget the dream The TVs light washed over the room and I watched as people spoke about things not at all important in this world I took a drink of my milk and watched the people on the screen I soon felt myself falling asleep I woke up the TV was off I didnt remember turning it off It was still dark out I looked at the clock it read  AM I swore it had to be later than that I pulled myself from my bed and I headed up the stairs to my room once more I laid there in my bed for what seemed like hours I rose up and looked at the clock it said  AM I blinked was the clock broken I walked over and unplugged it but it did not turn off It remained shining lightly in the dark reading  AM I backed into my bed and fell on top of it I heard something from the window I looked over and saw a face The features were inhuman I felt the fear paralyze me I couldnt look past the face staring at me Where its eyes should be were empty looming dark sockets the nose a pig snout and the teeth like a saber tooth tiger and it had black curly messy hair on its head It reached a hand up to open the window and I saw the unmistakable clawed fingers My nightmare had come to life I opened my mouth to scream but no sound emerged The window opened slowly and the creature quietly hit the floor It moved slowly towards me I heard its heavy breathing as it drew nearer and nearer still I closed my eyes hoping itd go away but fate would not help me there I felt a weight on my bed and my eyes shot open I looked into those looming sockets and then my mouth opened and I screamed The scream was not heard though It was as if the world was dead The creature took its claw up and slowly sliced my skin carefully and only in certain places as if it was a planned processfor some reason It finally crawled off me and left the room and closed the window softly I laid there in the bed bleeding slowly the pain ebbing out of my body feeling like hot hell fire Thats when I noticed my clock was off now I laid there relieved that it was gonebut those eyesthose dark looming eyes would burn my mind forever,Dark Looming Eyes,2,nosleep,top_week

Undead,0,2,1r0uz5,0,So this happened about a year ago I had been loopy for months but only like see shadows or hear the TV when it wasnt on which is nothing compared to what happened to me I was home alone as I always am after my school day but today I saw and heard more things than usual but I thought nothing of it I climbed the stairs and entered the bathroom and after certain events happened that I am not going to describe because I am not gross I got up then washed my hands and went to the door which is when I heard a BANG right on the door so I did what all manly people do locked the door and hid in the bathtub Soon I began hearing foot steps but not just any footsteps but boots like combat boots on a hard wood floor After about  minutes of marching I heard whistling of a man and the faint singing of a woman This went on for about half an hour After I got the courage to open the door I looked in the hallway and SAW no onethere wasnt anybody there I checked over the house twice and nothing I received every possible test and Im not crazy so what do you think happened,Boots,2,nosleep,top_week
amandaandbrooke,0,3,1rgdaq,0,One night in early  me and some friends were over at my house having a sleep over We were watching Toy Story  in my downstairs and we have  pillars downstairs to support our house and the framing on a the one behind the couch is loose so sometimes it snags on clothes and makes a loud noise when it hits the pillar So we were close to the end of the movie and we heard the loose framing hit it like someone pulled it away from the pillar We all automatically stopped and looked at each other for about a minute then we got up and ran to my room We had to go past the pillar to get to my room so it snagged on my blanket and made the snapping noise again which made everyone go faster The rest of the night we all kept hearing footsteps walking around like they were looking for something It hasnt happened again since that night,Just a normal night,3,nosleep,top_week
Hors,2,14,1rbmky,0,John held me close as I cried Again it had happened again I broke and my family had ridiculed me for it telling me to go hide in a cave and die I was weak that was what was hurting the most I failedIts okay John whispered in my hair and I continued to sob my entire body violently shaking with the force of themNo its not I whispered I cant be like this anymore I dont ever want to do this again John pulled back and searched my face His black eyes probing He slowly noddedI want to show you something He said I looked up at him quizzically my face showing my confusion I trusted him though so I slowly stood up from the log I was perched on He took my hand and led me to the picnic table that was in our woods my family rarely ever used it for anything it just sat there for throwing sticks on But now there was definitely something on itJohn I whispered He glanced back at meTrust me this will make it easier for you to control your emotions I nodded and stepped up closer behind him Navanod was standing over by it and glanced up as we got close I peered around John and saw what was there A man tied down I glanced at Navanod who silently stared back before I looked again at the manHe was bleeding already a small trickle that formed tiny puddles beneath him A small smile crept onto my features and Navanod turned his attention to John Shes ready Was all he said John nodded and pulled the knife he always had in his belt outGoing over to the man he barely pierced the skin before glancing at me I had moved in closer fascinated by what was happening the man on the table fought against the straps screaming I glanced at the house to see if anyone heard before looking back at John He stopped making small cuts and finally pushed the knife deep into the mans skin The man screamed and I was suddenly all the way at the table perched on the edge staring wide eyed at the thick stream of blood spurting out and pooling beneath the man and the table The thick red liquid sinking into the leafy groundCan I I whispered John looked over at Navanod before flipping the knife in his hand and giving it to me I looked at it then at the man How do I skin him I barely saw the smirk on Johns face because I was so focused on the blood it was shooting a satisfying feeling through me that I had never felt beforeJohn came up behind me and held his hand over mine Like this His hand guided mineMy head jerked up when I was finishing to someone screaming my name A piece of me crumbled as I slowly gave the knife back to John We can do another tomorrow He said I perked up at that I was covered in the mans blood and I smiled at that John stood and took me insideWhere have you been My mom demandedJust out in the woods I whisperedStop that mumbling My mom ordered John rolled his eyes next to me and I suppressed a smile You know how much I hate you playing out there alone I glanced over at John whose grin had now grownTomorrow He whispered before disappearing into my room laughingEdit So I probably should say that John and Navanod were  of the  demons following me around when I was younger No one but me could see them which led to some interesting situations if they decided to remain in the room when something was going on Im just going to post random snippets and not make this a series but in general they will be about me and them Sorry for any confusion and such,I Want to Show You Something,14,nosleep,top_week

samisboris,0,3,1r97n2,0,When I was a little kid I was exposed to the world of sheer adrenaline I loved roller coasters theme parks and loud action movies I was  years young when I first started to see these mysterious black figures Specifically one dark autumn night I had miraculously awoken from my small  year old body to find a beautiful silent room After looking around for  seconds something had walked into the door frame of my room I remember it perfectly to this day It stood  feet tall and looked like an average sized human except was not covered in skin This figure was pitch black the darkest color black I had ever seen It was wearing a blissful white robe The robe immediately stood out to me because its polar opposite color compared to the figures skin This picture still haunts me to this day There is never a moment where I cant stop thinking about this After I had realized that this thing was stuck staring at me in my door frame we both made extreme extensive eye contact Even though I could not physically see his eyes as more time went by I could feel a weird feeling growing inside of my body After I could not bare the feeling anymore I asked it what are you doing here what do you want from me I got no response from this being but a slight head turn This scared me even more When I got no responce back to any of my questions we made this scary eye contact once more The second eye contact was much longer than the first one but after a while it simply just walked out of my door frame That was the first and last time I had ever seen this thing I told my mom the next day and she told me it was something that god sent down to earth but I have always doubted it especially now  years later When I went to boarding school for my freshman year I went to a supposed haunted boarding school located up in santa barbra Ive heard the ghost story thousands of times and decided to go ghost hunting around the campus but was unsuccessful Later on that week my things started to disappear and I would awake with scrathes and bruises on my arms and upper body In the middle of the night when I would get water in the hallways I would feel the same eerie feeling I did when I was  and would also see dark figures from the corner of my eye The same darkness the being had when I was  The next week these same experiences started to happen in my personal dorm room except this time it felt more malicious The first time I saw something a scary looking black figure was when it walked towards my room mates side I thought I was just dreaming but the next night my closet door slid open and I saw the most terrifying thing ever A gargantuan black horned figure slammed open my closet door and rushed strait towards me with its arms pointed strait at me Before it was about to grab me it disappeared and the lights came right on thanks to my room mate AFter this happened I returned back home to LA Luckily everything had calmed down How ever now I am  I still see these black figures in the corners of my eyes I need to know what is this IS it an evil spirit are they angels are the lost ghosts Ive been doing research and said possibly it could be shadow people I just need to know what your opinion so I know I am not slowly maddening PLEASE IS THERE ANY ONE OUT THERE THAT CAN HELP ,Big black human shape in a white robe,2,nosleep,top_week

broomball,0,3,1r1cwi,0,httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsjrweirdwalkaroundtheblockandweirddreamweird link to first updatewhat i realized the gold and the creature with the eyes of blue are both like guard dogs and their masters are in control of them blue acted out of instinct it has no final destination like visions where i see realities different from our owntheroy from first post in series  changes since last post moving didnt help much just bought me more time i also purchased some throwing knives since my last update not due to the creatures just because i was losing my sense of home and slight sense of security from moving from the house i grew up inwarning i may ramble a bit with exlpaimations due to me having high funtioning autism and it causes me to have longer explainations than most people i also have slightly bad social skills  due to it also sorry about spelling and grammar i am on a mobile phone and it is half an hour until midnight for me i wasnt feeling well today so i am a bit tired and half of this was typed  days ago i just fell asleep before typing certain parts out that only i would have understood and i fixed and  made readable sense of itso you are lucky for now that i formatted what i did i will do a spelling and grammar edit tomorrowThe thing that marked the change was the blue creature appeared just after i shut my eye lids and they felt stuck shut I didnt bother trting to open them i knew it was no use and that the blue one was safe but not the gold one So i kept trying to switch into a dream but none would take the creature started to make a half choking half growling sound over and over like it was choking on a word before it choked out the word protect then lefti normally can start my dreams off then fall asleep into them but i havent been able to gaurd my mind i can normally just pick a theme eg horror story abandon building and spy  every so often i will get an odd dream that my mind cant draw on my most recent dream because the normal ones seem to make a storyline like last spring a trex and i were talking and it was wearing a monacle and top hat while drinking champane in a ruined section of a city  and then from down the road walnuts got fired at me i ran forward and cracked them with my bare hands until they stopped this time though it was they hacked in to a dream i had recentlythe recent dream i had fallen asleep while emotions i had were swirling so it randomized and it was that people on my list of people i trust that was pulled from my memoriesI would be getting ready for a formal dance at the school i went to before my dad moved yet in the dream i had moved to the  town the high school i went to is in i could see the school in the dream from the house i was in and it was a bright neon green house with a picket fence and elegant hand carved wooden gate there are no houses like that near the school though and a cop knocks on the door of the house and my mom answers it and the cop asks for me and mom says i am getting ready to go to a school dance the cop explains why he is there is to get me to come with him to talk out a hostage situation because the person with the hostage asked to see me So i slip a throwing knife of the new set mentioned above into each pant leg pocket then say that he can enter my room i then ask if i can bring either a throwing knife or a wooden stake for defence should i be used as hostage depends what person from my trust list it is being held hostage already in the dreamI have trust lists because my lack of social skills makes it hard to make friends so i classify them as aquaintences with varying levels of my trust whether i am friends with  them or not is there call but in the dream after the dream completes it restarts and gets the next person on the listsI get the ok from the cop who says hopefully it wont get to that fast foreward dream the person with the hostage has the most defendable place in the school and the only possibilities for escape is the window behind  him or at least the body shape looks male i will refer to him as chompers due to him having pure gold and silver teeth alternating so it goes silvergoldsilvergoldetc i first percieved chompers as a being to represent stress then i would be called to go stand near by chompers holds a glock  pistol a common pistol in military games eg socom in each hand right hand against hostages head and the left one points at me then i offer a hostage swap and hand the other hostage the defence weapon i had up my sleeve then i stand so my back faces chompers while he demands certain politcians be eliminated and vast sums of money as if i was a powerful bargining chip the cops cant complete his ransom with the assination call so he threatens me saying any last wishes i say i wish to hear a song from my phone and ask if i am allowed to reach in my pocket to get it chompers says yeah so i grab a throwing knife and stab back wards near intestines with the left throwing knife and jab his thigh at the same time as i dropped and ducked the cops took thier chance to shoot himEach time he would normally fall and i would see the bloody muscles of his face when his head hit the floor the only difference now is his eyes have been like snake eyes bright red with gold pupils instead of just turning to empty socketsCould it be stress but what if it is two entities battling in my mind one being instinct and one being stress because the walks i would take around the block were to eliminate or at least vent off stress and the slight paranoia during the encounters let them cross into reality and be anchors for their masters if so could it be only my own brain is the only one with a frequency and pattern they can survive,weird walk around the block and weird dream weird cat

horriddaydream,90,175,1r338n,669,My mother left when I was fourNormally that wouldnt mean anything but I suspected for a long time that the porcelain dolls were coming from her like some pitiful little attempt to show me that she loved me My father he worked overtime to keep things going in the household even if it was just the two of us His hands were always worn from working the machines at the shop and he slaved even more when he got home and had to make supper for himself and I and go through my nightly routines before I hit the sack I sometimes woke up in the middle of the night and he was still awake cleaning a room in the house and I thought to myself This man is dedicated Has to be awake in only a few hoursand here he is I love my father and I always haveOne of his most trusted friends from high school Alexander was my babysitter from the time my mother left to the time I was about seven years old We trusted Alexander He worked night shift and so he was able to work babysitting in around his hours and he would have done anything to help out my father to make that work My father paid him even though he asked for nothing he said he was just doing his good deed and I like it anyway My dad used to come home from work and Alexander would pick up his bags full of toys that we played with he always brought the best toys and trinkets with him His daughter had passed away when she was ten years old and I think it brought him great joy to now share her old toys with another little girl He would say to my dad She was great for me She ate well and she took her usual long nap Ill be back tomorrow And he always came back Well eventually times changed and my dads work schedule changed with them We didnt see Alexander anymore because we didnt NEED Alexander anymore My father thought that they lost touch permanently and when I asked about him he told me truthfully that Alexander was a very busy man And he understood that and I did too For my eighth birthday the first porcelain doll arrived It had beautiful blonde curly hair and a painted on face She was wearing what looked to be an expensive velvet dress with an attached tutu She came inside a stuffed envelope with nothing else on the package to identify who had sent her Just my name that was all The first thing that my father did was call my grandmother who said No I didnt drive by and place a present on the porch Im not her coward mother I would have given it right to her That gave my father the second idea my mother Only thing was we had no way of getting in touch with her and finding out for she had literally taken off and abandoned us both And over the next few weeks nobody came forth and said they had gotten me the doll so we assumed this is who had sent itThey showed up every year since then Each unique in their own ways each more beautiful than the last I thought it was a little odd yes Especially because my mother made no outreach to me so if she was sending me gifts but not bothering to even so much call me and check up then that was just plain rude of her and her gifts meant literally nothing But I continued to set them up on my shelf in my bedroom and they looked nice there I supposeThe year I turned nineteen I was moved into college and was taking courses on my birthday My father called me from home and asked me when I was coming back home for a break and I told him that I had time this weekend but I only said this because I sensed some urgency in his voice I could make it work He told me not to worry about anything but that he would really like to see me Then he stressed that I always lock my doors and always have somebody walking with me if I was out past dark which I already knewI returned home that weekend and my father said there had been an accidentMy porcelain birthday doll had arrived my nineteenth year doll When my father brought it inside the house it had smashed into a hundred separate piecesInside there was a diary entry on a piece of paperWe spent the entire day smashing open every porcelain doll and the entire night speaking with the policeAlexander had written diary entries for every time he had drugged and molested me each more explicit admitting that he had done the same to his daughter up until the time of her horrible death My father and I hadnt a dry eye in our house that entire night and I continued to have problems throughout my college career knowing that Alexander was somewhere out there probably assuming a new identity and doing the same thing to other girlsNow I know why he had always commented on me taking such usual long napsFollowhttpswwwfacebookcomDaydreamPublishing,Birthday Presents,844,nosleep,top_week

Jaunt,54,147,1rff5i,537,I wrapped my dollie in her prettiest red dress looked into her cracked eyes and whispered I love youI held her tight I love you I love you But I started to cry because dollies dont love back No my dollie wouldnt do not anymore I wanted something of my own to care for Something soft I could nuzzle up to at night when I was lonely Something that needed me I wanted a real babyI asked mama how to make a baby She slapped me across the face and made me drink dish soap to wash the devils talk from my mouth The red mark still burned on my cheek when I got to school but no one noticed They never noticed me except when I fell and spilled my lunch or when Jenny and the other girls made fun of the holes in my dresses They only noticed me to laugh at meThat night after I said my prayers I looked at the stars through my window and spotted one I had never seen before Big bright and ruby red it seemed to get bigger the more I stared at it It was beautiful so I sent it a wish Bring me a baby I said bring me something to loveThe star grew bigger and bigger until ruby red filled the room and turned the air thick and rusty Something was there with me Black and formless like a storm cloud it floated above me You want a child it said speaking into my head instead of my ears I will give you a child but you must promise to love and care for him no matter whatI promiseWisps of black wrapped around my wrists and pinned them to the ground as sure as steel rivets My nightdress was lifted and my legs pulled apart Gritty black tendrils rough as sandpaper opened me and slithered inside They scraped my insides slowly at first then faster and faster It felt like I was being shredded to pulp from the inside out I tilted my head back to scream but black filled my mouth and nothing came out Shhh it said to love your child you must suffer for him first A final push in and shards of splintered glass exploded inside meThe thing loosed its grip and I reached down to feel sticky red goo oozing out of me onto the floor I was shaking and cold and the room was falling away Will I die I askedNo You must care for him It is your promiseI woke the next morning without a scratch Was it a dream I touched my belly No he is there I can feel him Tiny and vulnerable and perfect I would keep my promiseHe grew every day Soon my belly was round and full underneath my dresses Everyone noticed me now especially Jenny and the other girls Slut they said Whore Trash One day Jenny fell in front of a school bus as it was pulling away You could hear the tire pop her skull open from across the parking lot When the police dragged the driver away he stammered that he had seen something push her something small and black like a living shadowMama cried She held me in a scalding tub and scrubbed my body until my skin cracked and bled Not clean not clean she said She pulled me out of school and swore that I would never leave the house until it was over and done because what would the neighbors think I didnt mind As long as my little boy was safe inside me I didnt care where I wentI dreamed of him He told me his name but it was a sound I couldnt pronounce a sound like a cloud of flies buzzing through the air I couldnt say it but I could hear it in my head and that was enough He told me that he would accomplish great things but he needed my love to make him strong first In my dreams I held him tight looked into his dark eyes and whispered I will love and protect you alwaysMama dreamed of him too I think She would lay in bed with sweat soaking into the sheets whispering Please Please help us God She ate less and less until she was sunken and pale like a skeletonI was drawing pictures one night when it happened I reached up for a red crayon and pop yellow liquid gushing out of me Hes ready hes finally ready I called out to mama and told her it was time She phoned the doctor begging him to be discreet to hide it from the neighbors He arrived and offered to inject me with something to relieve the pain I refused To love my baby I must suffer for him firstPushing screaming breathing pushing again Hours and hours I was weak I was tired But the thought of him kept me going After so long we would finally meet I would hold him in my arms for real and give him the love I kept in my heart just for him I pushed again with the last drops of strength I had left I emptied out and collapsed down onto the bed sighing with reliefI am sorry dear but the baby didnt make itNo No youre wrong I kept him safe this whole time I protected him and loved him and spoke to him in my dreams I was going to care for him and make him strong he cant be he cant be he cantI am so sorry Here child you can say goodbyeI held him in my arms He was limp and motionless his skin a pale gray his eyes shut tightly He looked so peaceful I had never seen anything so beautiful in all my life I clutched him to my chest and cried tears dripping onto his head Goodbye my love goodbye But no wait He cant be gone I can hear him I can hear the flies in my mindHis eyes snapped open and his head twisted around to look at mama and the doctor Mama fell to the floor and screamed Her legs scrambled to press her into a corner of the room and her eyes bulged as she shrieked and pleaded to God The doctor stood frozen for a moment before walking into the bathroom and quietly shutting the doorMy babys head turned back to me and I looked into his eyes for the first time Two huge pools of midnight black that seemed to suck the light out of the room itself I looked into those cold dark eyes and I smiled My son My beautiful son I am so happy to see youI stood up while mamas jagged screams scratched my eardrums and I carried my son to the bathroom I opened the door stepped over the spreading pool of red underneath the doctor and turned on the tap I bathed my son in the icy cold water as he stared up at me He was perfect He was everything I had hoped for And he was mineI saw things in my dream that night I saw great buildings and monuments ground to dust I saw waves of fire washing clean the cities of man I saw clouds of flies so thick they blacked out the sun I saw red Mists of red rivers of red chunks of oozing red heaped high in the moonlight And in the middle of it all I saw my son my baby boy Mamas so proud of you sweetheart I will always be there for you I will make you strong I will make you the man youre destined to be I will love you and care for you and protect you no matter what I promise,The Promise,684,nosleep,top_week

Exxile,97,154,1rbws0,389,Hello reddit Im a killer and I have no problem admitting that Many people have fallen victim to my gruesome attacks and I live life regretting none of it Im only sharing my story on here  so that someone out there can know about it Whether or not you choose to believe it is up to youI was a normal child but normal is relative so who am I to make that call What I should say is that I grew up how you would expect a kid to grow up My parents treated me properly I did great in school and I had many friends It wasnt until high school that I started feeling the need to kill It was all so spontaneous I was just sitting in class one day staring at one of the students when the image of him dying popped into my head I zoned out and focused on the image his body lying in a pool of blood leaking from his head His arms were snapped behind his back  and his feet were missing the big toes A few weeks later that daydream became a reality and I got away with itEveryone in the school was whispering rumors to one another as I walked to classes Some were saying that he joined the army others were convinced that he just moved like so many other kids did before him I was the only one who knew the truth and I had to hide my devilish grin from the rest of the school That was my only murder in high school but it ignited the flameWhen I reached adult hood I landed a successful job and had plenty of money to obtain the tools I had always dreamed of using on my victims Thats when I began to develop a signature style I would always sever the big toes but I no longer snapped the arms behind the back Honestly the sound of the bones breaking didnt sit well with me Every day I would watch the news expecting to see that one of the victims had been found but they never were Years went by and I targeted another twelve victims They were no one in particular Women teenagers it really didnt matter to me A dead body is a dead body in my eyes I dont care who it belongs to Very few of them would put up a fight and that was fine with me I wasnt trying to drag out the last moments of their lives I just wanted them to die I wanted to savor the warmth of their blood on my hands as I slit their throat  About a week after I killed my final victim I met a girl that I ended up falling in love with She doesnt realize how close she was to becoming just another undiscovered body She wasnt able to have kids which was fine with me I never really saw myself as a father Neither of us believe in god so we saw no point in getting married I was okay with this as well I felt like my life was finally going to be normal again After we had been together for a few years I decided to tell her about my past I made a special dinner for her to lighten the mood However when I told her she just laughed and thought I was being ridiculous It turned into her treating it like some type of role playing fantasy I had and she ignored me as I told her it was the truth I didnt know how to prove it to her so I killed someone in front of her One night I brought her with me on what she thought was a date When we got to the spot I opened the trunk so she could see my victim She still thought it was a joke and asked me how I got my friend to agree to this I think she finally understood that it was no joke as I sliced the mans throat Her face turned pale and she reached into her purse to get her phone I was prepared for this though and I knocked her unconscious After I finished with  my signature killing pattern I drove back to the house My secret was not safe with her but I loved her too much to kill herRight now shes kept in my basement I dont treat her like a prisoner mind you she has everything she could ever want Im hoping in time I can start leaving her untied at night so shell quit trying to escape I know one day shell accept who I am Maybe one day shell help me fulfill my new fantasy of killing together Or perhaps you guys wont believe me either and youll brush this off as just another made up story But thats the funny thing about being a killer,The funny thing about being a killer is that no one believes you if you tell them the truth,543,nosleep,top_week
AmbiguousGopher,31,83,1r5xlc,359,For most of my life Ive been drawn to a certain room of my house A bedroom at the far end of my basement which used to be a guest bedroom I cant really explain why but I just always wanted to sleep there Until the age of  my older brother and I shared a room right across the hall from the bedroom of my parents When he was  however he moved into that bedroom and over the years the room become even more interesting The room is now filled with posters of The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix an authentic Spanish sword he bought hangs above his desk and loads of other bits and pieces which captured my imagination when I was younger To top it all off there was an air vent connecting his room and mine Almost directly below my room I could hear him some nights talking to his friends on the phone while playing video games late into the night I envied his freedom If I had tried that my parents right across the hall would hear me and Id be groundedWhen I was  myself my brother and sister twins left for college Now the only child at home I called my brother up one weekend and asked Can I have your roomMy brother paused for a long time before respondingNoHe gave no explanation but I didnt really care I could understand that when he came to visit Hed want his own room to sleep in For  more years i didnt ask to have the room again but when i was  my brother bought a house To me it seemed like he was pretty much beyond the point of having any reason to care about his old room so one day when he called to check up on things I asked againThis time he responded more quickly His voice sounded casual but at the same time It kinda freaked me out He saidNah let mom make it a guest room again Besides your room is super classy My room isnt that greatAnd so yet again I let it go I stayed in my room and didnt really think anything of it that is until last week This summer I started having severe anxiety attacks coupled with spells of incapacitating depression especially at night Ive been on different medicines to help and have been going to therapy to help work on relaxation techniques Last week my therapist noted that sometimes the brain can form associations with certain rooms or areas She suggested that my brain due to the recurring spells in my room may have formed a negative association with it She told me that switching rooms may help me relax when I start having an attackThat night I did it I switched to my brothers room and it was amazing Since my basement always stays around below room temperature the sheets and pillow stayed cool which was just to my liking I slept better than Id slept in weeks and thought that perhaps this room was going to turn things around But the second night didnt go as well I woke from a nightmare and felt as if there was someone watching me I shook the feeling and went back to sleep This kind of thing happened for a few more nights each time I awoke more worried than the last Then came the big one I fell asleep as usual and I began to dream another nightmare but this time it was more vivid In the dream I saw looking at my brother when he was only  or  years old He was sitting on his bed talking to something I couldnt see it but he was looking at an angle which suggested something much larger than himself Tears were flowing steadily from his eyes and he was pleading BEGGING the thing to go away to leave him alone The power in the room went out I heard a horrible screeching like a pig being tortured The lights turned back on and my brother lay there unconscious A large black bruise had appeared on his ribs The clock in his room recovered from the power outage blinking the numbers  My brother then jerked upright and walked over to the only poster in his room at the time his Hendrix poster He took a pen form his desk and put a tally mark on the wall behind itI jerked up in my brothers bed I turned on the lamp and looked around the room I noticed every poster Sweat started pouring from my forehead burning my eyes I looked at the clock The numbers blinked ,My Brothers Room,442,nosleep,top_week
TheeMikeG,21,73,1r4fsf,333,Dear MikeTheyre letting me write a letter so I figured Id get my story out thereIt was a routine night drop nothing different from what weve done countless times before The steady hum of the C as it tore through the clouds was the only thing keeping me calm Yeah Ive done this a lot but you can never get rid of the nerves before a mission We had an idea of what awaited us down there but we couldnt be a hundred percent sure People are unpredictable and thats scary The plan from higher was to have our five man team infiltrate by night drop a small village I cant pronounce to search for and capture or kill a HVT whose name I also cant pronounce The gunship would rise up and provide overwatch until we were extracted Airborne all the way hooah The LT joined us again which he decided to do from time to time Nice enough guy I respected him Was supposed to be having a baby girl soon he would always talk about it during PT Good for him I could never hold down a relationship for very long I figured it was just because Ive seen too much shit to be normal and cuddle or whatever the fuck it is that couples do The rest of the squad was the usual guys Mitch Craft and Burroughs All experts in their craft We were a solid group and Id take a bullet or hell even two for any of them Thirty seconds shouted the LT from the bench a few spots to my right closest to the door The jumpmaster heaved the door upward and the familiar sound of air whooshing past the plane made my heart jump There was always a kick Hook up he shouted We all stood up in unison and clipped our static lines to the wire that ran through the plane above our heads I tugged on my static line to make sure it was attached There were no reserves for this one The jumpmaster held up his hand Five seconds The red light turned green and the LT positioned himself by the door The jumpmaster smacked his rear and the LT jumped out and was whisked away My stomach turned in knots Over a hundred jumps and I still hated this shit I was last to go out I tucked my head took a hop out of the plane and suddenly there was the rush and I felt myself getting tossed I heard my chute above and I breathed a sigh of relief Looking up to check my canopy I saw a fully inflated chute and I thanked the Lord once again I looked down for the rest of the squad and saw their chutes inflated too Past them I expected to see the ground but there was only a thick smoke or at least thats what it looked like A storm cloud Why didnt the jumpmaster hold off the jump until the bad weather passed Staus check I heard the LT ask through the radio As I watched the others canopies disappear into the black cloud I began to worry I heard the squad all check in though so I felt a little better  I held my hand up to my ear to activate our comms Sir whats the situation down thereZero visibility guys Pretty foggy Cant see my own canopy he saidThen I entered the black cloud and couldnt see a damn thing I heard something nearby Flapping My radio clicks before Mitch starts talking I heard something Flock of birdsWere too high replied the LT Eyes and ears open I tried to look around but there was no point I couldnt even see my canopy What if I was falling to my death right then Heavy flapping got my focus It sounded large whatever it was Sir something is up here with us I saySimmons stay calm whats gotten into Fuck Craft interrupts through the mic Then I hear a long painful scream far below me Jesus Christ yelled the LT Craft You thereSilence Not even static Guys stay calm Get ready to hit any minute I cant see the ground in this shit but well sort this out on the DZI checked my watch It takes maybe two minutes to hit jumping from a mile up Its been six minutes and I know this wasnt a HALO jump Was I caught in a thermal I pulled on my risers and felt myself drifting through the air When I released I didnt notice any change in descent speed The LT must have noticed the same thing because I could hear him cursing through the radio Theres a loud screech unlike anything Ive ever heard After it ended a few seconds later the LT had to shout over the commotion we were all making on the radio We were scared Guys I dont know what the fuck is going on but stay calm Weapons on amberMy combat gear was in a large sack between my legs but my USP was on my belt I took it out and held it ready I didnt know for what but I was ready to go How had we still not hit the ground yet Then I got an idea My combat load We are supposed to release it before landing and it slides down a twenty foot rope so we dont break our legs when we land I thought if I could cut it free maybe I could hear it hit the ground I asked for permission from the LT who quickly approved He must have been as freaked out as me to allow me to abandon my combat gear I pressed the handle on my hip and the gear slid down the rope and out of sight into the darkness I took out my knife and sawed at the line until it snapped I waited and waited but couldnt hear a thing I heard the flapping again and someone fired their weapon two three times Then silence Jesus Christ whispered the LT Status checkBurroughsSimmonsNothingSir what the fuck is going on I knew he wouldnt have an answer but I was desperate I have no ideaWe drifted through the air for ten more minutes Then I touched down I didnt hit hard it was like I was just set down Didnt even have to fall over I still couldnt see a damn thing though I heard quick steps and then Burroughs burst into view and tackled me to the ground He was frantic He begged me through tears to follow him We wandered around until we came to the LT He didnt have a right half of his body He was barely alive sputtering through bloody lips for us to run My baby my baby my baby he whispered over and over until he didnt say anything anymore The cloud cleared from the area behind him and there was this thing All I saw before I turned and ran was large leathery wings I heard the screeching and the flapping of those awful wings again Burroughs screamed as he was ripped backwards from beside me Somehow I burst out of the cloud and I saw headlights I nearly got hit by the jeep but dove out of the way just in time Out got two guards who spoke a language I didnt understand Burroughs was the translator They prodded me with machine guns and kicked and beat me until I was barely conscious How did they not see the thing behind me They dragged me into the back of their vehicle and drove me to their camp Ive been their POW for nearly a month now If you get this letter please get my story out there Im not crazy I promise I cant explain what happened any better than that Were not alone Something terrible is going on over here Time to go theyre

PeckerPoker,43,85,1r58lt,238,Ok so this isnt a long story filled with twists and turns but it just happened about  minutes ago and Im a little uneasy nowFor reference my husband son and I moved into an apartment in the tophalf of a centuryhome a couple months ago The doors all have old knobs and the doors dont always close easily  you really have to pull sometimesAnyway I just put my son almost two years old down for his nap I told him nightnight as I closed the door As I always do I pulled the door shut firmly and made sure I heard it click I swear I heard it clickI walked away and into the bathroom to go pee As I sat down on the toilet I heard my son start crying which isnt that unusual but normally he doesnt do more than fuss for a minute before falling asleep I even kept him up a little longer than usual to make sure he fell asleep He seemed pretty ready to go down thumb in mouth under his blanky he rolled over onto his side and put his blanket over his head like he does when hes really tiredI finish peeing and walk out of the bathroom and his door is wide open I see him standing in his crib crying I go in feeling uneasy and lay him back down and cover him back up He lays there and just keeps crying as I check his closet like there would be someone hiding in there or something Kind of dumb I know but I couldnt just shut him back in his room alone without checkingEven if I was wrong and the door didnt click shut which is possible it shouldnt have been wide open When I havent completely shut it in the past it will open up about  or  inches Its never opened up all the way like thatI checked the rest of the rooms and closets feeling nervous but kind of stupid Of course there wasnt anything unusual anywhere Still Im kind of on edge I wish my husband was home,Nap Time,323,nosleep,top_week

tellmewhatiswrong,52,59,1reivz,213,Arghhh I have no idea what to make of this situation I find myself inI started off  as being in the most amazing relationship Ive ever had I married the girl of my dreams last year after being together for  years prior to that She is the most beautiful intelligent interesting person I have ever met and I knew that as soon as we met each other Immediately the chemistry between us was electricDont get me wrong we are extremely different in a lot of ways but up until this point that has only helped to make our relationship stronger Im an atheist a kind of scientific nerd I guess She on the other hand was morenew age I guess you could say Not particularly religious but interested in the paranormal philosophy anything that cant really be explained It would not surprise me to see her out hunting for UFOs however for the most part this side of her was really just limited to reading about such events and watching the odd documentaryHaving said that she is so sensible and smart Shes a very curious person thats what I put her hobbies down to really Its never been more than a passing interest of hers She works as a personal assistant to the CEO of a law firm in the city Everyone says she should study law because her talents are wasted as a secretary But she seems content enough at the momentwell she didThe reason I find myself in this mess is because she has changed her mind about something we used to agree on  kids When we first got together we both agreed that we did not want to have children We based our entire relationship on that premise We were content with travelling the world expensive wines and sex on the kitchen bench All that would change if kids came into the picture I have never wanted children and dont feel like I ever willShe used to feel the same Until her sister had a baby She started to get a little clucky she said She started to see us with a baby of our own At first I thought it was just a passing comment but the longer time went on the more I realised she was serious Thats when the fights started Fight after fight every week Her crying and yelling and begging me to change To compromise Me dumbfounded and annoyed that one of the foundations of marriage is suddenly being challenged Things have been said in the heat of the moment and both of us have been deeply hurt by the other She makes me feel like I cant give her what she needs that Im denying her her happiness I make her feel like shes not important she says That Im being selfishMaybe I am I dont knowSo we found ourselves in a stale mate She posted something on Reddit asking for advice and most of the suggestions directed us to attend couples counsellingI was reluctant to say the least But I was willing to give it a shotSandra our therapist was actually not what I expected She seemed rational and quite straightforward not the Einsteinesque shrink that I had imagined She advised that we really we had two options  either she could stay with me and be without a child Or she could leave me for someone who would give her a baby We seem to be stuck in secret option number  staying in the circumstances we find ourselves inDisregarding all the fighting she was still her normal self and we have been managing to keep it together and still spend some quality time together We have still been going out with friends and going for walks with our dog and I know we still love each otherI stopped going to couples counselling I sort of felt like she couldnt give us a real answer she was only there to listen My wife kept attending on her own though I think she takes some kind of comfort in itShe came home last week and told me that shes going to be attending a Self help seminar and would I like to go I said definitely not I couldnt think of anything worse than to be honest Even the counselling sessions were too much for me She asked if I minded if she went She said it was with some famous psychoanalyst and that her therapist would be in attendance on the Assistance Team I said whatever she felt would help She said she feels it will help her clear her head on the baby issue Im all for anything that could help us get back on track so I told her to go for itThe seminar seemed pretty intensive It was  hours a day Friday Saturday and Sunday of last week It was also very expensive but I bit my tongue She got home last night and just seemed exhausted I havent gotten many details out of her as every night when she arrived home she went straight to sleep and we barely had time to speak Today we both had the day off which was recommended by the people who organised the seminarToday we woke up and she wasintense I woke up with her clinging to me for dear life She was stroking my face and staring into my face It was quite nice actually Nice to have some affection We cuddled in bed for a long while She seemedok Her eyes definitely looked brighter but she didnt say much just was very intensely affectionate She got up to have a shower and I went out to have some breakfast After about half an hour I knocked on the bathroom door telling her to leave some hot water She must have had it on so hot steam was pouring out of the door into our hallway and the walls were dripping with condensation I knocked a few more times and yelled out to her but got no responseI opened the door and waited for the hazy steam to clear to see her standing there fully clothed and staring in the mirror The shower was on full ball and extremely hot and I reached over the turned the tap off She didnt take her eyes off her own reflection She was very vague when I questioned her and sweating profusely I managed to get her dressed out her pyjamas and shes in the other room now watching TVI assume this weird behaviour is something to do with the seminar I dont really understand all this new age crap has anyone else ever been to one of these seminars Or know someone that has Ive tried googling more information but cant see anything about this specific group Any advice would be appreciated Im a bit weirded out right now to be honestUpdate herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrhbucupdateneedsomeadvicemywifeseemstobein,Need some advice My wife seems to be in some weird trancezombie like state Not sure what to do or if Im

imagination whateverbut hopefully youll all be able to make more sense of itI was driving in a rural part of Wisconsin which if you live there you know is much of the state Lots of flat farms country highways named for letters empty back roads etc It was  pm or laterI dont really remember when but it had been dark for some time and it was the middle of summer so it must have been late It was the time of night cars stop moving on the rural roads so its just you and your headlights and the world around you starts getting really creepy Plus youre always watching out for deer on these roads which can just pop out at any moment so youre kind of on yellow alertIm driving north on a long section of road Theres a big flat farm on my left mostly emptylooking probably planted with soybeans which dont grow high Im concentrating on the edges of where my headlights meet the darkness to watch for deer and I think I see one walking out of the farm toward the roadI tap the brakes not sure of what I see but soon I realize its not a deer Its upright something walking on two feet and its HUGE And its all black Its still moving but its not moving with any kind of walking movement its just sort of gliding across my visionAt this point Ive stopped the car completelyin the middle of the road just watching One instinct was to hit the gas and drive past because I could have easily passed it but Im not sure if it was about to jump out Im not really afraid yet Im just frozen you know those moments where you cant figure out what something is so there are no real emotions That was meThen it comes into clearer view in the headlights Well thats not very accurate to say because it didnt seem to reflect any light It was like the light moved through it if that makes sense But I could see the outline of the figure against everything else that was litthe road the trees etcThe figure looked like Death I mean EVERYTHING you imagine when you read the storiesthe scythe the big black hood It was exactly what you think when you think Grim Reaper only unnaturally tall and thin It was so tall and thin it looked a lot like this guys halloween costume when he wears it after about five minutes or so httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvIPoCkNKDGk Especially how tall it was I mean ten feet minimum I think most people think of the Grim Reaper as being as large as a big person but it wasnt really like thatBut that was my first thought A halloween costume It was still summer though so not Halloween But I rationalize maybe its just a prank But then I pay attention to how it moves to the middle of the roadIt just GLIDES I see no feet no hint that this thing is doing anything but flying off the ground but you cant see feet or anything because the robe hits the groundThen in the middle of the road maybe ten feet in front of me it stopsThe hooded face turnstoward meIts so slow and smooth and just plain UNNATURAL that I completely freeze in the car My hands are locked on the wheel The face is turning to me slowly perfectly smoothly and Im scared out of my mind Even if this is some prank this thing clearly means business Maybe its some psychopath scaring people and not just an innocent prankIt sees me I dont see eyes no glowing eyes or anything just black but somehow I KNOW that its looking at me making eye contact I got goosebumps even on my scalp I remember my hair feeling like it stood straight up I feel like I was literally looking death in the face My stomach sank like someone just told me a loved one had died I mean you do not want to feel this feeling Ever The thing stood perfectly still too as if considering me or weighing me I felt really judged if that makes sense Like I was being consideredThen he glides off so fast I dont even see where he goes The roads are clear again and then I heard the engine running as if all of the worlds sound had suddenly been unmutedI drive back home still frozen still rationalizing what I saw A prank I figure It had to be a prank some overzealous Halloween lover setting up rumors of the Grim Reaper walking around the farms I tell my parents about it and theyre sure its a prank So sure that I eventually rationalize it away and the memory is filed away as creepy but nothing supernaturalAt about the same time I heard that a farmer who owned that soybean field had died that night But it took me a long time before I put two and two together when I realized that I saw something that looked like THE FREAKING GRIM REAPER on the same night that farmer died I remember when I first had the thought and my stomach sankIt was like the rationalization I had used to remember the story of the Grim Reaper was suddenly stripped away and I had to confront the fact that I saw something very very scaryBut what else can I do but live my lifeI went back to collegeevery time I came back home at night I took an alternate road just because I got the creeps so bad Had a good semester mostly As had some good times with friends I drive back mostly during day or evening time so I dont have to revisit those unpleasant memoriesThen my parents tell me that there are more Grim Reaper stories going around lately all pretty similar to mine When you live in a  small town it seems like there are a lot of funerals for old people that you know or at least heard of going on all the time At one funeral an old ladys granddaughter cried because she saw she said a big black figure over the casket My parents heard that story and thought of mine but they still just treated it as a jokeI would stay up a lot later than the people in my house parents  younger brother plus an uncle aunt and cousin who were spending Christmas with us and slept in a room upstairs on this little side road in a rural subdivision No streetlights out there just the lights that other people kept on their garages all nightOne night I went up to my room at about  am and of course the whole house is quiet and I go to my room and turn out the lights so I can go to bed I usually throw a glance out the window and you can see most of the side street because the neighbors kept their garage light on all nightThis time the whole scene looks a little different Theres a big shadow looming in the front yard and its blocking a lot of light Then I look closer and I realize its not a shadowits something black thats cutting THROUGH the lightThen I feel my heart practically stop as I realizeits back The Grim Reaper figureIt was just like before It cast no shadow The scythe was there and the tall hooded cloak with no faceThe breath went out of me when I realized that unlike before this reaper was not looking to the side when I discovered it It was looking right at our houseII stood there frozen again my finger still on the switch from just having hit the light It was a windy winter night and you could see some snow move but the creatures robe didnt move at all The same way its movements before had been unnatural now it loomed like a statue No flailing around in the wind Just standing tall scythe up high staring at our houseI looked away then looked back again Still there Looming I didnt get the sense that it was looking at me but I still couldnt stop staringThen I looked away and looked back again This time I KNEW it was staring Again it was hard to seethere was really nothing that I could tell that suggested it was looking at me No evil glowing eyes or anything I just felt it Felt the same feelings as beforea rotten pit in my stomach the feeling of being measured and weighed and consideredI heard a squeak and realized it was me My breath was being squeezed out of me simply from the fear Keep in mind I had no idea what this thing would do next What fly up to my window Suddenly disappear Rip off its hood and reveal a laughing skullAfter a moment its gaze departed from me again I felt good enough to go to my brothers room and wake him up to show him something in the window It took him forever to get out of bed but it may have only been a few minutes By the time he woke up rubbed his eyes and listened to the panic in my voice a few minutes had at least past I showed him the window but of course the figure was goneBut still that was it I knew The night I saw deathThat was the night my uncle died,The night I saw death,246,nosleep,top_week
chimeraphantasm,44,52,1rbg7n,185,My name is Ramiel and I want you to read this right before you go to sleep Trust me its better this way If its the middle of the day for you or perhaps youre not quite tired yet bookmark this and read it when your eyes are starting to itch with tiredness but youre not nodding off yet I dont want you to forget what youre about to read Im on the tall skinny side of my arabic family I guess I take after my mom in that respect Though im pretty sure she didnt have this much facial hair She named me after an angel that is responsible for divine visions I wonder if she knew how right on the money she was  Why does my name and physical features matter I suppose it doesnt but if Im going to share something this personal with strangers for help or some kind of catharsis id rather you had a good idea of who I am and not just a blank slate  I dont want you to forget me when this is over Before we begin heres an interesting fact to wrap your head around Your brain produces extremely high amounts of a psychedelic compound called DMT Dimethyltryptamine two times in your life Once when you are born to help cope with the pressure it puts on your fragile infant body during the painful process of birth and once again when you are seconds from dying to ease the burden it puts on your body and mind as they both shut down for the very last time This is often why people claim to see their loved ones who have long passed on by their side bright lights from the sky or feelings of elation This process is so strong that it has the capabilities to erase everything in your mind like a mass wipe of your hard drive Now you might think that isnt too important if youre just starting out your life or simultaneously moments away from it coming to an end but I ask you to entertain the notion that you possess a soul or an inner essence of sorts what if that soul that consciousness that essence of you simply continued on without the knowledge of a past existence What if at the moment of death you saw something so undeniably horrifying and inconceivable something youd only seen in fleeting dreams and nightmares throughout your life that your brain compensates in the only way it knows how by erasing any prior memory of it before allowing what makes you you continue onto the next stage of whatever is out there Your brains last failsafe a defence mechanism to ensure you wont carry the burden with you But like any kind of defence mechanism theres always a bypassand theres always a black box  DMT is a chemical produced by your pineal gland and it is responsible for us dreaming every single night Not the reason however We have no idea why we dream we just do As soon we enter REM sleep our dreams become their most memorable and malleable It is at this point we have dreams which take proper form that we feel most real and perceive to be the most accessible though we seldom ever remember the dream itself Because like a drug trip our brain is determined to protect us from that experiencebut what if that wasnt the only reasonConsider this The older we get we sleep considerably less hours As babies we sleep for up to  hours and by the time we hit  years old its half of that amount What if this is a defence mechanism our brain develops so that we dont spend too long in that realm No im not talking about the further from Insidious or some kind of Nightmare on Elm Street knockoff before your already horror obsessed minds make some kind of parable to an existing franchise for comfort or relatable aspects Youre still very much within your own mind but theres something else there with you  Now I ask you to suspend all beliefs or nonbeliefs and read on to hear my story and why I no longer sleep and why despite being an Atheist I pray to something to anything hell even Hypnos would be a welcome evil right now that should my mind succumb to sleep and my body fail me that I dont dream Im a counsellor at my local university I took on the job in September of last year as a ditch effort to bump up my resume and to reduce rent through living on the campus It was your usual run of the mill kind of work talk to terrified st years whod never lived away from home before and were simply not used to their newfound freedom dealing with homesickness new friendships one night stands etc The nd years were dealing with social troubles within their housesapartments deadlines mounting and the occasional unplanned pregnancy The final year students were typically near breakdown over their dissertations and end of year exams so youd offer them all the appropriate advice your own experiences at the university as an example and then ultimately hope it all sinks in If not well theres always next week and beyond that a private therapist But like all forms of employment that deal with face to face interactions theres always one encounter you never forget For me that was Milo Moraga a nd year student studying Psychology amp Philosophy The first time he came into my office he struck me as a little bit gaunt his striped longsleeve top hanging off him like itd stretched in the wash Strung out but shy That would have been my first impression I think he sensed my preconceived notions avoiding making eye contact with me as he shuffled inside He was apprehensive sleep deprived his hair greasy under a black beanie and his eyes laden with heavy dark bags underneath like someone had put on eyeliner while he slept He sat down glancing around at the windows and leant forward cracking his knuckles and rubbing his hands over one another hastilyHello Milo how can I help you I understand you asked for this appointment because ofanxiety Do you want to tell me about that I looked through the brief set of notes the receptionist gave me and tried to study as best I could while he spoke Nothing that would ultimately help me ascertain the problem it just gave him time to compose himself He didnt respond just kept shuffling in his chair I guess he wasnt  sure he should come here  Your lecturer sent you here didnt they I said bluntly feeling a slight headache come on as I felt an awkward  minute session rearing its ugly monotonous head He nodded but I noticed something in that moment that made me think there was more to it His expression was almost like he was pleading for his life as he quickly nodded  I leaned forward placing my hands under my chin and up to my lips as I observed him I had to be very careful with how I handled this If he was suicidal one wrong statement could leave him with a noose round his neck  Milo what happened in the classroom to get you here Can you tell me that muchHe mimicked me leaning forward as well though his posture was the furthest parallel from my own it looked like his spirit was broken The lecturerMs Armstrongshe was talking about solipsism and I just gotlost within it Do you know what solipsism isI did but I shook my head I didnt want to interrupt him when he was being so open Its a philosophical belief that everything an individual perceives is only in his own mind it is a construct of his own psyche There is no other human beings no other individual thoughts just his or her ownI guess I found the idea kinda comforting and I broke down I raised an eyebrow thats certainly not a usual response Comforting Milo You mean to say you enjoy being alone amp isolated  No the opposite actually I have a lovely group of friends a loving family and a fiancé but it was comforting for another reasonif Its just me then what hurts me is just me I know what im capable of and it makes any kinds of threats a moot point It means thatthat He put his hands up to his mouth and began crying silently the picture of this situation was getting uglier and murkier the more he explained It means that I might not die after all I rolled up my sleeves my flannel shirt was already beginning to chafe me First signs of stress I suppose I looked down at my charm bracelet my wife brought me and took in a deep breath I knew this was going to be rough Itsits my dreams doc Theres something in my dreams I cant sleep anymore Each time I do its like I can sense im going into that place again journeying deeper into the void with every evening Ive tried taking coffee shit loads of red bull and any cheap ass energy drinks I can get my hands onI even took those pills truckers take so they can stay wired for  hours butwell you know the problem right doc He looked down and started rubbing his hands together again his knee bouncing as he struggled to keep it under control Withdrawal symptoms combined with sleep deprivation this kid was getting more tweaked by the minute The problem being that we all have to sleep eventually no matter how long we put it off I exhaled Milo I want you to start at the beginning I know youre anxious to get some kind of help but if I dont know the route of the problem I cant give you the correct advice okay Now I want you take in  deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth Can you do that for me And you dont need to call me doc im just a volunteer counsellor You can call me Rami if you like He nodded and did as instructed his demeanour improving slightly with each successive inhale though this was hardly a permanent solution to his paranoia I didnt want to ask at this point how long hed been awake for but I could tell itd been more than a handful of days Once an individual goes past the  day mark they will begin to lose their grip on sanity and brain cells will start to die I was silently hoping I could find out the problem to this sooner rather than later  Alright I picked up my laptop to take notes Go ahead tell me what started this all offWhat follows is the unedited conversation this is verbatim what was said between the two of us If I can find the audio recording later I will attach it to the post  Do you know much about lucid dreaming Rami  I know a little just that its something practiced and allows for complete control of the dream by the dreamer He nods before continuing Theres a learning curve to it you need to lie in bed and shut out all outside sounds and impulses The typical things really the sensation to scratch your arm to roll over to block out the voices He stopped and stared at me with fear I didnt mean to tell you that  Its alright well get to it later lets just focus on the why and not the how for the moment What made you decide to lucid dream in the first place  He shifted in his chair and suddenly looked very timid I kept seeing him in my dreams at first hed just be a random appearance and then hed start to try and approach me friendly smile and hand outstretched like he was greeting an old friend Never threatening or hostile just attempting to make contact with me Though hed never get to Every single time id be distracted by something at the last second or my dream would veer off in another directionHe shifted in his seat and closed his eyes before continuing I remember in the first few dreams we had hed just be lingering in the background If I was walking through a street hed just be standing with the crowd my brain created and not really reacting to anything but me Id see him watch me but then my dream would shift and I guess id just ignore it and carry onafter a few weeks I began getting better at controlling my dreams Id start to mess around with the world I was inhabiting like Inception I guess but morepersonal Id turn myself into a member of XMen or id go on a date with my perfect woman yknowthings that you can only dream of literallywell thats when he started to become more apparent Id usually wake up before he actually got too close but Id always remember the look on his face before I did His eyes widened He always looked so angryFormer abuse victim I thought adding it to the list of potential issues and solutions I didnt want to stop him while he was on a roll I nodded to show my attentiveness and he continued I still remember the first time he managed to speak to me I was in a park id visited as a child with my mother It was a small piece of heaven in London back then a mental safe haven when things got too stressful I guess But this was nothing like I remembered it the trees werent trees they were corpses stacked on top of one another some overlapping andmeshing with one another in unspeakable positions to form branches I could feel the atmosphere almost turn to pure disgust as they noticed me unable to move or even speak to me But their eyes their eyes said everything Because at first they fixated on me with hatred then quickly away in sheer terror Theyd seen something far more terrifying than the fate they were already sufferingsoI His eyes welled up with tears unblinking as they streamed down his face  I looked Rami I looked and saw him standing some  feet away down the path his head bowed He wasnt moving and yet he was His body was almostrippling The closest way I can describe it is the way a signal on a TV channel in the old days used to bend and flicker when the signal was weak Every time I blinked he came closer I tried for the longest time to not blink reallyI did But the brain betrays your conscious impulses The more you try to put off a basic function the more your brain wills you to do it When he was  feet away he simply vanished By the time I had registered that he was gone I heard a whisper in my earhe was standing right behind me I could feel his breath on my neck Ramiit didnt feel humanThere was an awkward silence he took in some deep breaths and shuddered Obviously reliving the memory wasnt going to be something pleasant for him butthe way he reacted it was like he truly had experienced this I stared at him nodding and silently encouraging him to continue When he didnt I leaned forward and quietly asked him what im sure he was waiting me to ask What did he say to you MiloMilo shook his head Im sorry I dont remember That was when the dream ended I didnt see him again in my dreams for a whileWe talked for a little while longer mainly about his anxieties in crowds and eye contact then our time came to an end and we scheduled an appointment for the following week This would be our last session together  It was a Monday morning and id just come back from a friends wedding my wife and I had been drinking so by the time I got to the office I was nursing a hangover my flannel shirt covering the bruises id sustained falling over and my best pair of jeans smeared in alcohol It was a day my mind was not in the work I suppose I just wanted to get home and go to sleep    Milo came in earlier than planned he looked desperate He was pulling at his hair biting his fingernails and pacing constantly It didnt look like hed seen any sleep at all I sent a text to my colleague asking for security to come over as soon as possible He was going to need to be sectioned for his own safety How on earth hed managed to go this long without his friends or fiancee doing something is beyond me  I remember what he said Rami I remember it clearly now He said between pants and more nail biting Okay Milo Well why dont you take a seat and well talk it out He ignored that but stopped pacing and stared intently at me  Ill be right here always He put his arms around himself a self defence mechanism when a persons personal space has been violated That was what he said I heard it again and again every time I closed my eyes He started bashing at his temples IT WONT FUCKING STOP  All I could do at this point was try to keep him talking and calm until security got here  Did this make you afraid to dream Milo  He started laughing his face showing the complete opposite of his vocal expression Pure incredulity and fear on his face against the guttural sound of his manic laughter  You dont get it do you He didnt mean just when I dream He meant always Now I knownow I know for sure He took a deep breath in and his demeanour shifted he suddenly looked like a man almost at peace Not content but willing to let go  Thanks for listening Doc sharing this with someone was important to meand to him Hes going to have his work cut out for him im sure And just like that he got up and left I followed him out naturally concerned for him I watched him leave the building and cross the road  Then he did something I wont ever forget  He turned to me smiling and outstretched his hand crying openly as a vehicle struck him I didnt even see it coming I was so captivated by his expression  I couldnt even bring myself to go over to his body I gave my statement and went straight home All I could do was look in the mirror wondering what it was that was bothering me so much about how I looked and why Milo outstretching his hand was so disturbing to me When I looked at myself I didnt see a  lb brown coloured hipster I saw someone troubled someone who didnt look like theyd slept much lately someone like MiloI got a phone call from the hospital later on that evening Milo was in a coma and on life support He was nonresponsive and likely brain dead His family were choosing to keep his life support on in lieu of their religious and moral views I think deep down they just didnt want to let him go Id been asked to go into his apartment with a member of his family to see if there was anything to indicate why he would willingly stand in front of oncoming trafficI wont bore you with the traveling details but his apartment was surprising I was half expecting a filthy run down place filled with half eaten food and human waste given his obsessive and unstable state Guess I just watched too many detectivehorror movies growing up His place was immaculate everything was extremely clean and organised hed already packed up a lot of his material possessions into boxes with names on the front this was already beginning to look like premeditation He had a desk beside his bed this was the only place in his room that showed any signs of his lack of sanity rubbing off on his living conditions Books on demonology the science of sleeping DMT some sleeping pills and a journal His brother went through the boxes while I took a look at the journal ill include photos later if I get permission from the family names have been changed and anything too personal will of course be blurred out It initially contained legible competent insights into his nightly journeys as he began to lucid dream But as this other entity began to make himself more known and aware the content shifts and the writing becomes hastily scrawled certain words appear larger than others he questions himself on numerous occasions and draws the mans face more frequently as the journal comes to its end  The final entry is barely legible but it details a conversation he had with the man in his dream and that a reminder that he would be with him always  After this there is just a single word on the hardback of the journal rewritten over and over almost like its been carved in DREAMWhich brings us to the final part of this story the present Im sure youd all love to discover im actually cursed or that this story will follow some typical archetype of horror shorts and im moments away from death passing on a final message But as im sure youre all coming to realise that is not the case  I just woke up from a lucid dream ive never had one before nor do I know how I had one but it was definitely a lucid dream I was able to control my reality my own physical form and everything around me It was here I saw Milo He approached me slowly and before I could even say anything he asked me a favour  Pull the plug let me dieI was so taken aback that my rational thought process dissipated and for a moment I wonderedwas this perhaps a shared dream I cant take the torture anymore Rami Please tell my family I love them but I need to be let goIts okay you dont need to suffer anymore in the real world ill do what I can to convince them I croaked placing a hand on his shoulder Milos smile faded  Im not talking about the torture there Rami Im talking about the torture herewithout being able to wake up he has complete control Im his new puppet and he wants to play forever He has no physical form this is where he resides This is where he plays  He looked over my shoulder and back at me with a sad smile on his face   Now hes chosen you as his new playmate He knows youre going to take my place Look at my journal again look at the drawings youll need to rememberHe turned to walk away leaving me feeling completely helpless in my own lucid dream  Oh and Ramidont turn aroundI didnt but my entire being was willing me to Its that same feeling of anxiety you get when youre home alone at night and you have the feeling something is watching you A crushing horrifying feeling I woke up in a cold sweat and did as he said I looked over the journal and in addition to scanning the drawings I found a theory Milo had documented in between the pages of his journal An idea is manifested through suggestive stories and cultural signifiers we can plant ourselves a character or a concept into our subconscious and our dreams with enough hints both subversive and subliminal An idea be it malicious or noble can grow and manifest in one mind before being shared to the masses through any kind of information supplement  The second section detailed a supporting theory  Within every story told fictitious or semibiographical exists a universe that we have created that is as real as our own For how can we truly know if our reality is more valid than the one we have created How can we truly know we have not just been added into a story of our own by a neutral writer we know as god This reality is as malleable and relevant as the one within which we dream Our dream world or coma world it can be argued are the realities and our concept of reality is but a dream in itself that our brain creates to escape the chaos uncertainty and pain of our dreamsYoure probably painting a very good picture of what is happening right nowIve attached an image of the man in this story and im sure youre all familiar with him  If you are youll understand why ive done this  Why ive made you awareThere is no Ramiel that name is a subliminal plant in itself it means Dreamer in Arabic I described him perfectly for you as a defence mechanism against what is going to happen in the coming weeks months and years I gave you plenty of physical aspects for your brain to put together you only know a basic layer of who he is so that your brain can put in the key elements which will make you trust him You know its funny but I found out what Milo meant by Dream its an acronym Dream Rami Evil Always ManifestsThats where I got the idea for RamiHe exists now to help fight off him  Because now youve read this read my experience and Milos youre aware on a subconscious leveland he needs new playmates This is no warning that implies you can do something to change it You cant your dreams are his playground not yours  You can shrug this off as another horror short if you like if that makes you feel better and sleep easier But he doesnt just strike the night you fall asleep he strikes when you allow your dreams to become more open and easier to mould He only enters when the reality is in flux  But with Ramiel in your head now too you have a guide a protector to help you  I didnt At least Milo is at peace hopefully I will be soon too Ive been putting off sleep for days I cant keep doing it much longer   Im beginning to feel drowsy I took a large amount of sleeping pills before writing this last section I cant put off sleeping forever I dont know whether im going to wake up or not but at least youve all been warned about him Feel free to reverse google image search the hosted image learn about him and if you do feel a sense of familiarity please be carefulDream of Ramiel you will be safe I wish you all the best you might not know my name or my face but do not forget my story  I will do my best to answer any of your questions in the comments later Do not forget about him Because believe me he wont forget about you when you fall asleepThe worst thing about all this Im not sure he stays in the dream world anymore When Milo looked at me I think I mistook his expression and his gesture At the time I thought he was crying and happy stretching his hand out to shake my hand Now I think he was terrified to see his worst fears manifested in the real world and he was stretching his hand out to stop him getting to me in the real world Why say this now Well ive been getting steadily drowsier and Ive felt something breathing down my neck for the last  minutes Who knows maybe its just my paranoia Sweet dreams

afewsmallrepairs,11,49,1rff0q,185,Theres always some chipper real estate agent waiting at the door with her flyers and her toobig smile and her nails painted to match her pantssuit  Theyre nosy and smothering but today I see that this one is busy with a bright young couple pointing out how much eastern light the kitchen gets with one perfectlylacquered finger the same goddamn shade of melonred as her smart little blazer  I still take a flyer from the cheery wicker basket in the front hallway out of politeness more than anythingThe house smells like cookies  Its an old realtor trick make someone think that they could be happy in this strange new place picture yourself cozied up on the couch with a plate of freshbaked chocolate chip cookies and a mug of hot cocoa and suddenly the price doesnt seem quite so steep  People want to feel like theyre homeIts a candle I think  Smells soursweet and artificialI realize suddenly Ive been standing alone in the foyer for a few minutes staring aimlessly into the house  Where to begin  The living room I guessTheres a big ugly fauxleather couch along one wall  The cheap kind you find at Big Lots  It doesnt serve much except to fill up the space  Its flanked by two particle board end tables little doilies on top of these  Miss MelonRed Blazer doesnt have much of a sense of style if this is her handiwork  The room looks like a scene straight out of a s Sears catalog  I can feel one of my headaches coming on like the low rumbling of summer thunder on the horizonThere are little dimples on the walls paint covering old nail holes left behind from family photos that once hung there  Scenes of summer vacations children playing smiling happy faces  You only put up pictures if the people in them are smiling rightWell the realtor hasnt put up any pictures  The room feels empty skeletal without themI move into the bathroom  Nothing special here more mementos from Walmart in the form of a seashellshaped soap dish and a tacky plastic shower curtain but Ive found the cookiescented candle so I blow it out with deep sense of satisfactionThere are two bedrooms  One at each end of the hall  I choose the one to my right feeling faintly like Alice in Wonderland as the real estate agent babbles away in the sunny kitchens eastern lightIts a small bedroom  The baseboards look brand new even though the house is several decades old whoever replaced them was an amateur  This looks like a shitty piecemeal job done by someone without nearly enough time or care  Its a shame is what it is  This would all have to be redoneTheyve set up this room as a home office but it should be the childrens bedroom  Where the thriftstore desk and bookshelf sit I can picture two tiny pink beds with matching flowery comforters sweet shiny stickers placed haphazardly across each headboard as little girls sometimes doThe headache is no longer approaching its here spidery sensations of dull pain spreading across my brain  I tap my knuckles against the space between my eyes but it holds fastFocus  I brace myself against the doorframe and there it is the telltale trace of someones childhood tiny little ticmarks carved in the wood to indicate height and its progression through time  I run my fingertips along these marks still so visible through the fresh coat of paint  It even looks like someone tried to sand them off  who would do something like that  Who would try to erase the remnants of someones lifeIf I dont leave I might faint all the blood is in my head with the headache so I do leave I move down the hall to the other roomThis one is the master bedroom  Looks like they couldnt afford a bed to properly stage the scene so this one feels even emptier than the den  The walls have been repainted a cheerful robinsegg blue but its wrong  Its all wrongThey did a fantastic job covering any sign of the fire but this color I hate this color it clashes with my bedspread and I wouldve never slept here beneath this hideous shade of blue  though there were many nights I suppose I didnt sleep I lay awake for hours trying to comprehend what had gone wrong where he was and why he thought he could fool meI drop to a knee to touch the outlet in the wall  Its new of course they wouldve had to replace it  Faulty wiring that causes fires well that just wouldnt do  When the bank takes a house it cant sell one with such a serious problem  Sometimes things need to be replaced resold  A fixerupper thats what theyd call itThe headache is in full force now yet a small smile tugs at the corner of my mouth when I remember everything hed promised to do to this damned house all the little projects he swore up and down hed finish someday to make this place perfect for me things that went forgotten when he decided his energy would be better spent fucking any secretary at the office that looked his wayIt wasnt hard  I went to the library two counties over and did research on arson  I was careful used the private browser on Google Chrome and still cleared the history wore a wig  Id seen enough about Casey Anthony to know how careful you have to be even if she did get off  but no one will ever truly believe she was innocent shell be a pariah forever and thats simply not how I planned to live the rest of my lifeIm really sorry about the children  My daughters  I truly am  I didnt know theyd be in our bed that night  They were supposed to be at a friends house but they came home early someone had pulled someone elses hair and that set everything off like a line of terrible fateful dominoes and the headaches were getting worse and it was probably all for the best anyway  I didnt do anything that couldnt be fixed with a few small repairs both to the house and my lifeIt makes me so angry  He was still acting like father of the year when every night for months he slipped under the sheets beside me reeking of some other womans sex  He couldnt even bother to take a shower and rinse the stink off his dick but he was still being a model dad letting our daughters snuggle next to him when the boogeyman came in the dark and mommy wasnt there because she was away at her own mommys the perfect alibi for when the police came to tell her Im sorry maam theres been an accident could you please come with usIm still crouched next to the outlet when I hear Miss MelonRed Blazer behind me inquiring politely if theres anything she can help me with  The bright young couple has gone and it smells like shes relit the candle in the bathroomI straighten tucking a strand of the long blonde wig behind my ear and smiling in the way that makes members of the service industry smile back at meI explain Im just looking  The price on the house is so low though what could possibly cause such a dramatic drop in this recovering economyThe real estate agents smile falters and she hesitates  I know shes bound by law to tell me to explain what happened here and why the pricetag on a little creampuff in a nice neighborhood is next to nothingI know the old saying about returning to the scene of the crime how dangerous it is and how not careful Im being right now but something in me cant resist because I can still see the little matching beds the stickers across the headboards and the ticmarks on the doorframe and something inside me needs to hear her say it to quantify each and every step I took to get hereWell she says slowly about a year ago there was a fireI nod and smile and as she tells me my story in her own words and somewhere in the back of my skull the headache lets go the pain in my brain dissipating at last leaving behind just me and the real estate agent in my old bedroom standing in the same place where about a year ago my plan went into motion and I set my husband and children

horriddaydream,16,65,1r68c5,177,My father always taught me to be kind to everyoneThere was this garbage dump close to my home I cant say anybody got a thrill out of living closely to the wretched thing for it stunk all to Hell and the trucks constantly entering and exiting could be an extreme annoyance I walked on the outskirts of town frequently past midnight which you may say is stupid especially if you saw my build and how small of a person I am and just how difficult it would be for me to protect myself from anyone A few times as I passed by the alwaysopened gates of the dump I also passed the man who would enter their limits every single nightAs shady as he was he had a lot to sayHis name was Terrance and he had been staying in the dump at night ever since it had opened back in  He had long straggly hair and he claimed that this area was just too dry the job shortage was unbelievable He would probably never have his own house I felt the upmost of pity for him and sometimes I even welcomed him to walk with me Everybody always seemed to know Terrance He was like the friendly neighborhood hobo They would nod to him wave give him a few dollars thank me for being so kind to him even though I would shrug it off and whisper that he was simply good company I asked him where he went during the day and he just said everywhere He had a huge black satchel that he slung over his back that probably contained normal homeless materials like paper towels maybe a few little scraps of food It always smelled but he smelled in general though I was too nice to say anything He claimed that there was a hollowedout truck near the far side of the garbage dump and he would stay there at night because it was warm and it was shelter It made me want to cry just the situation that this poor man was inI lived with only my father and so on occasion I would invite Terrance home to have a warm meal and my father was more than happy about this He was a kind man as I was a kind young adult and he completely understood that my heart was in the right place Terrance knew everything about our family in only a short amount of time and he never once took advantage of us He was just a man who had no direction after losing his wayTerrance disappeared for a couple of days I peered in through the gates of the garbage dump thinking twice about entering I walked to the back and noticed that there was nobody inside the shell of the truck that he had described to me a many of times But as I peeked inside the windows I saw many black satchels just like the one that Terrance was always carrying Most of them were empty but others were still shut tightly and looked full I reported the sceneThe cops had found small children of all shapes sizes ages and genders inside the bags He had been living off of them for years There was a lack of missing children in the area though some were found to be local Nobody knew where they had all come fromHe had been inside our house He had been inside my headNow he was nowhere to be foundFollow httpswwwfacebookcomDaydreamPublishing,Black Satchels,242,nosleep,top_week
OdysseyTheCrip,45,47,1r4dm5,150,Fuck meI was told to come here by a friend of mine having never heard of nosleep personally Im not really on board with the idea of having a community of people read my story for personal pleasure but hey what ever I guess a little bit of back story is needed here I live on the nice end of Vancouver city with my grandmother Im in secondary school and that school is in my general poshish neighborhood   days ago I was Getting home from a longass boring day at school I decided to Fuck around on DayZ until either I died or fell asleep at the keyboard At around  my Dog Buddy Decided to be the most annoying little shit possible So i turned my computer off and put the little fuckers leash on At this time of night the whole block was lights out I Could barely see  feet minutes of walking later I began to feel a bit paranoid street lights were flickering fog was getting thicker Buddy on the other hand was  trotting along rubbing his little schnauzer face in the frosted grass Then he stopped Dead in his tracks then buried his head in my calves I urged him to keep moving and after much encouragement he reluctantly followedI rounded a corner going back toward my place when i spotted a figure in the fog a big one Thinking nothing of the fact just someone else enjoying the fucking weather or something As we got closer buddy started barking crazily I urged him to shut up lest he wake the neighbors Then I got a good look at the figure It was a man  about pale He had a brown tweed waist coat a brown tweed fedora and some brown baggy suit pants As we neared him Buddy grew more and more franticThats when I noticed his smile The scariest fucking smile you will ever see He looked like he won the lottery got laid and inherited a mansion within a period of  minutes It stretched from ear to ear a yellowed fake smileGod i wish i could have unseen itI was within about  feet of him then the smell hit me It was a mix between pure decay shit aged cheese Then he stopped right in front of me and said in the most strange voice like an elderly man trying to be smoothYou have a cute dog there boyUh yeah thanksI guess something in my voice must have pleased him or something cause he chuckled a sick smokers laugh I began to move away from him breaking eye contact Looking back on it I should have just fucking ranHe grabbed my armDo you want to see my dogI looked down and i realized he had a leash too He yanked on it and trailing blood Came the corpse of a maggot riddled dogI threw up in my mouth This thing that was once a dog was missing patches of white fur its skin was turning green bits of skin were missing its ear was ripped and an eye was gone I couldnt even tell what the dogs fucking breed wasThrough his smiling teeth he saidPet the dogMy dog was oddly quite this whole timei missed his barkingI tried to get away he tightened his grip on my arm then he dug his finger nails into mePet the dogPlease No was all that came out of my mouthHis smile drained instantly Into an angry twisted frown teeth still showing PET THE FUCKING DOG He screamed yellow spittle flying from his mouth my arm was turning red from the irritation his brown fingernails were causing meI had no choice but to pet the dog I reached down slowly and ran my free hand along its back The fur and skin began to peel back as maggots crawled along my palm My hand was covered in a clear slimy film He let go of my arm then shoved me I landed flat on my ass on the pavement Then i took off running My dog was sprinting along with me Then i heard him laugh then screamNOW I WANT TO PET YOUR DOGMy blood went coldI heard pounding on the pavement behind me and a dragging He was coming after me pulling his dog along with him Running  straight blocks i ran down my alleyway my house was at the end of the block I flew down the alley still hearing his laughter and slamming footsteps behind me I got to my house ran up the stairs and fumbled for my house keys As His laughter grew in volume to an unbearable height i got the door open shoved my dog in then slammed it and locked it not even a full second after I locked the door there was a slam on it He had ran into the door This slamming continued for  minutes and then silence I waited  minutes then called the cops in less than  minutes they were here I told them exactly that what happened they told me theyd book the guy Until then they told me not to leave the housenot  minutes after they left i was asleep on the couch with my dogI was awoken to the sound of a door bell ringing I practically jumped off the couch ran into the kitchen grabbed a kitchen knife and went to the door thinking to myself Im gonna kill this bastardI Flung open the door knife in stabbing motionNo one was there NobodyThen I looked down And threw up The fucking dog corpse was sitting there in a pool of bloodNailed into the dogs head was a noteI dont like it when they runRight now Im sitting in my house With no one but my grandmother who is too sickly to get out of bed My parents and my little brother are out of town at a dude ranch in the interior of the province Fuck dammitEDIT Im sorry if theres any spelling

Magnum,33,77,1r5par,129,Born in the mid s i grew up active and was outdoors alot However as the technological age began I found myself inside more and more As I grew i spent more and more time watching TV playing videogames on my Super Nintendo And when the Sony Playstation came out my parents couldnt pry me from the screen As a consequence my eyesight suffered Slowly at first but as i got older it became an issue It was never so bad that I couldnt see without glasses but it was bad enough that i needed them to drive when i turned  However as senior in high school i quickly lost my glasses and proceeded to drive anyways No wrecks no tickets I thought that maybe my eyesight had improved over the few months that i had actually worn my glasses Oh how I wish I had been right Halfway between being  and  i picked up a job as a delivery driver Easy at first Until i had to start driving at night The night I almost ran off the road because I couldnt see through the oncoming cars headlights was the night I knew I had to get a new pair of glasses The next day I made an appointment and    business days later i had my new glasses Nothing special Just a simple blue metal frame with slightly skinnier than average lenses I Wore them all day And whenever someone asked how it felt to have new glasses i smiled and would comically sing Its a whole new world you know that cute little song from The Little Mermaid Oh how right i was As I prepared for bed that night getting changed taking a shower It all seemed normal Until I wore my glasses into my darkened bedroom No light was on in my room And i had foolishly turned off the hallway light before entering my bedroom Now in total darkness I realized just what real fear was You see with my slightly blurred vision of not wearing glasses any shadow could be brushed off simply because i couldnt focus and see what was just beyond the outer veil of darkness that covered them But now with those infernal glasses I could see them clear as day The creatures from monster stories My own personal Boogiemen All sitting around my room watching waiting inviting me to lay down and fall asleep right in their midst Right in my own bed I stood stunned Terrified Not Knowing what to do When suddenly one of them spoke The most terrifying voice I had ever heard Why not run away again child It amuses us to watch you at night oblivious to our very existence Unaware that you lay right where we want you Each and every night I stared blankly and felt confused Again How could i have seen these creatures before and not remember it Surely I would have some memory But none came As if to answer my question it spoke again Perhaps these will jog your memory It brought up its gnarled hand and unclenched its fist palm up to reveal my original pair of glasses A pair now almost three years old Thats when it hit me I hadnt lost my glasses But thrown them away Into a river Nearly twenty miles from where i lived Now more afraid than anything I did the only thing I could I laid down in my bed Removed my glasses and watched as those terrible Boogiemen again returned into those empty featureless shadows that surround each and every one of us every night as we lay down to sleep,Glasses,206,nosleep,top_week

out there I mean literally out there above the sky  Have you ever just stared at the stars and wished that youd some day get to see the Galaxy like it was a Star Wars or Mass Effect civilization I was no naive for the yearning I used to feel Now Im the dog who actually caught the carI have no idea what to do with itand I couldnt laugh if I triedSunday night maybe amI had just shut down my computer after my nightly gaming session  I was laying in bed browsing reddit on my phone and debating whether or not I was hungry enough to eat another can of spaghettios or if it would even be worth the trouble of walking downstairs and waiting for it to heat up Im not sure what made me notice it what actually snapped my senses to the realizationbut it was suddenly too quietGranted it was am so its not like I was expecting any sort of noise in particular  My roommate had fallen asleep hours ago but it was just so still  Im not sure if any of you know what Im talking about but it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up  I felt like I was in a vacuum it was utterly oppressive Im not sure how long I sat there waiting for something before the glow  A deep blood red light had flooded the hall and oozed under my door and it was slowly pulsing  I wanted to call out to tell my roommate to fuck off but I knew it wasnt him I just knew I dont think I couldve formed words if I tried  The vacuum sensation I had felt was gone and now sitting in my tiny bedroom I felt like I was under a microscope That terrible like youre being watched sensation I read about so much hit me like a brick  I cant explain how exactly I felt a mix of horror dread and confusion  I wanted to bolt but I wouldnt have been able to force myself to open that door if I triedI managed to shuffle off my bed and to the floor  I opened up my nightstand reaching for my revolver I needed to feel that cold steel and the heft of it in my hand As soon as I picked it up I was at a loss because for the first time it just felt like a toy in my hand I looked back to the door to that glow and felt completely powerless  There was a shadow now someone was standing outside my bedroom door and I felt like I might as well have been holding a nerf gun  When the long scratch started I felt nauseous  Like I was  again smoking weed in my room when I thought I had the house to myself and my mom knocked on the door asking why the fuck it smelled like burning leaves in the hall That sudden weight in my stomach the sudden dryness in my mouthIt was like a nail being dragged down the door from the top of the doorway to the bottom  I followed the sound with my eyes and when it stopped I heard a voice  Hear might not be the right word because it came from inside my headMichael Please put down the weapon  We do not want to harm you and I do not plan on doing so Your weapon would be useless anyways but I respect your autonomy May I enterThis had to be a dream a nightmare If every waking moment since Iheard that voice hasnt been an eternity in a waking hell I might be able to convince myself that it wasI wish to speak with you Michael We have much to discuss May I enterThere was no fucking way this was happening  Imlucky I didnt need to because I couldnt have spoken if I tried  Whatever it was must have known there was no way I would have let it in because it answered me anywaysNo matter you will see us in due time  We would like to invite you on a journey Michael  You will come with us and see everything you have always wished to Weve known you for a long time you would say years  You have a week to decide we will not force you You will require no luggage no currency You will want for nothing  You will not see your family or friends again but in time you will cease to worry about them   We respect your decisions I do think however you only have one real choice  I will see you soonThen it was all just overI might have sat there for hours At some point I got up and sat on my bed  When I finally mustered the courage to look out the window it was already dawn When I heard my roommate get up and go to work and finally figured it was safe to open my doorI am a shell  I dont know what to do you guys  I havent slept I forced myself to eat something yesterday but everything tastes of cardboard  I booted up my computer but now my life just feels like a game Im sick of I forced myself to talk to my parents the other day and smile at work but any interaction I have feels forced and artificiallike Im just going through the motions There was no way I could mention what happened Sunday

kimmiekissies,13,30,1rgt5c,119,I never even met him I didnt know his name or face I was blissfully unaware of his very existence I will never know why or when it started Im glad for that I guess I moved into my very small apartment in February last year My landlord Olivia was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers She was great to me even after telling her my problem Im antisocial but she didnt mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave letting me know she was leaving something for me I loved that Not even my family would cook so well The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again My other neighbors seemed fine but I never talked or visited with them I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an uncomfortable situation I loved living alone it was everything I hoped for I could just breathe By April though I started noticing things were not right They were moving or plain disappearing I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move another side affect was it would make me so drowsy Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring Until one incident doubled my paranoia Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia and woke up that evening at pm Per usual what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed I only sleep on the right side Always Even more it felt warm My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot but I knew it was to odd to dismiss I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with  typed in Nothing else was disturbed everything was exactly like it should be I let it go for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain I thought about telling someone my parents maybe Olivia but if its not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone I wasnt scared I was nervous maybe a little stubborn But I stayed I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world May came and It was getting worse My panties toothbrush hell even my food was being misplaced Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air I finally realized this wont go away by ignoring it I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days when I got home I told them everything Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror Written all over that walls COME BACK BABY PLEASE He ran out and called the police There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me The investigation revealed a man Henry the son of my landlord Olivia was in a projected relationship with me They showed me his confession on tape He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mothers extra key He claims we were in love and he had my permission He drugged his mothers food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep touch my hair kiss my shoulder The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed I was absolutely horrified and disgusted A man I never knew existed collected my drain hair clothes and trash and practically lived in my apartment for four monthsedit paragraphing,I used to live by myself,149,nosleep,top_week
tellmewhatiswrong,39,47,1rhbuc,115,OriginalPosthttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsreivzneedsomeadvicemywifeseemstobeinsomeThanks to everyone for your responses I have taken a lot of your adviceIll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours I was going to walk our dog Zeus but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confusedShe woke up after a couple of hours and waswell Happy Really really happy Almost manic She woke up full of beans and smiling like a maniac I was initially relieved I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed We set off for our normal walk and she was extremely energetic bounding off in front of Zeus and I Zeus is a Labrador and although he is a big boy hes still a pup We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as were trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable Its always been a real task getting him back on the leash though he never ever comes when hes called Anyway we let him off and hes running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough My wife shes picking flowers and sniffing them and singing She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit as she sings under her breath I was feeling quite content at this point Figured she must have just been over tiredShes swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt She yells in an almost unfamiliar masculine voice Zeus Here and points in front of her feetI stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know solemnly trot over to where shes pointing sit in front of her and stare up into her face They both sat there for a split second very still looking at each other I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her Umwhat the hell How did you manage that and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again and she started swinging again  Oh she said I used my mind to call out to himits something new I learnedShe seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest I pressed her for more details but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got She knows I dont believe that for a second Im just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained Thats really the only explanation I asked her to do it again but she refused so I think we both know it was a flukeThe rest of the afternoon wasnice Kind of odd Its like theres something thats amiss Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that something is not how it should be but you cant pin point whatWe talked a bit about the seminar She said that it was very intense The days were very long She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset to explore the root causes for whats going on in your life I asked if any hypnosis was used as suggested by you guys and she said no They talked a lot and were assigned to small groups and encouraged to open up and explore their inner beings She said she felt a lot better since attendingStill something was not quite right For instance we were talking about my sister who lives in another state and how she had recently got a new job A few minutes later my phone rang and it was her I picked it up and said Emma Speak of the devil and my wife smashed me up the side of the head causing me to drop the phone and shouted Emma is NOT the devil How could you say that Emma is NOT THE DEVIL I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down She was very upset at what I had said She sort of went silent again and was very still She seemed rather annoyed at me but by this point I was nearing exhaustion myself so I let her beShe fell asleep early about pm on the couch I covered her with a blanket and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and Ive never noticed it before I think that in my state of hyper vigilance I am being overly perceptive of small details I read more of my original post and all your comments and decided to step outside and call our therapist just to find out more about the seminar as I knew she was there assistingI walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her She answered on my first ring What she said has really weirded me out Only because although she gave me a lot of information she has raised many more questions as well as answered them She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda who are both selfappointed psychotherapists She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state they may need assistance She said she has referred a lot of her clients to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases Basically the course is about discovering your inner self and using different methods to connect to your inner voice to find out what the cause of your worries are She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense Each session goes for  hours with only an hour break During these sessions many different activities and topics are explored including regression Apparently Brian does this  hour session on the second last day where he gets everyone to meditate and be still and he regresses them back to childhood or even in some extreme cases past lives Our therapist said it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that but that she seemed brighter had a clarity about her after this experience They discussed what my wife had gone back to in her mind and the therapist was happy that it hadnt caused her any great distress but reminded me she couldnt discuss the specifics She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her experience I told her about my wifes strange behaviour She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions but nothing major I dont know if its just me but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice I dont know maybe I imagined it She said to call her if theres any further problems I hung up and as I was putting out my cigarette I turned to go inside and my wifes standing there staring at me I jump and say Jesus Christ honey you scared me and she replied Not as fucking much as Im going to scare you Ummm ok I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face and her face was fixed in this awful scowl I figured she must still be pissed at me from before I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep And well thats where she is now she was supposed to be off work today too but I was meant to go back to my job But when my alarm went off I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok I rang in sick for work and Im just doing some household jobs waiting to see if shes better when she wakes up and googling what regression means and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone Still nothing that convincing though I dont know Maybe Im too skeptical I just dont believe this crapThe whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me if Im honest But I have to say it has caused some kind of change in my wife She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment and Im worried because we both have to go back to work tomorrow and her work environment is very proper She is always a perfect employee and very dedicated to her work I cant help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in thismood Do you guys know anything about this regressionis it the same as hypnosis She was adamant she wasnt hypnotised but it sounds like it to meEDIT Ok now Im getting really freaked out I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep I cant quit work out what song shes singing Ive never heard it before But shes saying something about being someone called Azara or something Its really fucking unnerving it doesnt even sound like her Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light EDIT TWO Ok I managed to record a bit of itshes singing but I dont know what has anyone heard this before Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her Im kind freaked out now Ill admit it Here it

ephique,32,31,1r5tqd,93,Me and my brother were spending some quality time playing old video games from our childhood just chilling on the couch in my upstairs bedroom when the electricity in the entire house went out It was just us two home at this point and it was pitch black outside In desperation of finding our way through the house we used our phones to take flashshots giving us a small update of where in the big upstairs level of the house we were trying to make our way to the staircase leading downWe finally did and from there it wasnt ridiculously hard to manage ourselves to find some candles and what not We did what we could to drain out the time while waiting out the electricityproblem Eating sausage rolls gossiping and having conversations about what games to play once the electricity was backIt did come back after a couple of hours We already found ourselves in the kitchen positioned in the lower level of the house so we brought some snacks and drinks before we inevitably decided to continue our journeys into Donkey Kong Country Super Mario World and Castlevania  on the Super NintendoUpon starting our Super Nintendo my brother asked me where the remote for the tv was since we both were too lazy to actually use the power button on the tv Although the remote was nowhere to be found While looking for the remote which we both swore has never been anywhere else than on the coffeetable next to the couch the electricity ran out againMy brother expressed as he sighed Oh come on are you kidding me Being slightly more prepared the second time we picked up our phones and started taking flashshots again After a couple of shots the memory on my phone ran out I never thought we had taken that many pictures Either way I entered my image library on my phone to delete the old photos from the first time the electricity went out I took a good look at the first picture I opened it was my brother walking ahead of me just before we reached the stairs There was a man standing just next to him in the picture,Where is the remote,124,nosleep,top_week
slightlyspooked,45,21,1re11f,90,NoSleep I need your help Where do I begin I started working volunteer shifts at my local community centre about  months ago I love my job I get on well with all my coworkers but somethings been bothering me recently More than bothering me actually Theres been an attack on a child Well  I cant call it an attack exactly Everyones calling it an accident but I cant believe that Let me start over This whole thing began when the centre began to hold saturday clubs  an hour or two every weekend when kids are given pretty much free reign over the place We put on activities  cake baking crafts that kind of thing  and just generally keep an eye on the placeWere also there to keep the kids out of the basement Id like to say before I start that Ive never heard of anything being up with the basement before Im not a particularly superstitious person or at least I wasnt before all of this happened and I dont scare easy Basically the kids have to stay out of the basement because theres a lot of junk down there that could topple over onto one of them or otherwise get them in trouble Just to reiterate this is the only reason I was ever given for keeping them out of the basementBut kids arent satisfied by a simple its dangerous down there They wanted to know why Well I spun them this cock and bull story about how Id seen a monster down there once The other volunteer that day Julie joined in on the fun immediately and soon we had them all believing that there was something dark and horrible in the basement that would snatch them up and eat them if they ever went down there Were talking about  year olds here so the stories werent particularly gory or scary  but they believed us pretty much right off the bat Maybe thats why things went so weird Im sure those of you whove been around children know that they see the world in a different way to the rest of us  what seems to us like childish fantasy might as well be real life to them Anyway I told them that story three or four weeks before the incident Every Saturday wed have these kids in and every Saturday the veteran members of the group would take on the duty of informing the new members of what horrific fate awaited them should they wander into the basement With each telling theyd add details Some of them were actually very grim  they came up with one about a Victorian boy  bearing in mind that the community centre was only built in  that had been eaten by the monster and still roamed the halls crying out to go home The details got more and more gory  they came up with the idea that the monster would mark its victims with three slashes of its horrendous glistening claws  this was the same week we were showing the Zorro movies on the old projector In short it was beginning to seem as though Saturday Club had turned into NoSleep Junior We had complaints from parents about their children being too scared to come in and so my boss decided it was time to put a stop to the monster talk We tried everything we could to get the kids to stop talking about it  we played nonmonstery games with them we made apple pie we even passed the caretaker off as a professional monster hunter That kept them quiet for a while and we began to hope that theyd lost interest altogether In the meantime though I began to feel more and more uneasy locking up the centre at night I had no reason to be afraid  Julie or one of my other coworkers was usually waiting at the front desk for me in case there was trouble and the Zumba fitness group usually hung around outside until we locked up anyway In short nobody could get in without one of us noticing I mention that because the night before the attack I could have sworn I heard someone   a small someone  crying all through my lockup It always seemed like the voice was coming from the next corner but when I looked there was nobody there I even got Julie out to have a look  she said she couldnt hear anything but I could tell she was concerned Maybe she just wanted to get home early I dont know I told the police I hadnt seen anyone for definite anyway I wasnt working the next day but thats when the attack happened I dont know much about the details  the police told me that Julie heard crying and screaming from the basement and went down to find two of our regulars Tommy and Rosie spattered with blood and crying When she rounded the corner she discovered a third child  I wasnt told his name he was new  lying unconscious beneath a shelf She confided to me later that while shed told police the shelf must have toppled onto him it looked more like hed been hiding beneath it What sent me to you guys though is the other thing Julie told me Her first instinct being a mother herself was to pull the child out from under the shelf and make sure he was okay He didnt have any of the injuries shed expect in this kind of accident  no broken bones not even a bruise Instead he had three bloody lines carved into his chest Three large horrible claw marks When the police asked the other two children what theyd witnessed theyd only say The monster got him The Centre is closed until further notice  I think they think theres some sort of psychopath living there Thats the logical explanation but somehow I cant help questioning it When I pass by the closed Centre I swear I can hear a child crying inside  crying to go home The boy is okay by the way  apparently hes recovering at home but he wont name his attacker Hell only say that something got him I take a little comfort knowing that hes alright but how long will it be before something else happens Something worse Im afraid NoSleep  what have I done,Ive Created a Monster,111,nosleep,top_week

BensonHedges,4,25,1r2xlz,77,I heard the coffee pot drip before my alarm even went off bizarre I dont usually set a timer I like to go to the gym before I have my coffee Maybe it was my boyfriend being nice He typically works the graveyard shift and sometimes he comes home in the early morning to leave nice surprises Might as well get up I said aloud to myself since no one else was home My cat was absent from the bed which is also weird hes usually by my head in the mornings As I stretch my legs and arms out I notice an odd chill run up my spine Surely it was the weather New England has a way with inconsistent temperatures and the blanket over me was not quite fit for winter Its November that sixtydegree weather is bound to disappear sooner or later I havent quite figured out the thermostat we just moved in and the heat only seems to kick in on times when Im not home Must be the reason we bought this place so cheapand why people keep selling it New England is not the place to have a busted heating system This has been the biggest point of arguments since my boyfriend and I started cohabitating Get out of bed youre going to be late to your class I said this to myself a few times in hopes to have motivation to get to the am class at the gym I had no idea what time it was but if the coffee pot is going off it was creeping close to sunrise I havent unpacked the alarm clocks yet so my phones been the only thing reminding me what time of the day it is I thrusted my arms to the floor and pulled my phone to my bed   am What the fuck Ive still got twoandahalf hours of sleepand why is the coffee pot onI slipped out of the bed from the left side and stumble to the kitchen to turn off the coffee pot Im a coffee lover but nothing smells worse than burntcoffee As I went to flip the switch to off I realize the time isnt illuminated on the pot Directly above on the microwave  nothing Damnit The power went out The dripsound of the coffee pot was so loud and it was too early I was confused I could even smell the lingering scent of fresh brewed coffeebut it was am my mind must be playing tricks on me I headed back to the bedroom a little freaked out but convinced it was just all a coincidence This hallway seems so much longer in the dark and I still havent gotten used to the layout of this condo As I pass the bathroom I notice a shadow out of the corner of my eye I turned my head and didnt see anything except the shower curtain pulled all the way open Since weve moved in we havent used that showerweve got a shower stall in the bedroommuch more convenient Though I am sure there was a logical explanation for it When I get to the bedroom  another chill down my spine This was uncomfortable it was a winter chill I was feeling I was sure of that Something was wrong but i couldnt figure it out I need to go back to bedI hop in the bed and pick the blankets from off the floor As I turn on my side I hear the heater click on The electricity is back onfantastic I start counting sheep in my head to fall back asleep and keep thinkinghow did the blankets end up on the floorWhat feels like an hour later my alarm finally goes off The smell of burnt coffee has filled the condo and now Im frustrated I should have just unplugged the damn thing And where is my cat I have most definitely woken up on the wrong side of the bed I moved to the kitchen to pour some coffee  and its dry Nothing I must be imagining things That chill again I could feel the hairs spike up on my neck  absolutely razor sharp I decided to skip the gym and start my morning I remained timid but continued with my normal routine As I rummaged around the kitchen I noticed my cat out of the corner of my eye He was twitchy and obviously anxious A few years ago my cat had major anxiety problems and he developed what my vet called  Rolling Skin Syndrome When my cat got anxious his skin would roll around his body it looked almost as if he had a small gum ball moving around beneath his fur Today that ball was most definitely movingHe paced back and forth around the house with me now seeming more comfortable now that I was up with him Every time I moved to another room he cautiously peeked around the corner almost as if he was looking for something We moved to the bathroom I started to floss and then I heard itdrip drip drip I am sure its not the coffee pot and the house starts to smell again As I analyze my senses the smell become more pungent Less of a coffee smell and more of a rancid scent Drip drip dripI follow the noise it seems louder now and it seems like its coming from the bedroom Surely I would have heard it loud and clear when I was in bed earlierit seemed so distant then I enter the bedroom and my cat stopped dead in his tracks His skin is rolling again and he appeared more on edge tail straight in the air and its hairs following suit And that chill of course it was back And my sheets and blankets on the floor againWHAT THE FUCK Im working from home today and every time I walk by the bedroom I get the chills Ive resorted to closing the door until Im not alone It sounds like the wind is blowing up against the windows in that room

TheGroovyTurte,12,22,1raatv,76,So Im not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told if only for my own piece of mind  Im an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously underserved community  The hospital itself is old its been standing since the late s it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium Ive never really encountered anything supernatural but I havent written off the existence of such phenomena  That being said a shadow in the night isnt enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the nightSo when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty well  Id have my admissions Id take care of the current patients without issue  Then one night I got an admission Ill call this patient Jerry  Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any would be physician that trains at this facility  He has a whole boat load of medical issues kidney problems diabetes high blood pressure  He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia Before meeting Jerry I was told hes actually a really fun guy hes always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here  So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen I was a little anxious  The admission was done the orders were placed and I didnt think more of it  He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night  It was around  in the morning when I went back to see Jerry  I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up  When I went in there Jerry wasnt in his bed  Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying not crying but rather whimpering as if he didnt have the stamina to make it a full cry  I tried putting on a brave face and said Jerry whats going on For an old guy Jerry was quicker than I thought and stronger than I would have believed  He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him  They wont leave me alone they wont let me sleep they wont let me eat  He continued on in this line of things the phantom they wouldnt let him do  I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home  As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this I still needed the blood and this wasnt the first time Id dealt with a confused older patient  I helped Jerry back to his bed  Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK  Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient it was something familiar  I tied the tourniquet in place then I cleaned his arm found my vein and went for it  Im not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing I was filling up my vial it was about half way full when Jerry started screaming LEAVE ME ALONE LEAVE ME ALONE He began to jerk violently somehow the needle stayed in place but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerrys body was pulling it back  I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm but the needle didnt budge  In shock I pulled harder my efforts still could not budge the needle  In response I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing  The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being  full to maybe being about  full  After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerrys arm leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise  Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me Can you see them  I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room  I walked back to the nursing station one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming  I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill  With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep  I made my way to the oncall room which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital  I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes  All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerrys eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing and a senile sick old man  The only trouble is since then the shadows Ive seen in dark rooms seem darker the lights unable to pierce them  The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings  Im not really sure what to make of it  In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker the tapping louder and now I cant shake a feeling that Im being watched

floydnimrod,21,22,1rhxtb,116,Id just come from church for some reason Im not sure why Id gone into the church but it was the weirdest service Id ever been too Everybody was there It was a packed house Rich people poor people criminals middle class folk It was all people who didnt normally go to church I looked into the coat room as I walked in and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top Right in a church I was like what the hell Ive never see thatI sat in a pew and looked up There was no minister They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ and the minister was applauding her She seemed happy But the audience was restless not really paying attention not sitting down just kind of wandering around talking to everybody And then I saw a woman I used to know someone I worked with years ago I went to sit down next to her and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me saying she was so glad to see me I wasnt sure if she was sad or drunk or terrified or just lonely but she whispered in my ear offering me sex saying shes always wanted me ever since shed known me I sort of pushed her off my lap thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pickup And then I got up and walked out There wasnt really a church service going on anyway I dont even think it was SundayAnd then for some reason I was in a car with this old lady I dont even know who it was or why I was with her She was old like my grandma Freddie but it wasnt her We were driving down the street She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost I dont think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street almost the size of Portage with several lanes But they all seemed to be deserted like very early on a Sunday morning Im not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset but the sun was low in the sky I think it was late in the day The streets were mostly clear thoughThe lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car I think she was going to ask somebody for directions I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled like the satellite was confused or just no longer there And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds It basically turned green instead of blue but only for a moment and then it was back to normal Everybody stopped and looked upI was still in the car but I leaned forward and looked out the window The sun was over in the west low in the sky And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the suns normal path It was huge And my stomach got queasy for a moment It made your stomach sick because it was so big it actually pulled on you with its own gravity like the moon pulls on the tides but much bigger and everything inside you just got tugged aroundBut it went straight across the sky without hitting When I realized how close it was though I knew it was gonna hit somewhere probably on the other side of the world The gravity of the earth pulled it in and it slingshotted around to the other side somewhere I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old ladys armCome on We have to find shelter Its gonna hit We just abandoned the car in the street and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station or hydro office or whatever it was Im not sure which it was but there were large utility trucks with lifts on them It was also deserted for some reason except for two guys loading one of the trucks We banged on the doors but it was locked up We ran from door to door trying to get in but everything was locked And then I felt a great rumble under my feet It nearly knocked me down Ive never been in an earthquake so I dont know what its like but it felt like the entire planet shivered Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside except there were no hills I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions We were able to stay on our feet though A few moments later the sky in the north went dark If I assume the sun was setting in the west and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a northwest to southeast direction then it was north the black came from And I mean the entire sky Like a wall of blackness smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere from west to east as far as you could see in one huge wall of black cloud And it was coming toward us Well sort of going towards everyone everywhere I guess It came over the horizon like an charging army fast and steady advancingIt hit on the other side of the world somewhere Come on we have to get indoors We wont be able to breatheThe air started turning yellow Ash started raining down and bits of rock and debris from the blast where ever it hit I took a deep breath and held it as I was running I could already smell a weird burning rock smell like sulphur like burnt matches but more metallic Me and the lady finally got into some doors but it was just a little foyer We ran in and shut the doors behind us The inside doors were locked But it was somewhere to hide There was a fire alarm I pulled it not really knowing why I was bothering But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight The sign said In Case of Emergency so I pulled it The alarm went off and we looked out the window The yellow air turned brown and then dark red Then everything went black The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water And all light went out of the worldThe world as we knew it was over Even if we survived life as we know it would never be the same Wed be set back  years reduced to hunter gatherers again living out of caves If we survived the impact that is I honestly dont think anybody would have survived the shockwave Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybodyOf course thats when I woke up,I just dreamed of the apocalypse I probably wont sleep for a few days

Charliesfriend,20,7,1rhapg,81,A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community so I decided to create an account to share mineWhen I was a little girl about nine years old my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas My father had just gotten out of the Army and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world and spending two of those years in active combat zones my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone He couldnt have found a better location for this purpose anyone whos ever followed Interstate  westward through that area knows there isnt much between Topeka and DenverI still remember the day we my mom dad older sister and I moved into that old ranch house It had been built in the early s and being something of a history buff I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition the depression both world wars and everything since The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road backed literally into a hill This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground buried in the hillside Outside the house was a little grassy yard area and across this yard was an old barn We didnt have any horses but my dad held a particular love for classic cars and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare timeMy sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs while my parents took the master bedroom oddly on the first floor My sister and Is rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen and the stairs led down from thereIt was only our second or third night in the house that I began to notice some strange things occurring I was unable to sleep one night and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed The house was incredibly quiet both from being in the middle of a very isolated area and by virtue of being half buried Just as I was reaching the halfsleep stateSLAM I heard a door downstairs slam shut At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it but I couldnt make myself believe that And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core I heard footsteps coming up the stairway I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes so it probably wasnt my parents coming up to check on me I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs and then begin down the landing I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door pause for a moment and then continue on When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room he paused again and again he continued He reached the far end of the landing and then turned around and came back the way he came He continued for what seemed like an eternity pacing around outside my sister and Is rooms I finally worked up some nineyearold courage and crawled to the door I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside I waited until he was moving away from me and I was between him and the stairs planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned I barely cracked open the door and looked out and sawnothing The footsteps had stopped and the whole house was empty and still I was confused and afraid but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed A minute later the footsteps started again back and forth all along the landing Eventually they lulled me to sleep I didnt mention the noises that night to anyone fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko and of being made fun of by my sister But over the next few weeks everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch Objects moved on their own Small things would disappear for days only to be returned exactly where theyd gone missing from It was what I guess youd call typical poltergeist activity nothing harmful or malevolent just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room My family eventually began referring to this entity as Charlie He seemed to be a harmless ghost and sometimes downright helpful Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen The coffee maker had no automatic timer Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something like car keys or the like wed search the house frantically only to turn around and find what wed been searching for laying on the ground behind us And sometimes Charlie would slam a door or walk around loudly or turn a sink on seemingly just to let us know he was there And always those footsteps at nightCharlie always seemed particularly active in my dads auto shop My dad would occasionally find car parts hed been working on had been tinkered with despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there Sometimes tools would go missing only to be returned a short time later Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet When we asked what was wrong he just said Charlie was walking around out thereJesus I thought you all were just hearing things I wasnt sure why Charlie loved that shop so much but incidentally that was where I caught my first sight of him It was a Saturday and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch and asked me to take it to him I eased open the barn door and saw my dad seated at his work bench his back to me And I saw another man next to the car also out of my dads field of vision He was about  with dark hair and eyes He was dressed in what looked like typical s clothing black slacks a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt and topped off by a brown paper boy hat cocked to one side He looked right at me for a second a big mischievous grin on his face and then he simply disappeared I didnt even realized I was still holding my dads sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to realitySo passed the next few months My family was happy on our little haunted ranch Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us and life was good And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting One night in late November however I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could beMy dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka almost two hours away and since my Sister was almost  by then and there was virtually no crime in our rural area my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning Of course to my sister and I it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted watch scary movies all the kid stuff you cant do with your parents around At around midnight I was in my Sisters room with her watching some movie on her TV when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room My first thought was that it was Charlie playing another prank by this felt different somehow Charlies noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home But this noise sounded violent and angry Before I could really react we heard another loud crash and another My sister cautiously peeked out of her door and down into the living room I swear I saw her go white She began trembling and her hand covered her mouth I peeked around her to see what she saw and felt y blood run cold We could just barely see two men outside our from door One of them was kicking it in As we watched a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out and they both entered our home shining long flashlights all over My sister and I crawled under her bed and held each other tight This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt But as the two men began to go through the living room another loud crash came from the kitchen One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut a favorite trick of Charlies The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted Is there anyone in here If you are you better come out now We will find you and we will FUCK you up My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud At the mans words though Charlie apparently got angry We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room I heard one of the men say Whatthe FUCK And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around All at once every door window and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently and loudly Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls across the floor even at the intruders At this point the one in charge just yelled FUCK this and turned and ran out his buddy close behindAs soon as the men were out of the door everything stopped and the house was again silent It was a long long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move She had left her cell phone downstairs and and she needed it to call the police and our parents She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone I followed As we got to the bottom I looked into the kitchen and for just a moment Charlie was standing there exactly as I saw him before with the same grin on his face A moment later he was goneThe police arrived shortly and my parents not far behind The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables and they must have been scared off by a passing car Lucky for us My sister and I didnt even try to tell them what really happened and within thirty minutes both men were caught still fleeing After that night hearing Charlies walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night When he played his little pranks I would always look for him And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smileSeveral years later when I was a junior in high school I was working on a school report at the local library The topic was the history of our town and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my familys ranch I typed our address on the search bar and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks The date of the old article was July   and at the top was a picture of a man about  with dark hair and eyes It was unmistakably Charlie The title of the article read Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child a daughter after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu On the night of July  the article said Mr Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town When he pulled up to the house he found the door had been forced open He ran inside and found a man on top of his daughter The girl was sobbing her dress had been ripped open and the attacker held a knife to her throat In a moment of sheer instinct Mr Davis threw himself at the intruder tackling him of his daughter and as he held the attacker Mr Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor who promptly called the sheriff When deputies arrived they were able to apprehend the attacker who had been beaten half to death Unfortunately he had stabbed Mr Davis three times in the chest Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor,Charlie,88,nosleep,top_week

Terzis,17,38,1r6la8,61,So a while ago about a year ago now I was sitting on my bed with the laptop on my lap Next to me was my desk with my lamp on it I was using an MSN video chat with one of my female friends After talking for a couple of hours with my friend she messaged me we both did not have microphones and asked What is that kid eating haha i simply replied What are you talking about She stated that there was a kid sitting next to me with his hands at his mouth as if to be chewing and gnawing either on his hands or something that he was holding Chills ran through my body but i soon realized that she was most likely messing with meI replied Seriously stop messing with me She seemed like a pretty good actor considering she wasnt laughing or smiling at all Im not messing with you I was just curious as to what he was eating At this moment I was getting a bit worried and decided to put her to the test I want you to swear on your life that right now you see a child next to me who looks like he is eating something I requested I swear on my life that is what I see she replied I was pretty worried at this point and just when I thought I couldnt get much more creeped out my lamp turned itself offI know it wasnt a power surge because my alarm clock was still on and the standby light on my TVThis could just be a strangely timed sequence of coincidence but it sure did freak me out I left the room immediately,Child Eating,99,nosleep,top_week

TheGraveSin,10,17,1rdci1,58,So I grew up on a farm cows chickens horses you name it I usually got stuck feeding and watering the animals while my brothers ran the tractors and threw the hay bales Dragging the waterhose to each and every animals water pan was a pain and sometimes Id catch my younger brother sneaking at the other end of the pasture watering some of the animals I hadnt gotten to yet and it would always make me smile to myself Sometime in the summer our ducks started dying off Id find them smooshed and assumed it was an incident from them trying to breed one another and split some of them up in different pens and thought nothing more of it   Then three days later I found a calf with its body oddly angled and no sure sign of what caused it to die Nothing else happened for about a month or two Then I found the horse laid out freshly dead with sweat beaded all over it as if it had been running all night it was a young and healthy horse one of my favorite and my heart shattered to pieces I was reluctant to go back the next day forcing myself to look at my sweet animals and focus on them instead but they were acting oddly the pigs in particular who were hiding in their makeshift huts and houses not even coming when I did my usual call or dumped out the food I got worried and walked in the pen getting on hands and knees to look inside their little houses as soon as I saw their snouts with a squeal one of them ran into me biting at my arm and face I toppled backward kicking it away and dashed over the top of the pen hurt feelings because they were almost always happy to see me I didnt tell anyone just let it go assuming that at losing so many of my precious pets I was wigging myself out   The next time I went out at this point it was around winter because of the cold I asked my mom to help me with the animals As we were dragging the hose to the dairy cows she stops suddenly and asks whos that I look over seeing the usual figure of my brother and just say oh its just Derek Momma She shakes her head No Dereks at Pauls A weird feeling crawled down my spine as I glanced over my shoulder at the young male figure Dropping the waterhose I stepped in his direction I could clearly see his dirtsmeared jeans and the back of his hair had the same blond curl of my brothers Derek I yelled running over to him and reaching a hand out to put on his shoulder He turned his head in my direction his bright red eyes meeting mine as my hand fell through air I passed out then My mom says that by the time she reached me the figure was gone After later discussion my brother swore on his life that he had never once been in the pasture with me ,On the Farm,75,nosleep,top_week
MissMonstrosity,25,30,1r5z11,57,Hello everyone I told this story to a friend who told me I should post it here in Nosleep Im sorry for any grammatical errors or bad commentary Im not much of a writerAbout four years ago I was a troubled thirteen year old who like most teenagers didnt get along with my parentsIt was just me and my little Brother our Mother who spent more time on the computer then being a real Mother and our Step Father who in most cases acted more like a frat boy roommate then a parental figureAnyway this all started one day when my and my Mother got into an argument only god knows what it was about since we argued all the time  back then All I remember is that I stormed off taking a backpack of clothes and some food with me and ran into the woodsWe live on a huge property in the country and the woods go on for miles and miles in every direction with only a small creek running through it to break up the never ending amount of treesAlot of people might be freaked out by the ominous looking place but I loved it I went exploring out there everyday and I knew those woods like the back of my handI ran to the south west down a large hill that had the creek I mentioned earlier at the bottom of it the creek itself went on even farther than the woods cutting through several private properties and stopped just outside of a town over fourteen miles awayI decided Id follow to town where Id find somewhere to stay the nightWhy not just take the road to town well we lived in the country there were alot of crazy people out here drunks hillbillies prostitutes and a combination of all three I figured if I took the road Id only be asking to get raped or robbedIll fast forward a little about  hours later I finally came to the edge of our propertyThe property after ours belonged to an old man we met him in church a couple times Despite several threatening No Trespassing signs  I wasnt worried If he did so happen to come all the way out here and somehow find me I could just claim to be lost  I was sure he wouldnt be this far out in the woods anyway Here the woods thinned out a little and there were several small fields tucked between the trees I came here before but never went any further then the edge of the fieldsAt this point   the sun was only an hour or so away from setting and I started walking faster to hopefully get to town before nightfall I ran through the creek that separated me from the field and slipped on something causing me to fallIt hurt like hell later I found out I had broken my toe It was bleeding badly and I had to limp the rest of the way through the creek and fieldsI came to the end of the fields several minutes later where a small path either for ATVs or a tractor led through the woodsI never went this far before but I knew if I kept going straight Id get to the town within only an hour or so so I went onAfter what felt like forever of following a twisting path that seemed to go nowhere It finally came to a small circular clearing There was a fence surrounding it with a large sign once again threatening anyone who crossed I thought it was strange we were hours from any house why bother putting up a fence blocking off where no one would ever be likely to go Then again I was going through so maybe it wasnt all that uncommon I crawled under the fence foot still hurting like hell and went on through the clearing I knew I wouldnt be caught theres no way there would be anyone out hereI walked or more less limped through the clearing on the other side there was another small field and just my luck there was a old tree stand in one of the trees surrounding it We have a large hunting community and hunters often hide out in the tree stands that were often camouflaged in the treesI thought it would make a great place to stay the night since the town was still a long ways away and it was already starting to get darkI went up to it and poked my head inside it was perfect Just enough space to lay down and sleep if need be I climbed back out and headed back to the clearing There was a large hill to one side of it I figured if I climbed up it I could see just how far away the town was Ignoring my aching foot I limped over to the hill and right in that moment something hit me on the back of the head It felt like someone angrily poking me or throwing a small  pebbleI turned around quickly expecting to find an angry farmer or hunter no one was there it was probably just an acorn or nut falling from one of the surrounding treesI laughed at myself for being stupid and rubbed at my now aching headFor whatever reason I decided to not try to force my way up the large hill and instead went to the opposite side of the round clearing I dont know why it just felt like something was pulling me thereAbout half way across the clearing I stopped dead in my tracks and gasped I literally uttered  the words Oh my God Before quickly shutting my mouth in fear someone might have heard meThere before me were several grave stones All ranging in height and design The ground in front of some of them was lower than the rest of the ground almost as if the coffins underneath had caved inI stumbled over to the graveyard and bent down to try to read the headstonesMost were unreadable Only one of them had enough words I could make out it looked like two headstones fused togetherThe one on the left read GA Keaton date unreadableThe one on the right said Harriet Keaton   at the bottom just visible was Our angels together in heavenAt this point I turned and ranI blacked out for most of the time I was running I ran through the clearing ran along the path ran across the fields until I was finally back on our property I only slowed down because it was pitch black outside and stupid me forgot to bring a flashlight It was so dark I could hardly see in front of meOnce again Ill fast forward I finally got home after my step father had found me apparently he went out looking for me not to ensure I was safe and guide me home no Only because he wanted to drag me home to make me apologize to my motherI didnt care I happily followed him homeAfter finally getting there I found my brother looking like he was crying and my mom sitting at the table eating dinner looking like she didnt have a care in the world She glanced at me made a face And left the roomOver time I ended up telling her about the graveyard she found it interesting and soon enough all my family knew about the weird graveyard in the woods It became quite a conversation topic in our family before over time being forgottenOne thing I never told anyone though And the reason I went running out of that place like a baby Was because shortly after finding that cemetery I started to hear whispering and among the trees behind the graveyard I couldve sworn I saw something moving Then right after reading what was on the one tombstone what felt like a long boney fingerStarted tapping on the back of my head,A Cemetery in the Woods,87,nosleep,top_week
iwillneverbefree,8,20,1r1p8k,51,Im just your average everyday guy with a job I cook I clean I drink hell I even had a girlfriend before all this started going down If you saw me on the street youd walk right by me without a second glance Its just that I have a job Im a ParamedicI dont do anything important I just help those in need I started doing this because I didnt feel great about myself I always loved helping others and I always loved AampP so I saw this as a logical step I loved every second of it when I first started There was no greater high than when your adrenaline kicked in and your hands moved faster than your mind could think It was ecstasy This went on for  years Every day I fell more and more in love with my job My calling The only thing that bothered me was that overwhelming sense of being in a battle I thought it was normal afterall I was fighting for someone elses life I thought If only I knew how true that statement wasIt started off with a shadow when I walked onto a scene I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me Maybe it was my constant concern of someone attacking me God forbid I got shot while working I should have known something wasnt right when my partner looked in the same direction when I did I should have known better when he just shut down and barely spoke the rest of the night This went on for a while every so often seeing the shadow Things started to get worse however when the whispering startedAt first they were nonsensical Sometimes I wondered if they were even there at all if I was just going fucking nuts But they were They WERE there It only took me losing my first patient to hear them clear as day They were congratulating me They were telling me how great of a job I did I didnt understand then My mind had been turning on me it had to have been Its the stress Its the stress of losing someone I told myself on my way home I sat at home and hit the bottle Hoping that my next shift would be an easy one one quiet shiftIt wasnt quiet I should have known better than to use that word Its bad luck The voices didnt go away They only got louder Every patient I had I could hear them Its their time Shes ours now Let her rest I thought I was just compensating for losing someone I thought I was just preparing myself if I lost another one The more people I lost the more they got more sinister Youre almost ready I havent seen one this talented in eons You cant change fate Come join us I didnt understand right then but I understood it all soonIt was a  year old male His heart stopped I had to save this one he was just a child I HAD to save him We got him to the back of the ambulance and I started my work Things felt odd I felt as if I was in a daze My vision was blurry the lights seemed faint against the road I tried not to think about the voices I tried to block them out I did a damn good job until it screamed my nameJOHN I heard I stopped and slowly raised my head to look at the bench seat across from me It wasnt what you would expect death to be It wasnt a man in a robe with a scythe It was just a man in a suit with black eyes I froze I had to have been insane I needed to tell my partner to drop my off in the psych ward when we got to the hospital His smile was calming It was the kind of smile youd expect a great car salesman to have calming but also sinister His hair was well kept for a man his age Id have to say s or s His eyes like a void of everything that makes us human as if they were a black hole that sucked all feeling out of whatever had the poor misfortune of getting caught in their pathHavent you been listening John He said with a caring toneYou know what you must do You know who youll become Why are you fightingI started screaming at him Who are you What do you want Why have you been following meHe ignored all of my questions He simply put his hand to the child and started rubbing his headYou fought for so long John You know this is your fate How much more pain can you endureWhat are you talking about I yelled at him as the childs rhythm became worse and worseDont you understand John weve been with you since day one We are who you fight every day We are the ones who you ignore to do your job We are youI began to understandJohn you must know something He said looking at the monitor as it flatlined This will also be your fate You will die just like everyone else Theres nothing you can do about itDont you think I fucking know that I yelled grabbing the epinephrine out of my bagJOHN He yelled again knocking the epinephrine out of my handYou need to understand the forces that be When you die John you will become one of usThe fuck I will I said standing up but was forced back down by some unknown forceIts not something you can change John You have so much potential so much promise Weve been watching you from the day you were born and we are very very excited to meet youI stopped fighting I looked into his eyes and I felt something

iampatheo,11,15,1rcqug,47,  This is my first Reddit post so please excuse my mistakes I live with my parents and my grandfather who is my fathers uncle actually so basically not my grandfather      I am going to jump straight into the problem here because there is something definitely weird going on in our house There have been this series of events which have occurred throughout my childhood which I have always put them at the back of my mind maybe because as a child I didnt look into it enough but I never forgot But with the most recent event I cant help but ask you guys for advice     The first event occurred when I was around  I guess I was probably getting ready for school or something and the only people in the house that morning was my mom and my grandfather Mom was helping me put my tie on  we had a school uniform  and I remember glancing towards the living room which is visible from my room I saw my grandfather walk into the living room after which he proceeded to go towards the balcony and out of my sight I got out my room and I was walking towards the kitchen to get some water Now the kitchen is right next to my grandfathers room and its on the other side of our house As I reached his room I saw him sitting there reading the paper I got a bit surprised because I clearly remembered seeing him in the living room just a few seconds ago and there is no way he could have gotten back here before me or without bumping into me I asked him about it and he said he had no clue what I was talking about So I just put it at the back of my mindThe next incident happened a year back or so It was after  pm and I was locked up in my room listening to really loud music through my earphones while doing some reading I like doing that getting a whole background score feel for the things happening in the book After a while I heard my parents banging the door and shouting at me and I figured they must have been knocking for some time When I opened the door I saw them both standing there with concerned looks on their faces I asked them what happened and they said that apparently they could hear me crying out  for help from my room in a really panicky way and they thought had probably slipped and had broken a bone or something I obviously had no clue what they were talking about and they swore that the voice they heard was mine and no one elses It freaked me out a little But even then I didnt put it together with the incident from all those years back     And now something has happened again last night and this time I am pretty freaked out I was having my dinner in my room as I was watching a movie on my laptop As I finished I got out of my room and headed for the kitchen On the way I noticed my mom dad and grandfather in the living room watching TV As I walked past my grandfathers room I saw him Sitting on a chair by the window The room was dimly lit but it was enough to see everything I did a double take I looked towards the living room and he was still there with my parents  I looked back and he was still there sitting in his chair by the window He was looking at me but for some reason I couldnt see his eyes Not because they werent there or anything but it was as if I was feeling this weird force which was trying to make me look away from there I also got this head rush which you get when you stand up too fast As soon as I recovered from that and my head cleared he was gone from his chair My parents and grandfather were still sitting there in the living room chatting amongst themselves as they watched the TV I told them what happened but they obviously did not believe me and thought I was making it upI really need to know what this is Is this a doppelganger And if so what should I do Is this thing going to be harmful It hasnt done anything harmful so far ,DOPPELGANGER Problem,62,nosleep,top_week

ohthankheaven,5,16,1rbpkl,46,I dont have an exciting life I wake up each morning at exactly AM and by AM Im starting the engine of my poorly kept up with vehicle and begin my venture to work Im late every single day by about fifteen minutes to be precise I dont care they could fire me if they wanted but Im the kind of guy who comes to the office keeps his mouth shut and gets the job done They also figure that the fifteen minutes of tardiness isnt so bad compared to the hour and fortyfive minutes of unpaid overtime they sentence me with every day I would describe my job as dull repetitive and relentlessly boring and correspondingly so is my life My house isnt particularly lavish Living alone as a male really doesnt give your residence that home feeling Im not your average lonely I lack companionship I do not have a family I do not have friends Every day is the same Its winter time and the days freeze together My alarm goes off I hit snooze Again the obnoxious ringtone I set on my phone crackles out of the tiny speaker I hit snooze After a third ring Im out of bed and on my way to work Its freezing this morning and the heat in my car does not work My weatherbeaten jacket doesnt provide that much protection either I scrape through the day counting the minutes The drive home from work offers my only source of human contact and this lies in the sports talk radio station I listen to Their snide remarks always make me laugh and I sometimes call in to dispute some of the commentary they are making It also feels good to have somebody to talk to especially when youre as solitary as I amI dont choose to be this way I am a single child and my parents died three years ago in a car accident It was a tough loss it put me in a downward spiral until I hit bottom which just so happens to be where I still reside I try to socialize and be friendly but it seems like Im lost in the masses Maybe I should be more interesting or funny or wear nicer clothes Im not good with these things I started taking comfort in the internet For me it felt safer more secure from the harshness of the real world Not that the internet isnt any less relentless the only difference is Im hiding behind a screen and a handle I do not have a Facebook I dont know if its because I dont see the point of having one or Im too scared to deal with the fact that I would lack companionship on there as well I visit my favorite sports websites browse Reddit and enjoy YouTube None of those things could ever satisfy my primal need for a physical partner in life so eventually I started using a dating website A website that I dont feel the need to name They are all the same anyway It was slow at first Slower than it took me to fill out my profile and eventually take a picture anyway I didnt know what to write about myself and even convincing myself to finally publicize my life in an attempt to get anyone to talk to was an effort in itself  Months went by and I received no glimmer of hope Suddenly a chat prompt appeared on my laptopHello she saidHer name is Julie and she is beautiful I dont know what she saw in me but for the first time it is real it is there We spoke for years Endless chat logs phone calls video chats We shared tears laughs and something I never felt before love Two days ago I asked Julie to meet me for the first time and she said yes I was nervous at first but extremely happy I asked her if she wanted to have dinner but she said she would rather just come to my house instead Yesterday she came over she really is a special girl We hit it off so well that she decided to spend the night She really is excited to have me now I can hear her calling for me now I have never felt so happy and so confident There is one thing that is for certain she will never leave me Even if we fight even if we argue she still wont leave me We are going to have a great time together and we are going to play Even if it turns out she doesnt like the games we play she still wont leave me There is that chance though that small chance that things wont work out That chance that the love will fade and that abominable lonliness will come back It scared me at first because I cant go back to being alone again I wont go back I dont worry anymore though because Julie loves me and the games we play Julie loves to be with me and Julie isnt strong enough to bend the bars of her basement cell To be continued,Julie,62,nosleep,top_week
DickBanditDoneLanded,11,65,1r1zac,42,As a kid I grew up singing songs of joy with my friends Fun songs that made me feel like a child There was one song that I never really liked for reasons unbeknownst to me but that one song would become a living hell during my adult lifeMy wife packed my sons lunchbox with a pizza lunchables It was always his favorite one I had the privilege of walking him to school that cold October morning holding his hand the whole walk We talked about toys games and then the topic of songs came upHey dadhow come you never showed me the song about Josh Jacob Jinglehyper Smith he asked Haha you mean John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt I never liked that song kiddo I replied I thought his name was Josh like mine He added We got to the school about half an hour earlier than the entry time so I suggested we go to the playground located around back Josh agreed and followed me The air felt relatively dense that day I could barely see fifty feet away and asked Josh to stay in sight and have a little fun before school starts I look away at the birds in the trees and Im startled by the piercing cry of my son nowhere in sight I call his name and he says Sorry dad I fell off the monkey bars Ill be fine I sighed and laughed a little knowing my kid was such a warrior I notice Josh riding a swing and laughing with another little boy who also came to school too early I see his father standing on the side laughing and I worry about not being a good enough dad to Josh I start to walk toward the boys and thats when it hits me I wasnt watching Josh play none of the two boys was mine I tried to keep calm but felt the need to yell out his name to locate him I look around the playground and the school bell rings announcing the schools opening The dense foggy air dissipates and Im able to see everything clearly I find a note in the second floor of the jungle gym it reads I know how hard you tried to avoid me I wouldnt want the same thing happening with JoshMy heart sank and my eyes widened as the note dropped on the mulch and made a thud I felt every possible emotion at that one point in time I didnt know what to do where to go who to ask for help so I walked into the school where I come across a corkboard with pictures of kids on it All of these children were abducted by a strange man who walked into the forest beside the school I knew what I had to do I ran into the woods clenching the note he had written John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt I hear a high pitched voice scream from the bushes as I fall to the ground in fear I noticed a building on a hill about a mile into the wild It was a greenish wooden house much like the ones mystery inc would investigate but this was not a game this was my sons life and possibly that of many other children The smell of rotting was emitting throughout the air and I feared the worst for the status of the kids Not willing to be detected I snuck in through a window that was left open and creeped about the dark house with nothing but my signalless cellphone and my dedication I was in the basement floor and couldnt see anything so I turned on my flashlight app I had no idea I was about to come across one of the most horrible sights anyone couldve seen There were mutilated corpses not just any corpses but children kids who I had met through class pictures my wife bought and showed me The kids were decapitated burned sliced naked I was scared for my life I almost threw up one too many times but swallowed it back along with my will to flee I found a wooden staircase that was old and rotting The first step I took on it made a loud creak and there was a groan in the distance I hid behind a giant flowerpot as a huge figure approached the area I was in I could barely breathe as I noticed this man had blood between his fingernails as if he mutilated the children with nothing but his fingers He returned to the room and I followed him from afar The smell I picked up earlier was much stronger than before and I heard muffled cries coming from the room the man walked into Say it with me now kidsJohn Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt His name is my name too Whenever we go out The people always shout There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schm A kid bit a hole through the duct tape on his mouth and was able to scream while he sang I heard the kids name It was GaryThe children were all able to remove their mouth bindings and cried in unison for about ten seconds Then I hear a loud laugh followed by a SHUT THE FUCK UP At this point I was enraged Nobody has the right to scream at kids like that nobody I barged in grabbing this freak by his backlength hair and slamming his face into a table with limbs on it What did you just say to those kids you motherfucker I yelled oblivious to the children in the room Youre gonna pay for all your shit you son of a bitch I said Well thats just too damn bad He added I didnt know today was the day Id be found Its such a shame youve missed your playdate with your sonhe was SUCH a nice boy He said laughing his head off at the sight of my expression I was cold I was numb My son was dead I unleashed my fury on the man not holding back at all I knocked him unconscious and tied him down to a giant piece of metal I broke both his legs and made sure hed never walk again then I released the children many starving and ready to go home I tugged the slab down the hill and walked alongside the children toward the school The police had previously raided the woods but never came across the house in the entire year he had been performing the kidnappings I called the school and notified the authorities of the serial killer I had slayed and I wanted to make sure he was arrested and would suffer his whole life for what he did to my wife and I She was hysterical unable to perform for almost a whole year We cancelled any holidays and vacations and mourned a year away We finally concluded that our son was happy in a better place with the rest of his friends Although my wife and I never had any other children I became teacher at an elementary school in another state and was happy knowing I had kids who were fun to be around and nice to me One Monday morning we have a new girl come in and I ask her to introduce herself Shes laughing and shes shy and she wants to whisper something in my ear Ill introduce myself if we can just play today She says I promise her along with the class that well have a free day and she introduces herself and makes friends I start to like this girl because I never had a chance to have a daughter and always wanted one She was very sociable and was the class clownShe stopped coming to school for a week and out of curiosity I called her parents to ask about her sudden disappearance Her mother was crying and I couldnt understand her so her father came to the phone I told him about how the class missed her and he told me about a note that was left at their door one afternoon It read Go through her drawings I asked the dad to give me a minute while I did just that HE was in the pictures Every drawing she made had him hiding in the background There was a folded piece of paper that was thicker than the rest Little did I know it wasnt school paper it was skin Pressed and cut to replicate a note I thought by now youd figure out I was never human I got on the phone to tell the girls father the news but all I heard was a demonic maniacal laughter I felt a hole in my chest as the phone line went dead followed by three beeps and elongated static,His name is my name

Brodiche,28,13,1ra24j,41,The Eighth CrusadeOn the outskirts of the large city known as Canto a small cathedral stands unscathed by the horror happening not twenty miles away There were some smaller towns outside of the city but most of their residents fled as soon as the vague news reports of cannibalistic citizens came flooding in In the end those who were smart enough to run at the first sign of trouble were the only ones who made it the hesitant died along with the rest of the city However this small cathedral was different It was located in the middle of nowhere and had been long abandoned and forgotten by everyone aside from the city itself the closest town to it was almost an hour way and a small dirt road was the only thing that even hinted that there was another world past the miles and miles of flat plains The glow and black smoke from Canto can be seen in the distance  Short flashes of lightning filled the air just long enough to illuminate a figure on top of the cathedral his legs swung over the edge of the roof and head leaning against the lighting rod The faint glow of a cigar intensified as he put it to his mouth With a small grin played on his lips he gazed dreamily at the cityWhat a sight Obliteration has never looked so divine He whispered to himself Images of a crumbling Jerusalem played through his head Well I guess you cant get much more divine than thatFeeling a little foolish for talking to himself again he took one last drag of his cigar and flicked it behind him The man noticed that there was a thin layer of ash that had settled on to his body Slightly irritated by this the man glanced at his watch while getting to his feet ruffling his short black hair in an attempt to get as much ash off his head as possible His long black coat blew in the wind as he brushed it off The temperature was dropping fast it wouldnt be long until the rain began to pour The man wondered if it would be enough to quench the flames of the city The Vatican ordered complete destruction they wanted nothing standing of what they thought to be a heathen city The man wouldnt feel accomplished if the flames were so easily disposed of Glancing at his watch again figuring he had roughly another half hour before the he was picked up and debriefed He leaned back against the lightning rod and lit another cigar daydreaming of the day beforeOne bite one citizen and his work was done His mission was to just get the ball rolling nothing more Being as potent as he was his victims often became immensely strong They were puppets sure but also unstable The more of them that were roaming the streets the more dangerous the mop up was for the church The man was frustrated that he only got one snack he was tired of the left overs from corpses and the donations from Italian blood banks He was craving prey with more life to it one he could enjoy stalking before the killThe Vatican dispatched him and a helicopter to the abandoned cathedral Along with being the drop point the house of God was also were he was supposed to rendezvous with the evac crew His orders were to simply enter the city light the spark and watch God cleanse the Earth from the cathedral You zealots are no fun he would tell them Im doing Gods work for you lazy ass holes the least you could do is let me off the leashThe hungry man could not help but feel disappointed when they were offended They preached how the last crusade was such a failure due to the fact he had so much freedom the mobs of the powerful undead nearly completely consumed the Holy armyIt pissed him off that they never got over thatHe resolved that it was never really his fault humans were frail weak creatures They are easy to corrupt in every way None of them could handle the thirst and they tore everything apart Turning their victims into for lack of a better word zombies The Pope himself preformed the unnecessary but ritualistic blessing before he set offVai quarto Locke e fornire i nostri nemici a DioDeliver them I shall He sarcastically whispered to himself with a smirk The helicopter was taking off it was time to go to workLocke could not stop thinking about his one victim regardless of whom it was he planned to savor every last second of his feastThe man found himself seeking a challenge In the back of his mind he knew he wouldnt get one but the fantasy of a dangerous prey kept his thoughts occupied as he made his way towards the glistening city With the pace he was traveling at it wouldnt be long before reached the edge of Canto his long strides covered more distance faster than a highend sports car going ninety on an open freeway The cool night air was refreshing to him its not often he is allowed to roam out in the open like this He slowed down a bit to prolong this finite feeling of freedomBeing cooped up under Vatican City for so long had begun to take its toll on Lockes sanity Other than living off nothing but the scraps of Roma he had no real connection to the outside world Its not like he longed to live amongst the humans no the thought of that made him sick The only reason he could stand the Men of God back at the Vatican was because they were as far away from human as possible Hes seen them put on human masks sure seen them absolve the masses with a crooked smile seen them preach peace and the word of God to a thousand ignorant faces No no behind their masks they are every bit a monster as LockeThe city was drawing closer massive sky scrapers were lit up in a brilliant fashion A sense of intrigue radiated from surrounding smaller clusters of lights What were the humans doing at this hour Were they working overtime tucking the children in late night binge drinking at the local bar They were all so very ignorant of the malevolent fury of God that was about to rain down upon them Sure it looked pretty from a distance but Canto was the antithesis when viewed up close The Vatican made it clear to Locke that this was not a city that deserves pity even though he never considered giving it anyways he asked to be briefed on the citys situationCanto was dying almost all whove entered abandoned all hope for it when they saw what a hell hole it has become Corruption plagued the citys central government all of the representatives power focused on how to make the wealthy more capable of shitting on the poor As a result crime was abundant Drug trafficking prostitution child labor plagued the down town streets Whole families were often caught in cases of indentured servitude as the wealthy put it where even the children would have to be at the beckon call of the privileged doing strenuous and dangerous work that led to more than a few deceased children Anyone who cried foul ended up dead too it was just the way it went And it was reason enough to cleanse itLocke reached the edge of Canto he could now hear the grumbling sounds of the suffering city a siren blared unceasingly somewhere among the throngs of buildings Looking at his watch the man whispered to himselfTime to light the matchUpon entering the city Locke found to his disappointment that there was no shortage of easy prey The homeless aimlessly wandered the streets practically half dead already prostitutes looking vulnerable as ever He was slightly surprised however to find a couple of security guards having a smoke outside of a large ominously lit building A young woman dressed in rags stumbled past them she was appeared very exhausted and in need of medical care The guards just looked upon her and laughed asking the woman unrepeatable questions When she didnt respond to their cat calls one of the men grew frustrated and ran after her She let out a quick yelp of pain as he put his cigarette out on the back of her neckIn a very swift motion the girl whirled around grabbing the guards wrist and pulling him close The mans face was within an inch of hers his expression showed that of pure pain She had broken his wrist In a split second she revealed a small revolver put it to the mans chin and pulled the triggerThere was a bright flash then a spray of crimson red The mans body crumpled to the newly painted sidewalk with a softball sized hole where his skull used to be The woman was already on the other guard before he was done unhooking the strap to his sidearm Landing knees first on the guards chest she pinned him to the ground Grabbing a firm hold of her preys head with both hands she lifted up his skull and brought it back down to the concrete Over and over again she did this until the guard was pulverized into the sidewalkIt was all over that quickly She stood up without a sound her face expressionless except for a small smirk that crept on the edge of her lips she bent over to pick up her revolver that lie next to body of the first guard She shot Locke a quick glance and disappeared around the corner While the look she gave him was quick it was more than enough to excite him She had piercing brown eyes that screamed strength and short dirty black hair that was almost just long enough to veil her left eye Locke knew her just by that single short glance He knew her struggles knew her strength and knew her will to surviveHe knew he had found his preyThe building the two guards were once protecting let out the piercing wale of an emergency siren snapping Locke out of his mystified state It was then he noticed the streets were completely empty not a piece of human filth to be seen Whoever the guards were protecting called for backup and he had mere minutes to escape A thought crossed his mind and made him almost consider revealing himself to the approaching authorities before pounding them into dust Not wanting to risk compromising the mission Locke reluctantly retreated into a dark alley way He scaled his way to the roof tops from there and began the hunt for his new found prey The mystery womans scent was still live and growing stronger as he strides across the apartment building rooftops Lockes mind wandered back to the two guards how efficiently and violently she dispatched them Two full grown armed men could not handle the slender girl half their size Where can a human learn to kill like that Without mercy or emotion just pure unadulterated instinct After searching for a short time he came across her entering a dimly lit liquor store only to return moments later with a bag clenched in her fist The hunger was starting to get to him it was a ravenous gnawing that made his whole body tremble with anticipation He knelt down on one knee and gazed down at her from the roof tops Across the street from where Locke sat perched he saw her lean against a brick wall and begin chugging whatever was in the paper bag Locke felt his heart sink he had to stop her quickly or that alcohol will kill all the fun What was the fun in feeding from intoxicated prey He let out a small sigh and leapt off the building and descended to the street below The woman let out a small yelp as Locke landed safely in front of her A small cloud of dust and filth from the city escaped from under his feet leaving a small clear circle around where he landedFor a moment she just stared at him as he rose to his feet Only a dim street light illuminated the empty street the only thing she could make of the man was a pair of piercing red eyes that glowed like the moonThere is something magnificent about the moment you make yourself known to your prey spoke the man His voice had a crisp raspy tone to it full of anticipation and a hint of sensualityThe womans eyes widened at this not out of fear however it was more like she just received a jolt of electricity the grip on her bottle tightened She put on a smirk and spoke with an authoritative tone  Listen Ive had a long day I already have had to deal with two assholes today she lifted her hands almost defensively to reveal that they were caked with dried blood I caved both their heads in before they learned their place maybe I should take my time with you so I can really make a statement around hereThe man cocked his head a bit to the side at this threat amused and intrigued by her intensity He opened his arms wide as if to bow and took a step forward The woman reacted quickly and swung the bag at Lockes head The sharp crash of the class mixed with the sound of cracking bone traveled all the way down the street The woman expected the perfect stranger to be on the ground bleeding begging for his life like she has seen so many other men do However the man was still standing Aside from a small shard of glass that was lodged in the left side of his face he was completely unfazed by the vicious attack Locke licked his lips as the remaining alcohol from the bottle trickled down his faceHmm Im not much of a whisky man I prefer a more  he paused for a moment as he watched the panic in his prey begin to rise  exotic spirit He began to chuckle to himself in all reality the whole situation was darkly humorous to him This is the most pain hes been in in years and that is saying something His chuckle escalated to a howling laughterThe woman wore a look that held a combination of shock and excitement Even though she was beginning to panic a smile spread across her face Not once in her entire time in Canto has she met a man who could last more than  minutes in fight with her much less one who could so easily brush off a whisky bottle to the headShe watched as the mans laughter grew his bloodshot eyes screamed madnessIts time to put you down you crazy sonofabitch she said with a smile She slowly removed the revolver she used to kill the security guard the aged blood glistened in what little light was available The sight of the gun just seemed to incite a stronger laughing fit out of Locke The woman extended her arm and placed the barrel of the gun into the mans open mouth and pulled the triggerAgain there was a quick flash His head snapped back with full force but he remained on his feet never ceasing his laughter that grew into the howling of a demon He lowered his head fixing his blood red eyes on the womanHe was able to stop his laughter long enough to respond to the horrified look on his preys face Whats the matter baby doll You seemed surprised you cant dispatch me as easily as those two security guards Locke began to laugh again Honey they are nothing compared to a true monster     Locke took one last look at his victim then opened his jaws to reveal several sharp teeth The hole left by the bullet can be clearly seen as he made the final move on his prey                           The man wiped his mouth and looked down at his meal The womans eyes were glossed with fear but there was an eerie smile that still crept on her lips as she stared blankly into the night sky Locke allowed the womans essence to dissolve and flow throughout his body Fresh blood from a living victim holds a piece of that persons life and personality Anyone who takes that essence inherits a part of that persons life All their thoughts feelings information becomes a part of the predators body and soul Veronica He whisperedThe womans body began to violently shake She was beginning to reanimate Locke felt a slight pang of worry in the back of his mind A human of her caliber would be a serious threat as a vampire everything about her will be augmented and enhanced Locke looked back at the shaking body Give those zealots hell for me VeronicaTurning around he began to make his way to the edge of the city the sun was going to be rising soon it was in his best interest to get back to the Cathedral as fast as he can He had lit the match Canto will be devoured by flames by tomorrow night Locke finally said with a smile                                The enveloping darkness cascaded across the night sky Leaving the silhouettes of clouds drift overhead like veils of moving sentinels suffocating the very light out of the stars The scent of moisture and smoke hung thick in the air The sound of distant thunder boomed across the sky echoing into the midnight horizon A light from below slightly illuminated the world trails of thick black smoke were dressed in the light painted on by miles of inferno It was as if the gates of hell opened under the earth releasing and delivering throngs of angels utmost nightmares unto Gods domain The pounding hearts of a million terrified saints could be heard as the sky boomed again Below the heavens true evil incarnate devoured the world Sky scrapers wore flames from head to toe fire danced on the water under decimated bridges streets were in chaos destroyed vehicles littered the crowed avenues Exposed hands and limbs peek out from under of overturned cars burning corpses are contorted in horrible positions behind the wheel of their tombs Police stations show no sign of life a constant siren blares somewhere in the city with nothing living left to answer The city its souls

REALreptus,7,22,1r8gsb,37,I was about  living in CA at the time and like any other  year old kid I was best friends with the boy that lived down the street We often spent the night at each others houses but when we spent the night over at his house I would always try to get him to agree for us to sleep out in his huge treehouse we would stay up till dawn eating candy chips and playing playstation until our eyeballs hurt I always asked him if we could sleep outside because the first and only time we ever slept in his house I saw this ghost The ghost himself was a tall man wearing a black coat with a big black hat that sort of looked that that cool hat that Hugh Jackman wears in Van Helsing and he didnt have a solid or not solid form I know that sounds weird but it was like he was there but wasnt at the same time I guess the best way I could describe it would be like really thick black static in the shape of a really tall dude wearing a cloak and hat Well my best friends little sister would always talk about this guy in the hat I think the exact way that she referred to him was The guy in the hat but we were to busy doing our own thing to ever listen to her to us she was just my friends annoying little sister that wanted to follow us around and do what we were doing Well that night while we were playing video games I glanced down his hallway and at the very end of it there was the man in the hat but I had only glanced and when I did a double take he was gone so I just ignored it That sort of glance and disappear thing happened like  more times before we went to bed Now what happened next is what made me never want to spend the night in his house again We fell asleep just fine no nightmares no spooky visions before closing our eyes but around am no not exactly am I was young and scared and didnt look at the time so Im just guessing it was around am every single radio in his house turned on at the same time and at full volume and it wasnt music or even just static that played it was this really deep and low pitch rumble that came out at full blast It didnt say anything I dont even know if it was a voice or anything all I remember is that it scared the living shit out of me His mom got up and shut off all the radios and yelled at us cause she thought we did it as a joke or something and wouldnt listen to us when we said were where both sleeping when it happend My family moved away about  months or so after this and I havent heard from my friend since I dont know anything about the house or the land or if there was a murder there or whatever its just something that happened to me as a kid and something Ill never forget,I was about  when this happend at a friends house,59,nosleep,top_week
childrenofsamhain,9,6,1rhdoj,34,My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child Until recently he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters Sarah and Emily Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three Within the first two years living in the house Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary It wasnt until his daughter Sarah was around two years old that he started to notice she talked to herself Jamie thought nothing of it she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway whispering and giggling Curious he asked Sweetie who are you talking to Sarah replied The woman standing in the hallwayIs she your imaginary friendI guess Amused he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall whispering quietly Whats your friends name he asked her Her name is Helen Mary she said And what are you two whispering about Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped Im not supposed to tell you Suddenly the front door opened downstairs and they heard Claire come through the door Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her Jaime didnt think about that again for a few weeks Over time the two noticed that Sarahs interactions with Helen Mary became more frequent but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily Jaime was at home alone with Sarah He heard her playing upstairs chatting away with her imaginary friend when suddenly he heard glass breaking He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway holding a hammer She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces There was glass everywhere Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits When he returned to the living room he asked her directly Sweetie why would you smash all of our family pictures She looked at him Helen Mary told me to do itWhen Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends Jaime told her about the incident The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes She gasped silently at the sight When they returned downstairs to the kitchen they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior Suddenly the color ran out of Claires face and she looked at Jaime Theres no way she could have done that aloneWhatThere is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herselfJaime was confused I told you I caught her with the hammer She told me that she did itBut it wasnt until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him But some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground How could she have reached thoseHis mind was racing She must have moved a chair or somethingShe was adamant There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it and you would have seen her carry one upstairs rightJaime was silent He didnt have an answer They went to bed that night without any answers The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking Though he didnt have much time to think about it as two weeks later his second little girl was bornEmily was two years old in the summer of  and one afternoon when Claire was at home alone with the girls she heard Emily alone upstairs whispering She called up to her Who you talking to kiddoThe woman standing in the hallwayClaire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister Then she spoke againShe doesnt like you MommyWhy doesnt she like me Claire responded surprised I dont know Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent Until one night last monthJaime had put the kids to sleep around eight oclock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after Exhausted Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him He turned to see what was wrong and saw it His  year old daughter Emily standing beside the bed with a hammer in her hand Blood poured from Claires forehead Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand He turned to his wife She had stopped screaming now and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face She was going to be alright but she did have a deep cut to her forehead Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room He went and checked on Sarah who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed He told her that everything was alright and closed her door He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway and he finally asked her Emily why would you hurt MommyShe told me to DaddyWho told you to The woman standing right behind you She told me to hurt Mommy And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered And she told me to hurt you too DaddyThey moved last week ,The Woman Standing in the Hallway,40,nosleep,top_week
blkmagick,8,6,1r8old,32,My father was in the military which meant that we moved around a lot as I was growing up One of the places we moved to was Pensacola FL We moved there right before th grade started for me and we lived in military housing so we got to live in a two story house for the very first time I was excited I got my own room and my own bathroom right across the hallway Things were great until after a year of living in the house when things started to get strange I was home alone talking to my boyfriend on the phone when I heard a large crash in the kitchen I slowly walk in to see what happened and one of the cabinet doors were wide open and bowls were all over the floor I quickly pick up the bowls and put them away freaking out I was in there just five minutes earlier and everything was closed there was no way for the cabinet to open on its own I ran up to my room and locked my door until my family came home When they returned they asked why bowls were all over the floor in the kitchen A week after that incident I woke up suddenly out of a deep sleep gasping for breath I looked at my doorway and I see a girl standing there She was wearing an old white nightgown stained with blood and she had long black hair Her throat was slit and hastily stitched up along with her lips being stitched together Her eyes were gouged and missing and her hands were chopped off Thinking it was just my imagination I closed my eyes and reopened them only to see she had moved closer With each blink the closer she would get so I threw the covers over my head and prayed that she didnt touch me I ended up falling asleep and awoke in the morning with her nowhere to be found Over the next year she would appear every other week just watching me I got used to it eventually because I thought it was just a chronic bad dream and she didnt do anything to hurt me It wasnt until after we moved to back to Michigan did I get really scared My sister and I were talking and sharing stories about our house in Florida and she told me something troubling She mentioned that if she had to use the restroom in the middle of the night she would always use my parents bathroom in their room instead of the one across my bedroom I asked her why and her response wasBecause I would always see a girl in white standing outside of your door and it scared meKnowing that I wasnt the only one that saw her terrified me because I knew it wasnt just a dream I still wonder if she appears for the new family thats in the house and who she is and what happened to her I have to say though Im just glad to be out of that house,The Girl in White,38,nosleep,top_week

WILLingtonegotiate,11,5,1rdxhm,29,Well to start things off I have a hard time convincing myself that any of this is supernatural Just extremely weird somewhat scary It may be due to the fact I worry about my families safety more than anything Well I will start from the beginningWe moved into our new home around the end of August We resettled here in San Antonio due to my wifes employer requiring her to live here  I say new home because it is just that a NEW home The neighborhood is new as well All the homes are brand new the oldest being around a year old We love the area Awesome neighbors rural setting though stores still within walking distance We know absolutely nobody in this town so we have pretty much stuck to ourselves in the short time here so far We live in a  bedroom house with our three childrens rooms upstairs and my wife and myself sleeping in the master bedroom downstairs Our room is literally  feet from the front door I say this because my story revolves quite a lot around that very front door  Around our third night in the new home is when it started DINGDONGGGGGG The second part of the doorbell sound was separated by about  seconds I dont know why I find that eerie   DINGDONGGGGGG DINGDONG DINGDONG DINGDONGThese three were quite rapid taps on the doorbellI must have woke on the first ring but did not quite have my mind working yet much less my body I open my eyes and hear the long drawn out sound of the doorbell being pressed firmly Then three rapid taps My room is completely dark only lit by the blue lights of the alarm clock This same clock showed me at this moment it was  am Wtf I thought I immediately started fidgeting in my drawer for my handgun its a Glock  with an extremely bright light attached just under the barrel It would be quite handy in a few minutes  I grab a magazine slide it in and chamber a round With a flick of the switch the super bright beam illuminates my room and my clear path to the front doorAs I sleepily stumble my way to the front door I hear another rapid ring of the doorbell followed by a deep loud booming knock  I check through the peephole and can make out the top of a mans head as if he were leaning on the door listening for any type of movement coming from within my house I place my weapon on the door around where I figure this persons head to be and I speakWho is it I shoutedMy question was greeted by only what I can describe as the loudest silence I had ever felt wash over meAgain I shout Who is itAnd I hear him for the first timeIts me Daniel replied the dry calm yet exhausted voice of the man outside my door I do not know a Daniel I replied sternly What do you want I askedIve been left here I do not know where I am and I just need a place to sleep Replied the oddly calm voice just inches away from the barrel of my gunYou have  seconds to leave my property or I will shoot you where you stand I said this with a very loud and booming command In retrospect this seems harsh and I am not proud of it It was after am and I was worried for the safety of my family I mean no good person would do this type of thing to a stranger rightI start to count  just then I look out the peephole and no one is there  the  was noticeably quieter than the previous two in the countdown I have a bathroom just off the foyer and its window has a clear view of the front door  I peer out of it no one there I think to myself okay he got the point Oh shit what if he didnt and this asshole is now taking revenge on my wifes car or worse my baby truck I decided I would need to go outside against my inner monologue telling my white ass to stay insideI enter my room to grab my shoes and got a shock as my wife broke the silenceYou are not going outside after that She exclaimed She must have heard the entire thingDo you want this asshole screwing with our cars I askedI could care less you are NOT going out there She again rattled offBaby go back to sleep I will be fine I assured herI get my shoes on go to the front door and that is when I saw something so  simple yet extremely terrifying The door had been unlocked this whole time I do not know why but this had a huge effect on my nerves at the moment that it was noticed I check the bathroom window once again a quickly snap open the front door while sweeping every bit of the front porch with the barrel of my weapon the beam from its attached light painting my yard as if it were the broadest brush in the pale Nothing I step outside and onto the wet grass I check the side yard closest to my door and then start towards the driveway The vehicles looked fine as I could see them clearly due to the very bright street lamp illuminating my driveway No sign of Daniel I start to check the other side of my home when I hear it Thinking of it right now sends chills all the way down my body Im right here Replied Daniel in a scratchy but clear whisperThis was so chilling at the time that I could not bring myself to turn around right away It felt as if he were inches from me Right behind me staring I feel a little embarrassed to say it took quite a lot of courage to turn around but when I did I was surprised Daniel had not been directly behind me but about twenty feet away sitting on the curb beside my driveway facing away from me His silhouette small and twig like There was a lot of light coming from the street light across the street yet he seemed strangely dark As if he were able to escape the lights grasp ever so slightly I remedied this with the light beaming from beneath my pistol When I illuminated him it was not what I was expecting Maybe my being terrified at the moment had me thinking irrationally I was expecting an old bearded ghost of a man waiting for me to peer into his cold dead eyes only to grasp my soul and rip it out through my throat I know too many movies right This was a noticeably unkempt young man but not dirty more of a grungy type of look going on He was wearing a vertically striped orange and green striped tight fitting sweater he was african american and seemed to be in his early twenties He sat there seemingly in no hurry to turn around and greet me legs stretched out into the street hands placed palm down stretched out behind him fingers noticeable grasping at the blades of grass between them What do you need I rattle off with an understandably shaky voiceOnly what I asked for He replied again way too calm for the situation I suggest you get up and move on before I call the police I say I crinfe now thinking of how I reacted to this young man That will be fine would you do that for me would you call them for me He spat back as he peered slowly over his right shoulder at me his eyes closed tight seemingly due to my extremely bright light beaming into the back of his headSure do you fucking realize how close you were to being shot man I askWhy on earth would you shoot me I could have walked into your home without ever knocking right He said this the way a mother would say it to her child when revealing she knew a secret the child thought nobody knewAlright move the FUCK on dude NOW I shouted but noticeably terrified nowHe rose to his feet seemingly in one movement Turned to me his hand stretched out as to block the beam of light so he could open his eyes and look at me He opened his eyes which were noticeably bloodshot and just looked at me staring as if he were asking me to lower the light which I did As I did this he showed me his hands first palm then the back of his hands like a magician would when assuring his audience he had nothing up his sleeves He brought his hands to his face and covered it while rubbing it quickly as someone would while washing their face He slowly lowers his hands to his side and then looks straight up into the sky and then slowly down towards me He smiled and said in a hushed but very deep voice Call them motherfuckerI raise my weapon back up and start to back into my driveway towards my door every few steps I make towards my door he makes one towards meCall them motherfucker He screams As if he knew what the outcome of the call would beTake one more fucking step and it will be your fucking last I shout my finger fighting the urge to squeeze of a round into his torsoHe stops in his tracks cocks his head at an angle and presents a very dramatic frown Followed by a snarl His face seemed to twist and contort while staring at me with the most anger I had seen on a human face everI get into my home grab my phone a run upstairs to a window to get a view of this motherfucker while I call the police My wife was already up there she must have been watching the whole thing I quickly dial  while ushering my way to the window As I peer down at him he slowly looks up at us still snarlingCall them motherfucker His scream muffled a bit by our walls but still noticeably louder than beforeI get the operator on the phone never breaking eye contact with DanielI explain everything to the operator as they assure me she has officers on the wayShe calmly starts to ask for more details What is he wearing physical description what has been said did he physically attack me was he still there did he have any weapons do I have any weapon The questions seemed to go on and on She then saysSir you should be able to see the lights from the unit arriving can you see it She askedYes I exclaimShe then asked for me to stay inside until the officers knock at my door I immediately head down stairs and there is the knockPohleece A male voice shoutedI opened the door and was greeted by an officer The cop was about mid s portly and visibly sweaty You called in a disturbance He askedYeah did you grab him I repliedHell no is he still here He snarked Well he was ten seconds ago I saidWe both walk out into the yard where we had stood No sign of Daniel I explained everything to the officer as I have just done to all of you He seemed to believe it all and was also a bit shaken Damn thats some crazy shit He said with a look of astonishmentYoure telling me I replied He retreats to his car for a few moments and comes back He explains that a family had just reported their  year old son missing Their son was african american tall and most importantly his name was Daniel He explained further that Daniel was a diabetic and they worried he may be going into some sort of diabetic fit Everything started to fit perfectly There was a reason he was so irate and up and down This wasnt a maniac it was a young man that was simply ill My emotion went from scared for my family to scared for this young man As we are standing there in my yard the cop and I We hear itCRACK CRACK CRACK CRACK CRACKFive very noticeable gunshots rang out Followed by my neighbor a  something asian widow running from her house handgun swinging wildly back at her home She was screaming quite literally bloody murderAs I stand there paralyzed with shock the officer quickly draws his weapon and starts shouting commandsPut the weapon down now He screams thunderouslyI killed him She shouted while simultaneously throwing the handgun to the ground recklesslyThe officer orders her to the ground approaches her slowly and quickly handcuffs her He starts to search her stands her up walks her to his car and retrieves the thrown weapon All while I am standing there in horrorHe shouts for me to go into my home and stay in there  It turns out Daniel saw the lights about the same time I did He must have quickly ran to my neighbors and ran through an unlocked door My neighbor found him standing in her living room naked and apparently slamming her cats head into the wall She said he had the cat by the tail and was swinging it violently into the wall blood splattering everywhere She retrieved her handgun and shot him  times running out her door immediately afterI was told he was dead before he even hit the floor She hit him with three bullets One through the neck one through the thigh and one the fatal one through his temple I met the young mans family who actually was pretty hostile towards me They wanted quite surprisingly to sue my neighbor for wrongful death or some shit I cannot judge

mitchbresh,4,11,1rfvu4,24,So lets just get right into this I work at a Futureshop and I have for quite a while now One of my coworkers Will used to work in LA moving his way up the ranks as a screenwriter but moved to my city for his marriage We both started talking one day about how we love to write and started tossing ideas back and forth We both have a knack for the horror genre and decided that we would work together on writing a horror screenplay This was about a month ago and as of yet we havent been able to sit down and work on anything together On saturday we were both working and took our lunch break at the same time We started talking about when we could get together to work on the screenplay and thats when the story came up Will knows how much I love anything creepy and how invested I am in the paranormal so he shared something another one of our coworkers Chelsea had told him After he told me her story I had to meet with her She worked on Sunday and I asked Will to talk to her to see if she would be okay with discussing it with me Yesterday I received a text from Will saying that Chelsea would really love to talk to me about the situation One thing I should mention is that i have a family history of being involved with the paranormal I have had many of my own experiences along with helping out friends of friends with questions they have about the topic So yesterday I went in to talk to her about what had happened and this is what she shared with meShe has a son who is about twoyears old named Lucas A week ago Lucas woke up in the middle of the night screaming at the top of his lungs Chelsea ran to his room and tried to calm him down but nothing seemed to work She decided to take him into her room to sleep with her but when she did this he freaked out even more She said that Lucas was fixated on one corner of the room and kept staring at the corner repeating No no no over and over This obviously creeped her out so she took him out of the room and he seemed to calm down A couple nights ago the same thing happened but this time he pulled the sheet over his head as though to hide from something that was standing in the corner The second night he freaked out she had to take him on a car ride around the block just to calm him downShe said that her room has always felt off to her and that she often gets the feeling that there is a presence in the room with her I asked if she owned any pets and she told me that she has a dog Chelsea then proceeded to tell me that the dog has acted strange in the room before as well I asked her if there was anything else important I should know and she shared that her older son had said he saw a ghost in her room the other day Im not sure its linked though because he happened to see the ghost after the first incident with LucasAfter I had asked her all of my questions I told her to start paying attention to certain details and to note them as they happen I gave her my number and told her that if anything happens or if she has any questions she should call me At this point in time I dont think she has anything to worry about but I told her that I would like to come visit her son and her house to see if I can get a reading on anything Im not sure when Ill be able to visit her house or if anything else will happen but if something does happen Ill make sure to update those who are reading this,My Coworkers Son,35,nosleep,top_week
yurglar,10,14,1r6zsn,27,Under the BedIm writing this because I simply cannot sleep and theres something I really need to tell someone and I find this reddit to be a good place to do so It is something that is not what youd consider in the domain of classical horror stories like zombies or ghosts It is not because it was and Im afraid still is real It is so real that it happened  years ago when I was only  on a cold morning of December As you can see not the night of st October Just the placid boring morning of th December I was in bed and I knew my parents were already out they liked going on morning jogs together It was a Sunday and my head was throbbing I have frequent migraines and that th December migraine was particularly bad So there I was feeling shitty and thinking about lunch when I moved and my bed creaked The house was old like proper old and we had just moved in in this regard that part of my life did sound like the beginning of a cliché horror story I thought it was just temporary anyway once dad left his job we would leave to CaliforniaWhen I was a kid I had this habit of putting a pillow over my face when I had a migraine normally one of those useless small pillows always hanging around They were always cold and the cold felt good on my forehead and cheeks It might sound a bit stupid to you but to me it felt good for a few seconds On th December I did this and suddenly I could not remove the pillowI tried to remove it with all my strength and whoever whatever was pushing down gave in It was more or less the strength of a skinny teenager I started panicking scared my legs twisting and my heartbeat shooting through the roof I didnt even wonder what was happening I managed to catch a breath and then it happened all of a sudden I heard the light switch of my room go out and the blinds closing violently and the pressure on the pillow suddenly increased Twice then tenfold It was no longer the strength of a human being but something else I felt my mind slowdown from the lack of oxygen and I stopped fighting I felt a strange calm wash over me Whatever was killing me was impossible to fight it was like there was a ton of stone over that pillow I saw a light my vision going white and then tunneling and I heard whispers I was dying I felt scared then I put my hands over the pillow but there was nothing there and I only felt the hairs of my arms standing up My hands were not smashed as I expected My young brain could not make sense of it but I remember being scared really scared Thats when I heard a barkMy dog Thor had heard me twist and struggle in bed and had come to my lucky rescue The pressure immediately disappeared the blinds opened and the light turned on and thats when I felt it sliding over my right arm like a hand caressing it but a dead hand callous and cold hand and I felt it whatever it was turning and hiding under the bed like a snake hiding under a rock Thor kept barking madly teeth showing and ears back He was a German shepherd huge for the standards Then he neared my bed looked under my bed growling and then stopped He sniffed once then twice looked again under the bed and then climbed on top of the bed and licked my face where I laid regaining my breath and control over my limbs which had gone a bit numb I remember hugging Thor and almost cryingI told it to my parents but they did not believe me they thought it was the migraines and started talking about a psychologist or psychiatrist and bad grades at school I remember being angry with their reaction but over time it faded It took some time for me to sleep again and Thor always slept in my room sometimes even with me but there were never any more issues I never even remembered it from time to time it was just a scary traumatic memory my brain just erased For  years I slept over that memory over whatever was under my bedWe moved out a month ago after  years to a new modern house in California where my bed doesnt even have space under it and I love it My dad sold the house to this young couple who were his friends who didnt have much money but loved the retro feeling of the house Back then I didnt even remember that scary event  years agoThats when as I was laying on my new bed yesterday I remembered along with all my morning nightmare details  years ago my dad complaining the other day at dinner table how John and Mary the young couple havent phoned or said anything about the house since they started living thereI went to get Thor in my bedroom I cant stop thinking about it and I hope they are alright,Under the Bed,41,nosleep,top_week

BumpinRapTapes,10,9,1r0hla,25,So I got a call from a telemarketer nothing weird about that really  But before I hung up the automated voice started spitting out stuff like my address age stuff like that  And then my social security number  Then a list of my room mates  And then I was concerned  I waited until the machine stopped expecting some numbers to press for more info or whatever so I could find out whats up and get myself off their call list  All the lady robot said though was The Intermed company thanks youReasonably concerned I started doing some research after ignoring a bunch of message board sites  I finally found what I think was the Intermed site in like the fifth page of results  This is all it saidIntermed is at the forefront of the organ trade market and thought processing innovations  All our services are backed with industry leading research and proven by numerous customer testimonials  Many of our customers are satisfied to the point of frequent return and we pride ourselves in maintaining our client pool  Products and services offered by our company are backed with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime maintenance all available with a phone call  Hereditary conditions of the mind and body are often the only thing holding you back from reaching your full potential  Our team of researchers and technicians are here to offer you a remedy to any and all imperfections flowing through your bloodline at a price you wont need to think twice about  Never again will the flaws of your fathers keep you from the life you deserve  Even the best and brightest are far from perfect and we strive everyday to make you the perfect human beingNothing else  White page black text  Thats it  I decided to backtrack to the message boards to see what I could find  This led me to some random sites and eventually I found a few message threads of people sharing stories similar to mine  A weird robot caller with way too much information  One guy got the call in the wee hours of the morning and totally laid a boner kill on a sweaty night with his lady  They all seemed to be on the same hunt I was except for one username that I saw pop up on a few of the sites he called himself ASimpleCipher  All this dude did was sing Intermeds praises how he and his friends had used their products and services to tremendous avail and would recommend to anyone  All very cheesy and all seemingly marketing plants  Since that was my best lead I decided to make an account on one of the thread sites and try and get in contact with himI sent him a rather aggressive message which mayve been a mistake looking back  But regardless and unsurprisingly I got no response  I decided if worse came to worse Id just deal with it when it came up  I put the whole thing in the back of my mind  For a few monthsThen ASimpleCipher responded  Heres a copy and paste of our correspondenceMe  Hey man its really obvious you work for intermed youre not fooling anyone  I want to know who you are what intermed is and how you got so much of my information  And I want MY private information deleted from your database and I want off your call list  Immediately  I will not hesitate to get a lawyer involved if this goes any furtherASimpleCipher   I appreciate your interest in my company Ben  As always customer care is a top goal at Intermed  My representatives tell me that based on market research you would be a prime candidate for our products and services  As a courtesy we like to know as much as we can about potential customers so as to provide the best quality care possible  Like you I once felt a terrible weight in my life one that rendered me incapable of reaching my full potential as a human being  When doctors could not help me mend the flaws given to me by generations past I took matters into my own hands  As it came to pass that effort is what gave way to this current business venture  You may hesitate at terminology like Thought Processing and Organ Trade but let me assure you the danger begins and ends at the television screen  So if I may Id like to draw some common ground between yourself and I  We do share many similarities  As a young man I was plagued with severe asthma like yourself from my mothers side of the family leaving me unable to compete physically with my peers  This lead me to more intellectual endeavors as I began to mature into an adult  Cruel as fate is however I soon discovered Id inherited a more severe form of my grandfathers autism  His genes riddled me with social anxiety and I was thus outcast from much of any community I was ever a member of  In spite of my flawed genetics I was only more driven to clear the blemishes of my being  Nothing I vowed would hinder my quest for perfection of the perfect human being  Given to me from my lineage however was the savvy and cunning of generations of businessmen  Years centuries it seems passed while I honed my craft and built my empire  Once one is outcast from society one develops a strong callous to sympathy  Under a mutual agreement of confidentiality between you and I I will admit to using almost every associate of mine as merely a means to my own end  Well that end is Intermed  Intermed is my true brainchild as it were  I will also admit to misleading you a bit giving the facade of a full staff under my employ  Let me assure you I am fully capable of operating this venture on my own  Let me also assure you your personal information is safe and sound as I said I only aim to ensure the best service possible  Never miss a detail is a creed I operate underEnough business however  Even a jaded outcast such as me has need for camaraderie  During my time working in the shipping industry I found myself in Northern California in the early s  My business associate at the time was a rather unstable man  Every bit of his free time it seemed he would study the art of coded language ciphers cryptograms whatever one may call them  Strangely he got me very interested in the art and it has since become a favorite hobby of mine  Of course his were much more complex than anything I cared to attempt he was also versed in astrology and loved to incorporate knowledge of the stars into his little puzzles This earned him quite the sinister reputation after we parted ways  On the other hand I preferred to leave little clues here and there woven into my business dealings  Now imagine what fun it would be if someone figured out my little puzzles  All that work of building a persona of mystery  Unravelled by a thread Id left loose for some cunning soul to pull  Really I thought someone wouldve found it by now  Even after everyone Ive tried to sell Intermeds services and products to it is you cunning lad who has finally made contact  Very clever indeed  Of course you saw my companies website  I admit it is a bit sparse a work in progress  Reducing my mission for Intermed to a single paragraph however I did put in a bit of extra effortI have been rambling though I do apologize  Thank you for inquiring about my company I hope my response has eased any concerns you may haveIntermedI really dont know what to make of this guy  It really cant be some prank the guy knew I had asthma as a kid  How  I have to say that Ive never experienced such an air of creepiness from pure text  Something about the way he composed his message was off  I dont know  I cant make a lot of sense out of any of this  I stopped my investigation there being as I have seen too many horror movies and dont like the idea of rabbit holes  Its been a few months since and I havent heard anything from Intermed or ASimpleCipher  I check the thread site every now and then  I did go back and check out the Intermed website again  Im really not one for puzzles I cant make anything out of it  So Im submitting it here to see if someone is more cunning than me  I hope so  Anyway that about wraps it up sorry for the length Ive been staying in lately as my asthma has been returning so Ive kind of been alone with my thoughts,A Simple Cipher,34,nosleep,top_week
NeonPaint,12,6,1ra0o4,26,I need someone to help me I need to actually be able to go to sleep and not worry about what Im going to wake up to I need it to stopThe past few days have been enough to make me pack up and check myself into the crazy house It would have to be better than this I work at a nursing home Its not a luxurious job for sure but this nursing home makes my job interesting Its haunted I know it sounds stupid but it really is We have a shadow that haunts one room and our residents will act in ways that will set you on edge I guess the most recent example is Dessy I obviously cannot provide you her real name but this is a nickname I have given her myself Dessy is a cute little old woman She is the grandma you wish you could have Weve always had a pretty good companionship A couple weeks ago she changed Her appearance and her personality completely shifted Her eyes become sunken in hair was constantly messy when it used to always be well groomed teeth started to turn a nasty yellow and her feetdear god her feetthey looked like they belonged to a creature who only resembled a human in the slightest way The best way I can explain her feet is that they looked like long fingered hands with jagged finger nails they didnt look like they belonged to some little adorable woman of  She started saying things to me There was one conversation that has stuck with me Dessy do you want to go to the dining room tonightFuckfuckyou little whoreExcuse me Why are you saying that Honey you can eat in your room I just wanted to make sureHow does it feel whore Little slut you fucking slut you whore you SLUTYou need to stop being mean How bout we go into the bathroom and you can go before dinner At this moment she shuffles into the bathroom with me and I grab her pants to pull them downYou fucking slut Does he do this to you Does he put his hands in your pants Does he fuck you with his hand He fucked that little virgin ctvirginwhore slut fuck youwith his handvirgin ct ct ct I went white as a ghost I was close to Dessy but this old woman never knew anything about me other than my age my name and that I wasnt married I never spoke a word to her about anything sexual but she knew things My personal life isnt something I want to share but her mentioning those last words did relate to me in a very personal way I looked at her as if the devil himself were standing in front of me And then she smiled I cant explain to you guys the smile this woman gave me how it made me cringe how it made me sick Fast forward from that moment to a few days ago Stuff starts happening to me at my house It began with scratching One night I heard scratching coming from the walls then it was above me in the ceiling then back to the walls I didnt think it was too scary until it started to follow me around the house If I went into the kitchen the scratching would follow I couldnt get away from it But I soon realized there are much scarier noises out thereThe moaning is what followed and its been driving me to the brink of insanity Every night I hear this awful moaning Like someone is in this house crying out from a pain I can never imagine I get up I search for who ever or what ever it is If it sounds like its coming from the living room I run to the living room but as soon as my feet hit the carpet the moaning is now in the kitchen It plays with me Toys with my mind and makes me run around here on an endless hour consuming search of where it is coming from If I even want to know where it comes fromThe sound is so sad but it feels unmistakably evil to me I cant explain it but when I hear it I know its a cruel joke I know people say that they are sensitive to spirits all the time but I have always felt like I have been I cant sit down and talk to them like all these psychics out there but I will get random thoughts or names or feelings If a spirit is around I usually can get a name and maybe a fact or two but this has no name nothing What it does have is a moan that makes me instantly nauseous and it has a smile I havent seen it in its entirety but I got a glimpse of something that has made sleeping and living here nearly impossible One night when the moaning was louder than usual I went on the pointless search again trying to find it and figure out a way to stop it When I walked into the living room I saw a shadow and it had a smile on its face that made me throw up right there It made everything in me want to come up in my throat After I cleaned up and calmed down I realized that the smile was familiar to me Maybe thats why it caused me to get sick it could have been that my body knew instantly where that smile had been before Sweet Dessy showed me that smile that day in the restroom in her room She has never smiled at me like that again but I cant handle the thought of seeing it again whether its with or without a faceThe moaning and that smile haunts me It keeps me running around my house every night because I want it to STOP I havent had a real nights sleep in days  Im exhausted and Im working a full time job on a quarter tank of energy Things I usually love to do I dont have the energy to do I always liked to post comments on reddit but its been a couple weeks since Ive even done that because the thought of actually reading a post and commenting is too exhausting its pitiful I need someone to tell me what I can

BiohazardTyrant,3,10,1r4rao,20,So to begin I was eleven years old I believeMy father had brought me to a friend of his house Or rather farmI was excited because I had befriended the son of my fathers friend for stories sake I will call him James James had a older brother who was a year and a half older so I was eleven James was twelve and his brother thirteen We had all played around the barn and fields plenty of times before This time though it was a celebration of some sort I wish I could remember why but anyway they had been in this house on this farm for about half a year Tonight was the big party as in the most vivid thing I remember about that night The cut off pigs head Literally just cut right off and sitting on a support beam about shoulder high to the adults The body was dangling from a chain for a while until they skewered it onto a metal pole and roasted it whole over a fireI really wish I could remember why they were doing that but sadly I cannot In any case me James and his brother were just running around like we always did like idiots They had all of the farm as a playground and plenty of space to play We began by walking over to the stalls where they kept the horses and cattle The sheds were HUGE and seemed to be endless to a younger kid as myself After about a half an hour of walking through corridors left and right in the dark we started hearing noises but not normal ones Like chains being hit on metal and slammed into the ground then grunts We all took off running following James brother who quickly let out out to the closest exit None of us knew what the sounds were because of the fact the farm had been out of commission for about thirty years Nothing alive should have been in there We quickly made out way back to the farm house the big one where all the adults were partying and tried to talk to them about it but of course they had all had a drink or three and ignored us laughing it off as childish imagination For some reason Some stupid god forsaken reason James said we should go back out and just play in the field where there was a little light away from the adults and we listened Once the three of us were out there it turned into a I dare you to go out in the field gameWe each took turns going farther and farther out into the night Finally we all ended up ignoring the occurrences from earlier and started playing hide and seek Bad idea Very badJames and I were hiding in the tall grass near the side end of the barn and his brother came running out faster than I have ever seen anyone run screaming bloody murder to get away as fast as we could get to the adults James and I ran to him and stopped dead in our tracks quickly seeing why he had been fleeing There we were James his brother and I all standing still like sacks of meat staring to the treeline where we saw it There were three if I remember correctly faces All white and elongated just weirdly shaped about six feet off the ground and then came the true horror the glint off the blades they were holding We all ranFaster and faster we ranI turned around two times and I regret it to this day for the fact they were even closer than I thought blades outstretched trying to mince us up and drag us back into those hellish woods We finally made it to the adults The only thing I remember after that was that damn pig head cut off and just sitting there I could see the spine and every last vein we tried telling the adults but they just laughed None of us left the main barn after that for the rest of nightAbout a week later my friend Chris came over and had the worst part to share with me He had been having these night terrors of these creatures tearing at him and chasing him through his own new homeThen he told me his family had left the farm and moved to the cityThen he told me why He was attackedThen he showed me and lifted his shirt up showing me a scar which I know he did not have before because we used to swim together all the time He never had a mark there a week before But now across his stomach he had a fully healed scar of about ten inches going from left to right like he had been gutted But the scariest fact like I said was that it had not been there one night then he woke up with that kind of scar His family moved because of that that day And never returned to that farmI have long since lost touch with him he became very paranoid after that and I just cant forget thatFigured I would share it with the community I do hope if any of you take anything away from this if you see a creature with a white face long arms and a huge blade by a treeline Run just run And try to forget about it,A tale of a Farm and three young kids,30,nosleep,top_week
JordanThirstExile,11,34,1r857m,22,It started with the roses Ever since I was a little girl I loved them I loved the scent of them and the colors they came in I loved them so much that my mother had planted a few rose bushes outside our house so when it bloomed I could sit and stare at those beautiful roses They bloomed in shades of white and pink but my favorite rose was red like satin It reminded me of my mother and the way she always drew roses on her letters Fast forward to the time I was  years old I was never a popular girl by far but I wasnt unknown either I didnt have long blonde hair or blue eyes but I had talent a slim body and an obsession for roses All my friends knew how much I loved them Theyd buy me perfume in a roseshaped bottle or a dress with red roses on them for my birthday  I made the best out of what I could in high school being a short brown haired greeneyed girl It was the day before homecoming when the boy Id secretly been in love with asked me to the dance with a white rose I swooned and he took me to the dance the next night I of course in a rose dress and him in matching colors He had brought me a white rose corsage to match my dress We danced all night and we continued to date until high school ended After our senior year we went our separate ways and stopped talking But this didnt bother me I hadnt time to waste when I was busy with my rosesIn college I had been taking Art classes in my third semester when I got a call one evening informing me that my mother had pasted away in the hospital The following Tuesday we attended her funeral My father had picked out the colors We buried my loving mother in pink roses because she was a former cancer survivor and we were blessed to have her as long as we didFor the months following my mothers death I became deeply depressed The only thing that eased the pain from losing my mother were the roses When they bloomed in the spring my sprits suddenly lifted The roses were my life and I dont know what Id do without them  years go by and I ended up meeting a nice guy who joined my ecology class His name was Dylan and we immediately hit it off He gave me everything a girl couldve ever wanted and treated me like a princess I loved him more than anything in the world We talked about moving in together and buying a house after college We talked about getting married and having a daughter named Rose for my love of roses His handsome blonde hair and chiseled feature would make a beautiful babyWe went through college and eventually graduated together and got married We lived in a small townhouse in Vermont for a long time after that After trying many times to have the baby I so desperately wanted the doctor came to tell that I was infertile Dylan tried to tell me we could always adopt always have a child if I wanted but I didnt It wasnt fair If I couldnt have a child that was my own flesh blood how would she share the love of roses like my mother did with me Again for a long time I became mute I could not eat or sleep Dylan became very distant and we hardly spoke Everything we had was gone Nothing made me happy anymore Nothing would until I had a baby rose I would look out at our garden and wait for them to bloom but even then the roses did not make me happy It was the next winter before I found out I knew something had gone wrong because all of the roses had turned over black instead of falling off and dying Dylan had come home late that night and seemed very stressed I decided that night while he slept Id go through his phone He had  missed calls and a text from a girl named Lisa The text readYou HAVE to stay home tonight She wont stop crying unless youre here LisaWho wouldnt stop crying Did someone care that much about my dear Dylan to cry when hes not there I remember him saying he worked at the office with a girl named Lisa so I decided to send her a text replying Get her to stop crying I cant be that important After that I waited for a reply for several minutes before I got a reply backOf course youre important to her love Youre her daddy And she needs you here Just take off work this one nightWORK SHE though HE was at WORK He was supposed to be at work all day And WHOS daddy was she talking about I carefully went through his address book in his phone and found her home address I silently walked downstairs and out the door grabbing a hoe from the garden before leaving in the carI knew the black roses meant something was wrong I returned a few hours later with his baby in our car I left her there while I waited behind the house About an hour later I see Dylan walk out the front door to leave when he suddenly stops when he sees the child in the car with the windows up He screams ALLISON Is THAT the things name So it IS his At this point I was furious As he went to unlock the door to retrieve the child I pulled him backwards so he fell into the garden I picked up the hoe and shouted ALL I WANTED WERE THE RED ROSESThe hoe dug into his head once and I felt all the love Id ever had for him release into the small tiny bits of pieces that were once my loving husband When I was all through I tossed his body into the cellar along with his companions At least now the black roses are blood red once again A beautiful thing the roses are Little rose lives with me now and she has just enrolled in preschool She loves the roses as much as I do but her favorite ones are the dead petals So pretty she said Even after theyre dead I always agree with her on that Sometimes she asks where daddy is and I must tell her Simple Prim Rose ask the petals,It Ended With Roses,56,nosleep,top_week
buffalowing,6,10,1r337b,18,I probably cant tell a great story but I can tell you what I saw last fall I was outside admiring my garden that runs along the side of the house I froze as soon as I looked towards the front of the house I saw something short maybe  feet walking on two legs It was walking in the direction of my porch or front of the house I thought it was kinda strange since I live out in the suburbs and something like this would easily be noticed by any of my neighbors The funny part is we both made eye contact it noticed that I was looking straight at it As soon as it did it ran away and I ran after it When I turned the corner there was nothing I ran around the whole house just in case it was running circles around my house Nada So yeah I saw that once No biggie since I havent seen it again or it hasnt messed with my garden Here is a small image of the scenario and what I sawhttpimgurcomQarl,Random thing in my front yard,28,nosleep,top_week
cmd,4,4,1r2xzg,21, unexplainable experiences are not completely abnormal for me Every house or apartment that Ive lived in Ive seen or heard something that would make a lot of people hide under a blanket or leave the house all together The man at my window was one story of mine that never fails to make whoever I tell shudder so I figured Id share it hereIt began when I was  or  years old We lived in an older house but not one that would instantly stand out as creepy or unusual We didnt live in the middle of nowhere but rather on a street lined with houses on both sides of the road It was a fairly quiet neighborhood the kind where the rare car that came down the street would often break up a game of football or hockey that was being played by the kids that inhabited almost every house It wasnt perfect but it was great I was a very happy child One night I was plagued by a very odd yet equally terrifying nightmare I dreamt that I was in my bed in the room that I shared with my older sister I sat up and looked out of the window that was next to my bed which sat in the one corner of my bedroom flush against the wall The window overlooked the back yard and in that yard stood a man He wore a long black coat a widebrimmed black hat that hid his face from me and a black suit On his shoulder there sat a very large black bird with red eyes I stared at him for what seemed like forever before he looked up at my window The only features of his face that I could see were his eyes which were a deep red just like the birds Just as he made eye contact with me the bird left his shoulder and flew straight at my window When the bird got to the point where it would have inevitably smashed through the window and probably eaten me I woke up I was on my side facing my sisters bed that was situated in the exact same position as mine but on the opposite side of the room I stared at her as she slept soundly terrified and unable to go back to sleep I decided that the only way I would get any rest was by looking out my window and proving to myself that the man wasnt really there so I rolled over and sat up My curtains were already pulled to the sides of the window since my bedroom was on the second floor of a house in a decent neighborhood  we didnt really worry about anyone trying to peep on my sister and me The second I looked at the window he was there Even though he was impossibly directly outside my window  close enough that he should have left fog with his breath I still couldnt see any features of the mans face except his blood red eyes I did what many children would do I laid back down and threw my blankets over my head I eventually fell back asleep despite being scared out of my mindThe man visited me several times a month for several years after that always just staring at me through my window during the darkest parts of the night When my sister moved out I started sleeping in her bed  across the room and away from the window I didnt see the man anymore One day I was cleaning my room in preparation for my friend to sleep over that night I knelt on my old bed still there for when we had guests  to clean the window I pulled the curtain aside as a teenager now I valued my privacy and saw a handprint on the glass It was bigger than my own but I didnt think anything of it I had assumed one of my friends had left it there I sprayed the cleaner and wiped it away with the paper towel but the handprint remained A little grossed out I went over it again a little harder to scrub the print away It was still there That was when I realized that despite not seeing him anymore I still received visits from the man with the red eyes The hand print was on the outside of the window,the man at my window,25,nosleep,top_week

irinax,11,6,1rf7xn,20,Previous post herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrcopwhoisthiswomanpartThis night I had a friend over Its not related to the woman or this story at all  it was planned much earlier I needed some help with my new place so shed help me and sleep over because we had no idea how much time it would really takeShe had to leave really early before  AM so I thought I can just sleep until  and then goBut as soon as she went out I felt something weird As if theres someone still with me Someone watching me I just knew someone is thereKind of like when I lived with my parents and I just KNOW theyre here even though the door of my room is closed And I know so I have to get up and checkThats how it was So I got up to check Nothing I couldnt see anything but I could still feel it I figured the feeling would go away when I look around the apartment and see that theres nothing there It didnt It just felt like I was chasing after something and it kept getting away Like when you try to hold onto something really slippery I felt helpless and very hopeless in that moment It was much deeper than just not being able to find something I felt was there  it was just an ingeneral feeling of misery and despair not related to something specific So I figured maybe I was just getting sick maybe I was too tried too stressed maybe its really nothing and I went back to bed I fell asleep really quickly Then the doorbell rang I woke up It felt like I slept for hours and hours but in reality it was only like  or  minutes I went to open the door guess who it was The womanYeah I was terrified and for a moment I thought  Im done Its over Byebye cruel worldIt  wasnt  regular fear like youd be afraid when you know theres a reason to like a gun pointed or an angry dog It was more like fear of the dark you dont really know what exactly you fear but its still scaryAnd just to make it clear once again  she doesnt LOOK scary She looks normalShe speaks in a normal tone with a normal voice But theres just something about her that makes me want to get away but in the same way intrigues me  I feel that I HAVE to knowSo I was really holding back the what the fuck are you doing here you mad bitch rant that was forming in my mind I just greeted her instead because seriously what good could come out of getting pissy Not like that would help nowShe says hi Im like uhumm yeah hi And then she tells me she just wanted to visit me to see how am I doing hows life etc etc So Im like wtf you saw me yesterday and the day before and the day before She ignores me She asks to come in but I tell her I was just planning to get out I have things to do so  I wouldnt be a good host right now She says she doesnt mind it all I say I feel embarrassed about having such a messy home Maybe when I fix it I know  she knows Im lying But I just HAVE to say that I cant tell her the truth She just walks in and I immediately escort her outAnd the truth is I just DONT want her in I cant let  her I know she cant do anything more than she could do in the hallway or from the door or in the park or in an alley or anywhere else really but I just didnt feel like letting her in and still dont I know it was rude as fuck but so is trying to force someone to let you in their house at  in the morningShe keeps trying to get me to make her coffee or breakfast or something And the pushier she gets I get less afraid more angry She then asks me about my old town my friends family my new friends my new place what am I planning to do here I dont tell her shit I just ramble about unspecific things getting more and more angry She makes me feel dizzy Not in a Ohsoniceandcute way In a very bad way In a Icouldpassoutorevendie waySomehow I get through the conversation and then she just suddenly stops talking and stares at me Youre really not going to let me in I explain to her again that Im going out now and the place is a messSo she glares at me and nods AlrighttttI really thought she was going to attack me  I was really waiting for her to try to hit me or stab me or whateverBut she turns around then she turns back to me and says See you soon Maybe Ill come again tomorrow I tell her itd be better if she just lets me invite her when Im ready for visitors when I can actually provide a good stay for a guestBut friends name stayed the nightI get terrified again  bitch how the fuck do you know but I just say that friend is helping me with the apartmentShe nods again And then she says bye see you And walks away Turns around once again stares at me and says I still cant figure it out Thats why I just have to come back like you had to interrogate me at the park And then walks down the stairs I try to stop her but she ignores me Wont talk anymoreNow the thing is nothing about her except the knowing my greatgrandmother part seems supernatural otherwordly She seems like a silly but creepy lost cause And if it wasnt for my grandmothers warnings and the woman claiming to know Magdalena Id even consider her a cute wackadoodle But I still have NOTHING to explain WHY my grandmother appears to fear this woman and NOTHING to explain HOW could she a woman

schizoidvoid,10,7,1r45ql,20,Part  Manifestationshttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrxtthesilverladypartmanifestations For several years now Ive had this story inside me like lead shot in my gut Ive considered telling it hundreds of times over but the sheer magnitude of it has always stopped me With six months of therapy under my belt I figure its time I know now that I wont be free of this thing until I write it out Settle in because I cant tell this story in ten thousand characters or less Ill be lucky to get through it in twice or three times that Its hard enough to sum up everyday life and this story is anything butI had a recurring dream when I was really little I would wake up in the dream and standing beside my bed was the most beautiful lady I had ever seen Long straight hair and long flowing gown both of the purest silver like captured moonlight She would smile at me so sincerely so lovingly as she sat down beside me and began to speakThe words were comforting like a lullaby but I couldnt understand them Though she spoke quietly her voice seemed to echo through the room through the universe backwards and forwards in time begging to be understood by my adolescent brainI always tried to stay in the dream as long as I could but eventually I would drift back off to sleep in the dream and wake up to my mom gently rousing me for breakfastMy mom died when I was seven and the dreams stopped Well I prefer to say she died She was murdered I hate that word Its so cold it falls off the tongue like shards of glassMy mom was a health nut protein shakes weight lifting yoga the whole lot Above all she loved to jog We had several acres of untamed land around the house She always woke me up about an hour before dad went to work so she could go take a fortyminute run through the forest and along the creek it befell dad to make me breakfast and get me ready for schoolThey found her by the lake south of the house And hanging from the old weeping willow in the middle of the pasture And scattered across the countryside in a tenmile radius around the house  but that was mostly after the funeral All told the casket had about twothirds of a person inside when we finally buried her They never found her headWe used to be a close family  me my sister my mom and dad  Losing mom and losing her the way we did splintered us Dad lost himself in his advertising job My sister turned inward and fell into drugs and alcohol when the kids our age figured out how to get ahold of it Besides his job dads other mission was to keep his girls safe from all harm and he took that one even more seriously Leanna got it a little easier since she was four years older I was taken out of school Dad hired a tutor to homeschool me I wasnt allowed out after dark I wasnt allowed out without supervision Unless I was being taken to town for some reason I wasnt allowed to range out of eyesight or earshot of the houseI started writing obsessively Mom taught me how to keep a journal as soon as I could hold a crayon I still have my very first one the pages are filled with scribbles in different colors and some pages are nearly colored solid I guess I thought that good writing should fill as much of the page as possible I remember how unabashedly delighted mom was to see every single entry I guess writing is my way of honoring her memoryI took moms death hard but it was a long while before I really understood what it meant that mom was killed Dad told me that a very bad man had taken my mom from us that she was dead that shed never come back All things considered he handled that conversation pretty well Nothing could have softened the blow though My mommy was gone I loved her and wanted her but Id never see her again She was dead and death meant people were gone forever We werent a religious household so at that young age I was coming to grips with the fact that mom didnt exist anymore There was a hole in my world It was like that feeling when you go to grab something like a can of Coke without looking at it and you end up swiping at the air because that can wasnt where you expected it to beI healed in time For several years I was just chugging along going through the motions numb to the outside world Closing myself off was easy the outside world mainly consisted of our house and the clearing around it My dad was mostly an authoritarian figure when he was home always vigilant but never available My sister babysat me when dad was gone though she usually left me entirely to my own devices She was homeschooled too but she could drive sometimes she would simply leave me at the house and go off to do Big People stuff That Big People stuff as Ive written consisted mainly of shooting up with her friends or scoring more dopeShe had been chasing her high for ten years straight when I turned eighteen Leanna had been living with her junkie boyfriend for a couple years She was never able to hold down a job for very long so she would spread her legs for a dealer until he let her move in That was how she kept up her habit When that didnt work out shed beg dad for more money and find another dealer to fuckIt was a miserable shady life for her and she would have kept going until it killed her And it didMy dad got the call at four in the morning on a Tuesday I remember waking up blearyeyed to see him looking like death warmed over I had only seen that tortured look on his face once before and I shot straight up wide awake when I saw it that nightLeanna I saidHe nodded My heart sank into my stomach and stopped beating She was living in the city a fortyminute drive away A long miserable fortyminute drive away Neither dad nor I spoke a word He sat stoically knuckles white on the wheel crying silently I might as well have been dead myself I stared at my lap taking in nothing thinking nothing feeling nothing Where my heart had been was a gaping holeDad led me by the hand into the funeral home and sat me down in a chair where I waited motionlessly as he went to identify the body I heard his wracking sobs as he came back to get me some time later I reflexively turned towards the sound The funeral director and another man were practically holding him upright as he stumbled across the lobby They took me up and walked us to a private area with a couple of couches where we both collapsedI sat on the couch mindlessly pulling at my hair gazing at my father as he poured out his grief He had always been a reserved man but the dam had finally broken We had no family but ourselves Mom had grown up in a foster home and had no love for the people she called her fake parents My biological grandma had a stroke and passed in her sleep My grandpa followed not long after as old widowers are wont to do I never knew either of them If we had any extended family we never knew themI halfnoticed the little hank of hair tangled around my hand I hadnt felt it when I ripped it outDad cried for a long time eventually slumping sideways into his couch When his voice was gone and his sobs came without tears he stood up He seemed to be carrying the weight of a thousand suns on his shoulders At his slight nod in my direction I stood up myself and we walked together to the car He pulled out a rumpled piece of paper and his phone and dialed a number We were at a motel fifteen minutes later We went to sleep in our clothesThe next few days were a blur There were arrangements to be made and that was dads job I went to town and bought us clothes and toiletries to keep us going while we stayed at the motelThe funeral was a small affair back home We laid her to rest in the plot next to moms Dad and I were the only mourners A minister said some words we each tossed a handful of dirt on the grave and it was over It was overWe stepped through the doorway and into our home Quiet pervaded the empty space the sort of quiet only found indoors Clocks ticking a gentle hum from our air conditioner our breathing and the stecatto hitches as one or the other of us suppressed a sobWe stood alone in an empty house our bodies kept upright through some force of habit or instinct in the absence of warm blood flowing through our veins My sister had imparted some vitality into this place unbeknownst to us even after our mothers murder As our Leanna died so died the house I might have turned to see the land itself had withered without so much as a shrugDad pulled the door shut and the click of its latch impossibly loud against the quiet signaled the start of our new life or merely the end of the oldI glanced at the clock almost noon The gears in my brain began turning cast about for something to fill the time until bed and found nothing It then latched on to the only activity left and my feet carried me to the stairs with sliding steps They balked briefly as if puzzled by a reason to lift off the ground more than half an inch and then continued A minute later I fell backwards collapsing onto my purple comforter My toes brushed the carpet from time to time but that didnt matter Nothing did Apathy sang me a lullaby and the world faded awayMy staggered footsteps echoed through the tunnel meshing with the steadfast crashing of many feet behind me Searing hot agony blazed through my side I had to keep running I had to reach the end before I snapped upright eyes unfocused drenched in sweat I bent forward reflexively and threw up bile into my lap I sobbed and choked on my own vomit I coughed until my throat was raw until the vessels in my eyes popped and then collapsed sidewaysGood morning worldPart

quietgrl,12,7,1rchof,20,I had moved to Minnesota months ago in order to get away from some strange phenomenon happening to me in Philadelphia since May  I dont know what to call these things ghosts phantoms spirits However my friends and family arent judging my experiences as real accounts of the paranormal they believe that Im slowly losing my mind And sometime I wonder if thats the case too if Im simply falling into to some form of schizophrenia I decided to share my stories here so maybe I wouldnt have to feel much like a freak or that Im going crazy Or maybe I just dont want to feel alone with this Well I had a week to relax again without anything strange happening to me However I had that feeling again that things werent over and was just getting started I am anxious all the time ready for the next creepy thing to happen to me and Im not even sure if I can call my life living anymore I rarely sleep I barely function at work and Im losing a lot of weight from the lack of eating My only distraction these days seem to be stupid videos on the web and chatting with the cute neighbor named Charlie I dont share with him about my experiences because I dont want him to look at me with those same pitying eyes that my friends and family give meAlthough last week I did dare to ask Charlie if he had noticed anything strange in the neighborhood He gave me a funny and confused look and I had to try my best to explain what I was asking without really explaining the truth of my situation Oh I said waving my hands as if the movements would untangle my nervous words You know I mean do you notice anything weird or any weird stories from others in the neighborhood I was trying to figure out if I was the only person who had a ghost following themNo Charlie said shaking his head slowly in thought And then his baby blue eyes lit up Well yeah If you mean if there are any weirdos here yes we have a few like anywhere else I am a bit weird for example Nah I blushed towards him Youre not weird at all You seem very normal to me And very cute I wanted to add but I kept that thought to myself Well after a while of nothing happening to me I didnt exactly catch onto the next bizarre incident right away It must have been nearly am in the morning when I heard a man singing loudly outside If it hadnt been for CottonEye Joe Id been married a long time ago Where did you come from where did you go Where did you come from CottonEye Joe At first I was a lot annoyed for having my sleep disturbed by the most unlikely song but then it was kind of funny that someone really seemed to like this song and thought it was a good idea to bellow it early in the am Then another thought came to me that it may be the voice of Charlie proving me wrong about my earlier opinion that he wasnt weird It sounded a little like his voice and I couldnt help but wonder if he was drunk off his ass and having a bit of fun tonight I rushed from my bed and peered out the window my eyes slowly adjusting to the darkness outside The only thing I could see was a shadowed figured of a man non descriptive as he shambled towards the direction of the pathway between my house and CharliesI giggled to myself before heading back to sleep knowing that I would tease the guy tomorrow about his choice of song I slept peacefully as the night faded back into silence The next day I did run into Charlie a silly grin on my face I told him how I spotted him in a chorus of Cotton Eyed Joe stumbling towards his house at am in the morning He gave me the most confused lemon face that I ever saw on a man and replied Well I dont know who you saw but it wasnt me For one thing I was asleep at that time dead to the world And second of all I hate that song I dont even know all the words to it let along could sing the chorusHmm I said a bit confused now because I swore it was his voice that I had heard Hey he smirked I did tell you that we have some weirdos among us right It was probably Mr Roy who lives about two houses down from us All he ever does is drink and he only seems to leave his house during the night to avoid conversation and eye contact with any of the neighbors I wouldnt be surprised if he had a few too many last nightI agreed with that explanation for the time being but I wondered if Charlie was somehow covering up an embarrassing moment that I had caught him in The next night the singing happened again this time at am with a loud chorus of Where did you come from where did you go Where did you come from CottonEye Joe I rushed to the window and again I could only see a shadowed figure shambling towards the pathway and disappearing around the corner leading to the front of the housesI felt uneasy about the movement of the shadow as it didnt seem exactly like a humans walk at all and very unlikely for even a drunken one It was a combination of stops and jerks forward like someone moving a puppet on a string And sometimes the shadow seemed to jerk too far ahead causing the figure to appear a couple of feet in the matter of a blink I wasnt sure if I was just overly tired and seeing things or maybe not I decided to go back to sleep and forget about itThe next night I was awaken by the man singing the song loudly again this time at am I had left my floodlight on before bed a light that illuminates my driveway I eagerly peered out of the window hoping to see the guys face this time whether it would be Charlies or the weird neighbors This time the figured shambled directly in the path of the bright light and still his face was nothing but a shadow There was no hint to any of its features just a shadowed figured that belted out Where did you come from where did you go Where did you come from CottonEye JoeI was frighten shutting my curtains and hiding under my blankets I slept with my bedroom lamp on for the rest of the night just like a little kid Later in the day I asked Charlie if he heard the singing man last night or any time this week He did not And again I felt as If I may be hallucinating these thingsLast night I heard the man singing again this time at  midnight And I refused to leave my bed and look out there not wanting to see that shadowed figure shambling by moving many steps ahead in the matter of seconds I figured it was all in my mind that it would go away if I just ignore it Thats when I heard the creak of one of my floorboards at the end of my bedI sat bolt upright and could see the shadow standing at the foot of my bed Its darkness seemed to stand out much bolder than the darkness of the room a silent silhouette of a man who just stood there and said nothing for a while I was too afraid to move or to call out to my sister who was asleep in the nezt room I just stared at the figure barely breathing waiting for it to move or flinchIn a voice that was deep and demonic it sang out Where did you come from CottonEye JoeAt that moment I lost my shit and began to scream as I flipped out of my bed and hit the floor with a huge thump I began to crawl my way towards the door of my room but that thing it grabbed my ankle and began pulling me back towards it I kicked flailed around on the floor and cried out No no no no Let me goMy sister burst into the roomflipping on the lights her eyes wild and her voice wavering Whats happening The shadow man was gone and I broke out into tears still very afraid but so relieved that it wasnt there anymore After some moments of hysterical sobbing I was able to tell my sister what had happened I thin this time she believed meI dont know if the whole thing was just a horrible nightmare or if Im somehow hallucinating However that grab from the shadow man felt a lot real I can still feel the memory of that grip on my ankle a rough and cold hand that eagerly wanted to pull me in towards it I cant sleep with the light off now,Cotton Eyed Shadow,27,nosleep,top_week

soaked through the covers moistened my legs and cooled by the time I decided to move The clock read Too Early I had slept for nearly sixteen hours Whatever Once my mouth was rinsed and the bedding had been bundled up and tossed in the laundry room I padded into the main living room to watch infomercialsDad was up at six I didnt notice him until he slumped back into the couch beside me He was the first to speakMorning he said quietlyMm I agreedHow long have you been upSince fourI came in to check on you several times Looked like you were having nightmaresYeahYou were crying Tossing and turning I tried to wake you up He pulled up the sleeve of his robe to show me some scratches You uh thought I was a bad guyMy eyes misted up as I drew my knees up to my chest Words began to spill out Im sorry Dad cut me off Shh Its fine I know you didnt mean itHis voice was so gentle The authoritarian figure that had watched over me with a stern gaze was gone The fierce strength behind his eyes was broken and this man had no fire left All at once the protectve shell of numbness cracked and shattered I wanted my daddy Without a word I crawled over and laid my head on his shoulder Two weeks ago this act would have been inconceivable Two weeks ago Leanna was alive Some shred of rational thought in the back of my head noted with muted shock that the roles we had played every day were nothing more than an artificial construct an act we played out every dayDad wrapped me up in his arms and we cried together until I lost track of time altogether Inevitably the tears stopped flowing though neither of us made a move away from the other for another hour Who was left to prop the two of us up but each other We sat watching infomercials one after the other neither of us really caring for anything but the hypnotic power of the glowing screenMy stomach growled I remembered that I hadnt eaten In the same breath I realized that my head was pounding I clutched at my stomachEggs okay my dad murmuredI nodded still bent overDad lifted his arm from my shoulders and stood up In the span of that motion the weight fell on his shoulders again and he walked slowly to the kitchenI scarfed down the eggs unceremoniously and thanked my dad After that I retired to my room and spent most of the day at my writing desk staring at a blank sheet of paper I took regular breaks to stare out the window at the trees waving in the windEventually the sun sank below the treeline and I began nodding As I did my heart skipped a beat Would I wake up tomorrow tangled in the sheets fearing that unknown terror at my heelsIn the end I told myself that it was irrelevant Sleep is inevitable I still couldnt shake the feeling of impending doom that I might face that terror again As I slipped under the covers I cast about in my mind looking for anything to ease my fear A memory came of a lady in silver The dream I had when I was little Suddenly I missed that lady I couldnt recall her face but the feeling she brought with her was clear as day when I thought about it She made me feel safe protected warmTears leaked from between my closed eyelids I missed my mom I missed my sister I wished I could dream of that lady just one more time Nothing was more important I dwelt on her memory and the aching desire for that little bit of relief spread through my body until I craved her like a starving girl that smelled pizzaI fell asleep thinking of nothing else And then I woke upShe was standing at the edge of my bed and she was beautiful an angel wrought in the finest purest of silver And I didt hurt I stared at her and she was beautiful and she returned my gaze a quizzical look on her perfect face And she was beautiful Her hair and gown flowed behind her in slow motion defying gravity She opened her mouth as if to speak then closed it and paused and lowered her gaze Her eyes drifted back up to me and Can you see me Her voice was the choir of heaven the sweet whispers of a thousand mothers cooing at their newborn children It echoed through time and space it echoed within my mind and my heart lifted up higher higher until the echoes died away I found myself smiling tears of joy misting my vision blurring it into a shine of silver against the darkness of my roomI could only nodYou can understand me Her accent was stilted as though she was deaf I got the feeling that speech was mostly unnecessary for herI collapsed as the sorrows heartbreaks and betrayals of my past bled from my soul all at once A moment later I was at peace I sat up in a fluid motion turning to the silver lady before meYes I was hoping Id dream of you Im so glad youre hereThis is no dreamI laughed How could this be anything elseI do not know But I promise No dreamI considered this for a time while the lady waited motionless save for her gown and hair Some part of me knew that nothing this apparition would tell me would ever be a lie Nevertheless  Alright Ill just stay up all night then That should make it pretty obvious I grew serious Will you stay with me Can anybody else see youYou called me Not sure how Usually death calls me But no one will die here I dont understand You know death You should not see me nowMy jaw would have been hanging open except I seemed incapable of registering surprise that could overpower the warmth radiating from the ethereal lady in front of me As it was I responded Hmm a sound less consideration than contentedness Well what are you I said after a lengthy pause She responded with a pause of her own dropping her gaze and softly stroking her chin And then I felt a whisper in my mind the gentlest touch of wind as something made its way inside Her eyes lit up and I felt her happiness She could communicate without speaking I suddenly knew and this way was much faster more precise I tried to think back at her and she didnt respond A look of confusion passed across my face and then I understood that Id have to project myself back for twoway communication Telepathy wasnt nearly overpowering as the sound of her voice or maybe I didnt have anything left inside me to soothe and fix I realized that I had a thousand questions and we began to converse to an observer it would appear as though I was having half a phone conversation I can only summarize our exchangeShe didnt seem to know what or who she was She had no name She simply popped into existence one dayWhats your earliest memoryDarkskinned brutish people in caves A woman being raped while her child watched A fleeting moment blurred before her world became darkness a state she termed sleepHoly shitShe came and went and sometimes she was in many places at once Rarely she was everywhere The last time that happened she described lots of people starving or shooting at each other Patches on shirts and overcoats triangles and stars The holocaust She was everywhere thenHoly shitMy jaw was in fact hanging open now You were everywhere In the entire universeNo not the entire universe Just the earthThe oceans too All the landNo Only where there were peopleWhy do I feel so much better when youre aroundShe shrugged lines of sadness creasing her face like cracks in polished diamond The tragedy of her expression threatened to break my heart as though I was watching a snake eat a kitten Suddenly I saw myself as a child myself and my mother I knew this to be the last time I would see my mom alive The silver lady was embracing her weeping tears like liquid pearl I could see a swirling darkness surrounding the two of them there but not there The more closely I examined the miasma with this second sight the more sinister it became I began to see through it as though it was a portal to another dimension of gnashing swirling teeth and rotting flesh I felt a cold alien intelligence invade my mind and then I was a bug under a microscope My mind was aflame with pain and disgust pushing through the dull opiate warmth of the ladys protection The demonic thing was plotting yearning and I could taste its desire with my own tongue My vision began to fade to black and I was immersed in inky singleminded hatred of unfathomable depth Time lost its meaning and then I was back in my room unsure if a second had passed or a centuryThe lady nodded filling my mind with her own and I understood I had seen the hunger in the world a faceless timeless entity whose only purpose is to consume and destroy And before me stood the force of lightDawn broke through my windowThe introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroductionPart

Manifestationshttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrxtthesilverladypartmanifestations Part  SpiritshttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrcvthesilverladypartspiritsI remember a story arc in Greys Anatomy where the ghost of a doctors dead lover followed her around and only she could see it Thats when I stopped watching the seriesI was eating cereal watching reruns of Scooby Doo I couldnt recall cereal ever tasting better and I couldnt recall Scooby Doo ever being so entertaining But thats how it goes when the embodiment of good is sitting beside you on the couch giggling musically at the television Today was a day of firsts for the both of us Dad walked in at some point looking haggard as I had ever seen him His eyebrows shot up when he saw me curled up on the couch neatly groomed and with color in my cheeks I gave him a halfsmile equal parts enthusiasm and sympathy Make no mistake I hadnt forgotten my sisters death but no therapy on earth could have matched the aura of the silver lady I stood up smoothly walked the three paces across the living room and wrapped him in the biggest hug I could muster He was apparently speechless but when I looked up at him I saw that the worry lines around his eyes had softened a littleI reflexively looked back over my shoulder at the silver lady and she expressed her joy at my desire to comfort my dad I smiled at her and then glanced back at my dad who was looking at me quizzically now I brushed my hair back over my shoulder and smiled at him againWere going to be okay DadHe only nodded and wandered off He had taken time away from work to grieve and so he had not even dressed himself In the silence that followed I looked around I had to laugh and then I was shocked at the inappropriateness of my laughter Sitting on the couch was a ghost that only I could see a ghost that magically took away all my pain and trouble Yeah I must have snapped Two deaths was one too many My laughter had drawn the ladys attention She looked at me and frowned a little I shook my head at her incredulous and turned away Things like this didnt just happen to peopleI was grateful though at least I didnt get the ghost of deathly melancholy or something There wasnt much of an earthly nature that could upset me with her around That and the fact that I had an entire day to kill considered I decided I might as well make the best of it Everyone grieves in their own way I suppose Jurassic Park was showing and I figured Id go see it The movie wasnt for several hours though and so I grabbed up my things and went for pancakes at IHOP The silver lady sat across from me and I couldnt help but laugh The entire restaurant was going about its business and yet here sat a figure so obviously paranormal as to be hokey like a ghost bride her hair and gown blowing in a wind that only she could feel She noticed my disdain and expressed a mild indignance within my mind I shrugged it off and asked her what she could expect from me but quickly shut my mouth and looked around when I realized that I looked like a total schizophrenicI still had an hour to kill after breakfast so I decided to spend off some of my allowance though it had been meagre from week to week I had saved up almost a thousand dollars over my sheltered years I drove down main street and visited several little boutiques built into the slightlyrenovated shells of old department stores and hotels from the towns conception way back at the turn of the century Several tops caught my eye and the lady waited patiently as I tried each one I asked her what she thought of them from time to time but she didnt seem to have an eye for clothes having probably worn the same ghost dress for hundreds of millenia I was just wrapping up at the last store preparing to break another fifty dollar bill when a little girl in front of me in line turned aroundShe smiled wide and began tugging on the hem of her moms skirtMommy MommyWhat is it honey the woman asked a little exasperated but apparently feeling indulgentShes so pretty mommyThe mother looked at me and smiled and I smiled back Yes shes very pretty hon Now come on weve got to get to the bank She halfwalked halfdragged the girl out of the store the girls eyes were locked back over her shoulder that cheesy grin still on her faceI would have felt flattered except the child wasnt looking at me She was looking five feet to my left Right where the silver lady was standing My heart dropped right onto my stomachA sense of surprisingly smug satisfaction filtered through my mind simultaneously with a surge of grief and longing Satisfied though she may have been about my reaction the silver lady desperately wanted to follow the girl Suddenly I was along for the ride as the silver ladys desires became my own in our shared headspace I paid quickly at the checkout counter and trailed along behind the mother and daughter as though in a daze We walked out into the sunlight and I sneezed as my eyes adjusted Their car was parked twenty paces from the storeBy the time I had halved the distance between us they were pulling out And then shrapnel was everywhere I dropped to the ground reflexively and was peppered with safety glass Truly in a daze now I staggered to my feet and wandered it felt towards the smoking ruin in front of me Their little blue sedan was wrapped around an old steel truck I walked up to the passenger side window got as close as I could despite the truck and felt a warm breeze blow past me The silver lady was in the car then embracing the husk of what had just been an adorable baby girlBlood trickled from every orifice in her head Her skull had split open from front to back stretching her face oddly and she was staring vaguely off into the distance blinking outofsync one eye and then the other A couple arterial spurts sprayed the chrome bumper of the truck One moment there was a girl fighting for life and the next there was a lifesized gory mannequinI never got used to that part when life leaves the body the body ceases to be a person and becomes a shell inanimate as though it never breathed or laughed or ate or drankSound returned to the world and I heard choking gurgling screams Oh my god oh god no my baby oh god no My legs went out from under me I sat down hard on pavement kicked my legs until I bumped softly against the curb The silver lady was crying againI dont know how long I sat there but the next thing I knew the street was lit up with red and blue lights The din of sirens was crashing through my skull I was nearest the crash when it happened and so I had to give a statement I must have done well enough at it because the police let me go with the promise that I come in later to write everything out The driver of the pickup was clearly drunk and he must have been going twenty over the speed limit I made my way back into the boutique with stuttered steps and asked for a phone My dad was there in ten minutes flatI stared out the window blankly all the way home held aloft solely by the presence of the silver lady Dad tried to get me to speak several times but his words were a dull chatter in the back of my mind I closed my eyes as the tears began to roll down my cheeks I curled up inside myself and felt a welling spring of warmth rise inside of me as the tightness lifted from my chest I fled into it covering myself with the warming blanket of the silver ladys loving embrace like a child afraid of the dark I breathed deep and opened my eyes My gaze was drawn down to my own body My skin had taken on a silverwhite glow and an opalescence like polished marbleI glanced over at my dad wondering if he was seeing this My heart skipped a beat as I took in the dark sicklyhued vapor sticking to his skin like lake fog on a cold morningSarah Sarah what is it he asked seeing my face tight with shock and alarm His voice was jarring I could hear new and unfamiliar tones of worry and sadness layered within it But I couldnt respond I was busily looking around at the world which had taken on an alien cast The flora radiated crystalline hues and the sky boiled with color like something alive I could see the air itself buzzing with activityThis is the true world I thought to myself in a voice wholly not my own We seem to have  merged I felt my inner eye flipping through my memories and thoughts like the pages of a book each moment replayed and recast in the new light of a foreign perspective Simultaneously I felt my mind open to a tome of memories not my own as though a hidden eye within me had opened for the first time So much suffering so much death I was a failure For aeons I had tried to stem the tide of pain and misery that ran rampant across the earth like a plague but all my efforts amounted to a drop in the oceanI was being shaken My mouth tasted of ozone Dad had stopped the car and I realized I was doubled over and screaming Dad was near hysterics trying to get a response from me My voice shaky and otherworldly inside my skull said Sick  stomach Home Please take me homeThe introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroductionPart

funnyguy,2,5,1r3dcj,13,When I was younger may family moved around a lot  One of the places that we lived in was a town in New Jersey  We were only there for about  year but the events that occurred will leave a lasting mark on me for a life time  In order to protect the identity of people names will be changedDuring the summer when I was around the age of  my family moved to New Jersey  Upon moving I quickly befriended my neighbor James  James and I began hanging out a lot and soon he started introducing me to some of his friends  I soon became friends with these people and joined their little friend group of   Pretty soon school started up again and I began meeting fellow class mates  I made a few new friends but I mostly stuck with James and those peopleOne day during school I left class to go to the bathroom  Upon entering I noticed that someone had clogged the sink with paper towels and turned on the water  Luckily I got there before the water started flooding over so I turned it off cleaned up the sink and went about with my business  When I got back to class I told Henry one of the people in my friend group about what someone had did  He began to chuckle and told me I was funny  I asked what he meant and he turned to me looking confused  He asked Wait you dont know  I said I didnt know what he was talking about and he told me he would explain after schoolAt the end of the day I went to go meet Henry so that he could explain to me what he was talking about  I walked outside and saw James Henry and Tim the other member of the group waiting for me  I asked what was going on and they said they would explain  They told me that about  years after the school was built before any of us were born a boy had been killed in the bathroom that I had used earlier  They told me that he was being bullied and the bullies thought it would be funny to give the kid a swirly a swirly is where you hang a kid upside down put his head into the toilet and then flush it  Any way what the bullies did not expect to happen was the kid to drown  The bullies thought he was just being a pussy so they left him on the ground  The body was later discovered later in the day when another kid went to use the bathroom and saw that he was not breathing  The bullies got into some huge shit and were expelled and got into some trouble with the law  After that there had been strange occurrences of toilets or sicks being clogged strange noises being heard toilets flushing on their own or even for some people seeing a little boy soaking wet standing in the middle of the bathroom  The school had been putting it off as tricksters trying to scare younger kids but people honestly believed what they saw  At the end of the story I told my friends that they were bull shitting me but when they kept trying to convince me so I got frustrated and went homeThe next day in the school the guys were still on me about the whole murdered kid and how he haunts the bathroom  I didnt believe a word of it and started to get really mad at them  We got into a fight and I didnt speak with any of them for a while  About a month after our fight Henry left to go use the bathroom  He was gone for  minutes and the teacher asked me to go check up on him  I agreed and left go see what was wrong  I walked into the bathroom and saw no sign of Henry but only a small puddle of water on the ground  I figured that this was just some elaborate trick that the guys had set up to try and scare me  I started saying out loud Really funny Henry but you can come out now cause what ever youre trying to do is not working  Thats when I heard a slight whimper coming from one of the stalls  I opened it to find Henry curled up in a ball on the ground soaking wet  I knelt down and started shaking him and yelling for him to get up but all he did was lay there whimpering and slightly rocking back and forthI ran to go get a teacher and then brought her back to the bathroom  When we arrived Henry was no longer curled up in a ball but now standing up in front of one the mirrors just staring into it  The teacher ran over and asked what was wrong but he just stood there staring  She started to pull him away and he look at her and said NoI need to stayhe told me to staythat im going to join him  The teacher asked who told him to stay and then after another second of silence Henry burst into tears and said The boythe boy tolled me  For about the next week Henry did not show up in school and James Tim and I got worried so we went to visit him at home  When we got there his mother answered the door and when we asked how he was she said that all he does is stay up in his room and when ever they asked him to leave his face changed and he said he was to afraid  We went up to see him and when we got up there all he did was look up at us and then look back down at the floor  We asked how he was doing and he didnt answer  After a few minutes of silence Tim blurted out So what happened Henry  James and both gave him a nasty look and he just shrugged  Henry looked up at us and said that he saw him  We asked what he was talking about and he said he saw the boy  That they had stared at each other for about  minutes before the boy started walking towards him saying that he had to stay with him and join him  Henry started to back away but that only angered the boy as he lunged at Henry  Henry said that he was all of the sudden drowning in the toilet and he heard his name called and so he sat up and then collapsed to the floor  I then entered the stall and tried to get him and the rest we already knew  We all sat there in silence before with out a word got up and leftHenry stopped coming to school and after a few months we heard that he had moved away  We stopped talking about him because we refused to believe what he had told us  As the school year came to a close my parents informed me that we were moving again  I was upset because I would be leaving my friends but also slightly relived  I stayed in touch with James and Tim but over the years we grew apart and the whole long distance thing stopped working  The last I had spoke to them they said that they hadnt seen or spoke to Henry since that day we all went to see him  I hadnt seen Henry either but to be fare I was purposely trying to avoid him  I grew up and one day while reading the paper I saw a story about a man who had drowned in his own home  His name was Henry Goldmen  I figured that this couldnt be the Henry that I knew so long ago  But there is still apart of me that wonders that maybe Henry was telling the truth and maybe what ever tried to kill him the first time waited years before trying again but this time it succeeded  ,The little boy in the bathroom,18,nosleep,top_week

Marksman,3,3,1rftnd,12,Have you ever looked in a mirror and you were a little off put by your expression Or looked at yourself in the mirror and realized that the person looking back at you is youI walked beside my friend and as we walked we talked I cant remember what we talked about but all I remember is this bland superficial conversation about nothing in particular Conversations like these bothered me they didnt seem real to me just like sounds verbal things that hold no real meaning And as I thought about our conversation I wanted to make it more real for me to give our little talk some depth and just before I asked her a meaningful question I tripped I startled awake rubbed my eyes glanced at the clock but the time didnt register in my head I realized that I needed to go the the bathroom I shuffled over dragging my feet to be sure I didnt trip or stub my toe flicked on the lights squinting from the brightness relieved myself and turned on the faucet I ran my hands under the cool water threw some water on my face picked up the towel and wiped my face off As my eyes adjusted to the light I looked at myself in the mirror and my reflection was smiling at meI considered that I may have been dreaming or hallucinating but my cold damp hands and the pain of the bright light was all too real I did what I would usually do when in this sort of disbelief and rubbed my eyes some more hoping I was still just a bit drowsy But nothing changed I looked at myself and was quite curious I felt my face with my hand to see if I was actually smiling It certainly didnt feel like it Normally this would creep the hell out of me I would on any other occasion scream or run away but I just stared at the reflection looking into my eyes as if they werent mine A genuine happiness I havent felt that way in far too long I felt calm But suddenly as though something dropped to the ground the feeling of calm had broken like a shattering vase a feeling welled up inside me A tightness in my chestLike someone had just punched me it was one of a gurgling frustration I would be happy if it werent for this stupid house things are constantly broken and this wretched family it all torments me every day of my life Thats when I heard the voice of my father from couple days earlier Because I said so the words resonated in my mind I could feel my teeth gritting the sound made my skin crawl but the reflection just kept smiling backtaunting me The shrill sound of my mothers voice beckoned in a continuous annoying ringing in my earI shook my head to clear my thoughts but the ringing was still there I peered over at the clock and looked at the time    Its lateI couldnt possibly sleep now I was simply too stressed I had school tomorrow but I had to deal with thisLet me sleep I muttered half to myself half to the voices and that face in the mirror This was when I noticed the mirror had stopped reflecting my actions and just was a still image of myself smiling I became angry at this point What is wrong with you I said to it hoping it would stop Just go the hell away I growled through my teeth Feeling rather violent I stared back into my eyes trying to counteract that incessant grin with my anger No Its mouth didnt form the words but the sound just streamed out of it The ringing got louder and louder I tried to cover my ears but it felt like it was coming from inside my head the voices began circling me and taunting me and that terrible ringing Then it all just stopped Was it over I just wanted to go to sleep so I could continue my broken life It started laughing a laugh that sounded unmistakably like my voice But it was a sound I had never made before a sound like true laughter this was new to me It bothered me I was envious Why cant I experience that kind of happiness He bothered meI had enough The voices all faded away but the mirror kept smiling STOP I yelled as I punched the mirror the blood was quick to run down my arm and the few pieces of mirror were stuck in my hand I could feel them scaping at the bone The remnants of the mirror on the wall reflected nothing but my angry scowl and bloodied arm I stared at my hand It didnt hurt but I could lightly see the reflection of my own face in the bloodied shards It still smiled IT STILL SMILED NO I slammed my hand against the counter the blood spilled all over the room on my shirt and faceAnd so it happened Blake had snappedthough In his own mind he was trappedBroken and confused he wanted to dieBut all he could do was simply cryThe lights flicked off his mother shrieked in the other roomscared as though she could feel her impending doomHis father had been up all night drinkingWhile Blake was pondering and thinkingThe sound of the window outside smashingrang in his mind terrifying echoed the crashingNOW OF ALL TIMES Blake shouted furiouslyWe enter Blakes house to a horrid scenethe smell of blood nothing was cleanThe sanctity of his mind and house violatedwith adrenaline and fear his pupils dilatedSprinting to the kitchen he grabbed a toola knife very sharp for he was no foolNot afraid to risk his life with nothing to live forThis life And the criminal he did abhorCreeping through the house to find the thiefHe heard a loud scream though very briefIn his parents room he finds the two mangled corpses the floor already soaked in blood His parents had been completely mutilated each had been stabbed numerous times now slumped on the floor eyes still open A figure stood overtop the lifeless corpses that were once his parents hunched over with a bloody knife in hand the tall man was half visible in the moonlight that came through the window His skin fair and pale his face was itself a conundrum it was an inexplicable quality His face looked off Like an optical illusion where all you can do is stare and ponder His fingers were skinny the joints looked massive in comparison He looked almost inhuman but he was unmistakably a man Awkward echoed in my mind perhaps for lack of a better word as he edged toward meYou didnt I said to himYoure welcome I stated in a soft warm voiceto Blake who accepted my words without much choiceI followed him back to the kitchen as he put the knife downThe blood dripped from his hair as heavy as a crown Its done its over He quietly muttered to himselfWe can sleep now He put the knife on the shelfI climbed back out the window never there was a messas Blake walked he had no more stressHis house unviolated but his mind still taintedto this new life he will never be acquaintedMy wits came back to me Cold blood streamed down my arms I walked calmly to the bathroom and looked at the cracked and bloody mirror the counter was a mess Between the cracks I see my face depressed Sad to the point of a complete bleak The frown That was more like it That makes more sense to me no longer that disgusting smile I saw a tear on his face It was of blood Feeling around on my face I felt a drop of blood Blood on my face Then I felt something that I did not expect A smile My mind twisted Reality as I knew it broken demented distorted I looked again at my hand The shards of glass still glistened in the light even covered in blood I saw a piece of bone fractured I glanced again at the clock  When did that happen I said as recollections of what had just happened streamed back into my mind Did I wake up my parents when I hit the mirror Then reality hit me in a particularly cruel mannerFor a moment dead silenceMOM DAD I yelled as I sprinted across the house into their room There they lay Bloody and mangled bodies multiple stab wounds on both of them in the torso the chest the legs the knees even the faceI hugged them soaked in their still warm blood Yelling at the top of my lungs IM SO SORRY IM SO SORRY Like a pin dropping the tick of the clock in their room brought me to how real this wasBut only one thought reverberated in my mind This is going to totally ruin my day After about  minutes the blood grew cold and the corpses began feeling rather stale I walked around their room looking for my next days lunch money and as I was walking out I slipped in a pool of blood With a loud crash I continued to lay on the floor for quite some time I silently muttered to myselfDammit now I need to get some new clothesI began pacing toward my room taking off my shirt frustrated by this inconvenience I threw it on the floor and it made a sloshing sound Maybe I can wash it My mother had done my wash up until now I took a shower and put on some new clothes Clean at last I walked back into my parents room I stared a little while Maybe  or  hours It was so Peaceful This shouldve happened a long time agoWhen I remembered that it was time for bed I began laughing Laughing as I never had before in my life Overjoyed More genuine than any laugh I have ever had Time for bed I dont have a bedtime anymore No one to yell at me No one to tear my mind apart I laughed and laughed until I heard my alarm clock go off in my room Oh time for school I said with a grin on my faceBut without my parents here to test me this was no raceMe This house was now my place Im here

Dectrek,2,4,1rbx7r,13,All my life I have never believed in luck Its just some stupid phrase coined from the minds of jealous or selfabsorbed people saying Arent I the greatest I just won  off the lottery Im so lucky or Can you believe that he just won  grand off the lottery that son of a gun Now just because I think that luck is a bunch of crap doesnt mean that I gamble Oh I gamble alright I gamble until Im rich and drunk at the same time Ive been to Vegas with my friends Ron Jerry and Max a ton of times and they always say Wow Rob youre so lucky and Ill either ignore them or Ill be too drunk to hear them I was addict when it came to gambling but one night that all changedIt was another Vegas trip with the guys I had lied to my company telling them that I was going on a business trip and they had completely bought it I even was able to use company money to pay for the trip We checked into our hotel room and decided that tonight we were going to live like there was no tomorrow I played craps until I was running low on money so I went to the blackjack table and counted cards until I was well funded for the rest of the night We drank and we drank and we drank until we could barely see anymore I started to black out so we went to the streetsNow the next events were blurry and I dont remember all of it I think what happened was that my friends were telling me that I lucked out at blackjack when one of them said something about me cheating I got all offended and started taking hits at him and I think we got in a fight Next thing I knew I was in an alley and was starting to black out probably not such a good idea to have had that much to drink and thats when every turned blackThis is when it happened First everything was dark and I couldnt feel anything but then I heard voices They were cheering all around me that sounded like something exciting was happening and then I got the sense of feeling back I was lying on my back and there were voices all around me cheering as if it was a football game Then the lights went upI was blinded at first but as my eyes adjusted to the light I saw thousands of people sitting in stand around a stage that I was on I was laying a colorful wheel something you would see on the wheel of fortune and I couldnt get up Beyond the crowed was darkness and the only light came from a huge light bulb that was about  yards from where I was laying A man was standing on the stage and was holding a microphoneLadies and gentlemen please give a warm welcome too our next contestant Rob JohnsonThe crowd went wild and the wheel started to spin slowly at first but it gained speed quickly I was beginning to feel sick when I heard Jerry press the button when youre ready and the wheel began to slow down As it slowed I heard the man on the stage yell Lets see how luck our contestant is too which the crowed started to yell out colors that they thought the wheel would land on The wheel stopped on the color green and the crowd screamed with joy All around the room the color green was shown with the words Bad luck on them I was deeply confused when I heard Well it looks like Rob wasnt too lucky stay tuned for our next contestant too which I blacked outI woke up at the hotel in bed where I instantly began to contemplate what happened during the night I came to the conclusion that it was all just a dream and that my friends found me in the alley that I passed out in They had driven me back to the hotel where I slept the rest of the night away and was now waking up from a drunken dream Ron came into the room where they asked me if I was ok and what I was doing in that alley too which I replied that I just had had one too many drinks They gave me some water and then told me to get ready for breakfast The rest of the day was ok up until we went back to the casino at night I was losing my fortune at craps again so I thought I would count cards at Blackjack again to refund my lossesMy count revealed that the next card too be thrown was going to be a four and I had  points on the table He had thrown  aces kings queens jacks  and so on and so until  to which he had only thrown three I knew that there was no possible way that I could lose so I went all in He picked up the next card and laid it on the table and what I saw I couldnt believe He had laid down the ace of spades which I distinctly remembered getting three games ago I just sat there in disbelief as he ranked in all of my moneyI ran to the atm and took  dollars out of my account and ran back to the blackjack table where I counted cards until that was all I could think about but every time my calculations revealed what the next card was It was always a card that made me go over  I kept running to the atm and running back to the blackjack table but I always lost My bank account was swept clean that night all of the money that I had worked hard for year after year was taken away from me in a few hoursRon Jerry and Max all said that it was just bad luck but I couldnt believe what happened that night It had been a terrible night but not as bad as what happened when I feel asleepI was back on the wheel and everything was exactly the same as the night before except I got a new color This time I landed on purple which lit up the room with the word Truth When I woke up it was the next day and my friends came in and brought me too breakfast That day my company found out I lied to them about the trip when all of my bank account money disappeared and I was fired The bill for the trip was sent to me but I knew I wouldnt be able to pay for it That night I was back on the wheel being spun again for a new colorThis continued for ten days each brought a new horror such as pain or divorce to which I was beaten up by some muggers and then divorced by my wife On the eleventh night I was standing on the stage with the man holding the microphone Lets give it up for Rob Johnson everyone The man yelled and the crowd went wild I was ushered off the stage and was taken into a room with the guy who had the microphoneNice job Mr Johnson He said The crowd loved youWhat was that I asked I demand you tell me at once what is going onOh Im sorry you must be very confused Im Chris Armstrong and I run this show You see whenever someone new comes along we take the number of big sins that that person had committed in the past  hours and we have them face the wheel and its consequences that many times You had  total major sins in that past day so you faced the wheel ten times You sure put a show on for the audienceSins I askedOh yes you committed theft gambling murder you name it You cheated at blackjack you became drunk you beat up a few people and you committed more theft We havent seen a suspect like you for a whileI dont remember anything like that I snapped at himThats probably because you were drunk when most of it happened Dont worry though youll have plenty of opportunities to make up for them laterThis is when a thought occurred to me he said I committed murder but I didnt remember doing or who I did it tooWait who did kill I asked suspiciously You dont know I thought it would have occurred to you by now Lets see if I can make you realize who You got into a fight with him after you left the casino You hurt him pretty bad and in your drunkenness you killed him When he came here we thought that instead of making him face the wheel why not have him push the button that stops the wheel from spinning It was an attraction that brought in a larger crowd than usualThats when I remembered him saying Push the button when youre ready Jerry and how I had gotten into a fight with one of my friends about me cheating at blackjackI killed Jerry I asked in horror but then a new though came into my mind Wait if Jerry is dead and he pressed the button to stop the wheel then does that mean ImYes you are dead Chris said as if he knew exactly what I was about to ask You died of alcohol poisoning when you passed out in the alley The past  days have been a simulation Mr Johnson welcome to HellLucky me,Lucky Me,17,nosleep,top_week

TreasureHouseofDoom,16,62,1r396v,12,Channeling Aunt Lucias strength and wit remarkable as both had always been I felt myself fortified for what lay ahead but that didnt mean I was completely unafraid  Fear and anxiety are nearly interchangeable in certain situations and shedding them completely is not always the wisest approach  Composure maintained I dealt now with redirecting the bases of these emotions into something productive and controllable  I remembered my mothers fearlessness the way she seized every opportunity to create and do good the inner power she exuded This I channeled too  Sisters in unison one living and one passed on to strengthen me I was sure I carried now a shield of sorts  Across the miles as if she knew the battle I faced I could almost hear my mother say Keep your head up Julianne  Stay focused  Do good work  This was her mantra and as far as I knew it had never failed herLaughter rose from the study again and I was about to step through the door open myself to the onslaught when I caught the fragrance of chocolate on the air warm wafts from just beyond the door from the foyer to the hall  I heard the voices of children conversation and giggling just beyond that too  Instinct told me this is where I was needed most  Dulcie wanted me to follow her into the study and in her realm there was no telling what might happen but Marys presence was just ahead of me and it was possible I would have the opportunity to observe more of the events that had led to terrible schism between friendsDoors shut and power out the hall was dark and the musty odor of rooms not allowed to breathe hung in the air  I tried but couldnt recall if I had smelled this odor the night before  The chill and dank fragrance felt captive too as if I were stepping into some forgotten time and place  It was completely possible that I was that I had discovered some portal that Mary had provided one  Passing doors I heard the sounds of the once living in other spaces the turn of a music box in a nursery the zip and knock of a trestlepowered sewing machine probably a Singer like the one my mother used as a plant stand at home the coos of a baby and the lullaby her Mama sang  These memories vital and vibrant empowered me too  There was good energy about this place and I allowed it to circulate now through me  Three doors I passed to either side and I was just about to open the door to the kitchen when a fourth door to the right opened slightly  Through the slim space provided I heard the singsong voice of Dulcie coy and friendly beckon Wont you come play with us Julianne In the background the festive tones of a calliope rose and fell and I found myself reminded suddenly of a wonderful memory from my childhood  My siblings and I had been treated to a day at the North Carolina State Fair where my mother had introduced us to a man she knew from antiques auctions  Hed shown us the most glorious old calliope and hed had a real pet monkey named Clayton the Scoundrel  These are the old tricks of angry spirits to tease some memory out of us exploit and make it vile distract good people from good works  I knew this but I longed too for simpler days days when my sister brothers and I were among familiar people in a familiar place days when we were too young and innocent to recognize the darkness in others  Julianne familiar voice from the kitchen prevailed and as I reached for the cool brass doorknob I knew immediately whom I would find on the other side  Aunt Lucia tears stung my eyes but joy filled my heart  Three years she had been gone on the other side only her voice to guide me so much more than most others ever had again of a loved one but now she stood in front of me poised pretty powerful  Emanating from her in golden beams was the very energy she had radiated in life How can this beAunt Lucias smile was warm invitation into the kitchen  Forgive me but I worried you wouldnt get the fudge just right And she laughed at me as others of our family often did  I was neither a baker nor a cook but she is a Kook my sister might have saidThese young ladies have just introduced me to Vassar fudge And now I saw Mary at the island in Seths ultra swank kitchen measuring out white sugar  Across from her stood Dulcie her expression perplexedMiss Lucia wouldnt it all be better with more sugar and perhaps a little more cream she asked but Aunt Lucia only laughed sweetlyWell Sweet Dulcie she began as if she had known Dulcie Moseley for years why dont you tell me  Isnt it a Moseley who sent this recipe to you from Vassar and didnt she help to invent this sweet confection Aunt Lucia had such a way with children always  Never ask a yes or no question she had often told me Always engage a child  If necessary be wrong so that they may be right I remembered this as she winked at me over Dulcies golden headWell no Maam My Aunt Mae did send this but she isnt a Moseley shes a Baker on my mothers side and she and Mary burst into laughter as if her aunts being a Baker who sends fudge recipes was just about the funniest thing theyd ever heardOr she could be a Boiler or a Cook Mary giggled  I watched in some awe as the two girls exchanged looks of pure love deep respect and as my Aunt mitigated whatever memory might endanger this momentary union Now she turned to me expression earnest voice so soft I practically had to read her lips to understand her words Mary is a pip and an angel but theres deep sorrow about her and Dulcie really is a sweet girl good and kind but the anger that rages in her spirit is pure fire You must handle this all very carefully cautiously and you mustnt lose either your temper or your controlThis was the way of the women in my family  Always theyd presume that the younger women were ready for anything too that we could accomplish anything we set our minds to that our minds over mattersathand would sufficeHow did I get myself into this mess I said out loud and Aunt Lucia raised finely sculpted eyebrows as if to ask You mean you dont know and suddenly I was reminded of the walk through the cemetery the prank gone too far the Ouija board Id promised my mother Id never usedHow you came to be in the middle of this is no longer the issue What matters is how you plan to get yourself out And her insistence that I must disengage myself only after my promise to Mary was satisfied was implicit  There really was no other way  Now she only mouthed without even a hint of whisper Dont bring home any hitchhikers and I understood her warning  There are people who live their lives under the shadows of dark sad spirits hitchhikers who will never find their paths home To be under such shadow would be detriment not only to me but also to anyone who loved meBut what do I do I asked Aunt Lucia  And perhaps some answer would have come if only I had been strong enough to hold this lively memory open longer  Instead I felt the collapse of these exhausted spirits in front of me and in moments the vision in the kitchen they had never known had faded  Only red and black trim against the swank white and stainless of the kitchen Seths mother had designed remained or so I thought at first but as I investigated more closely I found the buttery print of a childs right hand smudged where Dulcie had stood only moments before Moving closer to it I thought about tearing a paper towel from the roll that stood upright just beside the sink to press it down for some evidence of this impossible reality when suddenly it combusted to tiny flames and the sizzle against the stainless island carried the salty tingle of tearsThe nature of my gift is such that I cannot press spirits to reveal themselves and even if I could I dont believe I ever would  Instinct dictates that as little engagement as possible is always the best mode and its a rule by which I live my life whenever possible  But I knew Id have to take a more proactive stance to accomplish what we allMary Dulcie and Ineeded and for that Id have to examine the house I thought back to the night before almost literally decades ago considering the journey along which these girls had brought me and the things Seth had told me about the house  I knew for instance that his father had discovered a secret compartment in the study that old photos and tintypes had been stored in the tin handkerchief box found in the wardrobe that stood in his parents room that the hall was part of an elaborate addition to join the kitchen to the rest of the house and that the Ouija board was strictly taboo in the Jefferies household just as it would have been in mine I knew too that the kitchen was not built in  when the house had been and that the original kitchen must have stood just past the rock wall in the farthest portion of the back yard  I did not however know where the Ouija board had come from originally and now I wondered if it had been in the house when the Jefferies had moved in or if it had come into the house with themId have to go to the study to begin my investigation  The notion sickened and worried me but I gathered myself for the inevitable  My mother had long taught me that the most direct way to gain protection from spirits that might harm you was to go to the Big Guy himself  Some might laugh at this but faith was and still is much more than a crutch for me and anyone who believes in the fires of Hell must embrace the comforts of Heaven too  Opening the door to the study I pushed it open so that the door knob bounced lightly against a chair just to the left of it  Colder air pushed into the space right in front of me and I shivered as if I were outside in a snowstorm  Dulcie was here now I knew and she had been waiting for me  Our Father who art in Heaven I began voice bold and strong Hallowed be Thy name The chandelier above the Dr Jefferies broad mahoghany desk swayed slightly at first and then began to spin from the center reminding me of the whirlaround at the park Thy Kingdom Come Thy will be done And now Dulcie laughed with much more depth than a child might have cold echo of the anger that was eating away her soul interrupted to say Im not the Devil Julianne Im only a little girl afterallAnd I strengthened myself for the tantrum I felt welling in her On Earth as it is in HeavenLook at me Julianne And it was all I could do to not make direct eye contact with her but I did see that she was as pretty in what came close to flesh as she had been in the picture innocent and sweet looking and completely mesmerizing in her charming presentation If I had not known what I did if I could not recognize the hate that burned her from the inside out I would have reached to hold her stroked her golden ringlets played dolls or drawn with her just as I would have my own little sister but there was no denying the tenacious embers of her eyes even as I avoided contact with themGive us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us And now her laughter was maniacal sad and laughing all at the same timeForgive us our trespasses she mocked and who is the trespasser here The question hovered between us and then seemed to take on an energy all its own as the accessories on Dr Jefferies desk and the loose items throughout the room rose and began to spin as if convection of Dulcies anger moved themLead us not into Temptation I continued spirit emboldened with every word of the prayer I had known by heart ever since I had been a toddler but deliver us from EvilAnd Dulcies angry laughter swelled to a cackle that rattled the house but then it fell too as the little girl so consumed by anger became increasingly exhausted as I continued for Thine is the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory Forever and Ever AmenI knew the entities that had exploited Dulcies sorrow and loneliness were not dormant and would not give up so easily  Stronger now I added Dear Heavenly Father Give me strength for the challenges I face and cast all unkind mischievous or evil spirits from my presence  Wrap me in your loving arms to protect and fortify me  I ask these things in your name AmenAnd now the room became silent its energy subdued and the objects that had spun around me lowered then settled in relative proximity to where they had been to start  I breathed deep solace and was happy to find new warmth about the room and to detect the spicy scent of candles burned perhaps days ago in the air  For the time being this was a study almost like any other  Now I set my task to discovering its every secret free from interruption for awhileThank you for reading each of these parts that explain an amazing event in my life If you havent been following please find other portions at these
