horriddaydream,90,,174,1r338n,,670,"My mother left when I was four.
Normally, that wouldn't mean anything, but I suspected for a long time that the porcelain dolls were coming from her, like some pitiful little attempt to show me that she loved me. 

My father; he worked overtime to keep things going in the household even if it was just the two of us. His hands were always worn from working the machines at the shop and he slaved even more when he got home and had to make supper for himself and I, and go through my nightly routines before I hit the sack. I sometimes woke up in the middle of the night and he was still awake, cleaning a room in the house, and I thought to myself, ""This man is dedicated. Has to be awake in only a few hours…and here he is."" I love my father, and I always have.

One of his most trusted friends from high school, Alexander, was my babysitter from the time my mother left, to the time I was about seven years old. We trusted Alexander. He worked night shift and so he was able to work babysitting in around his hours, and he would have done anything to help out my father to make that work. My father paid him even though he asked for nothing; he said he was just 'doing his good deed', ""and I like it anyway!"" My dad used to come home from work and Alexander would pick up his bags full of toys that we played with; he always brought the best toys and trinkets with him. His daughter had passed away when she was ten years old, and I think it brought him great joy to now share her old toys with another little girl. He would say to my dad, ""She was great for me. She ate well, and she took her usual long nap. I'll be back tomorrow!"" And he always came back. 

Well, eventually times changed and my dad's work schedule changed with them. We didn't see Alexander anymore because we didn't NEED Alexander anymore. My father thought that they lost touch permanently and when I asked about him he told me truthfully that Alexander was a very busy man. And he understood that, and I did too. 

For my eighth birthday, the first porcelain doll arrived. It had beautiful, blonde curly hair and a painted on face. She was wearing what looked to be an expensive, velvet dress with an attached tutu. She came inside a stuffed envelope with nothing else on the package to identify who had sent her. Just my name, that was all. The first thing that my father did was call my grandmother, who said, ""No, I didn't drive by and place a present on the porch. I'm not her coward mother; I would have given it right to her."" That gave my father the second idea: my mother. Only thing was, we had no way of getting in touch with her and finding out for she had literally taken off and abandoned us both. And over the next few weeks, nobody came forth and said they had gotten me the doll, so we assumed this is who had sent it.

They showed up every year since then. Each unique in their own ways, each more beautiful than the last. I thought it was a little odd, yes. Especially because my mother made no outreach to me so if she was sending me gifts but not bothering to even so much call me and check up, then that was just plain rude of her and her gifts meant literally nothing. But I continued to set them up on my shelf in my bedroom and they looked nice there, I suppose.

The year I turned nineteen, I was moved into college and was taking courses on my birthday. My father called me from home and asked me when I was coming back home for a break, and I told him that I had time this weekend, but I only said this because I sensed some urgency in his voice. I could make it work. He told me not to worry about anything but that he would really like to see me. Then he stressed that I always lock my doors and always have somebody walking with me if I was out past dark, which I already knew.

I returned home that weekend and my father said there had been an accident.
My porcelain birthday doll had arrived, my nineteenth year doll. When my father brought it inside the house, it had smashed into a hundred separate pieces.
Inside, there was a diary entry on a piece of paper.
We spent the entire day smashing open every porcelain doll, and the entire night speaking with the police.
Alexander had written diary entries for every time he had drugged and molested me, each more explicit, admitting that he had done the same to his daughter up until the time of her horrible death. My father and I hadn't a dry eye in our house that entire night, and I continued to have problems throughout my college career knowing that Alexander was somewhere out there, probably assuming a new identity and doing the same thing to other girls.

Now I know why he had always commented on me taking such 'usual long naps.'

honeymoonatthefalls,61,,144,1r0fus,,617,"The falls have a pull, according to the locals.  Something dark and unearthly like a siren’s song, sweet and somehow terrible.  It draws people “of a certain intent”.  That’s the polite way to say a lot of people end up crushed on the rocks below, their limbs torn apart by the unending rush of water, the brains that made them who they were nothing more than bits of foam and meat floating to the surface.  20-40 a year, in fact, depending on who you ask.

We were happy.  Weren’t we?  I thought we were.  I thought maybe we were different from everyone else, that we’d actually make it.  We wouldn’t end up in that 50% statistic.  We’d grow old together, laughing at the same stupid jokes, knowing what was going to come out of the other’s mouth before they even had a chance to say it.

Was it the pressure of the wedding?  The fact that I’m still “between jobs”?  Young 20-somethings in one of America’s bleakest economies, doing what we could to get by.  Scrambling for every scrap as the magazine covers reminded us how worthless our generation is, the snide remarks about our smartphones and Facebook and selfies.  Maybe getting married wasn’t a good idea.

But we were in love!  We were in love and we knew deep down in that secret place in our stomachs that she was the one for me and I for her.

So then why did it happen?

No.  I’m not supposed to ask that anymore.  I’m supposed to accept that she’s gone.  I’m supposed to accept the fact that she’s her own statistic now, one of 20-40 people a year.  Another tumble of bones on the body count that’s reached over 5000 since the falls became an attraction both for tourists and people with death on their mind.

But it’s hard to accept when I can still see her face so clearly, that sweet heart-shaped face with the little crescent-moon scar on her left nostril, the way her big blue eyes lit up when she showed me the fantastic deal she scored on Groupon, a Niagara Falls getaway for our honeymoon.

If only I could go back.  Tell her that the price was nice but I’d rather go to a beach, or Ireland, it doesn’t matter, anywhere but those cursed falls.

It’s impossible to describe how it feels to stand at the crest of Niagara, the mist peppering your face like cold little kisses, drinking in the smells and the sound and the remarkable way the water rushes down, down, ever down.  Your existence seems like a cosmic joke in comparison to this almost hauntingly beautiful feat of nature.  For a moment, it is.

The locals say you can tell who has a death wish by how close they’ll get to the edge.  Those who shy away, who shake their heads and insist nervously that they can see just fine from where they are, thank you very much, those are the ones who can’t trust themselves to get too close.  If they get too close to the edge, some little part of them knows they’ll jump.

She didn’t shy away.  She went right up to the railing.  She was smiling.

That’s the worst part.  She was smiling.

It was early in the morning, one of those damp gray dawns only possible in the new spring of upstate New York.  We had the sight to ourselves.  It was a little spooky, being out there alone, the kind of spooky you get from being in an empty shopping mall after hours, all those metal gates pulled down and the lights turned off.

She was standing there, a little too high on the guardrail, leaning just a little too far over, smiling as the mist touched her lips and made her hair curl in damp little tendrils on her cheeks.  She was beautiful.

I’ll never know why I pushed her.

That’s something I have to accept.

Jaunt-701,54,,152,1rff5i,,531,"I wrapped my dollie in her prettiest red dress, looked into her cracked eyes and whispered I love you.

I held her tight. I love you. I love you. But I started to cry, because dollies don't love back. No, my dollie wouldn't do, not anymore. I wanted something of my own to care for. Something soft I could nuzzle up to at night when I was lonely. Something that needed me. I wanted a real baby.

I asked mama how to make a baby. She slapped me across the face and made me drink dish soap to wash the devil's talk from my mouth. The red mark still burned on my cheek when I got to school, but no one noticed. They never noticed me except when I fell and spilled my lunch, or when Jenny and the other girls made fun of the holes in my dresses. They only noticed me to laugh at me.

That night after I said my prayers, I looked at the stars through my window and spotted one I had never seen before. Big, bright and ruby red, it seemed to get bigger the more I stared at it. It was beautiful, so I sent it a wish. Bring me a baby, I said, bring me something to love.

The star grew bigger and bigger until ruby red filled the room and turned the air thick and rusty. Something was there with me. Black and formless like a storm cloud, it floated above me. You want a child, it said, speaking into my head instead of my ears. I will give you a child, but you must promise to love and care for him no matter what.

I promise.

Wisps of black wrapped around my wrists and pinned them to the ground as sure as steel rivets. My nightdress was lifted and my legs pulled apart. Gritty black tendrils, rough as sandpaper, opened me and slithered inside. They scraped my insides, slowly at first, then faster and faster. It felt like I was being shredded to pulp from the inside out. I tilted my head back to scream, but black filled my mouth and nothing came out. Shhh, it said, to love your child you must suffer for him first. A final push in, and shards of splintered glass exploded inside me.

The thing loosed its grip, and I reached down to feel sticky red goo oozing out of me onto the floor. I was shaking and cold, and the room was falling away. Will I die? I asked.

No. You must care for him. It is your promise.

I woke the next morning without a scratch. Was it a dream? I touched my belly. No, he is there. I can feel him. Tiny and vulnerable and perfect. I would keep my promise.

He grew every day. Soon my belly was round and full underneath my dresses. Everyone noticed me now, especially Jenny and the other girls. Slut, they said. Whore. Trash. One day Jenny fell in front of a school bus as it was pulling away. You could hear the tire pop her skull open from across the parking lot. When the police dragged the driver away he stammered that he had seen something push her, something small and black like a living shadow.

Mama cried. She held me in a scalding tub and scrubbed my body until my skin cracked and bled. Not clean, not clean, she said. She pulled me out of school and swore that I would never leave the house until it was over and done, because what would the neighbors think. I didn't mind. As long as my little boy was safe inside me, I didn't care where I went.

I dreamed of him. He told me his name, but it was a sound I couldn't pronounce, a sound like a cloud of flies buzzing through the air. I couldn't say it, but I could hear it in my head, and that was enough. He told me that he would accomplish great things, but he needed my love to make him strong first. In my dreams I held him tight, looked into his dark eyes and whispered I will love and protect you always.

Mama dreamed of him too, I think. She would lay in bed with sweat soaking into the sheets whispering Please, Please help us God. She ate less and less until she was sunken and pale like a skeleton.

I was drawing pictures one night when it happened. I reached up for a red crayon and *pop*, yellow liquid gushing out of me. He's ready, he's finally ready. I called out to mama and told her it was time. She phoned the doctor, begging him to be discreet to hide it from the neighbors. He arrived and offered to inject me with something to relieve the pain. I refused. To love my baby I must suffer for him first.

Pushing, screaming, breathing, pushing again. Hours and hours. I was weak. I was tired. But the thought of him kept me going. After so long, we would finally meet. I would hold him in my arms for real and give him the love I kept in my heart just for him. I pushed again, with the last drops of strength I had left. I emptied out and collapsed down onto the bed, sighing with relief.

I am sorry, dear, but the baby didn't make it.

No. No you're wrong. I kept him safe this whole time. I protected him and loved him and spoke to him in my dreams, I was going to care for him and make him strong, he can't be, he can't be, he can't.

I am so sorry. Here child, you can say goodbye.

I held him in my arms. He was limp and motionless, his skin a pale gray, his eyes shut tightly. He looked so peaceful. I had never seen anything so beautiful in all my life. I clutched him to my chest and cried, tears dripping onto his head. Goodbye, my love, goodbye. But no, wait. He can't be gone. I can hear him. I can hear the flies in my mind.

His eyes snapped open and his head twisted around to look at mama and the doctor. Mama fell to the floor and screamed. Her legs scrambled to press her into a corner of the room, and her eyes bulged as she shrieked and pleaded to God. The doctor stood frozen for a moment before walking into the bathroom and quietly shutting the door.

My baby's head turned back to me, and I looked into his eyes for the first time. Two huge pools of midnight black that seemed to suck the light out of the room itself. I looked into those cold, dark eyes, and I smiled. My son. My beautiful son. I am so happy to see you.

I stood up while mama's jagged screams scratched my eardrums, and I carried my son to the bathroom. I opened the door, stepped over the spreading pool of red underneath the doctor, and turned on the tap. I bathed my son in the icy cold water as he stared up at me. He was perfect. He was everything I had hoped for. And he was mine.

-------

I saw things in my dream that night. I saw great buildings and monuments ground to dust. I saw waves of fire washing clean the cities of man. I saw clouds of flies so thick they blacked out the sun. I saw red. Mists of red, rivers of red, chunks of oozing red heaped high in the moonlight. And in the middle of it all, I saw my son, my baby boy. Mama's so proud of you sweetheart. I will always be there for you. I will make you strong. I will make you the man you're destined to be. I will love you and care for you and protect you, no matter what.

Capntallon,123,,116,1r8n66,,439,"I got this letter from an old friend I haven't seen in a long time. I figure that this would be best place to ask for advice. Here's the transcript of the letter:

*Hello, Daniel. Haven't seen you for quite some time now.*

*No time for formalities, though. I need you to do something. Remember that old house we used to hide out in down by the farm? I need you to go there. When you approach the house, try not to make any sound. Go up to the loft and you will find a trunk. In it you will find a small vial, a razor blade, and a folded piece of paper. Take the razor and prick your finger. Touch your forehead and make a dot of blood. DO NOT touch the vial before you do so.*

*Open the vial and drink it. When you do so your vision will go blurry, but you have to stay calm. Pick up the paper in the trunk and read the first paragraph. It's in German, but I know you won't have trouble with  pronouncing it. At this point, you MUST stay calm. You will start to feel closed in and you will start hearing voices. DO NOT listen to what they have to say. Tear the paper into the smallest pieces you can and scatter them on the floor.*

*When that's done, go downstairs to the ""kitchen"". You will find a gas can and a lighter. Set fire to the house. No matter what the voices say, you HAVE to set fire to the house. After it starts going, the voices will go away. Then you need to get away from that house as fast as you can.*

*Good luck,*

Exxile4000,97,,152,1rbws0,,391,"Hello reddit. I'm a killer and I have no problem admitting that. Many people have fallen victim to my gruesome attacks and I live life regretting none of it. I'm only sharing my story on here  so that someone out there can know about it. Whether or not you choose to believe it is up to you.

I was a normal child, but normal is relative so who am I to make that call. What I should say is that I grew up how you would expect a kid to grow up. My parents treated me properly, I did great in school, and I had many friends. It wasn't until high school that I started feeling the need to kill. 

It was all so spontaneous. I was just sitting in class one day staring at one of the students when the image of him dying popped into my head. I zoned out and focused on the image, his body lying in a pool of blood leaking from his head. His arms were snapped behind his back  and his feet were missing the big toes. A few weeks later that daydream became a reality... and I got away with it.

Everyone in the school was whispering rumors to one another as I walked to classes. Some were saying that he joined the army, others were convinced that he just moved like so many other kids did before him. I was the only one who knew the truth and I had to hide my devilish grin from the rest of the school. That was my only murder in high school but it ignited the flame.

When I reached adult hood I landed a successful job and had plenty of money to obtain the tools I had always dreamed of using on my victims. That's when I began to develop a signature style. I would always sever the big toes but I no longer snapped the arms behind the back. Honestly, the sound of the bones breaking didn't sit well with me. Every day I would watch the news expecting to see that one of the victims had been found, but they never were. 

Years went by and I targeted another twelve victims. They were no one in particular. Women, teenagers, it really didn't matter to me. A dead body is a dead body in my eyes, I don't care who it belongs to. Very few of them would put up a fight and that was fine with me. I wasn't trying to drag out the last moments of their lives, I just wanted them to die. I wanted to savor the warmth of their blood on my hands as I slit their throat.  

About a week after I killed my final victim, I met a girl that I ended up falling in love with. She doesn't realize how close she was to becoming just another undiscovered body. She wasn't able to have kids which was fine with me, I never really saw myself as a father. Neither of us believe in god so we saw no point in getting married, I was okay with this as well. I felt like my life was finally going to be normal again. 

After we had been together for a few years I decided to tell her about my past. I made a special dinner for her to lighten the mood. However, when I told her she just laughed and thought I was being ridiculous. It turned into her treating it like some type of role playing fantasy I had and she ignored me as I told her it was the truth. I didn't know how to prove it to her... so I killed someone in front of her. 

One night I brought her with me on what she thought was a date. When we got to the spot I opened the trunk so she could see my victim. She still thought it was a joke and asked me how I got my friend to agree to this. I think she finally understood that it was no joke as I sliced the mans throat. Her face turned pale and she reached into her purse to get her phone. I was prepared for this though and I knocked her unconscious. After I finished with  my signature killing pattern I drove back to the house. My secret was not safe with her but I loved her too much to kill her.

Right now she's kept in my basement. I don't treat her like a prisoner mind you, she has everything she could ever want. I'm hoping in time I can start leaving her untied at night so she'll quit trying to escape. I know one day she'll accept who I am. Maybe one day she'll help me fulfill my new fantasy of killing together. Or perhaps you guys won't believe me either and you'll brush this off as just another made up story. But that's the funny thing about being a killer...",The funny thing about being a killer is that no one believes you if you tell them the truth.,543,nosleep
AmbiguousGopher,31,,81,1r5xlc,,358,"For most of my life, I've been drawn to a certain room of my house. A bedroom at the far end of my basement, which used to be a guest bedroom. I can't really explain why, but I just always wanted to sleep there. Until the age of 8, my older brother and I shared a room right across the hall from the bedroom of my parents. When he was 13, however, he moved into that bedroom, and over the years, the room become even more interesting. The room is now filled with posters of The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, an authentic Spanish sword he bought hangs above his desk, and loads of other bits and pieces which captured my imagination when I was younger. To top it all off, there was an air vent connecting his room and mine. Almost directly below my room, I could hear him some nights talking to his friends on the phone while playing video games late into the night. I envied his freedom. If I had tried that, my parents right across the hall would hear me and I'd be grounded.

When I was 13 myself, my brother and sister (twins) left for college. Now the only child at home, I called my brother up one weekend and asked, 
""Can I have your room?""
My brother paused for a long time before responding
""No.""
He gave no explanation, but I didn't really care. I could understand that when he came to visit, He'd want his own room to sleep in. For 4 more years, i didn't ask to have the room again, but when i was 17, my brother bought a house. To me, it seemed like he was pretty much beyond the point of having any reason to care about his old room, so one day when he called to check up on things, I asked again.
This time he responded more quickly. His voice sounded casual, but at the same time, It kinda freaked me out. He said,
""Nah, let mom make it a guest room again. Besides, your room is super classy! My room isn't that great.""
And so, yet again, I let it go. I stayed in my room and didn't really think anything of it... that is, until last week. 

This summer, I started having severe anxiety attacks coupled with spells of incapacitating depression, especially at night. I've been on different medicines to help, and have been going to therapy to help work on relaxation techniques. Last week, my therapist noted that sometimes the brain can form associations with certain rooms or areas. She suggested that my brain, due to the recurring spells in my room, may have formed a negative association with it. She told me that switching rooms may help me relax when I start having an attack.

That night, I did it. I switched to my brother's room, and it was amazing. Since my basement always stays around below room temperature, the sheets and pillow stayed cool, which was just to my liking. I slept better than I'd slept in weeks, and thought that perhaps this room was going to turn things around. But the second night didn't go as well. I woke from a nightmare, and felt as if there was someone watching me. I shook the feeling and went back to sleep. This kind of thing happened for a few more nights; each time, I awoke more worried than the last. 

Then came the big one. I fell asleep as usual, and I began to dream: another nightmare, but this time it was more vivid. In the dream, I saw looking at my brother, when he was only 13 or 14 years old. He was sitting on his bed, talking to something. I couldn't see it, but he was looking at an angle which suggested something much larger than himself. Tears were flowing steadily from his eyes, and he was pleading, BEGGING the thing to go away, to leave him alone. The power in the room went out; I heard a horrible screeching, like a pig being tortured. The lights turned back on and my brother lay there, unconscious. A large black bruise had appeared on his ribs. The clock in his room recovered from the power outage, blinking the numbers ""00:00"". My brother then jerked upright and walked over to the only poster in his room at the time, his Hendrix poster. He took a pen form his desk and put a tally mark on the wall behind it.

I jerked up in my brother's bed. I turned on the lamp and looked around the room. I noticed every poster. Sweat started pouring from my forehead, burning my eyes. I looked at the clock. The numbers blinked ""00:00"".

TheeMikeG,21,,72,1r4fsf,,336,"Dear Mike,

They’re letting me write a letter so I figured I’d get my story out there.

It was a routine night drop, nothing different from what we’ve done countless times before. The steady hum of the C-130 as it tore through the clouds was the only thing keeping me calm. Yeah, I’ve done this a lot, but you can never get rid of the nerves before a mission. We had an idea of what awaited us down there, but we couldn’t be a hundred percent sure. People are unpredictable, and that’s scary. The plan from higher was to have our five man team infiltrate by night drop a small village I can’t pronounce to search for and capture or kill a HVT whose name I also can’t pronounce. The gunship would rise up and provide overwatch until we were extracted. Airborne all the way, hooah. 

The LT joined us again, which he decided to do from time to time. Nice enough guy, I respected him. Was supposed to be having a baby girl soon, he would always talk about it during PT. Good for him, I could never hold down a relationship for very long. I figured it was just because I’ve seen too much shit to be normal and cuddle or whatever the fuck it is that couples do. The rest of the squad was the usual guys. Mitch, Craft, and Burroughs. All experts in their craft. We were a solid group and I’d take a bullet or hell, even two, for any of them. 

“Thirty seconds!” shouted the LT from the bench, a few spots to my right, closest to the door. The jumpmaster heaved the door upward and the familiar sound of air whooshing past the plane made my heart jump. There was always a kick. “Hook up!” he shouted. We all stood up in unison and clipped our static lines to the wire that ran through the plane above our heads. I tugged on my static line to make sure it was attached. There were no reserves for this one. The jumpmaster held up his hand. Five seconds. The red light turned green and the LT positioned himself by the door. The jumpmaster smacked his rear and the LT jumped out and was whisked away. My stomach turned in knots. Over a hundred jumps and I still hated this shit. I was last to go out. I tucked my head, took a hop out of the plane and suddenly there was the rush and I felt myself getting tossed. I heard my chute above and I breathed a sigh of relief. 
Looking up to check my canopy I saw a fully inflated chute and I thanked the Lord once again. I looked down for the rest of the squad and saw their chutes inflated too. Past them, I expected to see the ground, but there was only a thick smoke, or at least that’s what it looked like. A storm cloud? Why didn’t the jumpmaster hold off the jump until the bad weather passed? 

“Staus check” I heard the LT ask through the radio. 

As I watched the other’s canopies disappear into the black cloud I began to worry. I heard the squad all check in though so I felt a little better.  I held my hand up to my ear to activate our comms. 

“Sir, what’s the situation down there?”
	
“Zero visibility guys. Pretty foggy. Can’t see my own canopy,” he said.

Then I entered the black cloud and couldn’t see a damn thing. I heard something nearby. Flapping? My radio clicks before Mitch starts talking. “I heard something. Flock of birds?”
	
“We’re too high,” replied the LT. “Eyes and ears open.” I tried to look around but there was no point. I couldn’t even see my canopy. What if I was falling to my death right then? Heavy flapping got my focus. It sounded large, whatever it was. 
	
“Sir, something is up here with us,” I say.
	
“Simmons, stay calm, what’s gotten into –”
	
“Fuck!” Craft interrupts through the mic. Then I hear a long, painful scream far below me. 
	
“Jesus Christ!” yelled the LT, “Craft! You there?!”
	
Silence. Not even static. 
	
“Guys, stay calm. Get ready to hit any minute. I can’t see the ground in this shit but we’ll sort this out on the DZ.”
	
I checked my watch. It takes maybe two minutes to hit jumping from a mile up. It’s been six minutes and I know this wasn’t a HALO jump. Was I caught in a thermal? I pulled on my risers and felt myself drifting through the air. When I released, I didn’t notice any change in descent speed. The LT must have noticed the same thing because I could hear him cursing through the radio. There’s a loud screech; unlike anything I’ve ever heard. After it ended a few seconds later the LT had to shout over the commotion we were all making on the radio. We were scared. 
	
“Guys! I don’t know what the fuck is going on but stay calm! Weapons on amber.”
	
My combat gear was in a large sack between my legs, but my USP was on my belt. I took it out and held it ready. I didn’t know for what, but I was ready to go. How had we still not hit the ground yet? Then I got an idea. My combat load. We are supposed to release it before landing, and it slides down a twenty foot rope so we don’t break our legs when we land. I thought if I could cut it free, maybe I could hear it hit the ground. I asked for permission from the LT who quickly approved. He must have been as freaked out as me to allow me to abandon my combat gear. I pressed the handle on my hip and the gear slid down the rope and out of sight into the darkness. I took out my knife and sawed at the line until it snapped. I waited and waited but couldn’t hear a thing. 
	
I heard the flapping again, and someone fired their weapon, two, three times. Then silence. “Jesus Christ,” whispered the LT. “Status check.”
	
“Burroughs.”
	
“Simmons.”
	
Nothing.
	
“Sir, what the fuck is going on?!” I knew he wouldn’t have an answer, but I was desperate. 
	
“I have no idea.”
	
We drifted through the air for ten more minutes. Then I touched down. I didn’t hit hard, it was like I was just set down. Didn’t even have to fall over. I still couldn’t see a damn thing though. I heard quick steps and then Burroughs burst into view and tackled me to the ground. He was frantic. He begged me through tears to follow him. We wandered around until we came to the LT. He didn’t have a right half of his body. He was barely alive, sputtering through bloody lips for us to run. 
	
“My baby, my baby, my baby,” he whispered over and over until he didn’t say anything anymore. The cloud cleared from the area behind him and there was this thing. All I saw before I turned and ran was large leathery wings. I heard the screeching and the flapping of those awful wings again. Burroughs screamed as he was ripped backwards from beside me. Somehow I burst out of the cloud and I saw headlights. I nearly got hit by the jeep but dove out of the way just in time. Out got two guards who spoke a language I didn’t understand. Burroughs was the translator. They prodded me with machine guns and kicked and beat me until I was barely conscious. How did they not see the thing behind me? They dragged me into the back of their vehicle and drove me to their camp. 

I’ve been their POW for nearly a month now. If you get this letter, please get my story out there. I’m not crazy, I promise. I can’t explain what happened any better than that. We’re not alone. Something terrible is going on over here. Time to go; they’re beckoning me to come outside. It’s awfully dark out there. Is a storm coming in?

courtneymadison,33,,82,1r2j24,,256,"I'm just a normal 18 year old that lives at home and goes to class. I've never really had any unexplainable experiences but I had one today. I woke up and started getting ready for class, I thought I saw my mom in her room so I started having a conversation with her while I was getting dressed. She was responding as per usual so I thought nothing of it. (Quick sidenote: Nothing felt wrong with the way she was responding. Whatever this was it sounded just like my mom.) After a while she stopped replying to me. Being curious I decided to go see why. I went to her room and it was empty, looked in the kitchen and it was empty, She would of had to have walked past me to leave the house so I knew she hadn't left. I decided to call her to figure out where she'd gone and when I looked I had a text from her that was received at 5:27 a.m. saying ""Got called in to open. Be home at 11 so you can take the car."". I called her to see if she was messing with me but she was actually at work. I don't know who I've been talking to all morning and I'm really freaked out. Can anyone help me? 


EDIT: I asked my little sister if when she had had anything strange happen when she was getting ready for school and she looked at me like I'd lost it. For all the people that asked about the conversation, the previous night my mom had found a ouija board (unused and still in the packaging) in my closet and she had thrown it away, ""She"" was talking about how ouija boards are dangerous and I shouldn't mess with them. She was very persistent that I don't get involved with things like that but she's always saying stuff like that so it wasn't a very out of the ordinary topic for us. The conversation was about an hour long and I was fully awake when it took place. We checked the house and nothing was missing or out of place. We live in an apartment and all the windows were locked and the screens were intact, so someone couldn't have gotten in or out through them. My mom is really into the weird/paranormal stuff so I told her everything and she has no idea what it could be. Also I feel I should mention we've lived here for 15 years and nothing like this has happened before.

I work in a recycling center. I am the guy that weighs the truck when it comes in with scrap metal, watches it unload, and then weighs the truck when it comes out. That difference in weight is used to calculate the value of the scrap and how much the customer receives for his load. it’s a well known place in my town, city actually. There’s a pretty steady business and it’s good work. I started out in the yard sorting and a few years ago moved into the office. I still have to wear a hard hat and safety vest, but only when I have to watch a truck unload in an area that the cameras don’t cover. 

A few days ago, we started getting loads from a demolition job about a hundred miles from town. It was an old Air Force base that didn’t survive the latest round of budget cuts. The base was being scrapped to make a nature preserve. The plan is called Nukes to nature. The contractors brought in mostly structural iron, copper wiring and office equipment. I was watching a contractor ( who was mostly likely drunk) tip his truck when a old metal desk caught my eye. It landed right side up twenty feet from me. Because I was bored I walked over and opened the drawers.

 One of the drawers a metal lock box. I took it back to my desk and set about picking the lock. Working in a scrap yard we sometimes come across old strongboxes or small office safes. My boss has a deal that if you can open it, then whoever finds it splits the contents 50/50 with the scrapyard. You can see why I’ve gotten pretty good at picking locks!

The box opened after a few minutes of concerted effort. Inside was just an old piece of computer equipment, an inch high by 4 inches long. The closest thing I could compare the size to was to the box that your bank send you your checks in. It had a small bar code on the top part, and handwritten in permanent marker was the words “ MJ-12, Containment “ An orange sticker proclaimed “ Erase and Destroy, ref FM 3-36 USA TRADOC”

I showed what I am now calling the hard drive to my boss, who was VERY unimpressed and gave me the number for a IT guy who might want to buy it. I am going to see if he wants to buy it, but I’m going to ask him if he can see what files are on the drive. Secret plans to bomb the Soviets? Blueprints for a new jet fighter? Who knows? It’s a mystery worthy of /r/nosleep!!!

I’ll post when I hear back from the IT guy

PeckerPoker,43,,86,1r58lt,,234,"Ok, so this isn't a long story filled with twists and turns, but it just happened about 15 minutes ago, and I'm a little uneasy now.

For reference, my husband, son, and I moved into an apartment in the top-half of a century-home a couple months ago. The doors all have old knobs and the doors don't always close easily - you really have to pull sometimes.

Anyway, I just put my son (almost two years old) down for his nap. I told him night-night as I closed the door. As I always do, I pulled the door shut firmly and made sure I heard it click. I swear I heard it click.

I walked away and into the bathroom to go pee. As I sat down on the toilet, I heard my son start crying, which isn't that unusual, but normally he doesn't do more than fuss for a minute before falling asleep. I even kept him up a little longer than usual to make sure he fell asleep. He seemed pretty ready to go down... thumb in mouth under his blanky, he rolled over onto his side and put his blanket over his head like he does when he's really tired.

I finish peeing and walk out of the bathroom and his door is wide open. I see him standing in his crib crying. I go in, feeling uneasy, and lay him back down and cover him back up. He lays there and just keeps crying as I check his closet... like there would be someone hiding in there or something. Kind of dumb, I know, but I couldn't just shut him back in his room alone without checking.

Even if I was wrong and the door didn't click shut (which is possible), it shouldn't have been wide open. When I haven't completely shut it in the past, it will open up about 5 or 6 inches. It's never opened up all the way like that.

I checked the rest of the rooms and closets, feeling nervous, but kind of stupid. Of course, there wasn't anything unusual anywhere. Still, I'm kind of on edge. I wish my husband was home.",Nap Time,320,nosleep

Thats some crazy stuff, am I right?

Let me know what you think.



","Found Hard Drive, wtf?",314,nosleep
tellmewhatiswrong,52,,56,1reivz,,215,"Arghhh. I have no idea what to make of this situation I find myself in.

I started off 2013 as being in the most amazing relationship I've ever had. I married the girl of my dreams last year, after being together for 5 years prior to that. She is the most beautiful, intelligent, interesting person I have ever met, and I knew that as soon as we met each other. Immediately, the chemistry between us was electric.

Don't get me wrong, we are extremely different in a lot of ways, but up until this point, that has only helped to make our relationship stronger. I'm an atheist, a kind of scientific nerd I guess. She, on the other hand, was more....new age? I guess you could say. Not particularly religious, but interested in the paranormal, philosophy, anything that can't really be explained. It would not surprise me to see her out hunting for UFO's, however for the most part, this side of her was really just limited to reading about such events and watching the odd documentary.

Having said that, she is so sensible and smart. She's a very curious person, that's what I put her hobbies down to, really. It's never been more than a passing interest of hers. She works as a personal assistant to the CEO of a law firm in the city. Everyone says she should study law because her talents are wasted as a secretary. But she seems content enough at the moment....well she did.

The reason I find myself in this mess is because she has changed her mind about something we used to agree on - kids. When we first got together, we both agreed that we did not want to have children. We based our entire relationship on that premise. We were content with travelling the world, expensive wines, and sex on the kitchen bench. All that would change if kids came into the picture. I have never wanted children, and don't feel like I ever will.

She used to feel the same. Until her sister had a baby. She started to get a little clucky, she said. She started to see us with a baby of our own. At first I thought it was just a passing comment, but the longer time went on, the more I realised she was serious. That's when the fights started. Fight after fight, every week. Her crying and yelling and begging me to change. To compromise. Me, dumbfounded and annoyed that one of the foundations of marriage is suddenly being challenged. Things have been said in the heat of the moment, and both of us have been deeply hurt by the other. She makes me feel like I can't give her what she needs, that I'm denying her her happiness. I make her feel like she's not important, she says. That I'm being selfish.

Maybe I am? I don't know.

So we found ourselves in a stale mate. She posted something on Reddit asking for advice and most of the suggestions directed us to attend couples counselling.

I was reluctant to say the least. But I was willing to give it a shot.

Sandra, our therapist, was actually not what I expected. She seemed rational and quite straightforward, not the Einstein-esque shrink that I had imagined. She advised that we really we had two options : either she could stay with me, and be without a child. Or she could leave me for someone who would give her a baby. We seem to be stuck in secret option number 3: staying in the circumstances we find ourselves in.

Disregarding all the fighting, she was still her normal self, and we have been managing to keep it together, and still spend some quality time together. We have still been going out with friends, and going for walks with our dog, and I know we still love each other.

I stopped going to couples counselling. I sort of felt like she couldn't give us a real answer, she was only there to listen. My wife kept attending on her own though, I think she takes some kind of comfort in it.

She came home last week and told me that she's going to be attending a ""Self help"" seminar, and would I like to go. I said definitely not. I couldn't think of anything worse than to be honest! Even the counselling sessions were too much for me. She asked if I minded if she went. She said it was with some famous psychoanalyst, and that her therapist would be in attendance, on the ""Assistance Team"". I said whatever she felt would help. She said she feels it will help her clear her head on the baby issue. I'm all for anything that could help us get back on track, so I told her to go for it.

The seminar seemed pretty intensive. It was 14 hours a day, Friday, Saturday and Sunday of last week. It was also very expensive, but I bit my tongue. 

She got home last night and just seemed exhausted. I haven't gotten many details out of her, as every night when she arrived home she went straight to sleep and we barely had time to speak. Today we both had the day off, which was recommended by the people who organised the seminar.

Today we woke up, and she was....intense. I woke up with her clinging to me for dear life. She was stroking my face and staring into my face. It was quite nice actually. Nice to have some affection. We cuddled in bed for a long while. She seemed.....ok. Her eyes definitely looked brighter, but she didn't say much, just was very intensely affectionate. 

She got up to have a shower, and I went out to have some breakfast. After about half an hour I knocked on the bathroom door, telling her to leave some hot water. She must have had it on so hot, steam was pouring out of the door into our hallway, and the walls were dripping with condensation. I knocked a few more times, and yelled out to her, but got no response.

I opened the door, and waited for the hazy steam to clear, to see her standing there, fully clothed and staring in the mirror. The shower was on full ball, and extremely hot, and I reached over the turned the tap off. She didn't take her eyes off her own reflection. She was very vague when I questioned her, and sweating profusely. I managed to get her dressed (out her pyjamas) and she's in the other room now watching TV.

I assume this weird behaviour is something to do with the seminar? I don't really understand all this new age crap, has anyone else ever been to one of these seminars? Or know someone that has? I've tried googling more information but can't see anything about this specific group. 

Any advice would be appreciated, I'm a bit weirded out right now to be honest.

PlotThickener,13,,47,1r0aj7,,198,"This is a story I've never discussed with anyone aside from those people involved. But I figured it belonged here. For the longest time I chalked it all up to pranks, my imagination, whatever...but hopefully you'll all be able to make more sense of it.

I was driving in a rural part of Wisconsin (which, if you live there, you know is much of the state). Lots of flat farms, country highways named for letters, empty back roads, etc. It was 10 p.m. or later--I don't really remember when, but it had been dark for some time and it was the middle of summer, so it must have been late. 

It was the time of night cars stop moving on the rural roads so it's just you and your headlights and the world around you starts getting really creepy. Plus you're always watching out for deer on these roads, which can just pop out at any moment, so you're kind of on ""yellow alert.""

I'm driving north on a long section of road. There's a big flat farm on my left, mostly empty-looking, probably planted with soybeans which don't grow high. I'm concentrating on the edges of where my headlights meet the darkness to watch for deer, and I think I see one walking out of the farm toward the road.

I tap the brakes, not sure of what I see, but soon I realize it's not a deer. It's upright, something walking on two feet, and it's HUGE. And it's all black. It's still moving, but it's not moving with any kind of walking movement; it's just sort of gliding across my vision.

At this point I've stopped the car completely--in the middle of the road, just watching. One instinct was to hit the gas and drive past, because I could have easily passed it, but I'm not sure if it was about to jump out. I'm not really afraid yet, I'm just frozen; you know those moments where you can't figure out what something is so there are no real emotions? That was me.

Then it comes into clearer view in the headlights. Well, that's not very accurate to say, because it didn't seem to reflect any light. It was like the light moved through it, if that makes sense. But I could see the outline of the figure against everything else that was lit--the road, the trees, etc.

The figure looked like Death. I mean EVERYTHING you imagine when you read the stories--the scythe, the big black hood. It was exactly what you think when you think Grim Reaper, only unnaturally tall and thin. It was so tall and thin it looked a lot like this guy's halloween costume when he wears it after about five minutes or so: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8PoCkNKDGk Especially how tall it was. I mean, ten feet minimum. I think most people think of the Grim Reaper as being as large as a big person, but it wasn't really like that.

But that was my first thought. A halloween costume. It was still summer, though, so not Halloween. But, I rationalize, maybe it's just a prank. But then I pay attention to how it moves to the middle of the road.

It just GLIDES. I see no feet, no hint that this thing is doing anything but flying off the ground, but you can't see feet or anything because the robe hits the ground.

Then, in the middle of the road, maybe ten feet in front of me, it stops.

The hooded face turns--toward me.

It's so slow and smooth, and just plain UNNATURAL, that I completely freeze in the car. My hands are locked on the wheel. The face is turning to me, slowly, perfectly smoothly, and I'm scared out of my mind. Even if this is some prank, this thing clearly means business. Maybe it's some psychopath scaring people, and not just an innocent prank.

It sees me. I don't see eyes, no glowing eyes or anything, just black, but somehow I KNOW that it's looking at me, making eye contact. I got goosebumps even on my scalp; I remember my hair feeling like it stood straight up. I feel like I was literally looking death in the face. My stomach sank like someone just told me a loved one had died. I mean, you do not want to feel this feeling. Ever. The thing stood perfectly still, too, as if considering me or weighing me. I felt really judged, if that makes sense. Like I was being considered.

Then he glides off so fast I don't even see where he goes. The roads are clear again, and then I heard the engine running as if all of the world's sound had suddenly been un-muted.

I drive back home, still frozen, still rationalizing what I saw. A prank, I figure. It had to be a prank, some overzealous Halloween lover setting up rumors of the Grim Reaper walking around the farms. I tell my parents about it, and they're sure it's a prank. So sure that I eventually rationalize it away, and the memory is filed away as creepy, but nothing supernatural.

At about the same time, I heard that a farmer who owned that soybean field had died that night. But it took me a long time before I put two and two together, when I realized that I saw something that looked like THE FREAKING GRIM REAPER on the same night that farmer died. I remember when I first had the thought, and my stomach sank.

It was like the rationalization I had used to remember the story of the Grim Reaper was suddenly stripped away, and I had to confront the fact that I saw something very, very scary.

But what else can I do but live my life?

I went back to college--every time I came back home at night I took an alternate road just because I got the creeps so bad. Had a good semester, mostly A's, had some good times with friends. I drive back mostly during day or evening time so I don't have to revisit those unpleasant memories.

Then my parents tell me that there are more ""Grim Reaper"" stories going around lately, all pretty similar to mine. When you live in a  small town it seems like there are a lot of funerals for old people that you know or at least heard of going on all the time. At one funeral, an old lady's granddaughter cried because she saw she said a big black figure over the casket. My parents heard that story and thought of mine, but they still just treated it as a joke.

I would stay up a lot later than the people in my house (parents + younger brother, plus an uncle aunt and cousin who were spending Christmas with us), and slept in a room upstairs on this little side road in a rural subdivision. No streetlights out there; just the lights that other people kept on their garages all night.

One night I went up to my room at about 2 a.m., and of course the whole house is quiet, and I go to my room and turn out the lights so I can go to bed. I usually throw a glance out the window and you can see most of the side street because the neighbors kept their garage light on all night.

This time the whole scene looks a little different. There's a big shadow looming in the front yard, and it's blocking a lot of light. Then I look closer and I realize it's not a shadow--it's something black that's cutting THROUGH the light.

Then I feel my heart practically stop as I realize…it's back. The Grim Reaper figure.

It was just like before. It cast no shadow. The scythe was there, and the tall hooded cloak, with no face.

The breath went out of me when I realized that, unlike before, this reaper was not looking to the side when I discovered it. It was looking right at our house.

II stood there, frozen again, my finger still on the switch from just having hit the light. It was a windy winter night, and you could see some snow move, but the creature's robe didn't move at all. The same way its movements before had been unnatural, now it loomed like a statue. No flailing around in the wind. Just standing tall, scythe up high, staring at our house.

I looked away, then looked back again. Still there. Looming. I didn't get the sense that it was looking at me, but I still couldn't stop staring.

Then I looked away, and looked back again. This time I KNEW it was staring. Again, it was hard to see--there was really nothing that I could tell that suggested it was looking at me. No evil glowing eyes or anything. I just felt it. Felt the same feelings as before--a rotten pit in my stomach, the feeling of being measured and weighed and considered.

I heard a squeak, and realized it was me. My breath was being squeezed out of me, simply from the fear. Keep in mind I had no idea what this thing would do next. What, fly up to my window? Suddenly disappear? Rip off its hood and reveal a laughing skull?

After a moment, its gaze departed from me, again. I felt good enough to go to my brother's room and wake him up to show him something in the window. It took him forever to get out of bed, but it may have only been a few minutes. By the time he woke up, rubbed his eyes, and listened to the panic in my voice, a few minutes had at least past. I showed him the window but, of course, the figure was gone.

But still, that was it, I knew. The night I saw death.

That was the night my uncle died.

chimera_phantasm,44,,52,1rbg7n,,181,"My name is Ramiel, and I want you to read this right before you go to sleep. Trust me, it’s better this way.

 If it’s the middle of the day for you or perhaps you’re not quite tired yet, bookmark this and read it when your eyes are starting to itch with tiredness, but you’re not nodding off yet. I don’t want you to forget what you’re about to read. 

I’m on the tall, skinny side of my arabic family, I guess I take after my mom in that respect. Though i’m pretty sure she didn’t have this much facial hair. She named me after an angel that is responsible for “divine visions”. I wonder if she knew how right on the money she was.  	

Why does my name and physical features matter? I suppose it doesn’t, but if I’m going to share something this personal with strangers for help or some kind of catharsis, i’d rather you had a good idea of who I am and not just a blank slate.  	

I don’t want you to forget me when this is over. 
	

Before we begin, here’s an interesting fact to wrap your head around: Your brain produces extremely high amounts of a psychedelic compound called DMT (Dimethyltryptamine) two times in your life; Once when you are born to help cope with the pressure it puts on your fragile, infant body during the painful process of birth and once again when you are seconds from dying to ease the burden it puts on your body and mind as they both shut down for the very last time. This is often why people claim to see their loved ones who have long passed on by their side, bright lights from the sky or feelings of elation. 

This process is so strong that it has the capabilities to erase everything in your mind, like a mass wipe of your hard drive. Now you might think that isn’t too important if you’re just starting out your life or simultaneously moments away from it coming to an end, but I ask you to entertain the notion that you possess a soul or an inner essence of sorts; what if that soul, that consciousness, that essence of you simply continued on without the knowledge of a past existence? What if at the moment of death, you saw something so undeniably horrifying and inconceivable, something you’d only seen in fleeting dreams and nightmares throughout your life, that your brain compensates in the only way it knows how, by erasing any prior memory of it before allowing what makes you “you” continue onto the next stage of whatever is out there. Your brains last failsafe, a defence mechanism to ensure you won’t carry the burden with you. But like any kind of defence mechanism, there’s always a bypass...and there’s always a black box.  
	
DMT is a chemical produced by your pineal gland and it is responsible for us dreaming every single night. Not the reason, however. We have no idea why we dream, we just do. As soon we enter REM sleep, our dreams become their most memorable and malleable. It is at this point we have dreams which take proper form, that we feel most real and perceive to be the most accessible, though we seldom ever remember the dream itself. Because like a drug trip, our brain is determined to protect us from that experience...but what if that wasn’t the only reason?

Consider this; The older we get, we sleep considerably less hours. As babies, we sleep for up to 14 hours and by the time we hit 18 years old, it’s half of that amount. What if this is a defence mechanism our brain develops so that we don’t spend too long in “that realm”? No, i’m not talking about “the further” from Insidious or some kind of Nightmare on Elm Street knockoff, before your already horror obsessed minds make some kind of parable to an existing franchise for comfort or relatable aspects. You’re still very much within your own mind, but there’s something else there with you.  

Now I ask you to suspend all beliefs or non-beliefs and read on to hear my story and why I no longer sleep and why, despite being an Atheist, I pray to something, to anything, (hell even Hypnos would be a welcome evil right now) that should my mind succumb to sleep and my body fail me, that I don’t dream. 

I’m a counsellor at my local university, I took on the job in September of last year as a ditch effort to bump up my resume and to reduce rent through living on the campus. It was your usual run of the mill kind of work, talk to terrified 1st years who’d never lived away from home before and were simply not used to their newfound freedom, dealing with homesickness, new friendships, one night stands etc. The 2nd years were dealing with social troubles within their houses/apartments, deadlines mounting and the occasional unplanned pregnancy. The final year students were typically near breakdown over their dissertations and end of year exams, so you’d offer them all the appropriate advice, your own experiences at the university as an example and then ultimately hope it all sinks in. If not, well there’s always next week and beyond that, a private therapist. 

But, like all forms of employment that deal with face to face interactions, there’s always one encounter you never forget. For me, that was Milo Moraga, a 2nd year student studying Psychology &amp; Philosophy. The first time he came into my office, he struck me as a little bit gaunt, his striped long-sleeve top hanging off him like it’d stretched in the wash. Strung out, but shy. That would have been my first impression. I think he sensed my preconceived notions, avoiding making eye contact with me as he shuffled inside. He was apprehensive, sleep deprived, his hair greasy under a black beanie and his eyes laden with heavy dark bags underneath like someone had put on eyeliner while he slept. He sat down, glancing around at the windows and leant forward, cracking his knuckles and rubbing his hands over one another hastily.

*“Hello Milo, how can I help you? I understand you asked for this appointment because of...anxiety? Do you want to tell me about that?”*

 I looked through the brief set of notes the receptionist gave me and tried to study as best I could while he spoke. Nothing that would ultimately help me ascertain the problem, it just gave him time to compose himself. 

He didn’t respond, just kept shuffling in his chair, I guess he wasn’t 100% sure he should come here.  	

*“Your lecturer sent you here, didn’t they?”* I said bluntly, feeling a slight headache come on as I felt an awkward 30 minute session rearing it’s ugly, monotonous head. 

He nodded, but I noticed something in that moment that made me think there was more to it. His expression was almost like he was pleading for his life as he quickly nodded.  	

I leaned forward, placing my hands under my chin and up to my lips as I observed him, I had to be very careful with how I handled this. If he was suicidal, one wrong statement could leave him with a noose round his neck.  	

*“Milo, what happened in the classroom to get you here? Can you tell me that much?”*

He mimicked me, leaning forward as well, though his posture was the furthest parallel from my own, it looked like his spirit was broken. 

*“The lecturer...Ms Armstrong...she was talking about solipsism and I just got...lost within it. Do you know what solipsism is?”*

I did, but I shook my head. I didn’t want to interrupt him when he was being so open. 

*“It’s a philosophical belief that everything an individual perceives is only in his own mind, it is a construct of his own psyche. There is no other human beings, no other individual thoughts, just his or her own...I guess I found the idea kinda comforting and I broke down.”*

 I raised an eyebrow, that’s certainly not a usual response. 

*“Comforting, Milo? You mean to say you enjoy being alone &amp; isolated?”*  

*“No, the opposite actually, I have a lovely group of friends, a loving family and a fiancé, but it was comforting for another reason...if It’s just me, then what hurts me is just me, I know what i’m capable of and it makes any kinds of threats a moot point. It means that..that...”*

 He put his hands up to his mouth and began crying silently, the picture of this situation was getting uglier and murkier the more he explained. 

*“It means that I might not die after all.”*

 I rolled up my sleeves, my flannel shirt was already beginning to chafe me. First signs of stress, I suppose. I looked down at my charm bracelet my wife brought me and took in a deep breath. I knew this was going to be rough. 

*“It’s...it’s my dreams, doc. There’s something in my dreams. I can’t sleep anymore. Each time I do, it’s like I can sense i’m going into that place again, journeying deeper into the void with every evening. I’ve tried taking coffee, shit loads of red bull and any cheap ass energy drinks I can get my hands on...I even took those pills truckers take so they can stay wired for 18 hours, but...well you know the problem, right doc?”* He looked down and started rubbing his hands together again, his knee bouncing as he struggled to keep it under control. 

Withdrawal symptoms combined with sleep deprivation, this kid was getting more tweaked by the minute. 	

*“The problem being that we all have to sleep eventually, no matter how long we put it off.”* I exhaled. *“Milo, I want you to start at the beginning, I know you’re anxious to get some kind of help, but if I don’t know the route of the problem, I can’t give you the correct advice, okay? Now I want you take in 3 deep breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. Can you do that for me? And you don’t need to call me ‘doc’, i’m just a volunteer counsellor. You can call me ‘Rami’ if you like?”* 

He nodded and did as instructed, his demeanour improving slightly with each successive inhale, though this was hardly a permanent solution to his paranoia. I didn’t want to ask at this point how long he’d been awake for, but I could tell it’d been more than a handful of days. Once an individual goes past the 3 day mark, they will begin to lose their grip on sanity and brain cells will start to die. I was silently hoping I could find out the problem to this sooner rather than later.  	

*“Alright”* I picked up my laptop to take notes. *“Go ahead, tell me what started this all off.”*

What follows is the unedited conversation, this is verbatim what was said between the two of us. If I can find the audio recording later, I will attach it to the post.  	

*“Do you know much about lucid dreaming, Rami?”* 

 *“I know a little, just that it’s something practiced and allows for complete control of the dream by the dreamer.”* 

He nods before continuing. 

*“There’s a learning curve to it, you need to lie in bed and shut out all outside sounds and impulses. The typical things really, the sensation to scratch your arm, to roll over, to block out the voices.”* 

He stopped and stared at me with fear. *“I didn’t mean to tell you that...”*  	

*“It’s alright, we’ll get to it later, let’s just focus on the why and not the how for the moment. What made you decide to lucid dream in the first place?”* 

 He shifted in his chair and suddenly looked very timid. 

*“I kept seeing him in my dreams, at first he’d just be a random appearance and then he’d start to try and approach me, friendly smile and hand outstretched like he was greeting an old friend. Never threatening or hostile, just attempting to make contact with me. Though he’d never get to. Every single time, i’d be distracted by something at the last second or my dream would veer off in another direction.”*

He shifted in his seat and closed his eyes before continuing. 	

*“I remember in the first few dreams we had, he’d just be lingering in the background. If I was walking through a street, he’d just be standing with the crowd my brain created and not really reacting to anything but me. I’d see him watch me, but then my dream would shift and I guess i’d just ignore it and carry on...after a few weeks, I began getting better at controlling my dreams. I’d start to mess around with the world I was inhabiting, like Inception I guess but more...personal. I’d turn myself into a member of X-Men or i’d go on a date with my perfect woman, y’know...things that you can only dream of, literally...well that’s when he started to become more apparent. I’d usually wake up before he actually got too close, but I’d always remember the look on his face before I did.”* His eyes widened. *“He always looked so angry...”*

*“Former abuse victim?”* I thought, adding it to the list of potential issues and solutions. I didn’t want to stop him while he was on a roll. I nodded to show my attentiveness and he continued. 	

*“I still remember the first time he managed to speak to me. I was in a park i’d visited as a child with my mother. It was a small piece of heaven in London back then, a mental safe haven when things got too stressful I guess. But this was nothing like I remembered it, the trees weren’t trees, they were corpses stacked on top of one another, some overlapping and...meshing with one another in unspeakable positions to form branches. I could feel the atmosphere almost turn to pure disgust as they noticed me, unable to move or even speak to me. But their eyes, their eyes said everything. Because at first they fixated on me with hatred, then quickly away in sheer terror. They’d seen something far more terrifying than the fate they were already suffering...so...I...”* 

His eyes welled up with tears, unblinking as they streamed down his face.  	*“I looked, Rami. I looked and saw him standing some 40 feet away down the path, his head bowed. He wasn’t moving and yet he was. His body was almost...rippling. The closest way I can describe it is the way a signal on a TV channel in the old days used to bend and flicker when the signal was weak. Every time I blinked, he came closer. I tried for the longest time to not blink, really...I did. But the brain betrays your conscious impulses. The more you try to put off a basic function, the more your brain wills you to do it. When he was 10 feet away, he simply vanished. By the time I had registered that he was gone, I heard a whisper in my ear...he was standing right behind me, I could feel his breath on my neck. Rami...it didn’t feel human.”*	

There was an awkward silence, he took in some deep breaths and shuddered. Obviously reliving the memory wasn’t going to be something pleasant for him but...the way he reacted, it was like he truly had experienced this. I stared at him, nodding and silently encouraging him to continue. When he didn’t, I leaned forward and quietly asked him what i’m sure he was waiting me to ask; 	

*“What did he say to you, Milo?”*

Milo shook his head. *“I’m sorry, I don’t remember. That was when the dream ended. I didn’t see him again in my dreams for a while.”*

We talked for a little while longer, mainly about his anxieties in crowds and eye contact, then our time came to an end and we scheduled an appointment for the following week. 

This would be our last session together.  	It was a Monday morning and i’d just come back from a friends wedding, my wife and I had been drinking so by the time I got to the office I was nursing a hangover, my flannel shirt covering the bruises i’d sustained falling over and my best pair of jeans smeared in alcohol. It was a day my mind was not in the work, I suppose. I just wanted to get home and go to sleep.   

 Milo came in earlier than planned, he looked desperate. He was pulling at his hair, biting his fingernails and pacing constantly. It didn’t look like he’d seen any sleep at all. I sent a text to my colleague asking for security to come over as soon as possible. He was going to need to be sectioned for his own safety. How on earth he’d managed to go this long without his friends or fiancee doing something is beyond me.  

*“I remember what he said, Rami. I remember it clearly now.”* He said between pants and more nail biting. 	

*“Okay, Milo. Well why don’t you take a seat and we’ll talk it out?”*

 He ignored that, but stopped pacing and stared intently at me.  	

*“I’ll be right here, always.”* He put his arms around himself, a self defence mechanism when a persons personal space has been violated. 

*“That was what he said. I heard it again and again every time I closed my eyes.”* 	

He started bashing at his temples. *“IT WON’T. FUCKING. STOP.”*  

All I could do at this point was try to keep him talking and calm until security got here. 

 *“Did this make you afraid to dream, Milo?”* 

 He started laughing, his face showing the complete opposite of his vocal expression. Pure incredulity and fear on his face against the guttural sound of his manic laughter.  	*“You don’t get it, do you? He didn’t mean just when I dream. He meant always. Now I know...now I know for sure.”* 	

He took a deep breath in and his demeanour shifted, he suddenly looked like a man almost at peace. Not content but willing to let go.  	

*“Thanks for listening Doc, sharing this with someone was important to me...and to him. He’s going to have his work cut out for him i’m sure.”*

 And just like that, he got up and left. I followed him out, naturally concerned for him. I watched him leave the building and cross the road.  

Then he did something I won’t ever forget. 

 He turned to me, smiling and outstretched his hand, crying openly as a vehicle struck him. I didn’t even see it coming, I was so captivated by his expression.  	

I couldn’t even bring myself to go over to his body, I gave my statement and went straight home. All I could do was look in the mirror, wondering what it was that was bothering me so much about how I looked and why Milo outstretching his hand was so disturbing to me. When I looked at myself, I didn’t see a 6’0 150lb brown coloured hipster. I saw someone troubled, someone who didn’t look like they’d slept much lately, someone like Milo...

I got a phone call from the hospital later on that evening, Milo was in a coma and on life support. He was non-responsive and likely brain dead. His family were choosing to keep his life support on in lieu of their religious and moral views. I think deep down, they just didn’t want to let him go. I’d been asked to go into his apartment with a member of his family to see if there was anything to indicate why he would willingly stand in front of oncoming traffic.

I won’t bore you with the traveling details, but his apartment was surprising. I was half expecting a filthy, run down place filled with half eaten food and human waste given his obsessive and unstable state. Guess I just watched too many detective/horror movies growing up. 

His place was immaculate, everything was extremely clean and organised, he’d already packed up a lot of his material possessions into boxes with names on the front, this was already beginning to look like premeditation. 

He had a desk beside his bed, this was the only place in his room that showed any signs of his lack of sanity rubbing off on his living conditions. Books on demonology, the science of sleeping, DMT, some sleeping pills and a journal. 

His brother went through the boxes while I took a look at the journal (i’ll include photos later if I get permission from the family, names have been changed and anything too personal will of course be blurred out). It initially contained legible, competent insights into his nightly journeys as he began to lucid dream. But as this other entity began to make himself more known and aware, the content shifts and the writing becomes hastily scrawled, certain words appear larger than others, he questions himself on numerous occasions and draws the mans face more frequently as the journal comes to it’s end.  	

The final entry is barely legible, but it details a conversation he had with the man in his dream and that a reminder that he would be with him always.  After this, there is just a single word on the hardback of the journal, rewritten over and over, almost like it’s been carved in. 	

**“DREAM.”**

Which brings us to the final part of this story; the present. I’m sure you’d all love to discover i’m actually cursed or that this story will follow some typical archetype of horror shorts and i’m moments away from death, passing on a final message. But as i’m sure you’re all coming to realise, that is not the case.  	

I just woke up from a lucid dream, i’ve never had one before nor do I know how I had one, but it was definitely a lucid dream. I was able to control my reality, my own physical form and everything around me. It was here I saw Milo. He approached me slowly and before I could even say anything, he asked me a favour;  	

*“Pull the plug, let me die.”*

I was so taken aback that my rational thought process dissipated and for a moment, I wondered...was this perhaps a shared dream? 	

*“I can’t take the torture anymore, Rami. Please tell my family I love them, but I need to be let go.”*

*“It’s okay, you don’t need to suffer anymore in the real world, i’ll do what I can to convince them.”* I croaked, placing a hand on his shoulder. 

Milo’s smile faded.  	

*“I’m not talking about the torture there, Rami. I’m talking about the torture here...without being able to wake up, he has complete control. I’m his new puppet and he wants to play forever. He has no physical form, this is where he resides. This is where he plays.”*  He looked over my shoulder and back at me, with a sad smile on his face.   	*“Now, he’s chosen you as his new playmate. He knows you’re going to take my place. Look at my journal again, look at the drawings, you’ll need to remember.”*

He turned to walk away, leaving me feeling completely helpless in my own lucid dream.  	

*“Oh and Rami...don’t turn around.”*

I didn’t, but my entire being was willing me to. It’s that same feeling of anxiety you get when you’re home alone at night and you have the feeling something is watching you. A crushing, horrifying feeling. I woke up in a cold sweat and did as he said, I looked over the journal and in addition to scanning the drawings, I found a theory Milo had documented in between the pages of his journal; 	

*“An idea is manifested through suggestive stories and cultural signifiers, we can plant ourselves, a character or a concept into our subconscious and our dreams with enough hints both subversive and subliminal. An idea, be it malicious or noble, can grow and manifest in one mind before being shared to the masses through any kind of information supplement.”*  

The second section detailed a supporting theory;  	

*“Within every story told, fictitious or semi-biographical, exists a universe that we have created that is as real as our own. For how can we truly know if our reality is more valid than the one we have created? How can we truly know we have not just been added into a story of our own by a neutral writer we know as “god”? This reality is as malleable and relevant as the one within which we dream. Our dream world or “coma world” it can be argued, are the realities and our concept of reality is but a dream in itself that our brain creates to escape the chaos, uncertainty and pain of our dreams.”*

You’re probably painting a very good picture of what is happening right now.

I’ve attached an image of the man in this story and i’m sure you’re all familiar with him.  If you are, you’ll understand why i’ve done this.  Why i've made you aware.	There is no Ramiel, that name is a subliminal plant in itself, it means “Dreamer” in Arabic. I described him perfectly for you as a defence mechanism against what is going to happen in the coming weeks, months and years. I gave you plenty of physical aspects for your brain to put together, you only know a basic layer of who he is so that your brain can put in the key elements which will make you trust him. 

You know, it's funny, but I found out what Milo meant by ""Dream"", it's an acronym. 

""**D**ream **R**ami **E**vil **A**lways **M**anifests.""

That's where I got the idea for Rami.

He exists now to help fight off *“him”*.  Because now you’ve read this, read my experience and Milo’s, you're aware on a subconscious level...and he needs new playmates.

 This is no warning, that implies you can do something to change it. You can’t, your dreams are his playground, not yours.  	

You can shrug this off as another horror short if you like, if that makes you feel better and sleep easier. But he doesn’t just strike the night you fall asleep, he strikes when you allow your dreams to become more open and easier to mould. He only enters when the reality is in flux.  But with Ramiel in your head now too, you have a guide, a protector, to help you.  I didn’t. 

At least Milo is at peace, hopefully I will be soon too. I've been putting off sleep for days, I can't keep doing it much longer.  

 I’m beginning to feel drowsy, I took a large amount of sleeping pills before writing this last section, I can’t put off sleeping forever. I don’t know whether i’m going to wake up or not, but at least you’ve all been warned about him. Feel free to reverse google image search the hosted image, learn about him and if you do feel a sense of familiarity, please be careful.

Dream of Ramiel, you will be safe. 

I wish you all the best, you might not know my name or my face, but do not forget my story.  I will do my best to answer any of your questions in the comments later. 

Do not forget about him. 

Because believe me, he won’t forget about you when you fall asleep.

The worst thing about all this? I'm not sure ""he"" stays in the dream world anymore. When Milo looked at me, I think I mistook his expression and his gesture. At the time, I thought he was crying and happy, stretching his hand out to shake my hand.

 Now, I think he was terrified to see his worst fears manifested in the real world and he was stretching his hand out to stop ""him"" getting to me in the real world. 

Why say this now? Well, i've been getting steadily drowsier, and I've felt something breathing down my neck for the last 20 minutes. 

Who knows, maybe it's just my paranoia... 

Sweet dreams.

afewsmallrepairs,11,,48,1rff0q,,186,"There's always some chipper real estate agent waiting at the door with her flyers and her too-big smile and her nails painted to match her pants-suit.  They're nosy, and smothering, but today I see that this one is busy with a bright young couple, pointing out how much eastern light the kitchen gets with one perfectly-lacquered finger, the same goddamn shade of melon-red as her smart little blazer.  I still take a flyer from the cheery wicker basket in the front hallway, out of politeness more than anything.

The house smells like cookies.  It's an old realtor trick; make someone think that they could be happy in this strange new place, picture yourself cozied up on the couch with a plate of fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies and a mug of hot cocoa and suddenly the price doesn't seem quite so steep.  People want to feel like they're home.

It's a candle, I think.  Smells sour-sweet and artificial.

I realize suddenly I've been standing alone in the foyer for a few minutes, staring aimlessly into the house.  Where to begin?  The living room, I guess.

There's a big ugly faux-leather couch along one wall.  The cheap kind you find at Big Lots.  It doesn't serve much except to fill up the space.  It's flanked by two particle board end tables, little doilies on top of these.  Miss Melon-Red Blazer doesn't have much of a sense of style if this is her handiwork.  The room looks like a scene straight out of a 1980s Sears catalog.  I can feel one of my headaches coming on like the low rumbling of summer thunder on the horizon.

There are little dimples on the walls, paint covering old nail holes left behind from family photos that once hung there.  Scenes of summer vacations, children playing, smiling happy faces.  You only put up pictures if the people in them are smiling, right?

Well, the realtor hasn't put up any pictures.  The room feels empty, skeletal without them.

I move into the bathroom.  Nothing special here, more mementos from Walmart in the form of a seashell-shaped soap dish and a tacky plastic shower curtain, but I've found the cookie-scented candle so I blow it out with deep sense of satisfaction.

There are two bedrooms.  One at each end of the hall.  I choose the one to my right, feeling faintly like Alice in Wonderland as the real estate agent babbles away in the sunny kitchen's eastern light.

It's a small bedroom.  The baseboards look brand new even though the house is several decades old; whoever replaced them was an amateur.  This looks like a shitty piecemeal job done by someone without nearly enough time or care.  It's a shame, is what it is.  This would all have to be redone.

They've set up this room as a home office but it should be the children's bedroom.  Where the thrift-store desk and bookshelf sit I can picture two tiny pink beds with matching flowery comforters, sweet shiny stickers placed haphazardly across each headboard as little girls sometimes do.

The headache is no longer approaching, it's *here,* spidery sensations of dull pain spreading across my brain.  I tap my knuckles against the space between my eyes but it holds fast.

Focus.  I brace myself against the doorframe and there it is, the telltale trace of someone's childhood, tiny little tic-marks carved in the wood to indicate height and its progression through time.  I run my fingertips along these marks, still so visible through the fresh coat of paint.  It even looks like someone tried to sand them off -- who would *do* something like that?  Who would try to erase the remnants of someone's *life?*

If I don't leave I might faint, all the blood is in my head with the headache so I do leave, I move down the hall to the other room.

This one is the master bedroom.  Looks like they couldn't afford a bed to properly stage the scene, so this one feels even emptier than the den.  The walls have been repainted, a cheerful robin's-egg blue, but it's wrong.  It's all wrong.

They did a fantastic job covering any sign of the fire but this color, I *hate* this color, it clashes with my bedspread and I would've never slept here beneath this hideous shade of blue -- though there were many nights I suppose I didn't sleep, I lay awake for hours trying to comprehend what had gone wrong, where he was and why he thought he could fool me.

I drop to a knee to touch the outlet in the wall.  It's new, of course, they would've had to replace it.  Faulty wiring that causes fires, well, that just wouldn't do.  When the bank takes a house it can't sell one with such a serious problem.  Sometimes things need to be replaced, resold.  A “fixer-upper”, that’s what they’d call it.

The headache is in full force now yet a small smile tugs at the corner of my mouth when I remember everything he'd promised to do to this damned house, all the little projects he swore up and down he'd finish someday to make this place perfect for me, things that went forgotten when he decided his energy would be better spent fucking any secretary at the office that looked his way.

It wasn't hard.  I went to the library two counties over and did research on arson.  I was careful, used the private browser on Google Chrome and still cleared the history, wore a wig.  I'd seen enough about Casey Anthony to know how careful you have to be, even if she *did* get off -- but no one will ever truly believe she was innocent, she'll be a pariah forever and that's simply not how I planned to live the rest of my life.

I'm really sorry about the children.  My daughters.  I truly am.  I didn't know they'd be in our bed that night.  They were supposed to be at a friend's house but they came home early, someone had pulled someone else's hair and that set everything off like a line of terrible fateful dominoes and the headaches were getting worse and it was probably all for the best anyway.  I didn't do anything that couldn't be fixed with a few small repairs, both to the house and my life.

It makes me so *angry.*  He was still acting like father of the year when every night for months he slipped under the sheets beside me, reeking of some other woman's sex?  He couldn't even bother to take a shower and rinse the stink off his dick but he was still being a model dad, letting our daughters snuggle next to him when the boogeyman came in the dark and mommy wasn't there because she was away at her own mommy's, the perfect alibi for when the police came to tell her I'm sorry ma'am, there's been an accident, could you please come with us?

I'm still crouched next to the outlet when I hear Miss Melon-Red Blazer behind me, inquiring politely if there's anything she can help me with.  The bright young couple has gone and it smells like she's relit the candle in the bathroom.

I straighten, tucking a strand of the long blonde wig behind my ear and smiling in the way that makes members of the service industry smile back at me.

I explain I'm just looking.  The price on the house is so *low,* though, what could possibly cause such a dramatic drop in this recovering economy?

The real estate agent's smile falters and she hesitates.  I know she's bound by law to tell me, to explain what happened here and why the pricetag on a little creampuff in a nice neighborhood is next to nothing.

I know the old saying about returning to the scene of the crime, how dangerous it is and how not careful I'm being right now, but something in me can't resist because I can still see the little matching beds, the stickers across the headboards and the tic-marks on the doorframe and something inside me *needs* to hear her say it, to quantify each and every step I took to get here.

""Well,"" she says slowly, ""about a year ago, there was a fire...""

I nod and smile and as she tells me my story in her own words and somewhere in the back of my skull the headache lets go, the pain in my brain dissipating at last, leaving behind just me and the real estate agent in my old bedroom, standing in the same place where about a year ago my plan went into motion and I set my husband and children aflame.

lynzo,20,,64,1r79t5,,182,"Through years of failed attempts to have my own kids, I yearned for children of my own, well, used to. 

I would travel for hours just to baby-sit my nephews while Helen (my sister) goes for their fortnightly romantic dinners to ""keep the flames of passion going"", in her words.

Playgrounds and parks were my favourite hunts. Toddlers old enough to walk would sometimes totter their way to the bench I'm sitting on just to smile at me. Young children would come up to me and play 'pretend' with me. It's quite a strange phenomenon, but without my trying to, children takes a liking to me. Of course, I'd gotten strange looks from parents, as though I dangled a carrot in front of their children's noses to lure them to me. There were carrots, but just not fr.

I met my BF, Luke, (now husband) some years ago. In the beginning stages of courtship, he would just look at me and smile, and I just thought he was just smitten with me. He's gotten me smitten quickly enough too, with his honeyed tongue. He always seem to know the right things to say. He'd still continue to look at me, and then just smile.

It was only some months into our relationship that I found out he could see spirits. His childhood was shaky when he first realised no one else saw the paler beings. He had since gotten used to them as they would either wander aimlessly or just stay rooted to a spot. Apart from seemingly looking at him, they don't try to communicate with him.

One day, a few months after finding out about his ability, he told me he has something to tell me. For one, he isn't the secretive or romantic type so I guessed it wasn't to propose. He held my hands and looked at me straight in the eye, and said, ""Umm... How should I put this..."" After a few false starts, impatient me started losing my cool and he finally got it out, in the crudest way he could put it (I know I deserved it), 


""You have three little ones following you since the day I met you and that's the reason why I looked your way and smiled at you. I've been wondering, but why are they following you?""


He went on, with a matter-of-factly tone, to explain that the children at the playground were not approaching me, but the little ones following and sometimes playing around me, and that the little ones aren't like the usual spirits he have seen but are much smaller (thus the name ""little ones""). Whenever he just looked and then smiled at me, the little ones were playing with each other and dancing around me. He had never seen other beings interact with one another before. Despite it being a hot day, the chills and the cold in my chest made the weather more bearable.

Before this, I had a failed relationship with a man who loves children as much as I did, but just upped and left, the day after I was discharged from the hospital for my third miscarriage.

horriddaydream,16,,67,1r68c5,,173,"My father always taught me to be kind to everyone.

There was this garbage dump close to my home; I can't say anybody got a thrill out of living closely to the wretched thing, for it stunk all to Hell and the trucks constantly entering and exiting could be an extreme annoyance. I walked on the outskirts of town frequently past midnight, which you may say is stupid, especially if you saw my build and how small of a person I am, and just how difficult it would be for me to protect myself from anyone. 

A few times as I passed by the always-opened gates of the dump, I also passed the man who would enter their limits every single night.

As shady as he was, he had a lot to say.

His name was Terrance and he had been staying in the dump at night ever since it had opened back in 1980. He had long, straggly hair and he claimed that ""this area was just too dry; the job shortage was unbelievable."" He would probably never have his own house. I felt the upmost of pity for him and sometimes I even welcomed him to walk with me. Everybody always seemed to know Terrance. He was like the friendly neighborhood hobo. They would nod to him, wave, give him a few dollars, thank me for being so kind to him even though I would shrug it off and whisper that he was simply good company. 

I asked him where he went during the day and he just said ""everywhere."" He had a huge, black satchel that he slung over his back that probably contained normal homeless materials like paper towels, maybe a few little scraps of food. It always smelled but he smelled in general, though I was too nice to say anything. He claimed that there was a hollowed-out truck near the far side of the garbage dump and he would stay there at night because it was warm, and it was shelter. 

It made me want to cry; just the situation that this poor man was in.

I lived with only my father and so on occasion I would invite Terrance home to have a warm meal, and my father was more than happy about this. He was a kind man as I was a kind young adult, and he completely understood that my heart was in the right place. Terrance knew everything about our family in only a short amount of time and he never once took advantage of us. He was just a man who had no direction after losing his way.

Terrance disappeared for a couple of days. I peered in through the gates of the garbage dump, thinking twice about entering. 

I walked to the back and noticed that there was nobody inside the shell of the truck that he had described to me a many of times. But as I peeked inside the windows, I saw many black satchels just like the one that Terrance was always carrying. Most of them were empty, but others were still shut tightly and looked full. 
I reported the scene.

The cops had found small children of all shapes, sizes, ages, and genders inside the bags. He had been living off of them for years. 

There was a lack of missing children in the area, though some were found to be local. Nobody knew where they had all come from.

He had been inside our house. He had been inside my head.

Now he was nowhere to be found.

horriddaydream,15,,57,1razjr,,151,"A new job with a bad boss with very little pay with customers that I didn't really like. 

That was the make-up of my new job at the bookstore.

We were called ""The Book Chefs"", a little shop on the corner of 6th &amp; Weston Street, whose name I didn't quite understand aside from the fact that, as employees, we were permitted to prance around in these aprons that wore the name of the store, and help customers find the books that they were seeking.

One day as I was stocking the shelves I felt a tug at the back of my apron and I smiled as I whipped around, figuring it was probably one of the other employees attempting to get my attention so they could tell me a funny workplace joke.

There stood a man in front of me, short, hunched, with thick glasses and a balding head - and he appeared to be mentally challenged. ""Hi, Pretty.""

""Uh…"" I caught myself, wondering if I should say hello and ask him what he needed, or respond to his compliment. ""Are you looking for anything in particular, sir?""

""You're pretty,"" he snorted again and then he walked out of the aisle, never taking his eyes off of me. It took a few seconds for me to process the fact that he had walked out of the aisle completely backwards. I watched him walk from aisle to aisle and he watched me, too. A half an hour later and he still hadn't left.

I did what any normal person would do; I told my boss at the back of the store.

The conversation was short and sweet. My boss picked up on the fact that the man was a bit slower, and she reasonably questioned him, ""Are you with somebody, sir?"" He said, ""No, I am by myself"" and she said, ""Are you looking for anything?"" ""No."" ""I'm sorry but you can't stay here all day. If you don't need anything, would you mind leaving?"" 

He crept out of the store, backwards again, and he gave me a wave as he disappeared around the corner. I felt barf in my throat.

That night as I got off of work, my eyes darted all over the back parking lot as I went to fetch my bicycle from the rack. My boss was arranging things inside the building but there were no windows along the back and so suddenly I felt eerily alone. It didn't take long for me to notice that somebody had cut the wires where my bike was located, and it was missing. I groaned and felt the urge to cry. That was a brand new bike and now I had no way home. I immediately panicked and decided that I would have to ask my boss for a ride. She was in the backroom, so I strode over to the door and began to rap on it slowly.

""Janet?"" I asked, hoping she would hear me from inside. Then, louder again. ""Janet!!""

The sound of my bike spokes being kicked could be heard from the woods behind the bookstore. My head jerked around and there stood the man from earlier. 

My heart sank in my stomach.

""Don't come near me.""

He took a few zig-zaggy steps in my direction, holding a small bag out in front of him as he worked his way across from the parking lot. It took him quite a few seconds to get to me from where he had been located and I froze in place as he came within feet of me. 

""I want to show you something,"" he said in his slow, soft voice.

""Please go away.""

He placed his hand inside his brown, leather bag and pulled out a book. Then he pulled out another. He stacked them on the ground next to himself and he nodded toward them. ""I like books.""

I played friendly, afraid he would hurt me if I didn't. ""What series is that?""

""Skin,"" he replied.

He grabbed one of the books off of the pile, and he neared me until he was within such a close distance that I could feel his breath on the front of my face. Then, he shoved the book into my hands.

It was still warm.

It was bound with human skin, stitched with real stitches, still bloody and damp.

My terrorizing screams had scared him away. I'm not sure that they ever found him. 

He had left one of the books in the parking lot in his quick getaway. There were no words written on the pages, but the police suspected that he had been using them as journals.

Odyssey_The_Crip,45,,47,1r4dm5,,148,"Fuck me.
I was told to come here by a friend of mine, having never heard of nosleep. personally I'm not really on board with the idea of having a community of people read my story for personal pleasure, but hey, what ever. 
I guess a little bit of back story is needed here. I live on the nice end of Vancouver city, with my grandmother. I'm in secondary school, and that school is in my general posh-ish neighborhood.  

2 days ago I was Getting home from a long-ass boring day at school, I decided to Fuck around on DayZ until either I died, or fell asleep at the keyboard. At around 11:30 my Dog, Buddy, Decided to be the most annoying little shit possible. So i turned my computer off, and put the little fucker's leash on. At this time of night, the whole block was lights out. I Could barely see 15 feet.
10 minutes of walking later I began to feel a bit paranoid, street light's were flickering, fog was getting thicker. Buddy, on the other hand, was  trotting along rubbing his little schnauzer face in the frosted grass. 
Then, he stopped. Dead in his tracks, then buried his head in my calves. I urged him to keep moving, and after much encouragement he reluctantly followed.
I rounded a corner, going back toward my place, when i spotted a figure in the fog, a big one. Thinking nothing of the fact, just someone else enjoying the fucking weather or something. 
As we got closer buddy started barking, crazily. I urged him to shut up, lest he wake the neighbors. 
Then I got a good look at the figure. It was a man, 6'7 about, pale, He had a brown tweed waist coat, a brown tweed fedora and some brown baggy suit pants. 

As we neared him Buddy grew more and more frantic.
That's when I noticed his smile. The scariest fucking smile you will ever see. He looked like he won the lottery, got laid and inherited a mansion within a period of 2 minutes. It stretched from ear to ear, a yellowed, fake smile.
God, i wish i could have unseen it.
I was within about 3 feet of him, then the smell hit me, It was a mix between pure decay, shit, aged cheese. 

Then, he stopped right in front of me. and said in the most strange voice, like an elderly man trying to be smooth.

""You have a cute dog there, boy.""

""Uh, yeah, thanks.""
I guess something in my voice must have pleased him. or something, cause he chuckled a sick, smokers laugh. I began to move away from him breaking eye contact. Looking back on it, I should have just fucking ran.

He grabbed my arm

""Do you want to see my dog?""
I looked down, and i realized he had a leash too. He yanked on it, and trailing blood, Came the corpse of a maggot riddled dog.
I threw up in my mouth, This thing that was once a dog was missing patches of white fur, it's skin was turning green, bits of skin were missing, it's ear was ripped and an eye was gone. I couldn't even tell what the dog's fucking breed was.

Through his smiling teeth he said.

""Pet the dog""

My dog was oddly quite this whole time,i missed his barking.
I tried to get away, he tightened his grip on my arm then he dug his finger nails into me.

""Pet the dog""

""Please, No"" was all that came out of my mouth.
His smile drained instantly. Into an angry twisted frown, teeth still showing. 

""PET THE FUCKING DOG"" He screamed. yellow spittle flying from his mouth. my arm was turning red from the irritation his brown fingernails were causing me.
I had no choice but to pet the dog. I reached down slowly and ran my free hand along its back. The fur and skin began to peel back as maggots crawled along my palm. My hand was covered in a clear, slimy film. 
He let go of my arm, then shoved me. I landed flat on my ass on the pavement, Then i took off running. My dog was sprinting along with me. Then i heard him laugh, then scream.

""NOW I WANT TO PET YOUR DOG.""

My blood went cold.

I heard pounding on the pavement behind me, and a dragging. 
He was coming after me, pulling his dog along with him. Running 2 straight blocks, i ran down my alleyway, my house was at the end of the block. I flew down the alley, still hearing his laughter and slamming footsteps behind me. I got to my house, ran up the stairs and fumbled for my house keys. As His laughter grew in volume to an unbearable height, i got the door open shoved my dog in then slammed it, and locked it. not even a full second after I locked the door, there was a slam on it. 

He had ran into the door. 

This slamming continued for 20 minutes and then, silence. I waited 5 minutes then called the cops. in less than 10 minutes, they were here. I told them exactly that what happened, they told me they'd book the guy. Until then they told me not to leave the house.

not 5 minutes after they left, i was asleep on the couch with my dog.
I was awoken to the sound of a door bell ringing. I practically jumped off the couch, ran into the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife, and went to the door. thinking to myself, 

""I'm gonna kill this bastard.""

I Flung open the door knife in stabbing motion.
No one was there, Nobody.
Then I looked down, And threw up. 
The fucking dog corpse was sitting there, in a pool of blood.
Nailed into the dog's head was a note

""I don't like it when they run.""

Right now I'm sitting in my house, With no one but my grandmother, who is too sickly to get out of bed. My parents and my little brother are out of town at a dude ranch in the interior of the province. 
Fuck dammit.

EDIT: I'm sorry if there's any spelling mistakes, grammar errors, or punctuation issues. I'm shaking right now

UPDATE: He was standing outside my window today. just standing there, unblinking. i was frozen, and a minute after still eye contact, his head started violently shaking. Like only that part was having a seizure. I ran to grab my camera and he was gone. That spasm his head was having, paired with the smile. was utterly terrifying.

acidmutt,40,,35,1r1qip,,139,"I have a problem and a fear, I fear I am not from here or am even human. 


Ill start with the basics and excuse me for spelling mishaps for I am writing this out via mobile device. I am supposedly a eighteen year old female. Currently living in Canada, although I hail from Debrecen, Hungary. I moved to Canada when I was ten years old. For as long as I can remember I have questioned what I am. Certain signs have always been there. I feel things I'm sure others do but most don't, I see things and I talk to things. 


First weird occurrence, I do not remember life in Hungary at all. I only remember from the age of ten and up. It feels like I've only been alive for eight years. Second I don't know where my parents are. I lived with a woman named Tina and a man named Marco since I moved to Canada up until I moved out a couple months ago. They tell me they adopted me, and that my Hungarian parents went missing and were never found. 


I feel cold all the fucking time. My feet and hands always feel like ice blocks, to the point where my boyfriend can't take the chills he gets when I put my hands around him at night. In the summer even on the hottest days I am always wearing a sweater and avoiding the shade. I love the sunshine. In the winter months it is ten times worse. I can feel my bones aching from being so cold. 


I can't swim, I float but I can't swim or ride a bike. People are either left handed or right handed, I am niether. I can't write worth shit with either of my hands. I try to only eat food I don't have to use silverware for. 


A polar bear follows me. I see him everywhere I go, tried to touch him once but he disintegrated into the air. I see dark figures that roam the streets at night, I see people in my mirrors that aren't there when I look behind me. I've gotten so used to seeing things I'm not even scared anymore. A few have spoken to me, they mainly ask for help. I helped one once but he burned me. 


I feel pain, and I bleed though. I pass out when I hold my breath, I have emotions. I look normal I think. Sorry for the male readers, I don't bleed once a month like I'm supposed to. I don't even have the organs I am supposed to, to reproduce. I have baffled x-ray techs and doctors everywhere. 


My dog not only hears me but he understands what I am saying. He can do all his tricks without hand motions, just my voice. No big? When my boyfriend tries to get him to do a trick just by speaking to him he doesn't know what to do until my boyfriend gestures along with the words. Tina and Marco tell me Oz (my dog) has been with me since and during Hungary. 


I've gone a week without food before I started feeling light headed all the time and gained hunger pains. I didn't lose any weight, I never do. And I never gain any. My teeth were so sharp they used to cut into my cheeks and cause discomfort, but last year the dentist filed them down for me. Baffled. 


I don't think I can see as well as a cat can in the dark but deffintly better then most other people. I've never had friends, people have always avoided me or left me out of activities. 


Tina is a ethologist and Marco is a paleontologist as their professions, why can't I remember.

Sleepwalking_t,34,,53,1r7w1t,,131,"I have been having sleeping problems for about 6 months now. I have troubles falling asleep and staying asleep. I also have issues with sleep walking, serious sleep walking issues. I live in a dorm, on the first floor, and right outside my dorm across the street is the smoke pit for my area. I once woke up sitting at the smoke pit in my pajamas sitting on the picnic table with my elbows on my knees, face in hands.

 
Please, hear me out, I know this doesn't seem supernatural, but I'm terrified and I don't know who to tell. I am going to continue with my sleep walking issues. 
I will not get into specifics on where I was but let's just say I was not in an area you would want to walk around alone at night. It was a community sleeping area, massive tent and I woke up sore, bruised, and covered in dirt. I figured I must have slept walked outside and fallen down. I have woken up standing in the middle of my dorm room, woken up sitting up right on my couch when I had fallen asleep in my bed. 


A few months ago I could not sleep for 2 days straight; no sleeping aids or cold medicine would work. Frustrated, I finally made a doctors appointment for my sleeping problems. I left out my sleep walking because I could loose my job if they knew I slept walked, and was prescribed Ambein. 
The first night on Ambein I still had troubles getting to sleep but they finally kicked in after an hour or so laying in bed. I woke up refreshed but a bit groggy, and got dressed for work. 


The next night on Ambein the pills kicked in quickly and I had , what I thought , to be a deep dreamless sleep. When I got into work my co worker laughingly asked me what the hell I called him for last night. 


"" What are you talking about?"" 


"" You called me last night, crying hysterically."" 


""What?!""


"" Yeah... I was about to get dressed and come over to check on you. You said , ' It's here Myke, it's here!'. Then you started snoring sooo... yeah figured you were just dreaming...""


Completely bewildered I apologized. I checked my call history and sure as shit, I had called him at 0447. 


Strange. I just played it off as a side effect of the Ambein. 
A few weeks went by and nothing else strange happened. I continued to take the Ambein. 


Sometime during the work day I went to show another co worker a funny picture I had saved on my phone when I noticed I had a lot of black photos on my camera roll. I selected the first one and it was my  dark room lit up from the flash. The next one of a different part of my room again lit up by the flash. This went on for 12 different photos: different parts of my room, dark, lit up from the flash. I downloaded an app so I could see the time stamp from the photos. I was definitely asleep; great, sleep me was taking pictures in my sleep.

 
I have started waking up with bruises, cuts, and feeling sore for no particular reason. 


I was staying the night at my guy's house and he told me the next morning  I sat up out of bed and asked him: 


""Do you see it?"" 


""See what?""

 
Silence from me, then I laid back down.

 
He jokingly told me that was the last night he would sleep with me. We laughed but I felt terrible creeping the hell out of the poor guy. 


It's escalating, Ive started seeing things when I'm awake. I see a black form walking into my bathroom while I'm getting ready in the morning. I ignore it, there is no way in hell I'm going to investigate that. Things disappear from my room then show up in the same spot days later.

Magnum6,33,,77,1r5par,,126,"Born in the mid 90s, i grew up active, and was outdoors alot. However, as the technological age began, I found myself inside more and more. As I grew, i spent more and more time watching T.V., playing videogames on my Super Nintendo. And when the Sony Playstation came out, my parents couldnt pry me from the screen. As a consequence, my eyesight suffered. Slowly at first, but as i got older, it became an issue. It was never so bad that I couldn't see without glasses, but it was bad enough that i needed them to drive when i turned 17. However, as senior in high school i quickly lost my glasses and proceeded to drive anyways. No wrecks, no tickets. I thought that maybe my eyesight had improved over the few months that i had actually worn my glasses. Oh how I wish I had been right. Halfway between being 19 and 20, i picked up a job as a delivery driver. Easy at first. Until i had to start driving at night. The night I almost ran off the road because I couldn't see through the oncoming cars headlights, was the night I knew I had to get a new pair of glasses. The next day I made an appointment, and 7 - 10 business days later i had my new glasses. Nothing special. Just a simple blue metal frame with slightly skinnier than average lenses. I Wore them all day. And whenever someone asked how it felt to have new glasses, i smiled and would comically sing ""It's a whole new world"", you know, that cute little song from The Little Mermaid. Oh how right i was. As I prepared for bed that night, getting changed, taking a shower. It all seemed normal. Until I wore my glasses into my darkened bedroom. No light was on in my room. And i had foolishly turned off the hallway light before entering my bedroom. Now in total darkness, I realized just what real fear was. You see, with my slightly blurred vision of not wearing glasses, any shadow could be brushed off, simply because i couldn't focus and see what was just beyond the outer veil of darkness that covered them. But now, with those infernal glasses. I could see them clear as day. The creatures from monster stories. My own personal Boogiemen. All sitting around my room watching, waiting, inviting me to lay down and fall asleep right in their midst. Right in my own bed. I stood stunned. Terrified. Not Knowing what to do. When suddenly, one of them spoke. The most terrifying voice I had ever heard. ""Why not run away again child? It amuses us to watch you at night, oblivious to our very existence. Unaware that you lay right where we want you. Each and every night."" I stared blankly, and felt confused. Again? How could i have seen these creatures before and not remember it. Surely I would have some memory. But none came. As if to answer my question, it spoke again. ""Perhaps these will jog your memory."" It brought up its gnarled hand and un-clenched its fist, palm up, to reveal my original pair of glasses. A pair now almost three years old. That's when it hit me. I hadn't lost my glasses. But thrown them away. Into a river. Nearly twenty miles from where i lived. Now more afraid than anything, I did the only thing I could, I laid down in my bed. Removed my glasses, and watched as those terrible Boogiemen, again returned into those empty, featureless shadows, that surround each and every one of us every night as we lay down to sleep.",Glasses,203,nosleep
Dusteratops,14,,28,1r8rf4,,129,"It was a long day of work, and my face was covered in oil and grease of all sorts. I suppose I looked like a coal miner or a hobo as I walked down the road. It was evening, so the crowd wasn't too large. There were groups of ladies, making their way home and spouting the latest gossip. There were solitary people making their way with their head down and their ears plugged in. There was a peculiar man walking adjacent to me with the strangest clothes and a mullet. He wore a robe with a sweater tied around his waste. Then there was Rachel, ahead in the distance. She was my ex-girlfriend who didn't know how to cope with seeing me, so it always turned out extremely awkward. I immediately turned around and talked to the first man I could start a conversation with, who just happened to be the man in the robe. 

""Hey.""

""Hey..""

""Whats up."" 

""Just walking around. So you like to read?"" He spoke in the thickest accent, and I couldn't figure out exactly what is was.

I was carrying a book, and I do like to read. ""I suppose so, I want to be a writer."" I replied, and then we jumped into the thickest conversation about all of our favorite books and the way the world works. He was able to question all of my ideas, and had a detailed answer for each and every one of my questions. Its safe to say I learned a lot from him. 

When Rachel walked by, she simply waved and smiled. I nodded back, but I couldn't help but notice that she felt like something was funny. It must have been the dirtiness of my face though this weird secret humor just continued to resonate off the face of every passerby. It was unsettling.

Mid conversation he asked me what my name was, without even breaking from the previous sentence. I told him my name and reached out my hand to shake. He left me hanging and slammed his palm into his chest and proudly proclaimed ""I am Moko."" 

Then we jumped right back into our conversation, which went on for quite some time. The sky became dark, and we were the only people in the road. I asked him where he was from and he never told me. 

A large chunk of our conversation was about sanity, and the works of the insane. He seemed to know everything about them, and it was unsettling the way his knowing black eyes drilled into my soul. Yet I learned and thought and learned some more. 

He pulled out a napkin and refused the pen that I offered him. He wrote down my number after searching for his marker for about a minute. He promised to give me a call when he got home, for he did not have a cellular. Then we went our separate ways. Oddly though, he went back the way he came. 

There were two girls laughing when we split apart, and I figured it was because of the thick accent my new friend had when he yelled his farewell. 

""He has a funny accent, doesn't he?"" I asked the two girls.

They responded by looking at each other and laughing to some secret joke, then one of them said, ""Who does?""

""You know, that man with the mullet I was just talking to.."" they gave each other another look, but it was without humor. The skin on my neck began to stand on end. They walked away.

I know he has a loud voice. I know they heard and saw him leave. I know I am not crazy. I know- My phone rang. I answered.

""Hey Brian, its Moko. I was thinking I'd come visit you this Christmas. See you then.""

She snuck into a decrepit old house where she had arranged the meeting. She walked into a pitch black room where someone placed a bag over her head. He said something about not wanting to know each other's identities.

She wondered why someone would want to do this, and finally worked up the courage to ask. 

""I don't know... It soothes me. Knowing that I'm saving a child from facing this shit sack of a world. No one should have to suffer this hell hole.""

She didn't really know what to say so she just stayed silent.

She could hear the man fumbling through some metal objects.

___________________________________________________________________________________

Sunday night, maybe 2am.

I had just shut down my computer after my nightly gaming session.  I was laying in bed, browsing reddit on my phone, and debating whether or not I was hungry enough to eat another can of spaghettio's, or if it would even be worth the trouble of walking downstairs and waiting for it to heat up. I'm not sure what made me notice it, what actually snapped my senses to the realization...but it was suddenly too **quiet**.

Granted it was 2am, so its not like I was expecting any sort of noise in particular.  My roommate had fallen asleep hours ago, but it was just so *still*.  I'm not sure if any of you know what I'm talking about, but it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  I felt like I was in a vacuum; it was utterly oppressive. 

I'm not sure how long I sat there, waiting for something, before the glow.  A deep blood red light had flooded the hall and oozed under my door, and it was slowly pulsing.  I wanted to call out, to tell my roommate to fuck off, but I knew it wasn't him. I just knew. I don't think I could've formed words if I tried.  The vacuum sensation I had felt was gone, and now, sitting in my tiny bedroom I felt like I was under a microscope. That terrible “like you're being watched” sensation I read about so much hit me like a brick.  I can't explain how exactly I felt, a mix of horror, dread, and confusion.  I wanted to bolt, but I wouldn't have been able to force myself to open that door if I tried.

I managed to shuffle off my bed, and to the floor.  I opened up my nightstand, reaching for my revolver. I needed to feel that cold steel, and the heft of it in my hand. As soon as I picked it up, I was at a loss because for the first time, it just felt like a toy in my hand. I looked back to the door to that glow, and felt completely powerless.  There was a shadow now, someone was standing outside my bedroom door, and I felt like I might as well have been holding a nerf gun.  

When the long scratch started, I felt nauseous.  Like I was 17 again, smoking weed in my room when I thought I had the house to myself and my mom knocked on the door asking why the fuck it smelled like burning leaves in the hall. That sudden weight in my stomach, the sudden dryness in my mouth.

It was like a nail being dragged down the door, from the top of the doorway to the bottom.  I followed the sound with my eyes, and when it stopped, I heard a voice.  “Hear” might not be the right word, because it came from inside my head.

*Michael. Please put down the weapon.  We do not want to harm you, and I do not plan on doing so. Your weapon would be useless anyways, but I respect your autonomy. May I enter?*

This had to be a dream; a nightmare. If every waking moment since I...heard that voice hasn't been an eternity in a waking hell, I might be able to convince myself that it was.

*I wish to speak with you, Michael. We have much to discuss. May I enter?*

There was no fucking way this was happening.  I'm...lucky I didn't need to, because I couldn't have spoken if I tried.  Whatever it was must have known there was no way I would have let it in, because it answered me anyways.

*No matter, you will see us in due time.  We would like to invite you on a journey, Michael.  You will come with us, and see everything you have always wished to. We've known you for a long time, you would say “years”.  You have a week to decide, we will not force you. You will require no luggage, no currency. You will want for nothing.  You will not see your family or friends again, but in time you will cease to worry about them.*  

 *We respect your decisions. I do think however, you only have one real choice.  I will see you soon.*

__________________________________________________________________________________

Then it was all just over...I might have sat there for hours. At some point, I got up and sat on my bed.  When I finally mustered the courage to look out the window, it was already dawn. When I heard my roommate get up and go to work, and finally figured it was safe to open my door.

I am a shell.  I don't know what to do you guys.  I haven't slept. I forced myself to eat something yesterday, but everything tastes of cardboard.  I booted up my computer, but now my *life* just feels like a game I'm sick of. 

I forced myself to talk to my parents the other day, and smile at work, but any interaction I have feels forced and artificial...like I'm just going through the motions. There was no way I could mention what happened Sunday night to anyone. 

He was right...I have only have one choice.  If I don't go with him...with *them*, I'll be trapped in this empty hell. My life feels like a hamster in a cage.

Who the fuck knows what will happen if I **do** go with them...?

kimmiekissies,13,,29,1rgt5c,,121,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before?????????

ephique,32,,32,1r5tqd,,95,"Me and my brother were spending some quality time playing old video games from our childhood, just chilling on the couch in my upstairs bedroom when the electricity in the entire house went out. It was just us two home at this point, and it was pitch black outside. In desperation of finding our way through the house we used our phones to take flash-shots, giving us a small update of where in the big upstairs level of the house we were; trying to make our way to the staircase leading down.

We finally did, and from there it wasn't ridiculously hard to manage ourselves to find some candles and what not. We did what we could to drain out the time while waiting out the electricity-problem. Eating sausage rolls, gossiping and having conversations about what games to play once the electricity was back.

It did come back after a couple of hours. We already found ourselves in the kitchen, positioned in the lower level of the house so we brought some snacks and drinks before we inevitably decided to continue our journeys into Donkey Kong: Country, Super Mario World and Castlevania 4 on the Super Nintendo.

Upon starting our Super Nintendo my brother asked me where the remote for the tv was, since we both were too lazy to actually use the power button on the tv. Although the remote was nowhere to be found. While looking for the remote, which we both swore has never been anywhere else than on the coffee-table next to the couch, the electricity ran out again.

slightly2spooked,45,,22,1re11f,,87,"NoSleep, I need your help. 

Where do I begin? I started working volunteer shifts at my local community centre about 6 months ago. I love my job, I get on well with all my co-workers, but something's been bothering me recently. More than bothering me, actually. 

There's been an attack on a child. 

Well - I can't call it an attack, exactly. Everyone's calling it an accident, but I can't believe that. 

Let me start over. This whole thing began when the centre began to hold saturday clubs - an hour or two, every weekend, when kids are given pretty much free reign over the place. We put on activities - cake baking, crafts, that kind of thing - and just generally keep an eye on the place.

We're also there to keep the kids out of the basement. I'd like to say before I start that I've never heard of anything being up with the basement before. I'm not a particularly superstitious person (or at least, I wasn't before all of this happened) and I don't scare easy. 

Basically, the kids have to stay out of the basement because there's a lot of junk down there that could topple over onto one of them, or otherwise get them in trouble. Just to reiterate, this is the only reason I was ever given for keeping them out of the basement.

But kids aren't satisfied by a simple 'it's dangerous down there'. They wanted to know *why*. 

Well, I spun them this cock and bull story about how I'd seen a monster down there once. The other volunteer that day, Julie, joined in on the fun immediately, and soon we had them all believing that there was something dark and horrible in the basement that would snatch them up and eat them if they ever went down there. We're talking about 5-10 year olds here, so the stories weren't particularly gory or scary - but they believed us pretty much right off the bat. 

Maybe that's why things went so weird. I'm sure those of you who've been around children know that they see the world in a different way to the rest of us - what seems to us like childish fantasy might as well be real life to them. 

Anyway. I told them that story three or four weeks before the incident. Every Saturday we'd have these kids in, and every Saturday the veteran members of the group would take on the duty of informing the new members of what horrific fate awaited them should they wander into the basement. With each telling, they'd add details. Some of them were actually very grim - they came up with one about a 'Victorian boy'  (bearing in mind that the community centre was only built in 1954) that had been eaten by the monster and still roamed the halls, crying out to go home. The details got more and more gory - they came up with the idea that the monster would 'mark' its victims with three slashes of its horrendous glistening claws - this was the same week we were showing the Zorro movies on the old projector. 

In short, it was beginning to seem as though 'Saturday Club' had turned into 'NoSleep Junior'. We had complaints from parents about their children being too scared to come in, and so my boss decided it was time to put a stop to the monster talk. We tried everything we could to get the kids to stop talking about it - we played non-monstery games with them, we made apple pie, we even passed the caretaker off as a 'professional monster hunter'. That kept them quiet for a while, and we began to hope that they'd lost interest altogether. 

In the meantime though, I began to feel more and more uneasy locking up the centre at night. I had no reason to be afraid - Julie or one of my other co-workers was usually waiting at the front desk for me in case there *was* trouble, and the Zumba fitness group usually hung around outside until we locked up anyway. In short, nobody could get in without one of us noticing. 

I mention that because the night before the attack I could have sworn I heard someone  - a small someone - crying, all through my lockup. It always seemed like the voice was coming from the next corner, but when I looked, there was nobody there. I even got Julie out to have a look - she said she couldn't hear anything, but I could tell she was concerned. Maybe she just wanted to get home early. I don't know. I told the police I hadn't seen anyone for definite, anyway. 

I wasn't working the next day, but that's when the attack happened. I don't know much about the details - the police told me that Julie heard crying and screaming from the basement, and went down to find two of our regulars, Tommy and Rosie, spattered with blood and crying. When she rounded the corner, she discovered a third child - I wasn't told his name, he was new - lying unconscious beneath a shelf. She confided to me later that while she'd told police the shelf must have toppled onto him, it looked more like he'd been hiding beneath it. 

What sent me to you guys, though, is the other thing Julie told me. Her first instinct, being a mother herself, was to pull the child out from under the shelf and make sure he was okay. He didn't have any of the injuries she'd expect in this kind of accident - no broken bones, not even a bruise. Instead, he had three bloody lines carved into his chest. Three large, horrible claw marks. 

When the police asked the other two children what they'd witnessed, they'd only say 'The monster got him'. The Centre is closed until further notice - I think they think there's some sort of psychopath living there. That's the logical explanation, but somehow I can't help questioning it. When I pass by the closed Centre, I swear I can hear a child crying inside - crying to go home. 

The boy is okay, by the way - apparently he's recovering at home, but he won't name his attacker. He'll only say that 'some*thing* got him'. I take a little comfort knowing that he's alright, but how long will it be before something else happens? Something worse? 

I'm afraid, NoSleep - what have I done?

I blinked.

Due to the stress of the situation, I can't really remember where I've been. I just remember fear and pain.

I don't know what's going on, but when I blink, I get ripped from where I am and I open my eyes to a new setting.

Right now, I'm trying my absolute hardest to not blink. I'm at a Best Buy on one of the laptops. My eyes are welling up with blood, and I don't think I can do this for long. I don't know what's going to happen to me. If I leave, I will check back when I can, if I can. My memory is slowly fading.

The only thing that I know for certain is that there is a man wherever I go. I can't see his face, but he looks to be in his late sixties carrying a duffle bag. He's here in the store. Watching me with a smile.

I don't know what will happen if I don't open my eyes. If I keep them shut, will this fix itself? I've gone to over a thousand different places today, and I need anyone's help. If you see a man bleeding from his eyes and mouth, it's me. Restrain me and don't let me go.

Do I need to talk to the man? 
I'm trying so hard not to blink.

One of the worst places I've been so far was an abandoned hospital where the man tried to ch

I don't exactly know where to turn, like the majority of the sub I'm assuming you share the same interest as me in the supernatural, the other side. I've always been intensely fascinated with it, usually the furthest I went was browsing /r/nosleep or heading into abandoned houses to sate my thirst for the creepy, although, the same routine things quickly became dull and eventually, I slowly got desensitized, bored. This was about the time I started reading 'recipes' for paranormal experiences.


The whole thing seemed awesome, the Midnight Man, One Man Hide and Seek, The Shoebox Telephone. All gave me chills, but I remained quietly skeptical the whole time. Fuck. Why did I have to be so blind. I still can't find the place to blame myself, I mean reading scary stories on the internet posted by a bunch of anonymous people, it would be stupid to take it all for fact, right?


Of all the rituals, one caught my eye, The Three Kings. I'm hesitant to post the link but I feel like it would be naive to think that no one would give it a quick search. http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wbo0u/please_dont_actually_try_this/ A blunt explanation of it would be a recipe where you can contact the dead, and ask them questions through two propped up mirrors.


After reading it I felt like I had to do it. I quickly spread it to a few friends and it wasn't long until hype was built upon the whole thing. Me and my best mate (For his sake i'll call him, Darcy), organized to do this when we had a few friends over for a small gathering whilst my parents were out for the week. Funny enough, at the time the thing I was worried the most about was it not working. We had tried a ouija board once at my request, and nothing happened, we all just sat there fingers on the cup for 10 minutes blaming each other for pushing it whenever it moved in the slightest. They all probably thought I was an idiot. So I thought I would give it a kick, my bright idea would be that we would all get absolutely hammered beforehand so that when it (surely) didn't work we would imagine that it did or at least get really scared in the process. Well at least we had the 'really scared' part down pat.


So everyone came at around 9:00pm yesterday, and it was all pretty normal, caught up, bitched about a few people, had some laughs and it wasn't until around 11:00pm that we started to set up. The atmosphere then was so... amusing of all things. We all giggled the whole time in our stupor, acting as if we were kids in primary school kids about to pull a really lame prank. It all seemed fun then. Of course I had to be the one who volunteered to be the one who sat the throne, eager to show my courage off to my friends. My lifeline was Darcy, if anyone was to hold the key between my life and death i'd gladly hand it to him.

For the sake of the story I'll skip all the tedious setting up and get to 3:33am. We were all fighting sleep by then and I think Sarah and Alistair were already gone, though we were sitting outside that door for so long it was hard for us to miss the time. When I had walked in I was immediately hit by the cool air, though this one wasn't the ghostly cold, it was literally fucking freezing from the fan that had been buzzing on for a few hours. Though something did feel off, it was either the fact that I was in a pitch black room holding a candle to my chest with a chair and two mirrors propped up adjacent to it, or it was that all of a sudden everything was quite. As if the world around me was devoid of life bar the constant drone of the fan. 


I sat down clutching the candle tightly, persistent to not let it go out, suddenly very aware to what i was doing. I remember shifting in my chair uncomfortably for a while but what follows that still remains hazy. I remember trying to call out for answers, ""Who's there"" ""What are you doing?"" ""Is there another side?"". None were answered, just silence, and the buzzing of the fan. I then said something stupid and heard giggling, assuming it was my friends outside I started cracking jokes. The more jokes I made the harder they laughed until I said ""Why arn't you responding, too scared to show your faces?"" and looked into the mirrors. Now, the huge cardinal rules of this recipe is not to look in the mirrors and around about this whole thing turned to fucking shit. The worst thing about looking into the mirrors isn't what I saw but rather the absence of it. I saw nothing, i saw the chair, the fan, but no me. I quickly looked to the other, and greeted by the same emptiness. Then the rumbling began, have you ever been in a house when a plane has flown overhead and the ground slightly shakes? It was like that except the sound emanated from the floor rather than the sky. It continued to get louder and louder until my eardrums felt as if they were going to burst and then I peed myself. The mirrors shattered and sent shards of glass everywhere and my candle was quickly snuffed out, and I screamed, boy did I scream, I legged it out of there like nobodies business and slammed the door behind me. Of course everyone was fast asleep but woken up with a few of my screams and sharp kicks to the ribs. They attempted to calm me down but i was flailing and screaming, I told them we had to get out of my house, but where do seven 17 year olds go at 4:00 am in the morning? Eventually I calmed down and tried to pass it off as a drunk hallucination which i knew was very impossible but it made my mind sort of at ease. 

We decided to get everyone up and camp downstairs in the living room. I felt safer with all of them around me and after much apprehension my tired state got the better of me and I drifted off to sleep. Last night was some of the worst nightmares i ever had, I saw my friends hanging and mutilated, I saw my childhood cat lay gutted on the floor, I saw myself smiling at a mirror. When i woke up, i was upstairs in the room. In between both mirrors, which had been shifted to face me lying on the floor. All my friends had left, when i called them they all gave me half ass reasons and some just avoided the question altogether. 


I'm scared. It is now 6:27 and starting to get dark again and I haven't been into the room since I woke up this morning. Help me, please. I don't feel alone in my house anymore.","Please, help. I screwed up.",109,nosleep
TheeMikeG,13,,33,1r8w1k,,84,"Let me introduce myself. My name is Mike Gordan and I exorcise demons for a living. Yeah, work is hard to find, but I get by. I was born into a normal, loving family, but everyone kind of went their separate ways a while ago. I have an older brother who joined the military, and my mother and father are both pilots, so they obviously travel a lot. After I graduated highschool and was in college for a few years I tried my hand at law. But after I failed the LSAT I got pretty down and didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. I dropped out of school and found myself struggling to get a job and even more so struggling to pay rent. 


Then I found Jesus. And by that I mean I was dumpster diving and found a KJV little orange bible inbetween a moldy sandwhich and a spent tube of toothpaste. When I got to the part about the end of the world and that 666 stuff I got interested, really interested. I’d go to the library and do hours upon hours of research. I learned about the Devil’s crossroads and the Grimorium Verum and the Lesser Key of Solomon and demonic sigils and how to summon them. I watched all eight seasons of Supernatural in two months and got a license online to be a priest. With my trusty orange bible in my pocket I scowered Craigslist for people who needed saving.


At first all I found were people that wanted their homes blessed, their babies baptised, or someone to perform a homosexual marriage. But I had a wealth of knowledge of demons and I wanted to do something a lot more meaningful. Then I found her. Her post was desperate. She claimed to be waking up with bruises and in different rooms or even places than where she had fallen asleep. I messaged her explaining that I was a priest who specialized in demon removal and that I would be happy to exorcise her home. For a modest fee of course. 


She replied immediately that she would pay me whatever I wanted, she just wanted to get rid of whatever was doing this to her. When I got to her house I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. No weird smell, no demonic symbols or texts, nothing. And the girl looked fine aside from some minor scratches and bruises. But she cried and cried and begged me to help her. It was pretty awkward because I’d never done this before, but I played confidence and expertise. I had her sit down in one of her wooden kitchen chairs and I bound her arms and legs to it. I took out my bible and began to read from a page I randomly flipped to. 


“All nations whom You have made Shall come and worship before You, O Lord, And shall glorify Your name, For You are great, and do wondrous things; You alone are God.""


And then she started to scream. Not a normal scream though, a deep, dark sounding scream. I dropped the bible. Mustering up my strength, confident in my knowledge, I snapped out of my state of shock and fiddled in my deep pocket for the plastic bottle of holy water I had purchsed online. I splashed some on her face and was horrified. Her face sizzled and burned. I’m talking like third degree. And that smell, my God that smell; like sulfur. By now she was thrashing wildly in the chair. I bent down and quickly retrieved the bible, then started again.


“And He changes the times and the seasons; He removes kings and raises up kings; He gives wisdom to the wise And knowledge to those who have understanding, He reveals deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, And light dwells with Him.” 


By now shit was falling off shelves, furniture was sliding around, the whole shabang. It was awesome. In my element now, and comfortable, I improvised.


“Jesus I ask that you cast out any and all evil spirits in, around or attached to this woman! Lord,  sanctify this follower of your word, and help me to command all demons to leave at once! I bless this woman, and damn you back to hell!” 


Then she vomited and passed out. Everything stopped moving and all was quiet. When she woke up, she had no memory of what had happened but said she felt much better. The color returned to her face and I knew it was gone. After I untied her she went to her purse and handed me a blank check.


Since that day I’ve been performing exorcisms, and I’ve done so many that things have slowed down almost entirely. I haven’t had a job in months, and rent is getting hard to pay again. So, I used my knowledge to make a deal where everyone wins. I’ve actually got a new customer right now. She’s struggling against the straps, but it’s useless. Once I put the demon in her, she’ll pay me anything to take it out.

BensonHedges1,4,,22,1r2xlz,,78,"I heard the coffee pot drip before my alarm even went off, bizarre, I don’t usually set a timer. I like to go to the gym before I have my coffee. Maybe it was my boyfriend being nice. He typically works the graveyard shift, and sometimes he comes home in the early morning to leave nice surprises. 


“Might as well get up” I said aloud to myself, since no one else was home. 


My cat was absent from the bed, which is also weird, he’s usually by my head in the mornings. As I stretch my legs and arms out, I notice an odd chill run up my spine. Surely it was the weather, New England has a way with inconsistent temperatures, and the blanket over me was not quite fit for winter. It’s November, that sixty-degree weather is bound to disappear sooner or later. I haven’t quite figured out the thermostat, we just moved in, and the heat only seems to kick in on times when I’m not home. Must be the reason we bought this place so cheap...and why people keep selling it. New England is not the place to have a busted heating system. This has been the biggest point of arguments since my boyfriend and I started co-habitating. 


“Get out of bed, you’re going to be late to your class…” 


I said this to myself a few times, in hopes to have motivation to get to the 5:15am class at the gym. I had no idea what time it was, but if the coffee pot is going off, it’ was creeping close to sunrise. I haven’t unpacked the alarm clocks yet, so my phone’s been the only thing reminding me what time of the day it is. 


I thrusted my arms to the floor and pulled my phone to my bed — 2:11 am. 


“What the fuck?! I’ve still got two-and-a-half hours of sleep…and why is the coffee pot on?”


I slipped out of the bed from the left side and stumble to the kitchen to turn off the coffee pot. I’m a coffee lover, but nothing smells worse than burnt-coffee. As I went to flip the switch to off, I realize the time isn’t illuminated on the pot. Directly above on the microwave - nothing. Damnit. The power went out! The drip-sound of the coffee pot was so loud, and it was too early. I was confused. I could even smell the lingering scent of fresh brewed coffee…but it was 2am, my mind must be playing tricks on me. 


I headed back to the bedroom, a little freaked out, but convinced it was just all a coincidence. This hallway seems so much longer in the dark, and I still haven’t gotten used to the layout of this condo. As I pass the bathroom, I notice a shadow out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head and didn’t see anything, except the shower curtain pulled all the way open. Since we’ve moved in, we haven’t used that shower…we’ve got a shower stall in the bedroom…much more convenient. Though, I am sure there was a logical explanation for it. 


When I get to the bedroom - another chill down my spine. This was uncomfortable, it was a winter chill I was feeling. I was sure of that. Something was wrong, but i couldn’t figure it out. 

I need to go back to bed.


I hop in the bed and pick the blankets from off the floor. As I turn on my side, I hear the heater click on. The electricity is back on…fantastic! I start counting sheep in my head to fall back asleep, and keep thinking…”how did the blankets end up on the floor?”


What feels like an hour later, my alarm finally goes off. The smell of burnt coffee has filled the condo, and now I’m frustrated. I should have just unplugged the damn thing. And where is my cat? I have most definitely woken up on the wrong side of the bed. I moved to the kitchen to pour some coffee - and it’s dry. Nothing. I must be imagining things. 


That chill again! I could feel the hairs spike up on my neck - absolutely razor sharp. I decided to skip the gym and start my morning. I remained timid, but continued with my normal routine. As I rummaged around the kitchen, I noticed my cat out of the corner of my eye. He was twitchy, and obviously anxious. 


A few years ago my cat had major anxiety problems, and he developed what my vet called - “Rolling Skin Syndrome”. When my cat got anxious, his skin would roll around his body, it looked almost as if he had a small gum ball moving around beneath his fur. Today that ball was most definitely moving.


He paced back and forth around the house with me now, seeming more comfortable now that I was up with him. Every time I moved to another room, he cautiously peeked around the corner, almost as if he was looking for something. We moved to the bathroom, I started to floss, and then I heard it…drip drip drip. I am sure it’s not the coffee pot, and the house starts to smell again. As I analyze my senses the smell become more pungent. Less of a coffee smell and more of a rancid scent. 


Drip drip drip…


I follow the noise, it seems louder now, and it seems like it’s coming from the bedroom. Surely I would have heard it loud and clear when I was in bed earlier…it seemed so distant then. I enter the bedroom, and my cat stopped dead in his tracks. His skin is rolling again and he appeared more on edge, tail straight in the air and it’s hairs following suit. And that chill, of course, it was back. And my sheets and blankets, on the floor again.


WHAT THE FUCK? 


I’m working from home today, and every time I walk by the bedroom, I get the chills. I’ve resorted to closing the door until I’m not alone. It sounds like the wind is blowing up against the windows in that room, but from where I’m sitting, the trees are as still as ever.

TheGroovyTurt1e,12,,21,1raatv,,75,"So I'm not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told, if only for my own piece of mind.  I'm an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously under-served community.  The hospital itself is old, its been standing since the late 1800s, it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium. 
I've never really encountered anything supernatural, but I haven't written off the existence of such phenomena.  That being said, a shadow in the night isn't enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the night.
So when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty well.  I'd have my admissions, I'd take care of the current patients without issue.  Then one night I got an admission, I'll call this patient Jerry.  Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital, to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any would be physician that trains at this facility.  He has a whole boat load of medical issues, kidney problems, diabetes, high blood pressure.  He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia. 
Before meeting Jerry I was told he's actually a really fun guy, he's always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here.  So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen, I was a little anxious.  The admission was done, the orders were placed and I didn't think more of it.  He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night.  It was around 2 in the morning when I went back to see Jerry.  I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up.  When I went in there, Jerry wasn't in his bed.  Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet, his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor. 
I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying... not crying, but rather whimpering as if he didn't have the stamina to make it a full cry.  I tried putting on a brave face and said ""Jerry whats going on?"" For an old guy, Jerry was quicker than I thought, and stronger than I would have believed.  He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him.  ""They won't leave me alone, they won't let me sleep, they won't let me eat."" 
 He continued on in this line of things the phantom ""they"" wouldn't let him do.  I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home.  As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this, I still needed the blood and this wasn't the first time I'd dealt with a confused older patient.  I helped Jerry back to his bed.  Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK.  Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better, maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient, it was something familiar.  I tied the tourniquet in place, then I cleaned his arm, found my vein and went for it.  I'm not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing. 
I was filling up my vial, it was about half way full, when Jerry started screaming, ""LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE!"" He began to jerk violently, somehow the needle stayed in place, but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerry's body was pulling it back.  I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm, but the needle didn't budge.  In shock I pulled harder, my efforts still could not budge the needle.  In response, I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing.  The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being 3/4 full to maybe being about 1/4 full.  After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerry's arm, leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise.  Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me ""Can you see them?""  I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room.  I walked back to the nursing station, one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming.  I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill.  With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep.  I made my way to the on-call room, which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital.  I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes.  All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerry's eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them. 
I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing, and a senile sick old man.  The only trouble is since then the shadows I've seen in dark rooms seem darker, the lights unable to pierce them.  The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings.  I'm not really sure what to make of it.  In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker, the tapping louder and now I can't shake a feeling that I'm being watched.  ",Night Float,96,nosleep
floydnimrod,21,,24,1rhxtb,,114,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Of course, that's when I woke up.",I just dreamed of the apocalypse. I probably won't sleep for a few days now.,138,nosleep
Charlies_friend,20,,7,1rhapg,,80,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,87,nosleep

Terzis28,17,,41,1r6la8,,58,"So, a while ago (about a year ago now) I was sitting on my bed with the laptop on my lap. Next to me was my desk with my lamp on it. I was using an MSN video chat with one of my female friends. 

After talking for a couple of hours with my friend she messaged me (we both did not have microphones) and asked ""What is that kid eating? haha"" i simply replied ""What are you talking about?"" She stated that there was a kid sitting next to me with his hands at his mouth, as if to be chewing and gnawing either on his hands or something that he was holding. Chills ran through my body, but i soon realized that she was most likely messing with me.

I replied ""Seriously, stop messing with me"". She seemed like a pretty good actor considering she wasn't laughing or smiling at all. ""I'm not messing with you, I was just curious as to what he was eating"". At this moment I was getting a bit worried and decided to put her to the test. ""I want you to swear on your life that right now, you see a child next to me who looks like he is eating something"" I requested. ""I swear on my life, that is what I see"" she replied. I was pretty worried at this point and just when I thought I couldn't get much more creeped out, my lamp turned itself off.

I know it wasn't a power surge because my alarm clock was still on, and the standby light on my TV.

This could just be a strangely timed sequence of coincidence, but it sure did freak me out. I left the room immediately.",Child Eating,99,nosleep
Maniac_Mortician,8,,18,1r4jq5,,56,"I am surrounded by death. Mr. Jones on the prep table, currently expelling the blood that gives us life. Mrs. Loughlin is dressed on the side table, waiting for the casket to be delivered. The 4 year old Ryan awaits my oven in the walk in fridge. And the 23 year old, Jill Brewer, is lying in the casket, sitting silently still, waiting for her family to pass by, look upon her pale, lifeless shell, and weep. 

Jones finishes pushing the blood out of his system, and I set to work. I use the needle injector to put the wires into his upper and lower jaw. I pull tight, and twist, like sealing a loaf of bread. He looks at me, with his eyes partially opened and his mouth firm. I grab 2 eye caps, lubricate with Vaseline, and grab my tweezers. One tug of the top lid, one placement of the bottom, and then again to the other eye. He no longer looks at me. He now looks like hes sleeping, if sleeping involved 2 hoses connected to the arteries and veins of your neck. His naked corpse is covered in purple and blue bedsores. They come with the elderly, and especially the cancer patients. Most of these dead who pass from cancer are older, and the older they are, the less they have moved in the months that the infliction slowly ate the remaining life from them. 

A quick threading of the needle send me into cleanup. I baseball stitch his neck, scrub him down, and rinse again. Some skin is slipping on his left hand. Nothing the embalming fluid shouldnt take care of. If it continues, I resolved to just wax it before putting him in the last suit he'll ever wear. 

I look up, just in time to see my colleague wheel in the dark blue casket. The younger worker is  guiding it through the door. He looks pale. *Id probably use the pink dye for him rather than peach. Would make him more lifelike.* I plan the embalmings of the people I meet. Some call it morbid. I call it early planning. 

We grab Loughlin, get our arms around her frame, and place her in the casket. They wheel it to the parlor, and set up the chairs. I take off my gloves, remove my apron, roll down my sleeves, and grab my jacket. As i shut the door behind me, i hear the door buzzer go off. The Brewer family has arrived. The service goes normal, and I tag out with another director to go finish up Loughlin. I prop the door open, get on the gloves and apron, and grab my trocar. I stick the pointed metal pole into his stomach, and vacuum him out. With the plug in place, i rinse him again. I glance to the clock, and a figure invades my vision. 

A little boy in his suit and tie. I panic, and immediatly stop what I'm doing and throw a sheet over the body. I ask the boy his name. He just stares at me. I ask if hes lost? He smiles, and walks away. I follow him. He goes into the first room, and circles back through the office. I get back to the hallway, and hes back in the prep room. I tell him he cant be here. He looks at me, sadness in his face, and looks back to the walk in. He begins to sniffle. I walk next to him, and say ""Ryan, it's okay."" He looks back at me, and stops sniffling. Instead, he holds out his hand to me. I reach for it, and... Hes gone. I open the door, and hes sitting on the tray, in his little suit, waiting for my oven.

TheGraveSin,10,,17,1rdci1,,60,"So I grew up on a farm, cows, chickens, horses, you name it. I usually got stuck feeding and watering the animals while my brothers ran the tractors and threw the hay bales. Dragging the water-hose to each and every animal's water pan was a pain and sometimes I'd catch my younger brother sneaking at the other end of the pasture watering some of the animals I hadn't gotten to yet and it would always make me smile to myself. Sometime in the summer our ducks started dying off, I'd find them smooshed and assumed it was an incident from them trying to breed one another and split some of them up in different pens and thought nothing more of it.   

Then three days later, I found a calf with its body oddly angled and no sure sign of what caused it to die. Nothing else happened for about a month or two. Then I found the horse laid out, freshly dead with sweat beaded all over it as if it had been running all night, it was a young and healthy horse, one of my favorite, and my heart shattered to pieces. I was reluctant to go back the next day, forcing myself to look at my sweet animals and focus on them instead but they were acting oddly, the pigs in particular, who were hiding in their makeshift huts and houses, not even coming when I did my usual call or dumped out the food. I got worried and walked in the pen, getting on hands and knees to look inside their little houses, as soon as I saw their snouts with a squeal one of them ran into me, biting at my arm and face. I toppled backward, kicking it away and dashed over the top of the pen, hurt feelings because they were almost always happy to see me. I didn't tell anyone, just let it go, assuming that at losing so many of my precious pets I was wigging myself out.   

The next time I went out, (at this point it was around winter) because of the cold I asked my mom to help me with the animals. As we were dragging the hose to the dairy cows she stops suddenly and asks ""who's that?"" I look over seeing the usual figure of my brother and just say ""oh it's just Derek Momma"" She shakes her head. ""No, Derek's at Paul's."" A weird feeling crawled down my spine as I glanced over my shoulder at the young male figure. Dropping the water-hose, I stepped in his direction. I could clearly see his dirt-smeared jeans and the back of his hair had the same blond curl of my brothers. ""Derek!"" I yelled, running over to him and reaching a hand out to put on his shoulder. He turned his head in my direction, his bright red eyes meeting mine as my hand fell through air. I passed out then. My mom says that by the time she reached me the figure was gone. After later discussion, my brother swore on his life that he had never once been in the pasture with me. ",On the Farm.,77,nosleep
MissMonstrosity,25,,31,1r5z11,,55,"Hello everyone. I told this story to a friend who told me I should post it here in Nosleep. I'm sorry for any grammatical errors or bad commentary, I''m not much of a writer.

About four years ago I was a troubled thirteen year old, who like most teenagers, didn't get along with my parents.
It was just me and my little Brother, our Mother who spent more time on the computer then being a real Mother, and our Step Father, who in most cases, acted more like a frat boy room-mate then a parental figure.

Anyway this all started one day when my and my Mother got into an argument, only god knows what it was about since we argued all the time  back then. 
All I remember is that I stormed off, taking a backpack of clothes and some food with me, and ran into the woods.

We live on a huge property in the country, and the woods go on for miles and miles in every direction, with only a small creek running through it to break up the never ending amount of trees.
Alot of people might be freaked out by the ominous looking place, but I loved it. I went exploring out there everyday and I knew those woods like the back of my hand.
I ran to the south west, down a large hill that had the creek I mentioned earlier at the bottom of it, the creek itself went on even farther than the woods, cutting through several private properties and stopped just outside of a town over fourteen miles away.
I decided I'd follow to town, where I'd find somewhere to stay the night.
Why not just take the road to town? well we lived in the country, there were alot of crazy people out here, drunks, hill-billies, prostitutes, and a combination of all three. I figured if I took the road I'd only be asking to get raped or robbed.

I'll fast forward a little, about 2 hours later I finally came to the edge of our property.
The property after ours belonged to an old man, we met him in church a couple times. Despite several threatening ""No Trespassing"" signs  I wasn't worried, If he did so happen to come all the way out here and somehow find me, I could just claim to be lost.  I was sure he wouldn't be this far out in the woods anyway. 
Here the woods thinned out a little, and there were several small fields tucked between the trees. I came here before, but never went any further then the edge of the fields.
At this point   the sun was only an hour or so away from setting and I started walking faster to hopefully get to town before nightfall, I ran through the creek that separated me from the field, and slipped on something causing me to fall.
It hurt like hell, later I found out I had broken my toe. It was bleeding badly and I had to limp the rest of the way through the creek and fields.
I came to the end of the fields several minutes later, where a small path, either for ATV's or a tractor, led through the woods.
I never went this far before, but I knew if I kept going straight I'd get to the town within only an hour or so, so I went on.

After what felt like forever of following a twisting path that seemed to go nowhere It finally came to a small circular clearing. There was a fence surrounding it, with a large sign once again threatening anyone who crossed. I thought it was strange, we were hours from any house, why bother putting up a fence blocking off where no one would ever be likely to go? Then again I was going through, so maybe it wasn't all that uncommon. I crawled under the fence, foot still hurting like hell and went on through the clearing. I knew I wouldn't be caught, theres no way there would be anyone out here.
I walked, or more less, limped, through the clearing, on the other side there was another small field, and just my luck, there was a old tree stand in one of the trees surrounding it. 
We have a large hunting community, and hunters often hide out in the tree stands that were often camouflaged in the trees.
I thought it would make a great place to stay the night, since the town was still a long ways away and it was already starting to get dark.
I went up to it and poked my head inside, it was perfect. Just enough space to lay down and sleep if need be. 

I climbed back out and headed back to the clearing, There was a large hill to one side of it, I figured if I climbed up it I could see just how far away the town was. 
Ignoring my aching foot, I limped over to the hill, and right in that moment something hit me on the back of the head. It felt like someone angrily poking me, or throwing a small  pebble
I turned around quickly, expecting to find an angry farmer or hunter, no one was there, it was probably just an acorn or nut falling from one of the surrounding trees.
I laughed at myself for being stupid and rubbed at my now aching head.
For whatever reason, I decided to not try to force my way up the large hill, and instead went to the opposite side of the round clearing, I dont know why, it just felt like something was pulling me there.

About half way across the clearing I stopped dead in my tracks and gasped. I literally uttered  the words ""Oh my God"" Before quickly shutting my mouth in fear someone might have heard me.
There before me, were several grave stones. All ranging in height and design. 
The ground in front of some of them was lower than the rest of the ground, almost as if the coffins underneath had caved in.
I stumbled over to the graveyard, and bent down to try to read the head-stones.
Most were unreadable. Only one of them had enough words I could make out, it looked like two head-stones fused together.

The one on the left read ""G.A Keaton -date unreadable-
The one on the right said ""Harriet Keaton 18?? - 187?""
at the bottom, just visible, was ""Our angels, together in heaven""

At this point, I turned and ran.
I blacked out for most of the time I was running, I ran through the clearing, ran along the path, ran across the fields until I was finally back on our property. 
I only slowed down because it was pitch black outside, and stupid me forgot to bring a flash-light. It was so dark I could hardly see in front of me.
Once again, I'll fast forward, I finally got home after my step father had found me, apparently he went out looking for me, not to ensure I was safe and guide me home, no. 
Only because he wanted to drag me home to make me apologize to my mother.
I didn't care, I happily followed him home.
After finally getting there I found my brother, looking like he was crying, and my mom sitting at the table eating dinner, looking like she didn't have a care in the world. She glanced at me, made a face. And left the room.
Over time I ended up telling her about the graveyard, she found it interesting, and soon enough all my family knew about the weird graveyard in the woods. It became quite a conversation topic in our family, before over time, being forgotten.



One thing I never told anyone though, And the reason I went running out of that place like a baby-
 Was because, shortly after finding that cemetery, I started to hear whispering, and among the trees behind the graveyard, I could've sworn I saw something moving.

 Then, right after reading what was on the one tombstone, what felt like a long boney finger,
Started tapping on the back of my head.

iwillneverbefree,8,,17,1r1p8k,,51,"I'm just your average everyday guy with a job. I cook, I clean, I drink; hell, I even had a girlfriend before all this started going down. If you saw me on the street, you'd walk right by me without a second glance. It's just that I have a job. I'm a Paramedic.

I don't do anything important, I just help those in need. I started doing this because I didn't feel great about myself. I always loved helping others, and I always loved A&amp;P, so I saw this as a logical step. I loved every second of it when I first started. There was no greater high than when your adrenaline kicked in and your hands moved faster than your mind could think. It was ecstasy. This went on for 8 years. Every day I fell more and more in love with my job. My calling. The only thing that bothered me was that overwhelming sense of being in a battle. I thought it was normal; after-all, I was fighting for someone else's life I thought. If only I knew how true that statement was.

It started off with a shadow when I walked onto a scene. I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Maybe it was my constant concern of someone attacking me. God forbid I got shot while working. I should have known something wasn't right when my partner looked in the same direction when I did. I should have known better when he just shut down and barely spoke the rest of the night. This went on for a while, every so often seeing the shadow. Things started to get worse, however, when the whispering started.

At first, they were nonsensical. Sometimes I wondered if they were even there at all, if I was just going fucking nuts. But they were... They WERE there. It only took me losing my first patient to hear them clear as day. They were congratulating me. They were telling me how great of a job I did. I didn't understand then. My mind had been turning on me, it had to have been. ""It's the stress... It's the stress of losing someone"" I told myself on my way home. I sat at home and hit the bottle. Hoping that my next shift would be an easy one... one quiet shift.

It wasn't quiet. I should have known better than to use that word. It's bad luck. The voices didn't go away. They only got louder. Every patient I had I could hear them. ""It's their time"" ""She's ours now"" ""Let her rest"". I thought I was just compensating for losing someone. I thought I was just preparing myself if I lost another one. The more people I lost, the more they got more sinister. ""You're almost ready."" ""I haven't seen one this talented in eons"" ""You can't change fate""... ""Come join us"". I didn't understand right then, but I understood it all soon.

It was a 5 year old male. His heart stopped. I had to save this one, he was just a child, I HAD to save him. We got him to the back of the ambulance and I started my work. Things felt... odd. I felt as if I was in a daze. My vision was blurry, the lights seemed faint against the road. I tried not to think about the voices, I tried to block them out, I did a damn good job until it screamed my name.

""JOHN"". I heard. I stopped, and slowly raised my head to look at the bench seat across from me. It wasn't what you would expect death to be. It wasn't a man in a robe with a scythe. It was just a man in a suit with black eyes. I froze. I had to have been insane. I needed to tell my partner to drop my off in the psych ward when we got to the hospital. His smile was... calming. It was the kind of smile you'd expect a great car salesman to have... calming... but also sinister. His hair was well kept for a man his age, I'd have to say 50's or 60's. His eyes like a void of everything that makes us human, as if they were a black hole that sucked all feeling out of whatever had the poor misfortune of getting caught in their path.

""Haven't you been listening John?"" He said with a caring tone

""You know what you must do... You know who you'll become... Why are you fighting?""

I started screaming at him. ""Who are you?"" ""What do you want?"" ""Why have you been following me?""

He ignored all of my questions. He simply put his hand to the child and started rubbing his head.

""You fought for so long John. You know this is your fate. How much more pain can you endure?""

""What are you talking about?"" I yelled at him as the child's rhythm became worse and worse.

""Don't you understand John, we've been with you since day one! We are who you fight every day... We are the ones who you ignore to do your job... We are you.""

I began to understand.

""John, you must know something."" He said looking at the monitor as it flatlined. ""This will also be your fate. You will die just like everyone else. There's nothing you can do about it""

""Don't you think I fucking know that?"" I yelled grabbing the epinephrine out of my bag.

""JOHN"" He yelled again knocking the epinephrine out of my hand.

""You need to understand the forces that be. When you die, John, you will become one of us""

""The fuck I will"" I said, standing up, but was forced back down by some unknown force.

""It's not something you can change, John. You have so much potential... so much promise... We've been watching you from the day you were born... and we are very, very, excited to meet you""

I stopped fighting. I looked into his eyes and I felt something. Something I wish I never would have felt... I felt at peace. It was if all the stress of saving a life was gone. It was as if I didn't have to fight anymore. It felt like I was being held by my mother again, like all was right with the world.

I sat there and placed my hand on the child. I felt death pass through me. I felt the coldness of the nothing reach my heart and sit there. I understood now. I understood why I am who I am. It was as if everything made sense to me...

iampatheo,11,,15,1rcqug,,45,"  This is my first Reddit post so please excuse my mistakes. I live with my parents and my grandfather, who is my father's uncle actually, so basically not my grand""father"". 
     I am going to jump straight into the problem here because there is something definitely weird going on in our house. There have been this series of events which have occurred throughout my childhood which I have always put them at the back of my mind, maybe because as a child I didn’t look into it enough, but I never forgot. But with the most recent event I can't help but ask you guys for advice.
     The first event occurred when I was around 10 I guess. I was probably getting ready for school or something and the only people in the house that morning was my mom and my grandfather. Mom was helping me put my tie on ( we had a school uniform ) and I remember glancing towards the living room which is visible from my room. I saw my grandfather walk into the living room after which he proceeded to go towards the balcony and out of my sight. I got out my room and I was walking towards the kitchen to get some water. Now, the kitchen is right next to my grandfather's room and it’s on the other side of our house. As I reached his room I saw him sitting there reading the paper. I got a bit surprised because I clearly remembered seeing him in the living room just a few seconds ago and there is no way he could have gotten back here before me or without bumping into me. I asked him about it and he said he had no clue what I was talking about. So, I just put it at the back of my mind.
The next incident happened a year back or so. It was after 11 p.m and I was locked up in my room listening to really loud music through my earphones while doing some reading( I like doing that, getting a whole background score feel for the things happening in the book). After a while I heard my parents banging the door and shouting at me and I figured they must have been knocking for some time. When I opened the door I saw them both standing there with concerned looks on their faces. I asked them what happened and they said that apparently they could hear me crying out  for help from my room in a really panicky way and they thought had probably slipped and had broken a bone or something. I obviously had no clue what they were talking about and they swore that the voice they heard was mine and no one else’s. It freaked me out a little. But even then I didn’t put it together with the incident from all those years back.
     And now something has happened again last night and this time I am pretty freaked out. I was having my dinner in my room as I was watching a movie on my laptop. As I finished I got out of my room and headed for the kitchen. On the way I noticed my mom, dad and grandfather in the living room watching TV. As I walked past my grandfather’s room I saw him. Sitting on a chair by the window. The room was dimly lit but it was enough to see everything. I did a double take. I looked towards the living room and he was still there with my parents!  I looked back and he was still there sitting in his chair by the window. He was looking at me but for some reason I couldn’t see his eyes. Not because they weren’t there or anything but it was as if I was feeling this weird force which was trying to make me look away from there. I also got this head rush which you get when you stand up too fast. As soon as I recovered from that and my head cleared he was gone from his chair. My parents and grandfather were still sitting there in the living room chatting amongst themselves as they watched the TV. I told them what happened but they obviously did not believe me and thought I was making it up.
I really need to know what this is. Is this a doppelganger? And if so what should I do? Is this thing going to be harmful? It hasn’t done anything harmful so far.

WontThinkStraight,12,,11,1rcy69,,49,"I just had a long overdue catch up with Brad, and to check on how [Emily's family were doing since their tragedy](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p22cl/notes/). In some welcome news, they are now expecting a new child to join their family.

Brad had another story for me though; one that has kept me awake  the past couple of nights. I've captured it below to help get it off my mind.


-------------------------------------------

In a universe filled with choices, but with only one life in which to make them, regrets become inevitable. Regrets for things done or left undone, for words said or left unsaid.

At that moment when our life is fading, and we see it all over again... how would we feel about those decisions we've made?  Would we be proud of those moments that defined us? Those moments alone when we think no one else is watching? How we treated those we loved, and those close to us?


Brad was not the only child in his family. He also had a younger brother, Paul. They could not have been more opposites to each other.

Where Brad was brash and wild in his youth, Paul was introverted and contemplative. And like many siblings, their childhood was one of constant warfare with each other. 

Looking back, Brad admits that he was an arrogant, possessive and obnoxious brat. Any of those traits alone would already have given him an excuse to hate on his little brother.

But it was really the fear of the Burnt Man that really started it all. 

As an only child, Brad enjoyed the attention and adulation that brought him. That changed when his brother Paul was born three years later.

At first, Brad had loved the idea of a brother to play with. He imagined they would play together and be best friends. That idea disappeared when he discovered Paul was a useless baby that only cried, smelled bad and demanded constant attention. The second year wasn't much better, with Paul starting to get a larger share of Brad's toys and presents.

It became really bad in the third year when Brad had to give up half his room and share it with Paul. He found they had nothing in common.

Where Brad liked being loud and attention seeking with others, Paul just babbled and talked with himself. Brad loved being outside and active, Paul preferred to stay indoors and draw with his crayon set.

What unsettled Brad though was what Paul would draw. There would be the usual things every child draws - houses, animals, trees and family. What was unusual was every drawing of their family always had an extra person.

Their parents would be there, and Brad and Paul, all drawn in rainbow hues. Right next to Paul would be a mysterious figure drawn in black and red.

The family faces all had big smiles, but the stranger was a disfigured mess: two big black circles for eyes and a shapeless mass for the mouth. In every drawing of the stranger, he was missing an arm and had red streaks running through all over.

Over time, this stranger began to feature more and more prominently in the drawings. Brad and his parents would no longer appear in them - just Paul playing with the stranger inside the house, or outside in the yard.

At first their parents thought it was just a phase, but eventually became concerned enough to ask Paul who that was. He told them it was his friend ""the burned man"". He had always been there for as long as Paul could remember. He never said anything - he just stood there, watching and listening.

They concluded it was just an imaginary friend. Granted, it was a bit more unsettling than having a dinosaur or elf for a friend, but at least Paul wasn't drawing some real-life predator.

One night (when Brad was 8, and Paul was 5), they stayed awake after their parents had tucked them in. Brad wanted to know more about the Burnt Man.

Paul said that he had been in an accident, a fire that had burnt his entire body and face. It had melted his eyes away and made his arm go missing. He was very sad.

Paul didn't find the Burnt Man scary though. He had always been around, and never did anything. Just watched and listened.

Brad told him he was stupid for having an imaginary friend.

Paul yawned, and simply replied that he wasn't imaginary. He was in the room with them right now. In fact, he was standing right next to Brad, watching and listening, as he did every night.

Brad felt a chill go up his spine. He had always been a brave child, but for the first time in his life he felt fear. He looked around in the darkness, not sure if the shadows were his imagination or the Burnt Man waiting for him to go to sleep.

Brad didn't go to sleep that night, and concluded that he needed a room of his own.

He could no longer share a room with his annoying brother and his creepy friend. But he couldn't admit that he was afraid either, so his 8 year old mind came up with an idea.

His plan was simple - to make it so painful for their parents to keep them together they would be forced to keep them in separate rooms. So began their adversarial relationship.

They fought over everything for many years, and often physically. Each prank they played each other escalated into new rounds of retaliation, all to the chagrin of their parents. 

It would take six more years until they moved to a bigger house and they were able to have separate rooms at last before the feuds started to die down. the Burnt Man had been all but forgotten by this time, replaced with pure animosity for each other. 

But on the first night in their new home, Brad remembered waking in the middle of the night and seeing a figure sitting on his bed, watching him. It stared at him through hollow eye sockets, and moaned at him through an open jaw. It reached for him with a horribly burnt hand, the other hung uselessly by its side with the lower half missing.

Brad screamed so loud it woke the house, and the figure had disappeared by the time he blinked. When Paul came into the room to check what all the commotion was about, Brad told him he saw the Burnt Man.

Paul laughed, and said he hadn't seen him in years. In fact, he could hardly even remember him. In any case, he couldn't see him in the room now. Paul closed the door as he left, then reopened it quickly and shouting ""Boo!"", before laughing again and walking back to his room.

For Brad, the memory of it seemed very real though. It wasn't just the terror, but the overwhelming sense of sadness he felt from the encounter.

Another incident was when Paul was 17 and involved in a hit-and-run accident. He was rushed to hospital in a critical condition, and the doctors weren't sure if he would survive. Paul was lying in bed with a coma, with his parents crying around him.

Brad could could see a figure through the corner of his eye standing by the walls. It was the Burnt Man, watching Paul intently.

""Just go already! Why are you still here? You're not wanted. Just leave us!"" Brad remembered shouting at the figure. He got a severe reprimanding from his parents, thinking that he was shouting at his brother.

""Paul is dying, Brad! It's time to put your stupid feud behind. We're family for god's sake. Act like it!"" his father had rebuked while his mother cried.

The words stung Brad, especially since he couldn't explain that he wasn't shouting at Paul. He quietly fumed, then stormed out.

Paul did recover two days later though, and was out of the hospital a week later.

That last incident was 15 years ago. The Burnt Man was never seen again by either of them since. 

Brad had become a serious and buttoned down computer analyst since then. Paul married, had two children of his own, and had saved countless lives through his job as an EMT. They had developed a grudging respect for each other, though their lives had drifted off in different directions over the years.

The Burnt Man was just another long forgotten childhood memory, filed away and never thought of again until recently. Only a recent tragedy brought it all back into sharp focus.

A few months ago, Brad learnt that his brother had died while on duty. He was on scene with other emergency services dealing with a factory fire.

A chemical storage tank had unexpectedly exploded near his location, dousing him in burning chemicals. The flying shrapnel had sheared off his left arm at the elbow.

Paul was 32.

---------------------------

In a life of many regrets, Brad now has one more for the list. He never did let Paul know how proud he was of him, and that despite their differences, he loved him as a brother.

He regrets that his last words to Paul weren't goodbye, but a text message which read ""You suck. I've shat better excuses than that."" It was said in jest about why Paul didn't have time over the weekend for a beer, but it was devastating knowing it would be the last memory both had of each other.

So every now and then, Brad talks to the silence in the room hoping that his brother, the Burnt Man, is still around to hear. Now much older and wiser, he no longer fears the Burnt Man - but fears that the only one listening might just be himself.

One that can only observe in silence, powerless to stop whatever fate awaits him, judging him with regret for the decisions he's made, and is yet to make.

Scared6,13,,45,1rb0kr,,48,"Has anyone heard the of the creepy tale ""That's not your mother""? Well, my family has told me about it from time to time, and we made jokes and pranks out of it.


Here's a example, one day, my mother called me into the kitchen to fix something for her. As I was walking through the hallway, my dads hand pulled me into the closet and whispered ""That's not your mother"".


These pranks freaked my out and my little cousins too. One day, my cousins mother told me about this story. I will tell this like how she told me.


*So, I tucked my five year old son into bed, and he went to sleep. When It was time for him to go to school, I called him to get up and come to the living room, I was reading the newspaper while I came across this one article. ""Missing children"" It read. My son then ran to me screaming and crying saying ""A man pulled me into the closet telling me not to come to you!*



No one was in the house she told me. We don't pull those pranks no more.",That's not your mother.,93,nosleep
ohthankheaven,5,,18,1rbpkl,,43,"I don't have an exciting life. I wake up each morning at exactly 6:30AM, and by 7:15AM I'm starting the engine of my poorly kept up with vehicle and begin my venture to work. I'm late every single day by about fifteen minutes, to be precise. I don't care, they could fire me if they wanted, but I'm the kind of guy who comes to the office, keeps his mouth shut, and gets the job done. They also figure that the fifteen minutes of tardiness isn't so bad, compared to the hour and forty-five minutes of unpaid overtime they sentence me with every day. I would describe my job as dull, repetitive, and relentlessly boring, and correspondingly, so is my life. My house isn't particularly lavish. Living alone as a male really doesn't give your residence that home feeling. I'm not your average lonely, I lack companionship. I do not have a family, I do not have friends. Every day is the same. It's winter time and the days freeze together. 

My alarm goes off, I hit snooze. Again, the obnoxious ringtone I set on my phone crackles out of the tiny speaker, I hit snooze. After a third ring, I'm out of bed and on my way to work. It's freezing this morning and the heat in my car does not work. My weather-beaten jacket doesn't provide that much protection either. I scrape through the day, counting the minutes. 
The drive home from work offers my only source of human contact, and this lies in the sports talk radio station I listen to. Their snide remarks always make me laugh, and I sometimes call in to dispute some of the commentary they are making. It also feels good to have somebody to talk to, especially when you're as solitary as I am.

I don't choose to be this way. I am a single child and my parents died three years ago in a car accident. It was a tough loss, it put me in a downward spiral until I hit bottom, which just so happens to be where I still reside. I try to socialize and be friendly but it seems like I'm lost in the masses. Maybe I should be more interesting, or funny, or wear nicer clothes. I'm not good with these things. I started taking comfort in the internet. For me it felt safer, more secure from the harshness of the real world. Not that the internet isn't any less relentless, the only difference is I'm hiding behind a screen and a handle. I do not have a Facebook. I don't know if it's because I don't see the point of having one or I'm too scared to deal with the fact that I would lack companionship on there as well. I visit my favorite sports websites, browse Reddit, and enjoy YouTube. None of those things could ever satisfy my primal need for a physical partner in life, so eventually, I started using a dating website. A website that I don't feel the need to name. They are all the same anyway. It was slow at first. Slower than it took me to fill out my profile and eventually take a picture anyway. I didn't know what to write about myself, and even convincing myself to finally publicize my life in an attempt to get anyone to talk to was an effort in itself.  Months went by and I received no glimmer of hope. Suddenly, a chat prompt appeared on my laptop.
""Hello"", she said.

Her name is Julie, and she is beautiful. I don't know what she saw in me, but for the first time it is real, it is there. We spoke for years. Endless chat logs, phone calls, video chats. We shared tears, laughs, and something I never felt before, love. 

Two days ago I asked Julie to meet me for the first time, and she said yes. I was nervous at first, but extremely happy. I asked her if she wanted to have dinner, but she said she would rather just come to my house instead. Yesterday she came over, she really is a special girl. We hit it off so well that she decided to spend the night. She really is excited to have me now, I can hear her calling for me now. I have never felt so happy and so confident. There is one thing that is for certain, she will never leave me. Even if we fight, even if we argue, she still won't leave me. We are going to have a great time together, and we are going to play. Even if it turns out she doesn't like the games we play she still won't leave me. 

There is that chance though, that small chance that things won't work out. That chance that the love will fade and that abominable lonliness will come back. It scared me at first, because I can't go back to being alone again. I won't go back. I don't worry anymore though, because Julie loves me and the games we play, Julie loves to be with me, and Julie isn't strong enough to bend the bars of her basement cell.

DickBanditDoneLanded,11,,67,1r1zac,,42,"As a kid, I grew up singing songs of joy with my friends. Fun songs that made me feel like a child. There was one song that I never really liked, for reasons unbeknownst to me, but that one song would become a living hell during my adult life.

My wife packed my son's lunchbox with a pizza lunchables; It was always his favorite one. I had the privilege of walking him to school that cold October morning, holding his hand the whole walk. We talked about toys, games, and then the topic of songs came up.
""Hey, dad...how come you never showed me the song about Josh Jacob Jinglehyper Smith?"" he asked. ""Haha, you mean John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt? I never liked that song, kiddo,"" I replied. ""I thought his name was Josh, like mine!"" He added.

 We got to the school about half an hour earlier than the entry time, so I suggested we go to the playground located around back; Josh agreed and followed me. The air felt relatively dense that day, I could barely see fifty feet away and asked Josh to stay in sight and have a little fun before school starts. I look away at the birds in the trees and I'm startled by the piercing cry of my son, nowhere in sight. I call his name and he says ""Sorry, dad! I fell off the monkey bars, I'll be fine!"" I sighed and laughed a little knowing my kid was such a warrior. I notice Josh riding a swing and laughing with another little boy who also came to school too early. I see his father standing on the side, laughing and I worry about not being a good enough dad to Josh. I start to walk toward the boys and that's when it hits me; I wasn't watching Josh play, none of the two boys was mine. I tried to keep calm but felt the need to yell out his name to locate him. I look around the playground and the school bell rings, announcing the school's opening. The dense, foggy air dissipates and I'm able to see everything clearly. I find a note in the second floor of the jungle gym, it reads: ""I know how hard you tried to avoid me, I wouldn't want the same thing happening with Josh.""

My heart sank and my eyes widened as the note dropped on the mulch and made a thud. I felt every possible emotion at that one point in time. I didn't know what to do, where to go, who to ask for help, so I walked into the school, where I come across a corkboard with pictures of kids on it. All of these children were abducted by a strange man who walked into the forest beside the school. I knew what I had to do, I ran into the woods, clenching the note he had written. ""John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt!"" I hear a high pitched voice scream from the bushes, as I fall to the ground in fear.

 I noticed a building on a hill about a mile into the wild. It was a greenish wooden house, much like the ones mystery inc. would investigate, but this was not a game, this was my son's life and possibly that of many other children. The smell of rotting was emitting throughout the air, and I feared the worst for the status of the kids. Not willing to be detected, I snuck in through a window that was left open and creeped about the dark house with nothing but my signal-less cellphone and my dedication. I was in the basement floor and couldn't see anything, so I turned on my flashlight app. I had no idea I was about to come across one of the most horrible sights anyone could've seen.

 There were mutilated corpses, not just any corpses, but children, kids who I had met through class pictures my wife bought and showed me. The kids were decapitated, burned, sliced, naked. I was scared for my life, I almost threw up one too many times but swallowed it back along with my will to flee. I found a wooden staircase that was old and rotting. The first step I took on it made a loud creak and there was a groan in the distance. I hid behind a giant flowerpot as a huge figure approached the area I was in. I could barely breathe as I noticed this man had blood between his fingernails, as if he mutilated the children with nothing but his fingers. He returned to the room and I followed him from afar. The smell I picked up earlier was much stronger than before and I heard muffled cries coming from the room the man walked into. 
""Say it with me, now, kids!
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt! 
His name is my name too! 
Whenever we go out! 
The people always shout! 
There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schm-"" A kid bit a hole through the duct tape on his mouth and was able to scream while he sang. I heard the kid's name; It was Gary.

The children were all able to remove their mouth bindings and cried in unison for about ten seconds. Then I hear a loud laugh, followed by a ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" At this point, I was enraged. Nobody has the right to scream at kids like that, nobody. I barged in, grabbing this freak by his back-length hair and slamming his face into a table with limbs on it. ""What did you just say to those kids, you motherfucker?!"" I yelled, oblivious to the children in the room. ""You're gonna pay for all your shit, you son of a bitch!"" I said ""Well that's just too damn bad!"" He added ""I didn't know today was the day I'd be found! It's such a shame you've missed your playdate with your son...he was SUCH a nice boy!"" He said, laughing his head off at the sight of my expression. I was cold, I was numb. My son was dead.

 I unleashed my fury on the man, not holding back at all. I knocked him unconscious and tied him down to a giant piece of metal. I broke both his legs and made sure he'd never walk again, then I released the children, many starving and ready to go home. I tugged the slab down the hill and walked alongside the children toward the school. The police had previously raided the woods, but never came across the house in the entire year he had been performing the kidnappings. I called the school and notified the authorities of the serial killer I had slayed and I wanted to make sure he was arrested and would suffer his whole life for what he did to my wife and I. She was hysterical, unable to perform for almost a whole year. We cancelled any holidays and vacations and mourned a year away. We finally concluded that our son was happy in a better place with the rest of his friends. Although my wife and I never had any other children, I became teacher at an elementary school in another state and was happy knowing I had kids who were fun to be around and nice to me. 

One Monday morning, we have a new girl come in and I ask her to introduce herself. She's laughing and she's shy and she wants to whisper something in my ear. ""I'll introduce myself if we can just play today."" She says I promise her, along with the class, that we'll have a free day and she introduces herself and makes friends. I start to like this girl because I never had a chance to have a daughter and always wanted one. She was very sociable and was the class clown.

She stopped coming to school for a week, and out of curiosity, I called her parents to ask about her sudden disappearance. Her mother was crying and I couldn't understand her, so her father came to the phone. I told him about how the class missed her and he told me about a note that was left at their door one afternoon. It read: ""Go through her drawings"" I asked the dad to give me a minute while I did just that. *HE* was in the pictures. Every drawing she made had *him* hiding in the background. There was a folded piece of paper that was thicker than the rest. Little did I know, it wasn't school paper, it was skin; Pressed and cut to replicate a note. ""I thought, by now, you'd figure out I was never human"" I got on the phone to tell the girl's father the news, but all I heard was a demonic, maniacal laughter. I felt a hole in my chest, as the phone line went dead, followed by three beeps and elongated static.","His name is my name, too.",109,nosleep
Brodiche,28,,16,1ra24j,,35,"The Eighth Crusade

On the outskirts of the large city known as Canto; a small cathedral stands unscathed by the horror happening not twenty miles away. There were some smaller towns outside of the city, but most of their residents fled as soon as the vague news reports of “cannibalistic” citizens came flooding in. In the end, those who were smart enough to run at the first sign of trouble were the only ones who made it, the hesitant died along with the rest of the city. 
However, this small cathedral was different. It was located in the middle of nowhere and had been long abandoned and forgotten by everyone, aside from the city itself the closest town to it was almost an hour way and a small dirt road was the only thing that even hinted that there was another world past the miles and miles of flat plains. The glow and black smoke from Canto can be seen in the distance.  
Short flashes of lightning filled the air, just long enough to illuminate a figure on top of the cathedral, his legs swung over the edge of the roof and head leaning against the lighting rod. The faint glow of a cigar intensified as he put it to his mouth. With a small grin played on his lips, he gazed dreamily at the city.
“What a sight. Obliteration has never looked so divine.” He whispered to himself. Images of a crumbling Jerusalem played through his head, “Well, I guess you can’t get much more divine than that.”
Feeling a little foolish for talking to himself again he took one last drag of his cigar and flicked it behind him. The man noticed that there was a thin layer of ash that had settled on to his body. Slightly irritated by this, the man glanced at his watch while getting to his feet, ruffling his short black hair in an attempt to get as much ash off his head as possible. His long black coat blew in the wind as he brushed it off. 
The temperature was dropping fast, it wouldn’t be long until the rain began to pour. The man wondered if it would be enough to quench the flames of the city. The Vatican ordered complete destruction; they wanted nothing standing of what they thought to be a “heathen city”. The man wouldn’t feel accomplished if the flames were so easily disposed of. Glancing at his watch again figuring he had roughly another half hour before the he was picked up and debriefed. He leaned back against the lightning rod, and lit another cigar, daydreaming of the day before.
****************************************

One bite, one citizen, and his work was done. His mission was to just get the ball rolling, nothing more. Being as potent as he was, his victims often became immensely strong. They were puppets, sure; but also unstable. The more of them that were roaming the streets the more dangerous the mop up was for the church. The man was frustrated that he only got one snack, he was tired of the left over’s from corpses and the donations from Italian blood banks. He was craving prey with more… life to it, one he could enjoy stalking before the kill.
The Vatican dispatched him and a helicopter to the abandoned cathedral. Along with being the drop point, the house of God was also were he was supposed to rendezvous with the evac crew. His orders were to simply enter the city, light the spark, and watch “God cleanse the Earth” from the cathedral. 
“You zealots are no fun!” he would tell them “I’m doing “God’s work” for you lazy ass holes, the least you could do is let me off the leash!”
The hungry man could not help but feel disappointed when they were offended. They preached how the last crusade was such a failure due to the fact he had so much “freedom”, the mobs of the powerful undead nearly completely consumed the Holy army.
It pissed him off that they never got over that.
He resolved that it was never really his fault, humans were frail, weak creatures. They are easy to corrupt in every way. None of them could handle the thirst, and they tore everything apart. Turning their victims into, for lack of a better word, zombies. 
The Pope himself preformed the unnecessary but “ritualistic” blessing before he set off.
“Vai quarto Locke e fornire i nostri nemici a Dio.”
“Deliver them I shall.” He sarcastically whispered to himself with a smirk. The helicopter was taking off; it was time to go to work.
Locke could not stop thinking about his one victim, regardless of whom it was he planned to savor every last second of his feast.
****************************************

The man found himself seeking a challenge. In the back of his mind he knew he wouldn’t get one, but the fantasy of a dangerous prey kept his thoughts occupied as he made his way towards the glistening city. 
With the pace he was traveling at it wouldn’t be long before reached the edge of Canto, his long strides covered more distance, faster than a high-end sports car going ninety on an open freeway. The cool night air was refreshing to him, it’s not often he is allowed to roam out in the open like this. He slowed down a bit to prolong this finite feeling of freedom.
Being cooped up under Vatican City for so long had begun to take its toll on Locke’s sanity. Other than living off nothing but the scraps of Roma, he had no real connection to the outside world. It’s not like he longed to live amongst the humans, no, the thought of that made him sick. The only reason he could stand the “Men of God” back at the Vatican was because they were as far away from human as possible. He’s seen them put on human masks, sure, seen them absolve the masses with a crooked smile, seen them preach peace and the word of God to a thousand ignorant faces. No, no, behind their masks, they are every bit a monster as Locke.
The city was drawing closer, massive sky scrapers were lit up in a brilliant fashion. A sense of intrigue radiated from surrounding, smaller clusters of lights. What were the humans doing at this hour? Were they working overtime, tucking the children in, late night binge drinking at the local bar? They were all so very ignorant of the malevolent fury of God that was about to rain down upon them. Sure, it looked pretty from a distance, but Canto was the antithesis when viewed up close. The Vatican made it clear to Locke that this was not a city that deserves pity, even though he never considered giving it anyways, he asked to be briefed on the city’s situation.
Canto was dying, almost all who’ve entered abandoned all hope for it when they saw what a hell hole it has become. Corruption plagued the city’s central government, all of the representatives’ power focused on how to make the wealthy more capable of shitting on the poor. As a result, crime was abundant. Drug trafficking, prostitution, child labor plagued the down town streets. Whole families were often caught in cases of “indentured servitude” as the wealthy put it, where even the children would have to be at the beckon call of the privileged, doing strenuous and dangerous work that led to more than a few deceased children. Anyone who cried foul ended up dead too, it was just the way it went. 
And it was reason enough to cleanse it.
Locke reached the edge of Canto, he could now hear the grumbling sounds of the suffering city, a siren blared unceasingly somewhere among the throngs of buildings. Looking at his watch the man whispered to himself.
“Time to light the match.”
****************************************

Upon entering the city, Locke found to his disappointment, that there was no shortage of easy prey. The homeless aimlessly wandered the streets, practically half dead already, prostitutes looking vulnerable as ever. He was slightly surprised, however, to find a couple of security guards having a smoke outside of a large ominously lit building. A young woman dressed in rags, stumbled past them, she was appeared very exhausted and in need of medical care. The guards just looked upon her and laughed, asking the woman unrepeatable questions. When she didn’t respond to their cat calls one of the men grew frustrated and ran after her. She let out a quick yelp of pain as he put his cigarette out on the back of her neck.
In a very swift motion the girl whirled around, grabbing the guard’s wrist and pulling him close. The man’s face was within an inch of hers, his expression showed that of pure pain. She had broken his wrist. In a split second she revealed a small revolver, put it to the man’s chin, and pulled the trigger.
There was a bright flash, then a spray of crimson red. The man’s body crumpled to the newly painted sidewalk, with a softball sized hole where his skull used to be. The woman was already on the other guard before he was done unhooking the strap to his sidearm. Landing knees first on the guard’s chest she pinned him to the ground. Grabbing a firm hold of her prey’s head, with both hands she lifted up his skull and brought it back down to the concrete. Over and over again she did this, until the guard was pulverized into the sidewalk.
It was all over that quickly. She stood up without a sound, her face expressionless except for a small smirk that crept on the edge of her lips, she bent over to pick up her revolver that lie next to body of the first guard. She shot Locke a quick glance and disappeared around the corner. While the look she gave him was quick, it was more than enough to excite him. She had piercing brown eyes that screamed strength, and short, dirty, black hair that was almost just long enough to veil her left eye. Locke knew her just by that single, short glance. He knew her struggles, knew her strength, and knew her will to survive.
He knew he had found his prey.
The building the two guards were once protecting let out the piercing wale of an emergency siren, snapping Locke out of his mystified state. It was then he noticed the streets were completely empty, not a piece of human filth to be seen. Whoever the guards were protecting called for backup and he had mere minutes to escape. A thought crossed his mind, and made him almost consider revealing himself to the approaching authorities before pounding them into dust. Not wanting to risk compromising the mission, Locke reluctantly retreated into a dark alley way. He scaled his way to the roof tops from there and began the hunt for his new found prey. 
****************************************
The mystery woman’s scent was still live and growing stronger as he strides across the apartment building rooftops. Locke’s mind wandered back to the two guards, how efficiently and violently she dispatched them. Two full grown, armed men could not handle the slender girl half their size. Where can a human learn to kill like that? Without mercy or emotion, just pure unadulterated instinct. After searching for a short time he came across her entering a dimly lit liquor store, only to return moments later with a bag clenched in her fist. 
The hunger was starting to get to him, it was a ravenous gnawing that made his whole body tremble with anticipation. He knelt down on one knee and gazed down at her from the roof tops. Across the street from where Locke sat perched he saw her lean against a brick wall, and begin chugging whatever was in the paper bag. Locke felt his heart sink, he had to stop her quickly or that alcohol will kill all the fun. What was the fun in feeding from intoxicated prey? He let out a small sigh and leapt off the building, and descended to the street below. 
The woman let out a small yelp as Locke landed safely in front of her. A small cloud of dust and filth from the city escaped from under his feet, leaving a small clear circle around where he landed.
For a moment she just stared at him as he rose to his feet. Only a dim street light illuminated the empty street, the only thing she could make of the man was a pair of piercing red eyes that glowed like the moon.
“There is something magnificent about the moment you make yourself known to your prey,” spoke the man. His voice had a crisp, raspy tone to it, full of anticipation and a hint of sensuality.
The woman’s eyes widened at this, not out of fear however; it was more like she just received a jolt of electricity, the grip on her bottle tightened. She put on a smirk and spoke with an authoritative tone. 
 “Listen, I’ve had a long day. I already have had to deal with two assholes today,” she lifted her hands almost defensively, to reveal that they were caked with dried blood. 
“I caved both their heads in before they learned their place, maybe I should take my time with you so I can really make a statement around here.”
The man cocked his head a bit to the side at this threat, amused and intrigued by her intensity. He opened his arms wide as if to bow and took a step forward. The woman reacted quickly and swung the bag at Locke’s head. The sharp crash of the class mixed with the sound of cracking bone traveled all the way down the street. 
The woman expected the perfect stranger to be on the ground bleeding, begging for his life like she has seen so many other “men” do. 
However, the man was still standing. Aside from a small shard of glass that was lodged in the left side of his face, he was completely unfazed by the vicious attack. Locke licked his lips as the remaining alcohol from the bottle trickled down his face.
“Hmm, I’m not much of a whisky man. I prefer a more... ,” he paused for a moment as he watched the panic in his prey begin to rise “… exotic spirit.” 
He began to chuckle to himself, in all reality the whole situation was darkly humorous to him. This is the most pain he’s been in in years, and that is saying something. His chuckle escalated to a howling laughter.
The woman wore a look that held a combination of shock and excitement. Even though she was beginning to panic, a smile spread across her face. Not once in her entire time in Canto has she met a man who could last more than 2 minutes in fight with her, much less one who could so easily brush off a whisky bottle to the head.
She watched as the man’s laughter grew, his bloodshot eyes screamed madness.
“It’s time to put you down you crazy son-of-a-bitch,” she said with a smile. 
She slowly removed the revolver she used to kill the security guard, the aged blood glistened in what little light was available. The sight of the gun just seemed to incite a stronger laughing fit out of Locke. The woman extended her arm and placed the barrel of the gun into the man’s open mouth, and pulled the trigger.
Again, there was a quick flash. His head snapped back with full force, but he remained on his feet, never ceasing his laughter that grew into the howling of a demon. He lowered his head, fixing his blood red eyes on the woman.
He was able to stop his laughter long enough to respond to the horrified look on his prey’s face. 
“What’s the matter baby doll? You seemed surprised you can’t dispatch me as easily as those two security guards,” Locke began to laugh again “Honey, they are nothing compared to a true monster.”     
Locke took one last look at his victim, then opened his jaws to reveal several sharp teeth. The hole left by the bullet can be clearly seen as he made the final move on his prey.                           
****************************************
The man wiped his mouth and looked down at his meal. The woman’s eyes were glossed with fear, but there was an eerie smile that still crept on her lips as she stared blankly into the night sky. 
Locke allowed the woman’s essence to dissolve and flow throughout his body. Fresh blood from a living victim holds a piece of that person’s life and personality. Anyone who takes that essence inherits a part of that person’s life. All their thoughts, feelings, information becomes a part of the predator’s body and soul. 
“Veronica,” He whispered
The woman’s body began to violently shake. She was beginning to reanimate. 
Locke felt a slight pang of worry in the back of his mind. A human of her caliber would be a serious threat as a vampire, everything about her will be augmented and enhanced. 
Locke looked back at the shaking body. 
“Give those zealots hell for me, Veronica.”
Turning around he began to make his way to the edge of the city, the sun was going to be rising soon it was in his best interest to get back to the Cathedral as fast as he can. 
He had lit the match 
“Canto will be devoured by flames by tomorrow night.” Locke finally said with a smile.
                               ****************************************
 The enveloping darkness cascaded across the night sky. Leaving the silhouettes of clouds drift overhead, like veils of moving sentinels, suffocating the very light out of the stars. The scent of moisture and smoke hung thick in the air. The sound of distant thunder boomed across the sky, echoing into the midnight horizon. A light from below slightly illuminated the world, trails of thick black smoke were dressed in the light painted on by miles of inferno. It was as if the gates of hell opened under the earth, releasing and delivering throngs of angel’s utmost nightmares unto God’s domain. The pounding hearts of a million terrified saints could be heard as the sky boomed again. 
Below the heavens, true evil incarnate devoured the world. Sky scrapers wore flames from head to toe, fire danced on the water under decimated bridges, streets were in chaos, destroyed vehicles littered the crowed avenues. Exposed hands and limbs peek out from under of overturned cars, burning corpses are contorted in horrible positions behind the wheel of their tombs. Police stations show no sign of life, a constant siren blares somewhere in the city, with nothing living left to answer. The city, its souls, everything was devoured by chaos.
Well, almost everything.

TheeMikeG,20,,12,1rdk7o,,41,"Hey, all, I’ll try and make this quick because I don’t know how much time I have. My name is Cliff and I live in a nice two-story house in a suburb in California. I have a loving wife and an amazing little princess of a daughter. Today I woke up and went downstairs to see her watching Sunday morning cartoons on our small, discolored TV. She turned up at me and smiled, jumping to wrap her arms around my leg. 

“Daddy! Mom wanted me to tell you that she left a note for you on the counter.”

I rubbed my fingers through her bleach blonde hair before turning to retrieve the note.

Morning honey, it read, have fun today on your father-daughter day! She is really looking forward to spending quality time with you. Maybe take her to that new movie she won’t stop talking about? 	

I set down the note and crept up behind my daughter who had returned her attention the the TV. I sprung, tickling her as she laughed and laughed. Stopping, I gave her a kiss on the back of her head and smiled. 

“So what do you want to do today?” 

She shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t know, can we get icecream?” Her eyes lit up with excitement and she nodded enthusiastically. 

I chuckled, “Yeah, that sounds great. Do you wanna see that movie too?” 

She clapped her hands and giggled cutely. “Yes!” she shouted.

I smiled and pocketed the car keys I had left on the counter the day before. “Ok, go get ready, I’ll be down here waiting.” 

“Ok daddy!” she smiled before bounding up the stairs. “I love you!”

“I love you too!” I shouted after her. I walked towards the TV and shut it off. Yawning, I walked through the eerily quiet house to the fridge. The silence was almost unsettling. I glanced around, looking out the windows for nothing in particular. 

“Almost ready!” yelled my daughter from her bedroom upstairs. 

I shook my head with amusement. I could remember the first time I saw her in the hospital. I promised I would care for her like no one else. So far I had kept my promise, and we’ve been inseparable since. Guilt struck me as I recalled how much I’d been working lately and hadn’t been home to spend time with her. My wife had been telling me late at night when I’d finally come home how our daughter would spend most of the day crying in her room asking for her daddy. Today I was going to make it all up to her. Right after I grabbed a snack. 

I smiled to myself and opened the fridge. The decapitated body of my wife tumbled out and knocked me to the floor, covering me in blood.

I screamed and scrambled backwards until I slammed into the cabinets under the sink. My daughter came skipping into the kitchen holding a knife in one hand and my wife’s head in the other. Her face was distorted as if she was screaming when the blade fell. “I’m almost ready!” she giggled before smiling real wide. “There’s just one more thing I need. Then we can spend the whole day together.”

I got to my feet but took a nasty cut to the leg. I managed to get past her and upstairs, and into my bedroom behind a locked door before she reached it. I can hear her slowly dragging the tip of the knife against the door. She keeps saying “Daddy, please come to the door, I miss you!” She might even be crying, she sounds so sad. I already called the police, I just wanted to leave a tangible record of what’s happening. But I’m sure I could handle this on my own right? I mean she’s a little girl! I might just go to the door now. What do you think?

youngsterjose42,3,,10,1rd8lb,,37,"My mother once told me a story, her sister had an encounter with the paranormal that eventually lead to her suicide... this is that story.

My mother had a sister once, I remember my earliest memories of her, she was always so depressed and I always asked why was she sad. She never had an answer. My mother told me it all started one night when she came home from work. She was walking the streets around midnight heading home when she noticed a man walking behind her. It wasn't the first time she had been followed by this man, Only difference was... this time he tried to talk to my aunt. He asked ""are you happy with your family? aren't you tired of living in a house of religious fools?"". She was scared and asked ""who are you?"" and my mother told me as soon as he stepped out of the shadows my aunt saw his face he looked rather normal except for his long hair and ember red eyes. He smiled and said ""your people call me the devil"" and she started to run. She ran as fast as she could. Eventually my aunt got the house of my mother and she explained what happened. My mother tried to calm her down, my aunt was breathing heavily and could not control herself. Soon enough she passed out.

A few days pass by and my mother sees that my aunt has a serious problem. She didn't go to work for about a week and she felt as if she was not safe at my mothers house. So she moved back to my grandmothers house. They were extremely religious and for some reason my aunt felt safe at her house. The same night she moved back in to her mothers house something happened that drove her into being institutionalized. It was around 1 in the morning and my grandfather and grandmother were fighting. My aunt knew she was awake because she could see her mother. she was in the kitchen and she was looking through the crack in the door. she suddenly felt something brush up against her arm. Her breath taken away, her eyes wide open, she turns around and sees the man claiming to be ""the devil"". He says ""tell me whats wrong. I know, I know something's wrong let me take you away from all your troubles"" she screamed as loud as she could until her mother and father came into the room, they turned on the lights and she kept staring at the empty space next to her bed. My grandmother started yelling at her ""are you crazy?! do you have any idea how late it is?! why are you screaming?!"" she kept going and going until my aunt finally screamed ""the devil, he's after me mom!"" my grandmother was religious, still is, but for some reason she did not believe my aunt and they put her away in a hospital for about a month or two.

While in the hospital my aunt told my mother what she saw in there. They had to put her on several medications before she stopped seeing the man. Every now and then she would try to fall asleep in the hospital while the man watched she said she heard him bragging ""you know they'll never believe you"" or ""you know they cant see me"". When the lights went out she closed her eyes. She could hear his threats, she could hear him mocking her life. She always kept her eyes closed she did not want to see his silhouette even less his ember red eyes. She described him as a physical being yet at the same time he did not exist. At some points she thought she was arguing with herself until she realized the voice was overlapping her voice, her thoughts. She had nightmares almost every night in that hospital. Around 2 month goes by in there and she pretends to be fine they let her out a week or so later. 

My mom did not hear of her for about 3 months after she got out of the hospital. My mother was worried and she sent out search parties she called cops. Yet she never found her. Turns out she was hiding in the woods. She didn't want see anyone, my aunt told my mother that she never gave in. I don't know the way my mom told me I can only assume she was lying. She told me how she lived in the woods for a few months living off whatever she could find. She explained to my mother how he never left her side, he was always there talking to her, he did not want to let her go. My mother told me that the last thing my aunt told to her was something this man, ""the devil"" said to my aunt "" i want you"" she ended up killing herself a week after. She was weak and brittle and was basically a walking corpse. A few members of the family came to her funeral, not many though that's what my mother told me. My grandmother did not go. She was embarrassed of her daughter and the fact that she killed herself.

A few months later after the funeral my mother gets off work around 8pm its still light out so she thinks ""why not visit my sister she needs it"" so she walks to the cemetery. It was almost sunset and my mother told me she sees a man placing flowers on her gravestone. My mother has never seen this man before and she starts running towards him as he walks away she starts running faster. He disappears into the woods and just before he did he looked back and my mother saw his ember red eyes.

REALreptus,7,,25,1r8gsb,,34,"I was about 13 living in CA at the time and like any other 13 year old kid I was best friends with the boy that lived down the street. We often spent the night at each other's houses, but when we spent the night over at his house I would always try to get him to agree for us to sleep out in his huge treehouse, we would stay up till dawn eating candy, chips, and playing playstation until our eyeballs hurt. I always asked him if we could sleep outside because the first and only time we ever slept in his house, I saw this ghost. The ghost himself was a tall man wearing a black coat with a big black hat that sort of looked that that cool hat that Hugh Jackman wears in Van Helsing, and he didn't have a solid or not solid form, I know that sounds weird, but it was like he was there, but wasn't at the same time. I guess the best way I could describe it would be like really thick black static in the shape of a really tall dude wearing a cloak and hat. Well my best friend's little sister would always talk about this guy in the hat, I think the exact way that she referred to him was ""The guy in the hat"", but we were to busy doing our own thing to ever listen to her, to us she was just my friend's annoying little sister that wanted to follow us around and do what we were doing. Well that night while we were playing video games, I glanced down his hallway and at the very end of it there was the man in the hat, but I had only glanced, and when I did a double take, he was gone, so I just ignored it. That sort of glance and disappear thing happened like 2 more times before we went to bed. Now what happened next is what made me never want to spend the night in his house again. We fell asleep just fine, no nightmares, no spooky visions before closing our eyes, but around 3am, no, not exactly 3am, I was young and scared and didn't look at the time, so I'm just guessing it was around 3am, every single radio in his house turned on at the same time and at full volume, and it wasn't music or even just static that played, it was this really deep and low pitch rumble that came out at full blast. It didn't say anything, I don't even know if it was a voice or anything, all I remember is that it scared the living shit out of me. His mom got up and shut off all the radios and yelled at us cause she thought we did it as a joke or something, and wouldn't listen to us when we said were where both sleeping when it happend. My family moved away about 6 months or so after this and I haven't heard from my friend since, I don't know anything about the house or the land or if there was a murder there or whatever, it's just something that happened to me as a kid and something I'll never forget.",I was about 13 when this happend at a friends house.,59,nosleep
childrenofsamhain,9,,5,1rhdoj,,34,"My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Until recently, he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters, Sarah and Emily. Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three. Within the first two years living in the house, Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't until his daughter Sarah was around two years old, that he started to notice she talked to herself. Jamie thought nothing of it, she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself. 

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""Is she your imaginary friend?""

""I guess."" 

Amused, he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall, whispering quietly. ""What's your friends name?"" he asked her. 

""Her name is Helen Mary"", she said. 

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

blkmagick,8,,7,1r8old,,32,"My father was in the military, which meant that we moved around a lot as I was growing up. One of the places we moved to was Pensacola, FL. We moved there right before 8th grade started for me, and we lived in military housing so we got to live in a two story house for the very first time. I was excited; I got my own room and my own bathroom right across the hallway. 

Things were great, until after a year of living in the house when things started to get strange. I was home alone talking to my boyfriend on the phone when I heard a large crash in the kitchen. I slowly walk in to see what happened, and one of the cabinet doors were wide open and bowls were all over the floor. I quickly pick up the bowls and put them away, freaking out. I was in there just five minutes earlier and everything was closed; there was no way for the cabinet to open on its own. I ran up to my room and locked my door until my family came home. When they returned, they asked why bowls were all over the floor in the kitchen. 

A week after that incident, I woke up suddenly out of a deep sleep, gasping for breath. I looked at my doorway and I see a girl standing there. She was wearing an old white nightgown stained with blood, and she had long black hair. Her throat was slit and hastily stitched up, along with her lips being stitched together. Her eyes were gouged and missing, and her hands were chopped off. 

Thinking it was just my imagination, I closed my eyes and reopened them, only to see she had moved closer. With each blink, the closer she would get, so I threw the covers over my head and prayed that she didn't touch me. I ended up falling asleep and awoke in the morning with her nowhere to be found. 

Over the next year, she would appear every other week, just watching me. I got used to it eventually, because I thought it was just a chronic bad dream and she didn't do anything to hurt me. It wasn't until after we moved to back to Michigan did I get really scared. My sister and I were talking and sharing stories about our house in Florida, and she told me something troubling. She mentioned that if she had to use the restroom in the middle of the night, she would always use my parent's bathroom in their room instead of the one across my bedroom. I asked her why, and her response was:

""Because I would always see a girl in white standing outside of your door and it scared me.""

Knowing that I wasn't the only one that saw her terrified me, because I knew it wasn't just a dream. I still wonder if she appears for the new family that's in the house and who she is and what happened to her. I have to say though, I'm just glad to be out of that house.

I’ve never had suicidal thoughts myself, I’ve been depressed but that’s just life, you can’t be happy all the time. 

**Most** people don’t think of the repercussions that can happen when they have suicidal thoughts as they just think that no one cares about them so they assume that they don’t have a reason to live and just want to end their lives.

Isn’t it weird how one thing can change your life drastically? From good to bad?

My dad had a great friend (no names) once who was amazing, he had a job that he enjoyed a lot which was him being a train driver.

My dads friend was driving a train to Glasgow when out of nowhere, a person jumped onto the tracks and died instantly. When this happened, my dads friends life just stopped, I can’t really explain it myself as I wasn’t the driver, he was. 

But can you just imagine driving a train, not seeing/seeing a young person jump in front of a train whilst not being able to stop the train from hitting that person? With their blood splattering the window and tracks. I mean the average speed limit of being hit by a car going 30 miles per hour can kill you, just imagine being hit by a train going like 5 times faster than that.

After that happened, my dads friend was just at a loss, he felt like it was his fault as he was the driver.

misstiddeR,6,,13,1r1ypf,,28," when I was younger I never really had friends.My Parents were drug users and no one wanted their children around the drug baby. I passed my time playing in fields and building forts, somewhere along the line I created an imaginary friend. We were the same age and she looked just like me. She would come to school and even stay all night at my house but no one else could see her. She wanted to be seen so badly.Sometimes she would get angry.One time she was so mad she scratched my arm and told me if I said anything to anyone she would hurt my parents.  She was always there staring at me, she wouldn't even blink. One day I started to cry. I was scared. my mother finally asked what was going on and I told her. ""Its Madi mom my friend she's mad at me.""The look on her face went from concern to questioning. ""who's madi honey"" I didn't want to answer her madi was in the corner of the room ripping her hair out and her eyes had grown dark.I told her she was my friend but no one could see her aside from me. My mother at that point thinking it was some silly kid thing began to joke around. ""oh and what does this madi look like?"" I told her she looked just like me and my mother froze. She began to get angry ""Did your father tell you to say this?"" I shook my head and looked over at madi she was smiling but where the black eyes had been before were now clawed bloody holesMadi spoke ""what did I tell you?""She stated to slowly come towards my mother and i. She said something over and over again. ""dirty bitch drop the needle"". And before i could do anything she grabbed my mothers head and with a single move killed her.I never saw madi again.

lovelylizards,4,,3,1rc40h,,30,"I've always loved pictures, it's like capturing memories to look at later. I take them any chance I get. I guess you could call it an unhealthy obsession. Being a little homesick lately, I've been going through old albums. I wish I hadn't.

I invited my sister, Nicole, over. We poured a couple glasses of wine and got out photo albums, scrapbooks, whatever we could find. It was nice having a change instead of my boring routine, but I'd definitely pick that over what happened next. 

After a couple drinks, a few laughs, and tons of pictures, we started to notice something. There was a man in every picture I was in. Just standing there, in the distance, smiling. At first I thought it was just a coincidence, but the more I looked, the more I recognized his face. I've seen this man before. He looked like a normal man, roughly 6 feet, brown hair, bright green eyes. The one thing that was off is that he was always smiling. I didn't think too much of it, it was getting late. Nicole went home by then so I decided to head off to bed. 


I usually never have nightmares, a few in a year at most. Tonight was different. I don't know if you'd call it a nightmare, but it was enough to scare the shit out of me. I was in a dark room, with nothing but a chair and a window. The window didn't open. I could see that man. He was behind a tree and just looking at me, mouthing some words I couldn't make out. Soon after, he started walking towards me slowly. He walked right through the window, he was just about to walk up to me when I woke up in a sweat. I wasn't sure what this meant, or why I was so terrified by it but I shook it off and went back to sleep.

The next day was rather normal. I was out running errands, as usual. It was when I was in Best Buy that I saw that damn guy again. Just smiling at me, staring at me with those bright green eyes. I decided to go up to him. 


""Excuse me, sir. May I help you?""


Nothing.


""Sir?""


Again, nothing. 

After what seemed like forever, just as I was about to walk away he said something. 


""I've been waiting for this.""


""Um, waiting for what?""


""This, you."" 


I got really uncomfortable, and felt it was best to walk away. On my way out the door I heard him say quietly ""Have a nice day, Jennifer."" Okay, how the hell did this freak know my name. I just wanted to go home and sleep. I left the store and continued on my way home. 

As I walked up to my door I found a photograph. It was of me, getting into my car at Best Buy. I was hoping this was just some prank because I didn't want to think of the alternatives. I looked on the back and one sentence has never scared me so much


""I've waited too long."" 


I had no idea what the hell this meant but I was getting sick of it. I didn't know what to do so I decided it would be best to just go to bed and get some much needed sleep. As I laid down and got comfortable, I heard a scratch by the window.

sgtatarms123,1,,17,1r20rb,,26,"I have been getting singular phantom door bell rings at my house, that only i am able to hear, my mum and dad don't hear anything.

The first instance was about 5 months ago, i heard a singular door bell ring at 7am, it woke me up, and i didn't think much of it. Later that day i asked my mother if she heard anything and she said no you're dreaming.

Now im not a crazy person, i am probably the most sane person you would ever meet, in addition i don't do drugs, or drink

So i don't think much about it, thinking my parents their old im young, young people have better hearing than old people.

But this keeps happening around the same time 7am, and im thinking who the heck is this, is this some joke is this the delivery man?

No it wouldn't be a delivery this early ever

Whenever im home alone i have the habbit of whenever the door bell rings i don't answer it, so it was about 4pm one day and a singular door bell ring happens, i tip toe and peek out the front window, i wasn't very fast so i saw nothing, and it never rung again.

A month later, its about 6pm, singular door bell ring, im there in 20seconds, nothing, front gate not moving, again me alone in the house.

Am i imagining all this? there is no way i am not crazy

Coincidence or not, a few days later my mum is in the house, the door rings, my mum answers, its my elderly neighbour.

So i think to myself so it was her all along, all those times i never answered the door it was her, even the times at 7am, shes old ok old people wake up early... ok case closed right.

Today

4:53am singular door bell ring, wakes me up from my sleep, i am not freaking crazy, you know how a door bell sounds, its long it lasts about 3 seconds, i am awake and i can hear the second half of the ring all around my house

I go back to sleep because i was tired, then it rings again at 7am... i tell my mum when i wake up says she didn't hear anything

Heres the good part my dad thinks im crazy too so bought some cctv security cameras and has installed one at our front porch

Today I rewinded the tape to 6:45am, 

I see two lumps laying vertically on our front porch, it is two people in sleeping bags

Skip forward to 6:55am

They get up, I see two men one wears a long brown coat and a black hat, he is big and fat but i couldn't see his face, the other guy is thin and small, he was wearing grey sweat pants and a grey sweater...

Him i saw, his face was skinny and pale almost half skeleton he has yellow rotten teeth

7:00am

I see him ringing our door bell then go back to sleep in his sleeping bag same with big fat guy, they zip themselves up before you could see their heads but here they zip themselves all the way up, and inch away like caterpillars, out of camera view (this took 3mins)

WTF - was this their sick way of saying thankyou for your hospitality 

(I rewinded the tape further they came at 3:09am and started sleeping on our front porch)

I think the ring at 4:53am meant the time they showed, i might have been in deep sleep the other times idk. I also think they hop our fence, I told my dad to put a camera there too, called cops shown them this, there's a patrol car outside our house right now.

WILLingtonegotiate,11,,6,1rdxhm,,29,"Well to start things off I have a hard time convincing myself that any of this is supernatural. Just extremely weird, somewhat scary. It may be due to the fact I worry about my families safety, more than anything. Well, I will start from the beginning.

We moved into our new home around the end of August. We resettled here in San Antonio due to my wifes employer requiring her to live here.  I say ""new"" home because it is just that, a NEW home. The neighborhood is new as well. All the homes are brand new the oldest being around a year old. We love the area. Awesome neighbors, rural setting, though stores still within walking distance. 

We know absolutely nobody in this town, so we have pretty much stuck to ourselves in the short time here so far. We live in a 4 bedroom house, with our three children's rooms upstairs and my wife and myself sleeping in the master bedroom downstairs. Our room is literally 10 feet from the front door. I say this because my story revolves quite a lot around that very front door.  

Around our third night in the new home is when it started. DING......DONGGGGGG!!!! The second part of the doorbell sound was separated by about 2 seconds. I don't know why I find that eerie.   DING......DONGGGGGG. 
DINGDONG DINGDONG DINGDONG
These three were quite rapid taps on the doorbell.

I must have woke on the first ring but did not quite have my mind working yet, much less my body. I open my eyes and hear the long drawn out sound of the doorbell being pressed firmly. Then three rapid taps. My room is completely dark, only lit by the blue lights of the alarm clock. This same clock showed me at this moment it was 2:30 am. 

""Wtf"", I thought. I immediately started fidgeting in my drawer for my handgun, it's a Glock 23 with an extremely bright light attached just under the barrel. It would be quite handy in a few minutes.  I grab a magazine, slide it in and chamber a round. With a flick of the switch the super bright beam illuminates my room and my clear path to the front door.

As I sleepily stumble my way to the front door I hear another rapid ring of the doorbell followed by a deep, loud, booming knock.  I check through the peephole and can make out the top of a mans head, as if he were leaning on the door, listening for any type of movement coming from within my house. I place my weapon on the door around where I figure this persons head to be and I speak.

""Who is it?!!"" I shouted

My question was greeted by only what I can describe as the loudest silence I had ever felt wash over me.

Again I shout, ""Who is it?!!"".
And I hear him for the first time.
""It's me, Daniel"", replied the dry, calm yet exhausted voice of the man outside my door. 
""I do not know a Daniel!"" I replied sternly. ""What do you want?"" I asked.
""I've been left here, I do not know where I am and I just need a place to sleep."" Replied the oddly calm voice just inches away from the barrel of my gun.
""You have 3 seconds to leave my property or I will shoot you where you stand!"" I said this with a very loud and booming command. In retrospect this seems harsh and I am not proud of it. It was after 2am and I was worried for the safety of my family. I mean no ""good"" person would do this type of thing to a stranger, right?

I start to count, ""1...........2"" just then I look out the peephole, and no one is there. ""3"", the 3 was noticeably quieter than the previous two in the countdown. I have a bathroom just off the foyer and it's window has a clear view of the front door.  I peer out of it, no one there. I think to myself ""okay, he got the point."" Oh shit what if he didn't and this asshole is now taking revenge on my wifes car or worse my baby (truck). I decided I would need to go outside, against my inner monologue telling my white ass to stay inside.

I enter my room to grab my shoes, and got a shock as my wife broke the silence.

""You are not going outside after that!!!"" She exclaimed. She must have heard the entire thing.

""Do you want this asshole screwing with our cars?"" I asked.

""I could care less, you are NOT going out there!!"" She again rattled off.

""Baby, go back to sleep I will be fine."" I assured her.

I get my shoes on, go to the front door and that is when I saw something so  simple yet extremely terrifying. The door had been unlocked this whole time. I do not know why but this had a huge effect on my nerves at the moment that it was noticed. I check the bathroom window once again a quickly snap open the front door while sweeping every bit of the front porch with the barrel of my weapon, the beam from it's attached light painting my yard as if it were the broadest brush in the pale. Nothing. I step outside and onto the wet grass. I check the side yard closest to my door, and then start towards the driveway. The vehicles looked fine as I could see them clearly due to the very bright street lamp illuminating my driveway. No sign of ""Daniel"". I start to check the other side of my home when I hear it. Thinking of it right now sends chills all the way down my body. 

""I'm right here."" Replied Daniel in a scratchy but clear whisper.

This was so chilling at the time, that I could not bring myself to turn around right away. It felt as if he were inches from me. Right behind me, staring. I feel a little embarrassed to say it took quite a lot of courage to turn around, but when I did, I was surprised. Daniel had not been directly behind me, but about twenty feet away, sitting on the curb beside my driveway facing away from me. His silhouette small and twig like. There was a lot of light coming from the street light across the street yet he seemed strangely dark. As if he were able to escape the lights grasp ever so slightly. I remedied this with the light beaming from beneath my pistol. When I illuminated him, it was not what I was expecting. 

Maybe my being terrified at the moment had me thinking irrationally. I was expecting an old bearded ghost of a man waiting for me to peer into his cold dead eyes, only to grasp my soul and rip it out through my throat, I know, too many movies right? This was a noticeably unkempt young man but not dirty, more of a grungy type of look going on. He was wearing a vertically striped orange and green striped tight fitting sweater, he was african american and seemed to be in his early twenties. He sat there seemingly in no hurry to turn around and greet me, legs stretched out into the street, hands placed palm down stretched out behind him, fingers noticeable grasping at the blades of grass between them. 

""What do you need?"" I rattle off, with an understandably shaky voice.

""Only what I asked for."" He replied, again way too calm for the situation. 

""I suggest you get up and move on before I call the police!"" I say. I crinfe now thinking of how I reacted to this young man. 

""That will be fine, would you do that for me, would you call them for me?"" He spat back, as he peered slowly over his right shoulder at me, his eyes closed tight seemingly due to my extremely bright light beaming into the back of his head.

""Sure, do you fucking realize how close you were to being shot man?"" I ask.

""Why on earth would you shoot me? I could have walked into your home, without ever knocking, right?"" He said this the way a mother would say it to her child when revealing she knew a secret the child thought nobody knew.

""Alright, move the FUCK on dude, NOW!"" I shouted but noticeably terrified now.

He rose to his feet, seemingly in one movement. Turned to me, his hand stretched out as to block the beam of light so he could open his eyes and look at me. He opened his eyes which were noticeably bloodshot and just looked at me, staring as if he were asking me to lower the light, which I did. As I did this he showed me his hands first palm then the back of his hands like a magician would when assuring his audience he had nothing up his sleeves. He brought his hands to his face and covered it, while rubbing it quickly as someone would while washing their face. He slowly lowers his hands to his side and then looks straight up into the sky, and then slowly down towards me. He smiled, and said in a hushed but very deep voice. 

""Call them motherfucker!""

I raise my weapon back up and start to back into my driveway towards my door, every few steps I make towards my door he makes one towards me.

""Call them motherfucker!"" He screams. As if he knew what the outcome of the call would be.

""Take one more fucking step, and it will be your fucking last!!!"" I shout, my finger fighting the urge to squeeze of a round into his torso.

He stops in his tracks, cocks his head at an angle and presents a very dramatic frown. Followed by a snarl. His face seemed to twist and contort while staring at me with the most anger I had seen on a human face, ever.

I get into my home grab my phone a run upstairs to a window to get a view of this motherfucker while I call the police. My wife was already up there, she must have been watching the whole thing. I quickly dial 911 while ushering my way to the window. As I peer down at him, he slowly looks up at us, still snarling.

""Call them, motherfucker!!!!"" His scream muffled a bit by our walls but still noticeably louder than before.

I get the operator on the phone, never breaking eye contact with Daniel.

I explain everything to the operator as they assure me she has officers on the way.

She calmly starts to ask for more details. What is he wearing, physical description, what has been said, did he physically attack me, was he still there, did he have any weapons, do I have any weapon? The questions seemed to go on and on. She then says.

""Sir you should be able to see the lights from the unit arriving, can you see it?"" She asked

""Yes!"" I exclaim.

She then asked for me to stay inside until the officers knock at my door. I immediately head down stairs and there is the knock.

""Poh-leece!"" A male voice shouted.

I opened the door, and was greeted by an officer. The cop was about mid 30's, portly and visibly sweaty. 

""You called in a disturbance?"" He asked.

""Yeah, did you grab him? I replied.

""Hell no, is he still here?"" He snarked. 

""Well he was ten seconds ago."" I said.

We both walk out into the yard where we had stood. No sign of Daniel. I explained everything to the officer as I have just done to all of you. He seemed to believe it all and was also a bit shaken. 

""Damn, that's some crazy shit!"" He said with a look of astonishment.

""You're telling me!"" I replied. 

He retreats to his car for a few moments and comes back. He explains that a family had just reported their 17 year old son missing. Their son was african american, tall, and most importantly his name was Daniel. He explained further that Daniel was a diabetic and they worried he may be going into some sort of diabetic fit. Everything started to fit perfectly. There was a reason he was so irate and up and down. This wasn't a maniac, it was a young man that was simply ill. My emotion went from scared for my family, to scared for this young man. As we are standing there in my yard, the cop and I. We hear it.

CRACK!!! ..........CRACK CRACK CRACK CRACK!

Five very noticeable gunshots rang out. Followed by my neighbor, a 60 something asian widow, running from her house, handgun swinging wildly back at her home. She was screaming, quite literally bloody murder.

As I stand there paralyzed with shock, the officer quickly draws his weapon and starts shouting commands.

""Put the weapon down, now!"" He screams thunderously.

""I killed him!"" She shouted while simultaneously throwing the handgun to the ground recklessly.

The officer orders her to the ground, approaches her slowly and quickly handcuffs her. He starts to search her, stands her up, walks her to his car and retrieves the thrown weapon. All while I am standing there in horror.

He shouts for me to go into my home and stay in there.  It turns out Daniel saw the lights about the same time I did. He must have quickly ran to my neighbors and ran through an unlocked door. My neighbor found him standing in her living room, naked and apparently slamming her cats head into the wall. She said he had the cat by the tail and was swinging it violently into the wall, blood splattering everywhere. She retrieved her handgun and shot him 5 times, running out her door immediately after.

I was told he was dead before he even hit the floor. She hit him with three bullets. One through the neck, one through the thigh and one, the fatal one, through his temple. I met the young mans family, who actually was pretty hostile towards me. They wanted, quite surprisingly, to sue my neighbor for wrongful death or some shit. I cannot judge them as I do not know what they must be going through.

Oh yeah, I forgot the craziest part. After the police officer ordered me back into my home, my wife and I found something that send chills down our spines. Lying there at the foot of our bed, a pair of shoes and socks. You guessed it. They were Daniels.

mitchbresh,4,,10,1rfvu4,,25,"So, let's just get right into this. I work at a Futureshop, and I have for quite a while now. One of my co-workers, Will, used to work in LA, moving his way up the ranks as a screenwriter, but moved to my city for his marriage. We both started talking one day about how we love to write and started tossing ideas back and forth. We both have a knack for the horror genre and decided that we would work together on writing a horror screenplay. This was about a month ago, and as of yet we haven't been able to sit down and work on anything together. 

On saturday we were both working and took our lunch break at the same time. We started talking about when we could get together to work on the screenplay and that's when the story came up. Will knows how much I love anything creepy and how invested I am in the paranormal, so he shared something another one of our coworkers, Chelsea, had told him. 

After he told me her story, I had to meet with her. She worked on Sunday and I asked Will to talk to her to see if she would be okay with discussing it with me. Yesterday I received a text from Will saying that Chelsea would really love to talk to me about the situation. 

One thing I should mention is that i have a family history of being involved with the paranormal. I have had many of my own experiences along with helping out friends of friends with questions they have about the topic. 

So yesterday I went in to talk to her about what had happened and this is what she shared with me:
She has a son who is about two-years old named Lucas. A week ago Lucas woke up in the middle of the night screaming at the top of his lungs. Chelsea ran to his room and tried to calm him down, but nothing seemed to work. She decided to take him into her room to sleep with her, but when she did this, he freaked out even more. She said that Lucas was fixated on one corner of the room and kept staring at the corner, repeating ""No, no, no..."" over and over. This obviously creeped her out, so she took him out of the room and he seemed to calm down. A couple nights ago, the same thing happened, but this time he pulled the sheet over his head as though to hide from something that was standing in the corner. The second night he freaked out, she had to take him on a car ride around the block just to calm him down.

She said that her room has always felt off to her and that she often gets the feeling that there is a presence in the room with her. I asked if she owned any pets and she told me that she has a dog. Chelsea then proceeded to tell me that the dog has acted strange in the room before as well. 

I asked her if there was anything else important I should know and she shared that her older son had said he saw a ghost in her room the other day. I'm not sure it's linked though, because he happened to ""see"" the ghost after the first incident with Lucas.

After I had asked her all of my questions I told her to start paying attention to certain details and to note them as they happen. I gave her my number and told her that if anything happens or if she has any questions, she should call me. At this point in time I don't think she has anything to worry about, but I told her that I would like to come visit her son and her house to see if I can get a reading on anything. 

I'm not sure when I'll be able to visit her house or if anything else will happen, but if something does happen, I'll make sure to update those who are reading this.",My Co-worker's Son,35,nosleep
yurglar,10,,16,1r6zsn,,24,"Under the Bed

I’m writing this because I simply cannot sleep and there’s something I really need to tell someone, and I find this reddit to be a good place to do so. It is something that is not what you’d consider in the domain of classical horror stories, like zombies or ghosts. It is not, because it was, and I’m afraid still is, real. 

It is so real that it happened 11 years ago, when I was only 7, on a cold morning of December. As you can see, not the night of 31st October. Just the placid, boring morning of 7th December. I was in bed, and I knew my parents were already out, they liked going on morning jogs together. It was a Sunday and my head was throbbing. I have frequent migraines and that 7th December migraine was particularly bad. So there I was, feeling shitty and thinking about lunch, when I moved and my bed creaked. The house was old, like proper old, and we had just moved in (in this regard that part of my life did sound like the beginning of a cliché horror story). I thought it was just temporary anyway, once dad left his job we would leave to California.

When I was a kid I had this habit of putting a pillow over my face when I had a migraine, normally one of those useless small pillows always hanging around. They were always cold, and the cold felt good on my forehead and cheeks. It might sound a bit stupid to you, but to me, it felt good for a few seconds. On 7th December I did this and suddenly, I could not remove the pillow.

I tried to remove it with all my strength, and whoever, whatever, was pushing down, gave in. It was more or less the strength of a skinny teenager. I started panicking, scared, my legs twisting and my heartbeat shooting through the roof. I didn’t even wonder what was happening. I managed to catch a breath and then it happened, all of a sudden. I heard the light switch of my room go out, and the blinds closing violently, and the pressure on the pillow suddenly increased. Twice, then tenfold. It was no longer the strength of a human being but something else. I felt my mind slowdown from the lack of oxygen and I stopped fighting. I felt a strange calm wash over me. Whatever was killing me was impossible to fight, it was like there was a ton of stone over that pillow. I saw a light, my vision going white and then tunneling, and I heard whispers. I was dying. I felt scared then. I put my hands over the pillow, but there was nothing there, and I only felt the hairs of my arms standing up. My hands were not smashed as I expected. My young brain could not make sense of it, but I remember 
being scared, really scared. That’s when I heard a bark.

My dog, Thor, had heard me twist and struggle in bed and had come, to my lucky rescue. The pressure immediately disappeared, the blinds opened and the light turned on and that’s when I felt it, sliding over my right arm, like a hand caressing it, but a dead hand, callous and cold hand, and I felt it, whatever it was, turning and hiding under the bed, like a snake hiding under a rock. Thor kept barking madly, teeth showing and ears back. He was a German shepherd, huge for the standards. Then he neared my bed, looked under my bed, growling and then stopped. He sniffed once, then twice, looked again under the bed, and then climbed on top of the bed and licked my face, where I laid, regaining my breath and control over my limbs, which had gone a bit numb. I remember hugging Thor and almost crying.

I told it to my parents but they did not believe me, they thought it was the migraines and started talking about a psychologist or psychiatrist and bad grades at school. I remember being angry with their reaction, but over time it faded. It took some time for me to sleep again and Thor always slept in my room, sometimes even with me, but there were never any more issues. I never even remembered it from time to time, it was just a scary, traumatic memory my brain just erased. For 11 years, I slept over that memory, over whatever was under my bed.

We moved out a month ago, after 11 years, to a new modern house in California, where my bed doesn’t even have space under it and I love it. My dad sold the house to this young couple who were his friends, who didn’t have much money, but loved the retro feeling of the house. Back then, I didn’t even remember that scary event 11 years ago.

That’s when, as I was laying on my new bed yesterday, I remembered, along with all my morning nightmare details 11 years ago, my dad complaining the other day at dinner table how John and Mary, the young couple, haven’t phoned or said anything about the house since they started living there.

I went to get Thor in my bedroom. I can’t stop thinking about it and I hope they are alright.

sinbysilence,9,,2,1r49de,,26,"Okay. You have to believe me. And what I'm about to say is going to make you not believe me. But please, be patient with me.

You're not real. At least, the you who is reading this isn't real. You only exist because my mind tells you to exist. Regardless of how unbelievable that sounds, I know it to be true. You're helping me cope. You're helping my brain stay active.  And, I believe, to some degree, you're helping keep me alive.

Since there's no better place to start,  I'll just start at the beginning. Back before I knew you existed. Back when you had the possibility of being real.

Back when my normal life got catapulted into this current situation.  I lead a very mediocre life. Living paycheck to paycheck, small group of friends, and no one in my life worth falling in love with. I was on my way to work, just like every other day. Stopped to get coffee. Lit my cigarette as I left the gas station. I began my morning commute.  It was all very routine. Until the car pulled out in front of me.  I stood up on my brakes, but still hit him at an abrupt 45 miles an hour. I ran the red light.  My seatbelt burned my chest.  My head  was blasted by the air bag. My femur protested against the impact until it snapped. The pain was dizzying.  Disorienting. I dug for the phone that flew out of my hand. Mom was still  on the line, crying. She heard what had happened and was over an hour away. But her and dad where on their way.

Now this is what I believe may have happened next. I think I remember getting out of the car and being put on the stretcher. I remember the god awful pain of having my leg reset on the side of the road. That had to be real, right?  It hurt so badly. It was the most earth shattering pain I've ever felt. Once I got to the hospital I was drugged and put to sleep to prep for surgery.

I faded in and out all week. After four nights, I woke to a conversation with my mom. I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night and, considering the drugs in my system, I was very much alert. My mom snapped to attention when she felt me stir. I look at her as though she was a stranger. I'll never forget the confusion I felt as I asked her...""who are you? ""

""It's me, Em. It's mom.""

""Where am I?"" I cried, tugging at the IV on my hand. 

""You're in the hospital,  sweetie.  You were in an accident. ""

""Was it bad?"" I begged for an answer. ""Was it bad?"" I was more hysterical the second time.

I never got an answer. Even when I woke up the next morning she acted as though the conversation never took place. And here's why: I never woke up. Instead,  my brain started to build my new percieved reality. Looking back on it, I think that conversation we had was the last real one I had. Because the accident WAS bad. Because I am still suffering from it, to some extent.

Suffering may not be the best way to put it. Sure, the first two months were brutal. I had to relearn to walk. I had to have help getting in an out of the shower. I had headaches. I got dizzy and sick often. I couldn't work. But it had to seem real.

Now,  life is amazing. I've met the person who made me believe in soulmates. I'm back at work - they even transferred me closer to home and gave me a raise when I came back. Remember how I was the one who ran the red light?  The guy I hit doesn't want to sue me. My life couldn't be anymore perfect if I wrote it myself. Because I have wrote it myself. My brain has created a life to make everything seem normal. I would have never questioned it if it weren't for the other night when I caught a glimpse of reality.

""Nurse...nurse...I think she's waking!"" 

Mom?

Opening my eyes felt like I was fighting a week without sleep.

""Where am I?"" I mumbled.  I hurt. It made no sense.

""You're in the hospital,  baby. You were in an accident, but it's okay. You're going to be okay. I'm so glad to see your eyes.""

Accident? I don't remember anything in my recent history that would have landed me in the hospital. I've been overly precautious these past five months. I voiced my confusion out loud.   ""What accident? I've not been in an accident since June."" 

I saw mom's face fall from optimism to sadness. I asked again, ""what accident?  Was it bad?"" I was scared. Scared because I didn't remember an accident. Scared because of how badly I hurt and didn't know why.

""Sweetie, you've been here since June.""

And then I understood. Why she was so happy to see my eyes. They had been shut since June. 

""Is it bad?"" But before she had a chance to answer, I was drifting again. And the next thing I knew,  I woke up in my bed with my boyfriend at my side.

Since that night, I occasionally catch bursts of their conversation inside my hospital room. Remember how I said I think you're helping to stay alive? 

""She's showing good brain activity. That's a good thing. Unfortunately,  it was a nasty bump to her head. But we've seen people wake up from comas after months, years even. So long as her brain remains healthy, there's no reason not to hope for the best.""

Sounds optimistic,  right? So why am I scared?

I've built an amazing life inside my head. I'm afraid I'll have to leave it. I'm afraid that I may soon wake up.

BumpinRapTapes,10,,9,1r0hla,,26,"So I got a call from a telemarketer, nothing weird about that really.  But before I hung up the automated voice started spitting out stuff like my address, age, stuff like that.  And then my social security number.  Then a list of my room mates.  And then I was concerned.  I waited until the machine stopped, expecting some numbers to press for more info or whatever so I could find out what's up and get myself off their call list.  All the lady robot said though was ""The Intermed company thanks you.""

Reasonably concerned I started doing some research, after ignoring a bunch of message board sites  I finally found what I think was the Intermed site (in like the fifth page of results).  This is all it said:

""Intermed is at the forefront of the organ trade market and thought processing innovations.  All our services are backed with industry leading research and proven by numerous customer testimonials.  Many of our customers are satisfied to the point of frequent return, and we pride ourselves in maintaining our client pool.  Products and services offered by our company are backed with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime maintenance, all available with a phone call.

Never again will the flaws of your fathers keep you from the life you deserve.  Even the best and brightest are far from perfect, and we strive everyday to make you, the perfect human being.""

Nothing else.  White page, black text.  That's it.  I decided to backtrack to the message boards to see what I could find.  This led me to some random sites and eventually I found a few message threads of people sharing stories similar to mine.  A weird robot caller with way too much information.  One guy got the call in the wee hours of the morning and totally laid a boner kill on a sweaty night with his lady.  They all seemed to be on the same hunt I was, except for one username that I saw pop up on a few of the sites, he called himself ASimpleCipher.  All this dude did was sing Intermed's praises, how he and his friends had used their ""products and services to tremendous avail"" and ""would recommend to anyone!""  All very cheesy and all seemingly marketing plants.  Since that was my best lead I decided to make an account on one of the thread sites and try and get in contact with him.

I sent him a rather aggressive message, which may've been a mistake looking back.  But regardless, and unsurprisingly, I got no response.  I decided if worse came to worse I'd just deal with it when it came up.  I put the whole thing in the back of my mind.  For a few months.

Then ASimpleCipher responded.  Here's a copy and paste of our correspondence:

[Me]  Hey man it's really obvious you work for intermed, you're not fooling anyone.  I want to know who you are, what intermed is and how you got so much of my information.  And I want MY private information deleted from your database, and I want off your call list.  Immediately.  I will not hesitate to get a lawyer involved if this goes any further.

[ASimpleCipher]   I appreciate your interest in my company, Ben!  As always, customer care is a top goal at Intermed.  My representatives tell me that based on market research, you would be a prime candidate for our products and services.  As a courtesy, we like to know as much as we can about potential customers, so as to provide the best quality care possible.  Like you, I once felt a terrible weight in my life, one that rendered me incapable of reaching my full potential as a human being.  When doctors could not help me mend the flaws given to me by generations past, I took matters into my own hands.  As it came to pass, that effort is what gave way to this current business venture.  You may hesitate at terminology like ""Thought Processing"" and ""Organ Trade"", but let me assure you the danger begins and ends at the television screen.  So, if I may, I'd like to draw some common ground between yourself and I.  We do share many similarities.  As a young man, I was plagued with severe asthma (like yourself) from my mother's side of the family, leaving me unable to compete physically with my peers.  This lead me to more intellectual endeavors as I began to mature into an adult.  Cruel as fate is however, I soon discovered I'd inherited a more severe form of my grandfathers autism.  His genes riddled me with social anxiety, and I was thus outcast from much of any community I was ever a member of.  In spite of my flawed genetics I was only more driven to clear the blemishes of my being.  Nothing, I vowed, would hinder my quest for perfection... of the perfect human being.  Given to me from my lineage, however, was the savvy and cunning of generations of businessmen.  

Years, centuries it seems, passed while I honed my craft and built my empire.  Once one is outcast from society, one develops a strong callous to sympathy.  Under a mutual agreement of confidentiality between you and I, I will admit to using almost every associate of mine as merely a means to my own end.  Well, that end is Intermed.  Intermed is my true brainchild, as it were.  I will also admit to misleading you a bit, giving the facade of a full staff under my employ.  Let me assure you I am fully capable of operating this venture on my own.  Let me also assure you your personal information is safe and sound, as I said, I only aim to ensure the best service possible.  Never miss a detail is a creed I operate under.

Enough business however!  Even a jaded outcast such as me has need for camaraderie!  During my time working in the shipping industry I found myself in Northern California in the early 1960's.  My business associate at the time was a rather unstable man.  Every bit of his free time, it seemed he would study the art of coded language, ciphers, cryptograms... whatever one may call them.  Strangely, he got me very interested in the art and it has since become a favorite hobby of mine.  Of course his were much more complex than anything I cared to attempt, he was also versed in astrology and loved to incorporate knowledge of the stars into his little puzzles (This earned him quite the sinister reputation after we parted ways).  On the other hand, I preferred to leave little clues here and there, woven into my business dealings.  Now imagine what fun it would be if someone figured out my little puzzles!  All that work of building a persona of mystery!  Unravelled by a thread I'd left loose for some cunning soul to pull!  Really, I thought someone would've found it by now.  Even after everyone I've tried to sell Intermed's services and products to it is you, cunning lad, who has finally made contact.  Very clever, indeed.  Of course you saw my companies website.  I admit it is a bit sparse, a work in progress.  Reducing my mission for Intermed to a single paragraph however, I did put in a bit of extra effort.

I have been rambling though, I do apologize!  Thank you for inquiring about my company, I hope my response has eased any concerns you may have.

-Intermed-

I really don't know what to make of this guy.  It really can't be some prank, the guy knew I had asthma as a kid.  How?  I have to say that I've never experienced such an air of creepiness from pure text.  Something about the way he composed his message was off.  I don't know.  I can't make a lot of sense out of any of this.  I stopped my investigation there, being as I have seen too many horror movies and don't like the idea of rabbit holes.  It's been a few months since and I haven't heard anything from Intermed or ASimpleCipher.  I check the thread site every now and then.  I did go back and check out the Intermed website again.  I'm really not one for puzzles, I can't make anything out of it.  So I'm submitting it here to see if someone is more ""cunning"" than me.  I hope so.

NeonPaint,12,,7,1ra0o4,,24,"I need someone to help me. I need to actually be able to go to sleep and not worry about what I'm going to wake up to. I need it to stop.
The past few days have been enough to make me pack up and check myself into the crazy house. It would have to be better than this. 

I work at a nursing home. It's not a luxurious job for sure but this nursing home makes my job interesting. It's haunted. I know it sounds stupid but it really is. We have a shadow that haunts one room and our residents will act in ways that will set you on edge. I guess the most recent example is Dessy, I obviously cannot provide you her real name but this is a nickname I have given her myself. 

Dessy is a cute little old woman. She is the grandma you wish you could have. We've always had a pretty good companionship. A couple weeks ago she changed. Her appearance and her personality completely shifted. Her eyes become sunken in, hair was constantly messy when it used to always be well groomed, teeth started to turn a nasty yellow, and her feet...dear god her feet...they looked like they belonged to a creature who only resembled a human in the slightest way. The best way I can explain her feet is that they looked like long fingered hands with jagged finger nails, they didn't look like they belonged to some little adorable woman of 92. 

She started saying *things* to me. There was one conversation that has stuck with me. 

""Dessy, do you want to go to the dining room tonight?""

""Fuck...fuck...you little **whore**.""

""Excuse me? Why are you saying that? Honey, you can eat in your room, I just wanted to make sure...""

""How does it feel whore? Little slut you fucking slut you whore you **SLUT**.""

""You need to stop being mean. How bout we go into the bathroom and you can go before dinner?"" 

At this moment, she shuffles into the bathroom with me and I grab her pants to pull them down.

""You fucking slut. Does he do this to you? Does he put his hands in your pants? Does he fuck you with his hand? He fucked that little virgin c--t......virgin....whore slut **fuck** you...with his hand....virgin c--t c--t c--t."" 

I went white as a ghost. I was close to Dessy but this old woman never knew anything about me other than my age, my name, and that I wasn't married. I never spoke a word to her about anything sexual but she knew *things*. My personal life isn't something I want to share but her mentioning those last words did relate to me in a very personal way. I looked at her as if the devil himself were standing in front of me. And then she smiled. I can't explain to you guys the smile this woman gave me, how it made me cringe, how it made me sick. 

Fast forward from that moment to a few days ago. Stuff starts happening to me at my house. It began with scratching. One night I heard scratching coming from the walls then it was above me in the ceiling then back to the walls. I didn't think it was too scary until it started to follow me around the house. If I went into the kitchen, the scratching would follow. I couldn't get away from it. But I soon realized there are **much** scarier noises out there.

The moaning is what followed and it's been driving me to the brink of insanity. Every night I hear this awful moaning. Like someone is in this house crying out from a pain I can never imagine. I get up, I search for who ever or what ever it is. If it sounds like it's coming from the living room, I run to the living room but as soon as my feet hit the carpet, the moaning is now in the kitchen. It plays with me. Toys with my mind and makes me run around here on an endless hour consuming search of where it is coming from. If I even want to know where it comes from.

The sound is so sad but it feels unmistakably evil to me. I can't explain it but when I hear it, I know it's a cruel joke. I know people say that they are sensitive to spirits all the time but I have always felt like I have been. I can't sit down and talk to them like all these psychics out there but I will get random thoughts or names or feelings. If a spirit is around, I usually can get a name and maybe a fact or two but *this* has no name, nothing. 

What it does have is a moan that makes me instantly nauseous and it has a *smile*. I haven't seen it in its entirety but I got a glimpse of something that has made sleeping and living here nearly impossible. 

One night when the moaning was louder than usual, I went on the pointless search again trying to find it and figure out a way to stop it. When I walked into the living room, I saw a shadow and it had a smile on it's face that made me throw up right there. It made everything in me want to come up in my throat. After I cleaned up and calmed down, I realized that the smile was familiar to me. Maybe that's why it caused me to get sick, it could have been that my body knew instantly where that smile had been before. Sweet Dessy showed me that smile that day in the restroom in her room. She has never smiled at me like that again, but I can't handle the thought of seeing it again whether it's with or without a face.

The moaning and that smile haunts me. It keeps me running around my house every night because I want it to **STOP**. I haven't had a real nights sleep in days.  I'm exhausted and I'm working a full time job on a quarter tank of energy. Things I usually love to do, I don't have the energy to do. I always liked to post comments on reddit but it's been a couple weeks since I've even done that because the thought of actually reading a post and commenting is too exhausting, it's pitiful. 

I need someone to tell me what I can do. Any ideas will help. ",Maybe I'm losing my mind.,31,nosleep
ggtheblock,4,,7,1r2ucw,,25,"I don't know what I saw, I'm not even really sure I should have seen what I did. 

Two nights ago I was having a wonderful dream. There was nothing odd or creepy to it, just a dream. I woke up in the middle of the night as some people tend to do but then I have wondered since if I ever really did wake up at all. From my bed I watched as 2 figures cloaked in crimsom, one considerably taller than the other, walked into my room. The shorter of the two turned to look at me as he shut off my alarm clock. I woke up the next morning several hours after my alarm was supposed to go off. Did I unplug it in my sleep? Did I even set it in the first place? I didn't want to consider any other options. Last night however tipped the scales in the other direction.

Last night's dream is still fresh on my mind. I was on a mission to stop a bomb going off. I had a key and as I raced through the city streets I checked my watch every block to see how much time I had left. I made it inside the building, rounding the last corner, checking my watch one last time and saw that I had just 2 minutes to spare but when I looked up I was no longer dreaming. I was on my couch, looking eye to eye with the hooded figures as they sat only inches away. They were green, withered. The red of their cloaks matched only by the red of their irisis. No glow to be found, however they had perfect white teeth. The smaller of the two had the larger smile, clearly taking pleasure in what he was about to do.

 ""I'm sorry but we can't let you do that."" 

It was then that I noticed a small familiar watch in his hand and didn't really realize what he did as he removed the final 2 minutes from the timer. I was back in the dream, staring in horror at the monitors of the console I was supposed to have reached in time. Millions dead, cities in ruin, more carnage then I have ever witnessed. I broke, fell to my knees and cried until the building's security came and apprehended me. 

I don't know what happened. I'm not sure if I fell into some sort of inception scenario but I pray I do not have anything important to dream about tonight.",We Can't Let You do That,32,nosleep

I've always felt safe here, never once paranoid, never worried, the crime rate here is pretty low.

In the entire twenty years I've lived here I've only seen news of one single break in.
I'd say that gives me plenty of easy sleeping.


Until recently.


I was getting ready for work, my job is night cook at a local restaurant.
I left the house, noticing the cool air of November,
And as the chill whispered into my lungs, I felt,
As cliché as it sounds, as if I was being watched.

I looked around, nothing was there.
But when I finally shrugged it off, and got Into my car,
I noticed that my mirrors were all fogged up.

Normally, this wouldn't even bother me, as It's so easy to get out of my driveway. 
But tonight, everything seemed wrong.
As I turned the key, and my engine started up,

I heard my radio move to static, from channel to channel, instead of the usual classic rock station.
Living alone, I have no reason to believe anyone would tamper with my car. I don't have neighbors nearby, and My dog would have warned me if someone was messing around.

Again, I checked my clock and shrugged it off.
I'd be late if I didn't hurry.

As I reached the switch off the static, my radio stopped, 99.9FM. 
And I heard a whisper, at first I thought I was going insane or dreaming.
But I turned the volume up, and could barely make out the words,
""kill...me.......Kill....me...""

The words sent a chill colder than the freezing air through my spine, and I immediately turned the radio off, and left,

theunlockeddoor,2,,10,1r1j47,,24,"I work at a public library and I really need to write about this.  Yeah, boring. Librarians=Blah. I know.  This is probably going to be tl:dr and dull.  I know I'm super-new to reddit, but I really need to get this out of my system and I'd feel weird posting about this anywhere else.  So, mock me for my noobness, but I really need to talk.

And aside from 'sexy librarian' sterotypes, you ought to know that the people checking books out from behind the desk have to deal with all sorts of people.  People checking out books about livestock and winking and grinning at you too much, and women, teary-eyed, avoiding your gaze, checking out books about abuse or divorce.  We're sort of like bartenders, but without the convenience of bouncers.  So, when I tell you that meeting this one particular guy kept me up at night, you ought to know that it's not because I have a simple, dusty job. 

This is a story about  person I met through my job.  It's also a story told to me by that person.  

When I came in to work one morning my boss was wandering around the workroom looking disgusted.  She kept going between the bathroom and her desk- trying to work but getting nauseous every so often.  Apparently, when she'd rolled up in the parking lot that morning, she'd found something on the pavement.

A wet set of dentures.

We all laughed at how weird that was, and set the things gingerly on a pad of paper towels in the backroom.  No way were we putting a pair of raw dentures in the lost and found tub.  We forgot about them before lunch.

Later that day, though, this guy came in.  I ended up knowing him as ""Irma's Nephew"".

He limped in and asked if we had any books about dentistry.  I told him I didn't know where to find them off the top of my head and proceeded to do a search on the computer.  As I typed things in and scanned our holdings, he kept staring at me.  His eyes seemed too large and white, popping out against his skin.  He kept chewing his lips and the sides of his cheeks.  It was so fierce, so intense and obsessive, it looked painful.

Then he said: ""Teeth.  C'mon, gimme anything about teeth.  How they grow....""  And trailed off.

I was rattled but I managed to scribble a number down on a scrap of paper and gesture towards the nonfiction section.  He hobbled off.

Twenty minutes or so later, it was the top of the hour, and my turn to do a ""walkabout"".  ""Walkabouts"" are a thing our library system made up to make sure nobody is being harassed or molested out in the stacks.  We're supposed to check all the blind spots in the building every half hour.

So, I was doing my walkabout when I spotted Irma's Nephew sitting on the floor between two rows of books.  He glanced up at me, stood, and as I was moving away, caught me.  His hand on my wrist made me nervous, but I looked back at the circ desk and saw Vikki watching us like a hawk.  Somehow this made me brave.  He told me he needed my help, that these books weren't helping.  So I asked him what else I might look up for him.

""No,"" he said, ""I need to talk to you, to someone, to someone, to anyone.  My aunt, she...""  And he trailed off, eyes bugging.

Sadly, money doesn't reach super-far in the library world, and I hadn't been trained on how to properly treat a mentally ill patron.  As a fail safe, I went with gentleness, since he had a hard grip on my wrist.

So, I asked him to talk to me (looking back over my shoulder at Vikki).

This is the best version I can write of the garbled story he told me.  I could just say: ""And then he told me a spooky story"", but that wouldn't explain why I'm jumpy. I apologize that this is long, but I'm trying to get this out in an accurate way.

""I’ve got an Aunt, named Irma, and she pretty much raised me.  She’s like my mother, but she’s been gettin’ on, gettin' on, you know, and recently she’s been forgetting things.  I need these books for her.  She’s got a problem.  A real….. strange thing goin’ on.
	
“Last summer she got all her teeth pulled.  Got dentures instead.  And she hated them, said they always felt funny in her mouth, and I TOLD HER! we’d go get them refit, recast, but she’d still hate them.  She’d just spit them right out onto the carpet and glare at me with her mouth-skin all sunk-in and puckered up.  I’m the only one of the family that visited her anymore.  So that meant she blamed me.  I was the only one around to be hateful to.  Fuck.

""In June, she started doin’ this thing where she’d say she lost her dentures.  Whenever I went over to see her, she’d ‘lost’ them and I’d scold her because dentures are damn expensive.  Pardon me.  But she’d say it’s no problem and grin big.  I’d look all over- turn the house upside down, and not be able to find them.  She’d say “They’ll turn up in no-time” and wave her hand at me like this.  

""The weird thing is that they would.  I’d come over again and she’d have them back in.  Clack them at me and laugh.  Everytime.  Clack, clack, clack.  And laugh.  Clack, clack.
	
""She, uh, she just kept losing them.  I tried talking to her neighbor down the stairs, Lucy, to try and help her out.  Lucy is a nice woman and said she’d check on her when she got the chance.  And she did good.  When I hadn’t been able to visit in a few days, I’d get a text or call from Lucy lettin’ me know everything’s alright with Miss Irma.  
	“Only I got into a car wreck.  Was laid up in the hospital doped out of my brain on pain killers for who-knows-how-long.  Doctor said I’d broken my thigh-bone.  I didn’t see Miss Irma for a long time.  I think I got a call from Lucy at some point but it’s a foggy.  I remember answering and Lucy just murmuring, murmuring something I couldn’t understand.  It must have been the drugs.  It must have been.

So, eventually, I’m better, and I go over there.  I try knocking on Miss Irma’s door.  She never gave me a key, but she always bustled up and let me in.  I knocked and knocked and she didn’t come, so I got nervous, you know?  I went over to Lucy’s then, to see if she had a back-up key, or could call the building manager.  But I when I knock on her door it just kinda…whoosh…opens.
	
I call her name, but nothin’.  So of course I go in, cuz maybe they both in trouble.  But Lucy is nowhere.  Her apartment is just… empty.  Except, just as I’m leaving, I see something pink on the floor.
	
{Here, the guy paused, licking his lips again.  It seemed to me he was winding up his courage, or working past something particularly horrible.}

""It was teeth, ma’am.  Dentures.  A top and a bottom, both.  The top was kinda falling off the bottom, was at an angle.  Like they’d just been dropped and left.  
	
“I knew Lucy didn’t wear dentures, so this scared me a lot, because Miss Irma might be wandering around lost with her dementia.  She’d started forgetting my name.  She could be anywhere, doing anything if she was spitting her teeth out again.
	
“So I run.  Run and find the janitor that sometimes cleaned up the stairwells and he looks at me like I’m crazy.  He says “I thought your gramma moved out last month.” I say “No, sir, you are mistaken.  She can’t have gone nowhere.”  And he says “Well, I ain’t seen you nor her in that time.”  And I argue with him but eventually he comes with me and unlocks the door.   
	
“Inside Miss Irma’s the tv was on, but, she wasn’t in her chair where she’d sit for hours and watch tv.  I mean, she’d sat there so much it had left an impression, her shape.  But that wasn’t all she left.  She also left her teeth. {He was giggling a bit hysterically at this point}
	
“No, not the ones in Lucy’s place.  These were different.  These were more.  These were MORE.  All over.  Pairs and pairs of false teeth were lying all over Miss Irma’s apartment.  They were on bookshelves and on the kitchen table.  The biggest pile was around her chair.  I was confused at first.  There was no way she could have collected all these teeth by herself.  I certainly only bought her the two pairs.  She didn’t have no friends to bring her sets of teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth.
  
""And they were different, too.  As in, some were little.  Like, tiny white baby teeth, just little gappy chips.  And others were big and wide and long.  And some of the sets, I don’t know how they could fit in a person’s mouth.  they were full of fangs and tusks and.

“And it makes no sense.  I can only come up with one idea.  She was on her own for a month, except for Lucy.  I know Lucy didn’t bring her all those teeth.  The only thing I can think is that she was growing them back herself.  That, every time she had ‘lost’ and found her dentures before, she’d just thrown them away and grown a new pair in her mouth.  Then that set would fall out and she’d grow more.  And then they must have started growing strange in her mouth.  And she's gone off somewhere wandering wandering, I can't find her. I don't..  I need help for her.""

I peeled his hand off and somehow got out of there.  I went back and handed him some paper I think had a number for psychiatric help on it.  Really, I went back to the staff bathroom and sat against the wall for a while, breathing and feeling really strange in my stomach.

When I left work, I had to pass the set of dentures my boss found in the parking lot that morning.  I found myself staring at them.

Chenigin,8,,11,1r6b7r,,22,"When I was ten my parents divorced. Soon after I moved into an old house in Orange County CA with my mother and stepfather. This house had a nice floor plan but needed major work. With all the remodeling being done to the house it was not uncommon for my step father to walk around at night to check up on and see how the house was holding up. One night I was laying in bed when I heard heavy footsteps outside my bedroom window. My room was located at the side of the house. Me being young and naïve I automatically thought it was my step dad. I heard the footsteps walk into the garage and enter the house via the garage door. I knew this was the time to go to the restroom because well.. their was an adult and he could protect me from my fears of the dark. When I heard the footsteps walk past my door I slowly opened my door and called out my step fathers name. At the same time I stuck my head out my door and saw the back of a boot I never saw before turn the hallway corner. This made me reconsider how safe it was to go take a leak. I heard a sound in the kitchen.. the distinct sound of the drawers opening and a hand shuffling through its contents. After what seemed like an eternity I decided to call out to my stepfather again, this time slowly creeping out of my room so I can get to the corner of the hallway. As soon as I started to edge forward I heard the heavy footsteps make a b line straight for the front door.. I started to pick up my pace so I could get a good view of who it could be. When I got to where I could get a good view of the door I saw something I would never forget. The door slammed shut and the lock turn to the lock position. As if someone had the key and was locking it from the outside. By then my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I ran to the door to see if I could see who was in our house. When I opened the door I saw nothing... No sight of someone running away.. no evidence of anyone ever being there in the first place.. Just 10 year old me.. standing in the dark.. Suddenly the fight or flight instinct kicked in again.. but instead its the opposite instinct.. fuck! I'm ten.. I am by myself in the dark.. someone just broke into the house! I slammed the door shut and ran into my mothers room. My stepfather right away called the cops and propped a chair to the front door and the garage door so even if someone had the key they could not open it. The cops showed up and didn't find a single thing. No footprints nothing.. My mother turned on me and said it was just my childish imagination making up things.. I started to doubt myself after the years... Chucking it as what my mom said.. my youthful imagination.. I am 24 now.. I don't sleep walk nor have I ever. If it was a dream... I never had one like that ever since. If anyone has any ideas on what I might of experienced please.. I am all ears. I always wondered what other people would have to say about this. Glad to have found Reddit that's for sure. ",Still think about this all the time,33,nosleep
BensonHedges1,2,,13,1r60t4,,25,"I'm writing this from my phone, I needed to get out of the house. I'm sitting at Panera Bread and my boyfriend thinks I'm nuts. In the time I posted my last update to now, Things got worse.

 It was so bizarre - my boyfriend got home around 5pm yesterday and went to take a nap. He worked a detail after his shift, so I was home alone for the most part. I did my best to stay away from the room. My cat just growled.  
There was a good hour of him sitting at the doorway...growling. For anyone that knows him, he's has the most amazing temperment...he never hisses or growls. The entire time my boyfriend was in the room napping, NOTHING. He thinks I'm crazy because I begged him not to sleep in that room...he went to work at 10pm last night, and I slept on the couch. Remember that wind? I have no fucking clue what it was, but I was on a conference call and heard a small rumble from the room. I ignored. Apparently whatever is happening - ignoring makes it worse. A couple minutes later, another rumble, and a smell. I lied when I said the worst smell ever was burnt coffee. This smell was like death. Not the death that a cat drags in by the tail. And then another rumble. As soon as my call was over, I rushed into the room, febreeze in hand. I can't explain it exactly, but as I opened the door to the bedroom, all of that windows made a loud thud like they were closing, but they were open. I sure as hell didn't open them. Is it even possible for them to thud OPEN? What the hell. Against my better judgment I went into the room. It's day time, what can happen, right? There was a stain on the floor - just a big dark stain... I don't want to say blood because it's not mine and fuck this supernatural shit. It got bigger though, like water expanding. I could see it growing, but I couldn't tell if my mind was playing tricks on me. 
I ran.
Fucking ran.

What the hell is my cat seeing? I wonder if this is just my mind playing tricks on me. 

I've had some trouble posting this today - but I haven't been home, and I'm returning tonight. My intention is to sleep in that room. I want to know what's going on, and why it's getting so cold. I'm getting the chills thinking about the chills.

BiohazardTyrant,3,,9,1r4rao,,21,"So to begin, I was eleven years old I believe...

My father had brought me to a friend of his' house. Or rather farm.

I was excited because I had befriended the son of my fathers friend, for stories sake I will call him James. James had a older brother who was a year and a half older, so I was eleven, James was twelve and his brother thirteen. We had all played around the barn and fields plenty of times before. This time though it was a celebration of some sort, I wish I could remember why but anyway, they had been in this house on this farm for about half a year. Tonight was the big party, as in the most vivid thing I remember about that night. The cut off pigs head. Literally just cut right off, and sitting on a support beam about shoulder high to the adults. The body was dangling from a chain for a while, until they skewered it onto a metal pole and roasted it whole over a fire.

I really wish I could remember why they were doing that but sadly I cannot. In any case, me James and his brother were just running around like we always did like idiots. They had all of the farm as a playground and plenty of space to play. We began by walking over to the stalls where they kept the horses and cattle. The sheds were HUGE, and seemed to be endless to a younger kid as myself. 

After about a half an hour of walking through corridors left and right in the dark we started hearing noises, but not normal ones... Like chains being hit on metal and slammed into the ground, then grunts. We all took off running following James' brother who quickly let out out to the closest exit. None of us knew what the sounds were because of the fact the farm had been out of commission for about thirty years. Nothing alive should have been in there. 

We quickly made out way back to the farm house, the big one where all the adults were partying and tried to talk to them about it but of course they had all had a drink or three and ignored us laughing it off as childish imagination. 

For some reason. Some stupid god forsaken reason, James said we should go back out and just play in the field where there was a little light away from the adults and we listened. Once the three of us were out there it turned into a ""I dare you to go out in the field"" game.

We each took turns going farther and farther out into the night. Finally we all ended up ignoring the occurrences from earlier and started playing hide and seek. Bad idea. Very bad.

James and I were hiding in the tall grass near the side end of the barn and his brother came running out faster than I have ever seen anyone run, screaming bloody murder, to get away as fast as we could, get to the adults! James and I ran to him, and stopped dead in our tracks, quickly seeing why he had been fleeing. 

There we were, James, his brother and I all standing still, like sacks of meat staring to the treeline where we saw it. There were three if I remember correctly faces. All white and elongated, just weirdly shaped about six feet off the ground, and then came the true horror, the glint off the blades they were holding. 

We all ran.

Faster and faster we ran.

I turned around two times and I regret it to this day for the fact they were even closer than I thought blades outstretched trying to mince us up and drag us back into those hellish woods. 

We finally made it to the adults. The only thing I remember after that was that damn pig head, cut off, and just sitting there, I could see the spine, and every last vein... we tried telling the adults but they just laughed. None of us left the main barn after that for the rest of night.




About a week later my friend Chris came over, and had the worst part to share with me. He had been having these night terrors of these creatures tearing at him and chasing him through his own new home.

Then he told me his family had left the farm, and moved to the city.

Then he told me why. He was attacked.

Then he showed me, and lifted his shirt up, showing me a scar which I know he did not have before because we used to swim together all the time. He never had a mark there a week before. But now, across his stomach he had a fully healed scar of about ten inches going from left to right, like he had been gutted. But the scariest fact like I said was that it had not been there one night, then he woke up with that kind of scar. 

His family moved because of that, that day. And never returned to that farm.

I have long since lost touch with him, he became very paranoid after that and I just cant forget that.

Figured I would share it with the community, I do hope if any of you take anything away from this, if you see a creature, with a white face, long arms, and a huge blade by a treeline. Run, just run. And try to forget about it.","A tale of a Farm, and three young kids.",30,nosleep
JordanThirstExile,11,,33,1r857m,,21,"It started with the roses. Ever since I was a little girl I loved them. I loved the scent of them, and the colors they came in. I loved them so much that my mother had planted a few rose bushes outside our house so when it bloomed I could sit and stare at those beautiful roses. They bloomed in shades of white, and pink, but my favorite rose was red like satin. It reminded me of my mother and the way she always drew roses on her letters. 


Fast forward to the time I was 14 years old. I was never a popular girl, by far, but I wasn’t unknown either. I didn’t have long blonde hair or blue eyes, but I had talent, a slim body, and an obsession for roses. All my friends knew how much I loved them. They’d buy me perfume in a rose-shaped bottle, or a dress with red roses on them for my birthday.  I made the best out of what I could in high school being a short, brown haired, green-eyed girl. 


It was the day before homecoming when the boy I’d secretly been in love with asked me to the dance with a white rose. I swooned and he took me to the dance the next night. (I, of course, in a rose dress and him in matching colors.) He had brought me a white rose corsage to match my dress. We danced all night, and we continued to date until high school ended. After our senior year we went our separate ways and stopped talking. But this didn’t bother me, I hadn’t time to waste when I was busy with my roses.


In college I had been taking Art classes in my third semester when I got a call one evening informing me that my mother had pasted away in the hospital. 
The following Tuesday we attended her funeral. My father had picked out the colors. We buried my loving mother in pink roses, because she was a former cancer survivor, and we were blessed to have her as long as we did.
For the months following my mother’s death I became deeply depressed. The only thing that eased the pain from losing my mother, were the roses. When they bloomed in the spring my sprits suddenly lifted. The roses were my life, and I don’t know what I’d do without them. 


2 years go by and I ended up meeting a nice guy who joined my ecology class. His name was Dylan and we immediately hit it off. He gave me everything a girl could’ve ever wanted and treated me like a princess. I loved him more than anything in the world. We talked about moving in together and buying a house after college. We talked about getting married and having a daughter named Rose for my love of roses. His handsome blonde hair and chiseled feature would make a beautiful baby.


We went through college and eventually graduated together and got married. We lived in a small townhouse in Vermont for a long time after that. After trying many times to have the baby I so desperately wanted, the doctor came to tell that I was infertile. Dylan tried to tell me we could always adopt, always have a child if I wanted, but I didn’t. It wasn’t fair! If I couldn’t have a child that was my own flesh blood, how would she share the love of roses like my mother did with me? 


Again for a long time I became mute. I could not eat or sleep. Dylan became very distant and we hardly spoke. Everything we had was gone. Nothing made me happy anymore. Nothing would until I had a baby rose. I would look out at our garden and wait for them to bloom, but even then the roses did not make me happy. 


It was the next winter before I found out. I knew something had gone wrong because all of the roses had turned over black instead of falling off and dying. Dylan had come home late that night and seemed very stressed. I decided that night while he slept I’d go through his phone. 


He had 3 missed calls and a text from a girl named “Lisa”. The text read:
“You HAVE to stay home tonight! She won’t stop crying unless you’re here! –Lisa”
Who wouldn’t stop crying? Did someone care that much about my dear Dylan to cry when he’s not there? I remember him saying he worked at the office with a girl named Lisa, so I decided to send her a text replying, “Get her to stop crying, I can’t be that important.” 


After that I waited for a reply for several minutes before I got a reply back.
“Of course you’re important to her love! You’re her daddy! And she needs you here! Just take off work this one night!”


WORK? SHE though HE was at WORK? He was supposed to be at work all day! And WHO’S daddy was she talking about? 


I carefully went through his address book in his phone and found her home address. I silently walked downstairs, and out the door, grabbing a hoe from the garden before leaving in the car.


I knew the black roses meant something was wrong. 


I returned a few hours later with his “baby” in our car. I left her there while I waited behind the house. About an hour later I see Dylan walk out the front door to leave, when he suddenly stops when he sees the child in the car with the windows up. 
He screams “ALLISON!” 


Is THAT the things name? So it IS his! At this point I was furious! 


As he went to unlock the door to retrieve the child, I pulled him backwards so he fell into the garden. I picked up the hoe and shouted “ALL I WANTED WERE THE RED ROSES!”


The hoe dug into his head once, and I felt all the love I’d ever had for him release, into the small, tiny bits of pieces that were once my loving husband. When I was all through I tossed his body into the cellar along with his companion’s. At least now the black roses are blood red once again.


 A beautiful thing, the roses are. 


Little rose lives with me now and she has just enrolled in preschool. She loves the roses as much as I do, but her favorite ones are the dead petals. 


“So pretty!” she said, “Even after they’re dead!” 


I always agree with her on that. Sometimes she asks where daddy is and I must tell her, “Simple, Prim Rose, ask the petals!”

I froze as soon as I looked towards the front of the house. I saw something short, maybe 2-3 feet walking on two legs. It was walking in the direction of my porch or front of the house. I thought it was kinda strange since I live out in the suburbs and something like this would easily be noticed by any of my neighbors. The funny part is we both made eye contact, it noticed that I was looking straight at it. As soon as it did it ran away, and I ran after it. When I turned the corner there was nothing. I ran around the whole house just in case it was running circles around my house. Nada. So yeah I saw that once. No biggie since I havent seen it again or it hasnt messed with my garden.

cmd102,4,,4,1r2xzg,,20," unexplainable experiences are not completely abnormal for me. Every house or apartment that I've lived in, I've seen or heard something that would make a lot of people hide under a blanket or leave the house all together. The man at my window was one story of mine that never fails to make whoever I tell shudder, so I figured I'd share it here.

It began when I was 7 or 8 years old. We lived in an older house, but not one that would instantly stand out as ""creepy"" or ""unusual"". We didn't live in the middle of nowhere, but rather on a street lined with houses on both sides of the road. It was a fairly quiet neighborhood, the kind where the rare car that came down the street would often break up a game of football or hockey that was being played by the kids that inhabited almost every house. It wasn't perfect, but it was great. I was a very happy child. 

One night, I was plagued by a very odd, yet equally terrifying nightmare. I dreamt that I was in my bed, in the room that I shared with my older sister. I sat up and looked out of the window that was next to my bed, which sat in the one corner of my bedroom flush against the wall. The window overlooked the back yard, and in that yard stood a man. He wore a long black coat, a wide-brimmed black hat that hid his face from me, and a black suit. On his shoulder, there sat a very large black bird with red eyes. I stared at him for what seemed like forever, before he looked up at my window. The only features of his face that I could see were his eyes, which were a deep red, just like the bird's. Just as he made eye contact with me, the bird left his shoulder and flew straight at my window. When the bird got to the point where it would have inevitably smashed through the window and probably eaten me, I woke up. I was on my side, facing my sister's bed that was situated in the exact same position as mine, but on the opposite side of the room. I stared at her as she slept soundly, terrified and unable to go back to sleep. I decided that the only way I would get any rest was by looking out my window and proving to myself that the man wasn't really there, so I rolled over and sat up. My curtains were already pulled to the sides of the window, since my bedroom was on the second floor of a house in a decent neighborhood,  we didn't really worry about anyone trying to peep on my sister and me. The second I looked at the window, he was there. Even though he was impossibly directly outside my window,  close enough that he should have left fog with his breath, I still couldn't see any features of the man's face except his blood red eyes. I did what many children would do, I laid back down and threw my blankets over my head. I eventually fell back asleep, despite being scared out of my mind.

The man visited me several times a month for several years after that, always just staring at me through my window during the darkest parts of the night. When my sister moved out, I started sleeping in her bed,  across the room and away from the window. I didn't see the man anymore. 

One day, I was cleaning my room in preparation for my friend to sleep over that night. I knelt on my old bed, still there for when we had guests,  to clean the window. I pulled the curtain aside (as a teenager now, I valued my privacy), and saw a handprint on the glass. It was bigger than my own, but I didn't think anything of it. I had assumed one of my friends had left it there. I sprayed the cleaner and wiped it away with the paper towel, but the handprint remained. A little grossed out, I went over it again, a little harder to scrub the print away. It was still there. That was when I realized that, despite not seeing him anymore, I still received visits from the man with the red eyes. The hand print was on the outside of the window.",the man at my window,24,nosleep

I just kept clicking through - that was my greatest vice. I could have let it rest. But with every story, my blood pumped faster, my breath came quicker.

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

The anticipation is mounting, building to orgasmic frenzy. I found it, the ultimate high. Or rather, it found me. All I had to do was believe. All I have to do is turn around.

This night, I had a friend over. It's not related to the woman or this story at all - it was planned much earlier. I needed some help with my new place so she'd help me and sleep over because we had no idea how much time it would really take.

She had to leave really early, before 7 AM, so I thought I can just sleep until 7 and then go.

But as soon as she went out, I felt something weird. As if there's someone still with me. Someone watching me. I just knew someone is there.

Kind of like when I lived with my parents and I just KNOW they're here even though the door of my room is closed. And I know so I have to get up and check.
That's how it was. 

So I got up to check. Nothing, I couldn't see anything but I could still feel it. I figured the feeling would go away when I look around the apartment and see that there's nothing there. It didn't. It just felt like I was chasing after something and it kept getting away. Like when you try to hold onto something really slippery. 

I felt helpless and very hopeless in that moment. It was much deeper than just not being able to find something I felt was there - it was just an in-general feeling of misery and despair, not related to something specific. 

So I figured maybe I was just getting sick, maybe I was too tried, too stressed, maybe it's really nothing, and I went back to bed. I fell asleep really quickly. 

Then the doorbell rang, I woke up. It felt like I slept for hours and hours, but in reality it was only like 6 or 7 minutes. I went to open the door, guess who it was? The woman.

Yeah, I was terrified and for a moment I thought - I'm done. It's over. Byebye cruel world.

It  wasn't  regular fear, like you'd be afraid when you know there's a reason to, like a gun pointed or an angry dog. It was more like fear of the dark, you don't really know what exactly you fear but it's still scary.

And just to make it clear, once again - she doesn't LOOK scary. She looks normal.
She speaks in a normal tone, with a normal voice. But there's just something about her that makes me want to get away, but in the same way intrigues me - I feel that I HAVE to know.

So I was really holding back the ""what the fuck are you doing here you mad bitch"" rant that was forming in my mind, I just greeted her instead because seriously, what good could come out of getting pissy? Not like that would help now.

She says hi. I'm like uh,umm, yeah, hi. And then she tells me she just wanted to visit me to see how am I doing, how's life, etc, etc. So I'm like wtf, you saw me yesterday and the day before, and the day before. She ignores me. She asks to come in but I tell her I was just planning to get out, I have things to do so  I wouldn't be a good host right now. She says she doesn't mind it all. I say I feel embarrassed about having such a messy home. Maybe when I fix it. I know  she knows I'm lying. But I just HAVE to say that. I can't tell her the truth. She just walks in and I immediately escort her out.

And the truth is, I just DON'T want her in. I can't let  her. I know she can't do anything more than she could do in the hallway, or from the door, or in the park, or in an alley, or anywhere else really, but I just didn't feel like letting her in (and still don't). I know it was rude as fuck but so is trying to force someone to let you in their house at 7 in the morning.

She keeps trying to get me to make her coffee or breakfast or something. And the pushier she gets, I get less afraid, more angry. She then asks me about my old town, my friends, family, my new friends, my new place, what am I planning to do here. I don't tell her shit, I just ramble about unspecific things, getting more and more angry. 

She makes me feel dizzy. Not in a Oh-so-nice-and-cute way. In a very bad way. In a I-could-pass-out-or-even-die way.

Somehow I get through the conversation, and then she just suddenly stops talking and stares at me. ""You're really not going to let me in?"" I explain to her, again, that I'm going out now and the place is a mess.
So she glares at me and nods. ""Alrightttt"".

I really thought she was going to attack me - I was really waiting for her to try to hit me or stab me or whatever.

But she turns around, then she turns back to me and says ""See you soon. Maybe I'll come again tomorrow."" I tell her it'd be better if she just lets me invite her when I'm ready for visitors, when I can actually provide a good stay for a guest.
""But *friend's name* stayed the night?""
I get terrified again - bitch how the fuck do you know, but I just say that friend is helping me with the apartment.

She nods again. And then she says bye, see you. And walks away. Turns around once again, stares at me, and says ""I still can't figure it out. That's why I just have to come back, like you had to interrogate me at the park."" And then walks down the stairs. I try to stop her, but she ignores me. Won't talk anymore.

Now the thing is, nothing about her, except the knowing my great-grandmother part, seems supernatural, otherwordly. She seems like a silly, but creepy lost cause. And if it wasn't for my grandmother's warnings and the woman claiming to know Magdalena, I'd even consider her a cute wackadoodle. But I still have NOTHING to explain WHY my grandmother appears to fear this woman and NOTHING to explain HOW could she, a woman that looks not a day older than 30, have known my great-grandmother that died over 30 years ago.",Who is this woman ?

-----

For several years now I've had this story inside me like lead shot in my gut. I've considered telling it hundreds of times over, but the sheer magnitude of it has always stopped me. With six months of therapy under my belt, I figure it's time. I know now that I won't be free of this thing until I write it out. Settle in, because I can't tell this story in ten thousand characters or less. I'll be lucky to get through it in twice or three times that. It's hard enough to sum up everyday life, and this story is anything but.

I had a recurring dream when I was really little. I would wake up in the dream, and standing beside my bed was the most beautiful lady I had ever seen. Long, straight hair and long, flowing gown, both of the purest silver like captured moonlight. She would smile at me so sincerely, so lovingly, as she sat down beside me and began to speak.

The words were comforting like a lullaby, but I couldn't understand them. Though she spoke quietly, her voice seemed to echo through the room, through the universe, backwards and forwards in time, begging to be understood by my adolescent brain.

I always tried to stay in the dream as long as I could, but eventually I would drift back off to sleep in the dream and wake up to my mom gently rousing me for breakfast.

My mom died when I was seven, and the dreams stopped. Well, I prefer to say she died. She was murdered. I hate that word. It's so cold; it falls off the tongue like shards of glass.

My mom was a health nut; protein shakes, weight lifting, yoga, the whole lot. Above all, she loved to jog. We had several acres of untamed land around the house. She always woke me up about an hour before dad went to work so she could go take a forty-minute run through the forest and along the creek; it befell dad to make me breakfast and get me ready for school.

They found her by the lake south of the house. And hanging from the old weeping willow in the middle of the pasture. And scattered across the countryside in a ten-mile radius around the house - but that was mostly after the funeral. All told, the casket had about two-thirds of a person inside when we finally buried her. They never found her head.

We used to be a close family - me, my sister, my mom and dad ... Losing mom, and losing her the way we did, splintered us. Dad lost himself in his advertising job. My sister turned inward, and fell into drugs and alcohol, when the kids our age figured out how to get ahold of it. Besides his job, dad's other mission was to keep his girls safe from all harm, and he took that one even more seriously. Leanna got it a little easier since she was four years older. I was taken out of school. Dad hired a tutor to homeschool me. I wasn't allowed out after dark. I wasn't allowed out without supervision. Unless I was being taken to town for some reason, I wasn't allowed to range out of eyesight or earshot of the house.

I started writing obsessively. Mom taught me how to keep a journal as soon as I could hold a crayon. I still have my very first one; the pages are filled with scribbles in different colors, and some pages are nearly colored solid. I guess I thought that good writing should fill as much of the page as possible. I remember how unabashedly delighted mom was to see every single entry. I guess writing is my way of honoring her memory.

I took mom's death hard, but it was a long while before I really understood what it meant that mom was killed. Dad told me that a very bad man had taken my mom from us, that she was dead, that she'd never come back. All things considered, he handled that conversation pretty well. Nothing could have softened the blow, though. My mommy was gone. I loved her and wanted her, but I'd never see her again. She was dead, and death meant people were gone forever. We weren't a religious household, so at that young age I was coming to grips with the fact that mom didn't exist anymore. There was a hole in my world. It was like that feeling when you go to grab something like a can of Coke without looking at it, and you end up swiping at the air because that can wasn't where you expected it to be.

I healed in time. For several years I was just chugging along, going through the motions, numb to the outside world. Closing myself off was easy; the outside world mainly consisted of our house and the clearing around it. My dad was mostly an authoritarian figure when he was home, always vigilant but never available. My sister babysat me when dad was gone, though she usually left me entirely to my own devices. She was homeschooled too, but she could drive; sometimes she would simply leave me at the house and go off to do Big People stuff. 

That Big People stuff, as I've written, consisted mainly of shooting up with her friends, or scoring more dope.

She had been chasing her high for ten years straight when I turned eighteen. Leanna had been living with her junkie boyfriend for a couple years. She was never able to hold down a job for very long, so she would spread her legs for a dealer until he let her move in. That was how she kept up her habit. When that didn't work out, she'd beg dad for more money and find another dealer to fuck.

It was a miserable, shady life for her, and she would have kept going until it killed her. And it did.

-------

My dad got the call at four in the morning on a Tuesday. I remember waking up, bleary-eyed, to see him looking like death warmed over. I had only seen that tortured look on his face once before, and I shot straight up, wide awake, when I saw it that night.

""Leanna,"" I said.

He nodded. My heart sank into my stomach and stopped beating. She was living in the city, a forty-minute drive away. A long, miserable forty-minute drive away. Neither dad nor I spoke a word. He sat stoically, knuckles white on the wheel, crying silently. I might as well have been dead myself. I stared at my lap, taking in nothing, thinking nothing, feeling nothing. Where my heart had been was a gaping hole.

Dad led me by the hand into the funeral home, and sat me down in a chair where I waited motionlessly as he went to identify the body. I heard his wracking sobs as he came back to get me some time later. I reflexively turned towards the sound. The funeral director and another man were practically holding him upright as he stumbled across the lobby. They took me up and walked us to a private area with a couple of couches, where we both collapsed.

I sat on the couch, mindlessly pulling at my hair, gazing at my father as he poured out his grief. He had always been a reserved man, but the dam had finally broken. We had no family but ourselves. Mom had grown up in a foster home, and had no love for the people she called her ""fake parents."" My biological grandma had a stroke and passed in her sleep. My grandpa followed not long after, as old widowers are wont to do. I never knew either of them. If we had any extended family, we never knew them.

I half-noticed the little hank of hair tangled around my hand. I hadn't felt it when I ripped it out.

Dad cried for a long time, eventually slumping sideways into his couch. When his voice was gone and his sobs came without tears, he stood up. He seemed to be carrying the weight of a thousand suns on his shoulders. At his slight nod in my direction, I stood up myself, and we walked together to the car. He pulled out a rumpled piece of paper and his phone, and dialed a number. We were at a motel fifteen minutes later. We went to sleep in our clothes.

The next few days were a blur. There were arrangements to be made, and that was dad's job. I went to town and bought us clothes and toiletries to keep us going while we stayed at the motel.

The funeral was a small affair back home. We laid her to rest in the plot next to mom's. Dad and I were the only mourners. A minister said some words, we each tossed a handful of dirt on the grave, and it was over. It was over.

-----

We stepped through the doorway and into our home. Quiet pervaded the empty space, the sort of quiet only found indoors. Clocks ticking, a gentle hum from our air conditioner, our breathing and the stecatto hitches as one or the other of us suppressed a sob.

We stood alone in an empty house, our bodies kept upright through some force of habit or instinct in the absence of warm blood flowing through our veins. My sister had imparted some vitality into this place, unbeknownst to us, even after our mother's murder. As our Leanna died, so died the house. I might have turned to see the land itself had withered, without so much as a shrug.

Dad pulled the door shut, and the click of its latch, impossibly loud against the quiet, signaled the start of our new life, or merely the end of the old.

I glanced at the clock: almost noon. The gears in my brain began turning, cast about for something to fill the time until bed, and found nothing. It then latched on to the only activity left, and my feet carried me to the stairs with sliding steps. They balked briefly, as if puzzled by a reason to lift off the ground more than half an inch, and then continued. A minute later, I fell backwards, collapsing onto my purple comforter. My toes brushed the carpet from time to time, but that didn't matter. Nothing did. Apathy sang me a lullaby, and the world faded away.

My staggered footsteps echoed through the tunnel, meshing with the steadfast crashing of many feet behind me. Searing hot agony blazed through my side. I had to keep running, I had to reach the end before -

I snapped upright, eyes unfocused, drenched in sweat. I bent forward reflexively and threw up bile into my lap. I sobbed, and choked on my own vomit. I coughed until my throat was raw, until the vessels in my eyes popped, and then collapsed sideways.

Good morning, world.

quietgrl,12,,8,1rchof,,19,"I had moved to Minnesota months ago, in order to get away from some strange phenomenon happening to me in Philadelphia since May 2013. I don't know what to call these things... ghosts, phantoms, spirits? However, my friends and family aren't judging my experiences as real accounts of the paranormal, they believe that I'm slowly losing my mind. And sometime... I wonder if that's the case too, if I'm simply falling into to some form of schizophrenia. 

I decided to share my stories here, so maybe I wouldn't have to feel much like a freak or that I'm going crazy. Or maybe I just don't want to feel alone with this. 

Well, I had a week to relax again, without anything strange happening to me. However, I had that feeling again that things weren't over and was just getting started. I am anxious all the time, ready for the next creepy thing to happen to me, and I'm not even sure if I can call my life “living” anymore. I rarely sleep, I barely function at work, and I'm losing a lot of weight from the lack of eating. 

My only distraction these days seem to be stupid videos on the web and chatting with the cute neighbor named Charlie. I don't share with him about my “experiences”, because I don't want him to look at me with those same pitying eyes that my friends and family give me.

Although last week, I did dare to ask Charlie if he had noticed anything strange in the neighborhood. He gave me a funny and confused look and I had to try my best to explain what I was asking, without really explaining the truth of my situation. “Oh,” I said, waving my hands as if the movements would untangle my nervous words, “You know... I mean, do you notice anything weird or any weird stories from others in the neighborhood?” I was trying to figure out if I was the only person who had a ghost following them.

“No.” Charlie said, shaking his head slowly in thought. And then his baby blue eyes lit up, “Well, yeah! If you mean if there are any weirdos here, yes we have a few, like anywhere else. I am a bit weird, for example.” “Nah.” I blushed towards him, “You're not weird at all. You seem very normal to me.” And very cute, I wanted to add, but I kept that thought to myself. 

Well, after a while of nothing happening to me, I didn't exactly catch onto the next bizarre incident right away. 

It must have been nearly 3am in the morning, when I heard a man singing loudly outside, “If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe... I'd been married a long time ago! Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?” At first, I was a lot annoyed for having my sleep disturbed by the most unlikely song, but then it was kind of funny that someone really seemed to like this song and thought it was a good idea to bellow it early in the a.m. 

Then another thought came to me, that it may be the voice of Charlie, proving me wrong about my earlier opinion that he wasn't weird. It sounded a little like his voice and I couldn't help but wonder if he was drunk off his ass and having a bit of fun tonight. I rushed from my bed and peered out the window, my eyes slowly adjusting to the darkness outside. The only thing I could see was a shadowed figured of a man, non descriptive, as he shambled towards the direction of the pathway between my house and Charlie's.

I giggled to myself, before heading back to sleep, knowing that I would tease the guy tomorrow about his choice of song. I slept peacefully, as the night faded back into silence. 

The next day, I did run into Charlie, a silly grin on my face. I told him how I spotted him in a chorus of Cotton Eyed Joe, stumbling towards his house, at 3am in the morning. He gave me the most confused lemon face that I ever saw on a man and replied, “Well, I don't know who you saw, but it wasn't me. For one thing, I was asleep at that time, dead to the world. And second of all, I hate that song! I don't even know all the words to it, let along could sing the chorus.”

“Hmm.” I said, a bit confused now, because I swore it was his voice that I had heard. “Hey,” he smirked, “I did tell you that we have some weirdos among us, right? It was probably Mr. Roy, who lives about two houses down from us. All he ever does is drink and he only seems to leave his house during the night to avoid conversation and eye contact with any of the neighbors. I wouldn't be surprised if he had a few too many last night.”

I agreed with that explanation for the time being, but I wondered if Charlie was somehow covering up an embarrassing moment that I had caught him in. 

The next night, the singing happened again, this time at 2am with a loud chorus of, “Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?” I rushed to the window and again I could only see a shadowed figure, shambling towards the pathway and disappearing around the corner leading to the front of the houses.

I felt uneasy about the movement of the shadow, as it didn't seem exactly like a human's walk at all, and very unlikely for even a drunken one. It was a combination of stops and jerks forward, like someone moving a puppet on a string. And sometimes the shadow seemed to jerk too far ahead, causing the figure to appear a couple of feet in the matter of a blink. I wasn't sure if I was just overly tired and seeing things or maybe not. I decided to go back to sleep and forget about it.

The next night, I was awaken by the man singing the song loudly again, this time at 1am. I had left my floodlight on before bed, a light that illuminates my driveway. I eagerly peered out of the window, hoping to see the guy's face this time, whether it would be Charlie's or the weird neighbor's. This time, the figured shambled directly in the path of the bright light and still his face was nothing but a shadow. There was no hint to any of its features, just a shadowed figured that belted out, “Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?”

I was frighten, shutting my curtains, and hiding under my blankets. I slept with my bedroom lamp on for the rest of the night, just like a little kid. Later in the day, I asked Charlie if he heard the singing man last night or any time this week. He did not. And again, I felt as If I may be hallucinating these things.

Last night, I heard the man singing again, this time at 12 midnight. And I refused to leave my bed and look out there, not wanting to see that shadowed figure shambling by, moving many steps ahead in the matter of seconds. I figured, it was all in my mind, that it would go away if I just ignore it. That's when I heard the creak of one of my floorboards at the end of my bed.

I sat bolt upright and could see the shadow standing at the foot of my bed. Its darkness seemed to stand out much bolder than the darkness of the room, a silent silhouette of a man, who just stood there and said nothing for a while. I was too afraid to move or to call out to my sister who was asleep in the nezt room. I just stared at the figure, barely breathing, waiting for it to move or flinch.

In a voice that was deep and demonic, it sang out, “Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?”

At that moment, I lost my shit and began to scream, as I flipped out of my bed and hit the floor with a huge thump. I began to crawl my way towards the door of my room, but that thing... it grabbed my ankle and began pulling me back towards it! I kicked, flailed around on the floor, and cried out, “No, no, no, no! Let me go!”

My sister burst into the room,flipping on the lights, her eyes wild and her voice wavering, “What's happening?!” The shadow man was gone and I broke out into tears, still very afraid but so relieved that it wasn't there anymore. After some moments of hysterical sobbing, I was able to tell my sister what had happened. I thin this time, she believed me.

I don't know if the whole thing was just a horrible nightmare or if I'm somehow hallucinating. However... that grab from the shadow man felt a lot real. I can still feel the memory of that grip on my ankle, a rough and cold hand, that eagerly wanted to pull me in towards it. I can't sleep with the light off now...",Cotton Eyed Shadow,27,nosleep

How it starts is that I am laying in my bed and I am slightly awake but I cannot move or speak. I can how ever see what is going on so there is that. While in my bed it feels like I have a huge weight on me and I cannot move. I do however, try to edge myself over to side of the bed in hopes of waking up because I don't want to feel that way anymore. 
There has been one time where I woke up several times on to be slammed back down onto my bed. That time managed to freak me out so much that I ran out of my apartment and did not return until later that day. Another time I felt as though I was dragged off my bed and dragged down a hallway that seemed like it was at an elementary school only to never reach the end. 
I thought it was a ghost, for lack of a better terms, for awhile but I could not gather enough evidence to prove it. I do not rule it out though. I have had not physical harm come to and it happens so often sometimes that I end up ignoring it and just get annoyed by it. Oh I almost forgot that this usually happens from 12-4 am if that makes any differences. I have wanted to film myself and maybe record what I might say during these happenings. That may give more insight on it.

Myzrath,5,,7,1r5zd8,,17,"I came from a universe where things twisted and changed at the mercy of my infinite will. But here everything was the same. Every day I awoke encased in meat, trapped in the same skin I’d loathed for so long. I interacted with the same people I hated, and wondered why I couldn’t have been born across the ocean. My will and infinite vision was no use here: No matter how vivid my dreams were, they were meaningless and intangible. I spend endless nights staring at the mist and midnight skies, longing to revert to my true form. I dreamed of another existence that was so real, so overpowering that it choked out this disappointing joke  you call reality. Things are woven into the fabric of your world that you will never see or comprehend. And I longed to see them again.


I came from a place where I never had to question sanity, because there was no such thing. There was only the boundless infinity of thoughts. I was nothing, yet I was everything. I had no body and I had no pain. For vast, uncounted ages I soared through the bleak darkness of space, savoring the isolation and the pain it brought. My soul was seared by the fire at the hearts of stars, and my dreams were inspired by black holes sucking entire galaxies into oblivion. I wandered for eternity, but suddenly, it was over.


And I awoke in this prison of meat, wondering why the stars were so far away.


 I wondered why I had these new emotions, like hatred and longing. I was jealous of the other meat puppets for having better skins to walk around in. Or for living in a nicer house, or fucking a better looking slab of meat. Slowly I began to forget everything. And only in dreams can I remember true freedom: the boundless infinity where I once roamed as a collection of particles calls to me, and soon I will return.

I came from a dimension where my dreams, desires, and fears were nonexistent. I had no one to envy, no one to despise. I was a subatomic particle with the fury of a dying star, and now I’m trapped inside a walking corpse waiting to die.

The vomit had soaked through the covers, moistened my legs, and cooled by the time I decided to move. The clock read Too Early; I had slept for nearly sixteen hours. Whatever. Once my mouth was rinsed and the bedding had been bundled up and tossed in the laundry room, I padded into the main living room to watch infomercials.

Dad was up at six. I didn't notice him until he slumped back into the couch beside me. He was the first to speak.

""Morning,"" he said quietly.

""Mm,"" I agreed.

""How long have you been up?""

""Since four.""

""I came in to check on you several times. Looked like you were having nightmares.""

""Yeah.""

""You were crying. Tossing and turning. I tried to wake you up."" He pulled up the sleeve of his robe to show me some scratches. ""You, uh, thought I was a bad guy.""

My eyes misted up as I drew my knees up to my chest. Words began to spill out. ""I'm sorry --""

Dad cut me off. ""Shh. It's fine. I know you didn't mean it.""

His voice was so gentle. The authoritarian figure that had watched over me with a stern gaze was gone. The fierce strength behind his eyes was broken, and this man had no fire left. All at once, the protectve shell of numbness cracked and shattered. I wanted my daddy. Without a word, I crawled over and laid my head on his shoulder. Two weeks ago, this act would have been inconceivable. Two weeks ago, Leanna was alive. Some shred of rational thought in the back of my head noted with muted shock that the roles we had played every day were nothing more than an artificial construct, an act we played out every day.

Dad wrapped me up in his arms, and we cried together until I lost track of time altogether. Inevitably, the tears stopped flowing, though neither of us made a move away from the other for another hour. Who was left to prop the two of us up but each other? We sat watching infomercials, one after the other, neither of us really caring for anything but the hypnotic power of the glowing screen.

My stomach growled. I remembered that I hadn't eaten. In the same breath, I realized that my head was pounding. I clutched at my stomach.

""Eggs okay?"" my dad murmured.

I nodded, still bent over.

Dad lifted his arm from my shoulders and stood up. In the span of that motion, the weight fell on his shoulders again and he walked slowly to the kitchen.

I scarfed down the eggs unceremoniously and thanked my dad. After that, I retired to my room and spent most of the day at my writing desk, staring at a blank sheet of paper. I took regular breaks to stare out the window at the trees waving in the wind.

Eventually, the sun sank below the treeline, and I began nodding. As I did, my heart skipped a beat. Would I wake up tomorrow tangled in the sheets, fearing that unknown terror at my heels?

In the end, I told myself that it was irrelevant. Sleep is inevitable. I still couldn't shake the feeling of impending doom, that I might face that terror again. As I slipped under the covers, I cast about in my mind, looking for anything to ease my fear. A memory came, of a lady in silver. The dream I had when I was little. Suddenly I missed that lady. I couldn't recall her face, but the feeling she brought with her was clear as day when I thought about it. She made me feel safe, protected, warm.

Tears leaked from between my closed eyelids. I missed my mom. I missed my sister. I wished I could dream of that lady just one more time. Nothing was more important. I dwelt on her memory, and the aching desire for that little bit of relief spread through my body until I craved her like a starving girl that smelled pizza.

I fell asleep thinking of nothing else. And then I woke up.

She was standing at the edge of my bed, and she was beautiful, an angel wrought in the finest, purest of silver. And I did't hurt. I stared at her, and she was beautiful, and she returned my gaze, a quizzical look on her perfect face. And she was beautiful. Her hair and gown flowed behind her in slow motion, defying gravity. She opened her mouth as if to speak, then closed it and paused and lowered her gaze. Her eyes drifted back up to me, and ...

""Can you see me?"" Her voice was the choir of heaven, the sweet whispers of a thousand mothers cooing at their newborn children. It echoed through time and space, it echoed within my mind, and my heart lifted up higher, higher, until the echoes died away. I found myself smiling, tears of joy misting my vision, blurring it into a shine of silver against the darkness of my room.

I could only nod.

""You can understand me."" Her accent was stilted as though she was deaf; I got the feeling that speech was mostly unnecessary for her.

I collapsed as the sorrows, heartbreaks, and betrayals of my past bled from my soul, all at once. A moment later, I was at peace. I sat up in a fluid motion, turning to the silver lady before me.

""Yes. I was hoping I'd dream of you. I'm so glad you're here.""

""This is no dream.""

I laughed. ""How could this be anything else?""

""I do not know. But I promise. No dream.""

I considered this for a time while the lady waited, motionless save for her gown and hair. Some part of me knew that nothing this apparition would tell me would ever be a lie. Nevertheless ... ""Alright. I'll just stay up all night, then. That should make it pretty obvious."" I grew serious. ""Will you stay with me? Can anybody else see you?""

""You called me. Not sure how. Usually death calls me. But no one will die here. I don't understand. You know death. You should not see me now.""

My jaw would have been hanging open, except I seemed incapable of registering surprise that could overpower the warmth radiating from the ethereal lady in front of me. As it was, I responded, ""Hmm,"" a sound less consideration than contentedness. ""Well, what are you?"" I said, after a lengthy pause. She responded with a pause of her own, dropping her gaze and softly stroking her chin. And then, I felt a whisper in my mind, the gentlest touch of wind as something made its way inside. Her eyes lit up, and I felt her happiness. She could communicate without speaking, I suddenly knew, and this way was much faster, more precise. I tried to think back at her, and she didn't respond. A look of confusion passed across my face, and then I understood that I'd have to project myself back for two-way communication. Telepathy wasn't nearly overpowering as the sound of her voice, or maybe I didn't have anything left inside me to soothe and fix. I realized that I had a thousand questions, and we began to converse; to an observer, it would appear as though I was having half a phone conversation. I can only summarize our exchange:

She didn't seem to know what or who she was. She had no name. She simply popped into existence one day.

""What's your earliest memory?""

Dark-skinned, brutish people in caves. A woman being raped while her child watched. A fleeting moment, blurred, before her world became darkness, a state she termed sleep.

Holy shit.

She came and went, and sometimes she was in many places at once. Rarely she was everywhere. The last time that happened, she described lots of people starving or shooting at each other. Patches on shirts and overcoats: triangles and stars. The holocaust. She was everywhere then.

Holy shit!

My jaw was, in fact, hanging open now. ""You were everywhere? In the entire universe?""

No, not the entire universe. Just the earth.

""The oceans too? All the land?""

No. Only where there were people.

""Why do I feel so much better when you're around?""

She shrugged, lines of sadness creasing her face like cracks in polished diamond. The tragedy of her expression threatened to break my heart, as though I was watching a snake eat a kitten. Suddenly I saw myself as a child, myself and my mother. I knew this to be the last time I would see my mom alive. The silver lady was embracing her, weeping tears like liquid pearl. I could see a swirling darkness surrounding the two of them, there but not there. The more closely I examined the miasma with this second sight, the more sinister it became. I began to see through it, as though it was a portal to another dimension of gnashing, swirling teeth and rotting flesh. I felt a cold, alien intelligence invade my mind, and then I was a bug under a microscope. My mind was aflame with pain and disgust, pushing through the dull opiate warmth of the lady's protection. The demonic thing was plotting, yearning, and I could taste its desire with my own tongue. My vision began to fade to black, and I was immersed in inky, single-minded hatred of unfathomable depth. Time lost its meaning, and then I was back in my room, unsure if a second had passed or a century.

The lady nodded, filling my mind with her own, and I understood; I had seen the hunger in the world, a faceless, timeless entity whose only purpose is to consume and destroy. And before me stood the force of light.

Dawn broke through my window.

This might have been a bad idea, but I read about Astral Projection and started trying to practice it but I've had no luck.  But since then, I've been hearing things before I sleep and when I wake up.

A few weeks ago I started hearing the sound of boiling water coming from my kitchen in the middle of the night; after that it was quiet conversation; and after that it was the sound of a light switch being turned on and off.

In the mornings I hear scratching, and speaking and I can't pinpoint where it could be coming from.

What happened last night is what made me scared enough to write about this.  My eyes were shut as I was trying to fall asleep, and out of nowhere I heard typing on my keyboard, which is only a few feet from my bed.  I was too scared to open my eyes and look, so I acted like I was asleep.  This morning I saw a new icon on my desktop, it was a jpg, eventually I opened it and it was just black.

I remember a story arc in Grey's Anatomy, where the ghost of a doctor's dead lover followed her around and only she could see it. That's when I stopped watching the series.

I was eating cereal, watching reruns of Scooby Doo. I couldn't recall cereal ever tasting better, and I couldn't recall Scooby Doo ever being so entertaining. But that's how it goes when the embodiment of good is sitting beside you on the couch, giggling musically at the television. Today was a day of firsts for the both of us. Dad walked in at some point, looking haggard as I had ever seen him. His eyebrows shot up when he saw me curled up on the couch, neatly groomed and with color in my cheeks. I gave him a half-smile, equal parts enthusiasm and sympathy. Make no mistake; I hadn't forgotten my sister's death, but no therapy on earth could have matched the aura of the silver lady. I stood up smoothly, walked the three paces across the living room, and wrapped him in the biggest hug I could muster. He was apparently speechless, but when I looked up at him, I saw that the worry lines around his eyes had softened a little.

I reflexively looked back over my shoulder at the silver lady, and she expressed her joy at my desire to comfort my dad. I smiled at her, and then glanced back at my dad, who was looking at me quizzically now. I brushed my hair back over my shoulder and smiled at him again.

""We're going to be okay, Dad.""

He only nodded and wandered off. He had taken time away from work to grieve, and so he had not even dressed himself. In the silence that followed, I looked around. I had to laugh, and then I was shocked at the inappropriateness of my laughter. Sitting on the couch was a ghost that only I could see, a ghost that magically took away all my pain and trouble. Yeah, I must have snapped. Two deaths was one too many. My laughter had drawn the lady's attention. She looked at me and frowned a little. I shook my head at her, incredulous, and turned away. Things like this didn't just happen to people.

I was grateful, though; at least I didn't get the ghost of deathly melancholy or something. There wasn't much of an earthly nature that could upset me, with her around. That and the fact that I had an entire day to kill considered, I decided I might as well make the best of it. Everyone grieves in their own way, I suppose? Jurassic Park was showing, and I figured I'd go see it. The movie wasn't for several hours, though, and so I grabbed up my things and went for pancakes at IHOP. The silver lady sat across from me, and I couldn't help but laugh. The entire restaurant was going about its business, and yet, here sat a figure so obviously paranormal as to be hokey, like a ghost bride, her hair and gown blowing in a wind that only she could feel. She noticed my disdain and expressed a mild indignance within my mind. I shrugged it off and asked her what she could expect from me, but quickly shut my mouth and looked around when I realized that I looked like a total schizophrenic.

I still had an hour to kill after breakfast, so I decided to spend off some of my allowance; though it had been meagre from week to week, I had saved up almost a thousand dollars over my sheltered years. I drove down main street and visited several little boutiques, built into the slightly-renovated shells of old department stores and hotels from the town's conception way back at the turn of the century. Several tops caught my eye, and the lady waited patiently as I tried each one. I asked her what she thought of them from time to time, but she didn't seem to have an eye for clothes, having probably worn the same ghost dress for hundreds of millenia. I was just wrapping up at the last store, preparing to break another fifty dollar bill, when a little girl in front of me in line turned around.

She smiled wide and began tugging on the hem of her mom's skirt.

""Mommy! Mommy!""

""What is it, honey?"" the woman asked, a little exasperated but apparently feeling indulgent.

""She's so pretty, mommy!""

The mother looked at me and smiled, and I smiled back. ""Yes, she's very pretty, hon. Now come on, we've got to get to the bank."" She half-walked, half-dragged the girl out of the store; the girl's eyes were locked back over her shoulder, that cheesy grin still on her face.

I would have felt flattered, except the child wasn't looking at me. She was looking five feet to my left. Right where the silver lady was standing. My heart dropped right onto my stomach.

A sense of surprisingly smug satisfaction filtered through my mind simultaneously with a surge of grief and longing. Satisfied though she may have been about my reaction, the silver lady desperately wanted to follow the girl. Suddenly I was along for the ride, as the silver lady's desires became my own in our shared headspace. I paid quickly at the checkout counter and trailed along behind the mother and daughter as though in a daze. We walked out into the sunlight and I sneezed as my eyes adjusted. Their car was parked twenty paces from the store.

By the time I had halved the distance between us, they were pulling out. And then shrapnel was everywhere. I dropped to the ground reflexively and was peppered with safety glass. Truly in a daze now, I staggered to my feet and wandered, it felt, towards the smoking ruin in front of me. Their little blue sedan was wrapped around an old steel truck. I walked up to the passenger side window, got as close as I could despite the truck, and felt a warm breeze blow past me. The silver lady was in the car then, embracing the husk of what had just been an adorable baby girl.

Blood trickled from every orifice in her head. Her skull had split open from front to back, stretching her face oddly, and she was staring vaguely off into the distance, blinking out-of-sync, one eye and then the other. A couple arterial spurts sprayed the chrome bumper of the truck. One moment there was a girl fighting for life, and the next there was a life-sized gory mannequin.

I never got used to that part; when life leaves the body, the body ceases to be a person and becomes a shell, inanimate as though it never breathed or laughed or ate or drank.

Sound returned to the world, and I heard choking, gurgling screams. ""Oh my god, oh god no, my baby, oh god no."" My legs went out from under me. I sat down hard on pavement, kicked my legs until I bumped softly against the curb. The silver lady was crying again.

I don't know how long I sat there, but the next thing I knew, the street was lit up with red and blue lights. The din of sirens was crashing through my skull. I was nearest the crash when it happened, and so I had to give a statement. I must have done well enough at it, because the police let me go with the promise that I come in later to write everything out. The driver of the pickup was clearly drunk, and he must have been going twenty over the speed limit. I made my way back into the boutique with stuttered steps and asked for a phone. My dad was there in ten minutes flat.

I stared out the window blankly all the way home, held aloft solely by the presence of the silver lady. Dad tried to get me to speak several times, but his words were a dull chatter in the back of my mind. I closed my eyes as the tears began to roll down my cheeks. I curled up inside myself, and felt a welling spring of warmth rise inside of me as the tightness lifted from my chest. I fled into it, covering myself with the warming blanket of the silver lady's loving embrace like a child afraid of the dark. I breathed deep and opened my eyes. My gaze was drawn down to my own body. My skin had taken on a silver-white glow and an opalescence like polished marble.

I glanced over at my dad, wondering if he was seeing this. My heart skipped a beat as I took in the dark, sickly-hued vapor sticking to his skin like lake fog on a cold morning.

""Sarah? Sarah, what is it?"" he asked, seeing my face tight with shock and alarm. His voice was jarring; I could hear new and unfamiliar tones of worry and sadness layered within it. But I couldn't respond. I was busily looking around at the world, which had taken on an alien cast. The flora radiated crystalline hues and the sky boiled with color like something alive. I could see the air itself buzzing with activity.

""This is the true world,"" I thought to myself in a voice wholly not my own. ""We seem to have ... merged."" I felt my inner eye flipping through my memories and thoughts like the pages of a book, each moment replayed and recast in the new light of a foreign perspective. Simultaneously I felt my mind open to a tome of memories not my own, as though a hidden eye within me had opened for the first time. So much suffering, so much death. I was a failure. For aeons I had tried to stem the tide of pain and misery that ran rampant across the earth like a plague, but all my efforts amounted to a drop in the ocean.

I was being shaken. My mouth tasted of ozone. Dad had stopped the car, and I realized I was doubled over and screaming. Dad was near hysterics, trying to get a response from me. My voice, shaky and otherworldly inside my skull, said, ""Sick ... stomach. Home. Please, take me home.""

Benlightenment,1,,5,1r3pbk,,15,"So, my auntie used to work for a millionaire. Not the best kind though, the kind who got the millions by being lucky in the national lottery. He only won about 6 million or so, but it was enough to get him a fancy ass house, and to hire my aunt as a housekeeper/general helper woman.
His house was a kinda half-new project. There was an old bit of land with an old house sat on it just outside the city they lived in, which he bought up, and then built his house around that one. And then his garage, and a private gym... he wasn't clever with his money (and my aunt was stealing some too, which she went to prison for eventually, but that's another story).
So in the end, the guy pretty much bankrupts himself on silly business ventures and cars. He has to sell the house. At that point, I was staying with my aunt for a week or two for a little holiday, so she asked me if I wanted to come along while she had to clear some stuff out. Me, coming from a crappy little town, jumped at the chance to have a nosy around a millionaire's mansion.

Once we got there, my aunt took off into the kitchen, which is where Mr Millions was (his name was Lee, really). They basically said I can have a wander round, play on his Dreamcast (that was a mega thing for me at the time) and just don't mess around with stuff I shouldn't. Understandable.
So I wandered off, walked through a few of the mega living rooms with leather sofas and stuff. It was all pretty old, but I think that was more just because he'd bought it to look that way. I sat down and messed around on the Dreamcast for a bit, but got bored playing Quake and decided to go have another wander. He had a swimming pool, but I didn't have my trunks, so I was kinda lost for something to do. I figured I'd just go down the other end of the house where I hadn't been and see what else he had kicking around.

So, the house itself was a pretty standard layout. You know the mansion in Resident Evil 1? The entrance hall kinda looked like that, only it was dark colours and wood rather than white. Upstairs was basically just one long landing corridor which had loads of doors off it to bedrooms and stuff. At the very end was a double-door, which I'd never been through. Given the way the doors looked, I assumed they were part of the old house which he'd kept, so I went to have a look.

Inside was a pretty tiny room, considering the house. Probably could've fit two or three double beds in there at most. One side had a couple of armchairs and a little table, and the rest was like a little library, with a couple of bookcases free standing and the opposite wall to the chairs being a full bookcase wall, which was amazing to me at the time.
I figured there had to be something in here I wanted to read, so I went up along the wall of books just having a look what was there. It was all pretty standard stuff that you'd expect to buy just to fill up a bookcase. Dickens, Austen... that kinda stuff.

Now, from where I was, I couldn't see the doors anymore, cause the bookcases were in the way. So, not paying attention, when they slammed shut, I squealed like a girl and jumped almost out of my skin. Given the size of the house, I figured it was either the wind or someone closing the doors, not realising I was in here.

It wasn't, though. To this day, I still have no idea who did it (I say who rather than what, cause what is crazy) but both the doors were shut tight. But that wasn't the odd thing.
On the doorknobs was a book that had been placed there, balancing. So yeah, my gut is already going a bit weird at this point, cause that's just odd. The cover had bright colours though, so I assumed it was someone playing a prank. As I got close enough to read, I saw what it was: a kid's book. Innocent enough. Except for the title. 

“I See You”

It was some kind've of Peekaboo book for kids, but that didn't matter at the time. As soon as I read it, my blood froze and I ran out of there like a little bitch. 
I still don't know whether it was one of his family or not. The house has been pulled down since, though from what my auntie told me, the half that he built around is now a protected building, so it's still there, in pieces. 
She said it was haunted too, but that was only after I'd told her the story. It's about 10 years on now, and I still dunno what happened that day. Given that my aunt was thieving from the guy... it's not like I can ask him either.",The millionaire's library,20,nosleep
lamented_dreams,4,,7,1rgqu8,,15,"I love the dark. I really do.

I don't mean going gothic and pagan and all that, but I do like the dark. I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos, researching diseases and the supernatural, and writing stories.

Anyways, I've recently come across a quote from a game called 'Knock Knock'. And let me say, it's utterly terrifying for not just the player, but the watcher too. There's nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the game.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside."" —Knock Knock

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

DjFlamefist,14,,3,1reoey,,13,"So i was staying at my aunt's house because she was going away to Iceland for a couple of days, and i had to watch her dog for a bit. Poor bastard couldn't be left a lone, now could he? I have experienced minor things in that house before, like things vanishing and reappearing and things like that. I guess there could be some logical explanation to it, but i have always been sure there was something fishy going on in there. I wasn't afraid though, haven't had any ""problems"" before. At the third day, the day before they returned, it happened. Although it was a normal day, no problems what so ever, i heard someone ring the doorbell. I thought fo sure that this was my aunt returning early from the vacation for some reason, but it felt... odd. I brought her dog just to stay there for a second line of defense as i was opening the door (The dog was a basset hound for those who might wonder). I opened the door and i saw two weird guys there, they looked like they have come from a party or something, atleast they looked drunk. ""Hello"", i said in my own language ofcourse, didn't expect visitors from other countries. They looked weirdly at eachother, dog barking like flipping fuck at them. ""Is this Norway?"" they answered, Surely that must be a weird question to ask. ""Yes, i suppose so, where are you guys from?"" i answered, trying to be as polite as i could. ""Oh, nowhere, was just checking with ya'"" they said with a weird look on their face. ""Umm, do you need to borrow a phone or something? surely that must be the reason you are here?"" i said. ""Well, we were just checking with ya'"" they said, with the dog between my feet still barking like heck. They looked at eachother and left. They went about 8 meters away from the house as i was closing the door. Thought it'd be impolite not to say goodbye, so i opened the door again to ofcourse... say goodbye.
They weren't there. Nothing was there. Everything was as usual, the dog had stopped barking, and i was left with a question: Is this real?.

I am sure that they couldn't have gotten more than 2 meter away from their spot while i reopened the spot, even if they ran at full speed. Even then i would have seen them. What do you think happened, people of reddit? could it really be some logical explanation for this?",I might have encountered a ghost.,16,nosleep
funnyguy135,2,,6,1r3dcj,,12,"When I was younger may family moved around a lot.  One of the places that we lived in was a town in New Jersey.  We were only there for about 1 year but the events that occurred will leave a lasting mark on me for a life time.  In order to protect the identity of people names will be changed.

During the summer when I was around the age of 13 my family moved to New Jersey.  Upon moving I quickly befriended my neighbor, James.  James and I began hanging out a lot and soon he started introducing me to some of his friends.  I soon became friends with these people and joined their little friend group of 4.  Pretty soon school started up again and I began meeting fellow class mates.  I made a few new friends but I mostly stuck with James and those people.

One day during school I left class to go to the bathroom.  Upon entering I noticed that someone had clogged the sink with paper towels and turned on the water.  Luckily I got there before the water started flooding over so I turned it off, cleaned up the sink and went about with my business.  When I got back to class I told Henry (one of the people in my friend group) about what someone had did.  He began to chuckle and told me I was funny.  I asked what he meant and he turned to me looking confused.  He asked, ""Wait, you don't know?""  I said I didn't know what he was talking about and he told me he would explain after school.

At the end of the day I went to go meet Henry so that he could explain to me what he was talking about.  I walked outside and saw James, Henry and Tim (the other member of the group) waiting for me.  I asked what was going on and they said they would explain.  They told me that about 5 years after the school was built, before any of us were born, a boy had been killed in the bathroom that I had used earlier.  They told me that he was being bullied and the bullies thought it would be funny to give the kid a swirly (a swirly is where you hang a kid upside down, put his head into the toilet and then flush it).  Any way what the bullies did not expect to happen was the kid to drown.  The bullies thought he was just being a pussy so they left him on the ground.  The body was later discovered later in the day when another kid went to use the bathroom and saw that he was not breathing.  The bullies got into some huge shit and were expelled and got into some trouble with the law.  After that there had been strange occurrences of toilets or sicks being clogged, strange noises being heard, toilets flushing on their own or even for some people seeing a little boy soaking wet standing in the middle of the bathroom.  The school had been putting it off as tricksters trying to scare younger kids but people honestly believed what they saw.  At the end of the story I told my friends that they were bull shitting me but when they kept trying to convince me so I got frustrated and went home.

The next day in the school the guys were still on me about the whole murdered kid and how he haunts the bathroom.  I didn't believe a word of it and started to get really mad at them.  We got into a fight and I didn't speak with any of them for a while.  About a month after our fight Henry left to go use the bathroom.  He was gone for 20 minutes and the teacher asked me to go check up on him.  I agreed and left go see what was wrong.  I walked into the bathroom and saw no sign of Henry but only a small puddle of water on the ground.  I figured that this was just some elaborate trick that the guys had set up to try and scare me.  I started saying out loud, ""Really funny Henry but you can come out now cause what ever you're trying to do is not working.""  Thats when I heard a slight whimper coming from one of the stalls.  I opened it to find Henry curled up in a ball on the ground soaking wet.  I knelt down and started shaking him and yelling for him to get up but all he did was lay there whimpering and slightly rocking back and forth.

I ran to go get a teacher and then brought her back to the bathroom.  When we arrived Henry was no longer curled up in a ball but now standing up in front of one the mirrors just staring into it.  The teacher ran over and asked what was wrong but he just stood there staring.  She started to pull him away and he look at her and said, ""No...I need to stay...he told me to stay...that i'm going to join him.""  The teacher asked who told him to stay and then after another second of silence Henry burst into tears and said, ""The boy...the boy tolled me.""  For about the next week Henry did not show up in school and James, Tim and I got worried so we went to visit him at home.  When we got there his mother answered the door and when we asked how he was she said that all he does is stay up in his room and when ever they asked him to leave his face changed and he said he was to afraid.  We went up to see him and when we got up there all he did was look up at us and then look back down at the floor.  We asked how he was doing and he didn't answer.  After a few minutes of silence Tim blurted out, ""So what happened Henry?""  James and both gave him a nasty look and he just shrugged.  Henry looked up at us and said that he saw him.  We asked what he was talking about and he said he saw the boy.  That they had stared at each other for about 20 minutes before the boy started walking towards him saying that he had to stay with him and join him.  Henry started to back away but that only angered the boy as he lunged at Henry.  Henry said that he was all of the sudden drowning in the toilet and he heard his name called and so he sat up and then collapsed to the floor.  I then entered the stall and tried to get him and the rest we already knew.  We all sat there in silence before with out a word got up and left.

Henry stopped coming to school and after a few months we heard that he had moved away.  We stopped talking about him because we refused to believe what he had told us.  As the school year came to a close my parents informed me that we were moving again.  I was upset because I would be leaving my friends but also slightly relived.  I stayed in touch with James and Tim but over the years we grew apart and the whole long distance thing stopped working.  The last I had spoke to them they said that they hadn't seen or spoke to Henry since that day we all went to see him.  I hadn't seen Henry either but to be fare I was purposely trying to avoid him.  I grew up and one day while reading the paper I saw a story about a man who had drowned in his own home.  His name was Henry Goldmen.  I figured that this couldn't be the Henry that I knew so long ago.  But there is still apart of me that wonders that maybe Henry was telling the truth and maybe what ever tried to kill him the first time waited years before trying again but this time it succeeded.

The_John_Deere,11,,14,1r800l,,14,"I thought i would be safe from stuff like this, that these sorts of things wouldnt happen to me for a long time. Honestly, I didn't. Hell, I especially didnt expect it to be at school. 

I've dealt with ghosts before, more than I can count. I can normally help when people have problems with the paranormal, but now I'm the one in need of help.

I assume many of you remember u/inaaace's stories about Rose and the orange, correct? How could you not, that was one of the biggest things on this sub all year. This encounter/series of encounters is like that.

It started about a month ago. I'd have a dream that I wouldn't remember, and then at random points in the day I'd remember having that in the dream. Every day more and more instances of déjà vu would happen. This week has been the worst. I remembered my dream on Wednesday, and everything tht happened Wednesday I knew would happen, like us having a substitute in French, a pop quiz in Trigonometry, and a surprise workout at Track.

Last night, I thought I had a normal dream. Just regular stuff. Until *she* showed up.

This girl has bothered me sine freshman year. She's a bit of a weirdo, and all my friend think she likes me. The feeling is not mutual. Anyways, she popped up in my dream with the creepiest damn smile I've ever seen. And ten everything went black. I don't know if the dream ended or I just forgot the rest, but it just stopped. 

I came to school today thinking everything would be dandy, and it was, until 8th period seminar (my school has a ""free period"" that we go to every other day, and the class we go to during that block alternates every time). I walked in, and she sat next to me. Awesome. Just what I need. 

For most of the class I felt her eyes on me, and everytime I looked over she had a smile that grew gradually bigger. By the end of the period the smile resembled the one from the dream *exactly*. I was extremely freaked out, and it was probably showing, too. I looked over one more time, and then te entire dream flashed back to me. She had been holding something in the dream, some small enough to fit in her hand. As soon as I remembered this, her eyes locked with mine, an then she reached into her bag, 

And held out an orange.

I have to go back to that class in 2 hours. I don't know what to do. Nosleep, please help me. I don't think I can handle this one alone.

Edit for words. Sorry I was in a rush to write this.

EDIT 2: 15 minutes left in class, nothing really noteworthy has happened. Seems like she's backed off a bit. I still feel her eyes on the back of my head, though, so I'm bracing myself for when class is over.

EDIT 3: sorry about the delay, early track practice. The remainder of class was extremely uneventful except for the last 5 minutes, during which she got that freaky smile on her face and started slowly moving closer to me. When the bell rang, I bolted. Didn't want to stick around any longer. 

But what's really freaky is what happened around the end of practice. We had a workout today, and on our cooldown I could have sworn I saw her, behind the trees or on the other side of the road. I just ignored that though, and it's all been pretty good since. I just got home, so I should be safe. I'll keep you guys posted if anything else exciting happens.",I didn't think this would happen to me.,28,nosleep
Pretending_To_Care,2,,12,1r6wgf,,12,"It was around 1am, when Steve and I stumbled upon the railroad tracks that lead out of our small village. 

""You know, about two miles down the track, there's an old church that's been abandoned. I hear it's a place for Devil worship."" Steve was grabbing a branch just off to the side of the track. 

""Fuck that."" I snapped. 

""Chicken shit?"" Steve smiled. 

""No! I just don't think it's a good idea. Rick said he'd been there during the day with Alan, and there was blood all over the place and a stick that had been used to stab something.""

""How would he know that?""

""There was blood on it.""

""Well look, I've got a stick! How's about I stab anyone if they get near. Or you, for being a pussy."" Steve began jabbing towards me like some sort of fencing opponent. 

""Fine, we can go, but you lead the way, big man."" I agreed. 

We hiked down the tracks for about an hour and a half, maybe longer if you count the couple times we stopped so Steve could smoke from his pipe. The church was in sight. 

As we got closer, we notice a faint light pouring out of the broken door at the front of the church. When we were within twenty or so feet from the side of the church when we crouched behind some trees in the woods. 

""Do you hear that!?"" Steve gasped. 

""Hear what?""

""That chanting.""

We fell silent for a few seconds, but in turn were met with more silence. Nothing. 

""Look, let's creep around front and see if we can get a look inside."" Steve was already headed toward the front before I could object. 

It's a surprise that if anyone were inside, they didn't hear us. Steve was stepping on every stick his feet could've found.

As we placed our backs against the wall of the church, we could hear shuffling against its concrete floor, then silence again. 

Steve leaned over to me ""Right, on three, we both take a quick look... One, two... three.""

We probably should have booked it as soon as we saw what was inside, but shock had totally frozen us in place. 

Upon looking inside, we were met with the dead stare of about thirty fully cloaked people. They knew we were there, and they just stared at us. Behind them was a bloodied lamb, and beside it, a man holding a stick.

Now I'm no expert, but I thought sacrifices were conducted with a blade. NOT by gouging what must have been a couple dozen holes in the body of your sacrifice. 

""Jesu- Oh my God man, fucki- RUN!""

We ran as fast as we could for about ten minutes before I pleaded Steve to wait for me. I couldn't run any more. I had to catch my breath. 

""What... the FUCK was THAT!?"" Steve gasped. 

""I, don't know. You fucking idiot. I told you we shouldn't have gone anywhere near that fu-"" I stopped abruptly.

Behind us was a mob of people carrying flashlights.

""Get down!"" I gasped. 

We laid silently in the dark of the woods for what seemed like forever. We kept our heads down, trying not to breathe. The only indication about where they were was from the lights they carried, and then the worst possible thing that could've happened, did.

In succession, all the lights that were just on, went off. We were blanketed in darkness with this group of men, no more than thirty feet away. We only heard the crackling of branches and the shuffling of leaves for the next few seconds before we heard a voice nearby, grumble a faint ""We have seen you. Come out.""

I couldn't see Steve, but I knew what had happened. Steve bolted off further into the woods, snapping their attention right at us. I could hear him sulking as he ran harder and harder, but they were catching him. I remained silently on the ground as they disappeared. 

I must have laid there, not making a noise for fifteen minutes. What just happened? I was worried sick about Steve. They got him, I just had this feeling, they got him. 

Eventually, I crept my way back home and snuck into my room without waking my parents. I contemplated waking them up to tell them what happened for a while, before I broke down and did exactly that. Sort of. 

At this point, it was around 6am, and dad was getting ready for work. I told him that Steve and I were in the woods and we got spooked by an animal and lost each other running, so I just came home. I told him I was worried Steve might have gotten hurt and that we should call to see if he was okay. My dad is a sharp man, and knew something was up, but didn't question me. He just nodded his head and said ""Okay. ""

We contacted Steve's mother, who confirmed that, surprisingly, Steve was home. After a few more minutes, my dad concluded their phone conversation and reassured me Steve was okay. 

Around noon, I drove over to Steve's house to check in on him. When I got there, he signaled me to follow him up to his room. 

""They know who we are."" He said. ""As I was running, they yelled my name at me. These people, they know who we are.""

I froze.

""If they know who we are, then they live in our village.""

""Exactly, we-..."" Steve stopped himself. ""What do we do?"" He asked.

So a little background, I'm a First Nations female living on reserve and I was probably around 15 when this happened... As a native women I have always been very spiritual.

The house I was and am currently still living in is about 4acres in the country on reserve and the area by my house is surrounded by trees on 3 sides, with a long driveway. There's a path just off the trees line that I used to love too walk but to get to it you need to do a bit of bush whacking. 

So one day I'm out on a walk on these trails with my 3 dogs; Ginger (mix breeds of something), Maggie and Charlie ( both black labs). The trail I'm walking goes for about 1km before you reach a sort of T intersection, go south and in .5 you reach these sand dunes or head north and there's acres and acres of trails. As I'm walking with my dogs, I get to this intersection when I hear Ginger start to whimper, she's nudging me trying to get me to head back home, I think this is odd  but my other dogs are fine so I brush it off and keep walking as Ginger takes off running home with her tail between her legs. 

Feeling adventurous I go north to do some exploring. 2 dogs in tow. I get another kilometre before a coyote comes across our paths. Dogs growling , coyotes looking at us, growling. That is till it looked behind us, kinda whimpered, and took off. Still didn't think much of it. What I was paying attention to was the howling coyote close to us and close to probably 5-10 of them I can hear howling not to far in the distance. 

Decided it was time to take my growling dogs home far away from the pack of coyotes coming for us. 

Everything was going fine on the walk back, coyotes got close then they got distant. Dogs were happy, that is... Till we got to that damn T intersection. It was like a fricken flip got switched. My once happy dogs started whimpering, I felt them nudging me on both sides, they started kind of running up ahead before they would turn around, realize I wasn't with them and they would come back by my side, nudging me to go faster, whimpering, tail between their legs. I was  scared... Then I heard it .

2 claps, right behind my head. I'm I'm the fricken bush ! I turned around slowly and ... Nothing. I grab the biggest branch I could find and start walking. 
Double clap, keep walking
Double clap, maybe it's an animal, but what kind of animal makes that noise right behind your head ?!? 
Double clap, turn around.., still can't see anything !!!
Double clap, keep walking
Double clap, little people, centaurs, bad spirits ? 
Double clap, I want to run all the way home but force myself to walk because running seems like it would make the being watched and followed feeling so much worse... 
Double clap, scared me, scared dogs...ALL...THE WAY...HOME... followed me all the way to the tree line, my dogs were scared all the way home, till we hit the tree line..then they were happy...

I ran to my mom crying, warning her not to let anyone walk the trails alone anymore. I still can't, not alone. 

I don't know what followed me home, but I know that whatever it was, it was very bad..",Followed home by something while walking in the bush,19,nosleep
angelcot,3,,1,1rh91p,,12,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep
Marksman46,3,,4,1rftnd,,11,"Have you ever looked in a mirror, and you were a little off put by your expression? Or looked at yourself in the mirror and realized that the person looking back at you, is you?

I walked beside my friend, and as we walked, we talked. I can’t remember what we talked about, but all I remember is this bland, superficial conversation about nothing in particular. Conversations like these bothered me; they didn't seem real to me, just like sounds, verbal ""things"" that hold no real meaning. And as I thought about our conversation, I wanted to make it more real for me, to give our little talk some depth, and just before I asked her a meaningful question, I tripped. I startled awake, rubbed my eyes, glanced at the clock but the time didn't register in my head. I realized that I needed to go the the bathroom. I shuffled over, dragging my feet to be sure I didn't trip or stub my toe, flicked on the lights, squinting from the brightness, relieved myself and turned on the faucet; I ran my hands under the cool water, threw some water on my face, picked up the towel and wiped my face off. As my eyes adjusted to the light, I looked at myself in the mirror, and my reflection was... smiling at me...I considered that I may have been dreaming, or hallucinating, but my cold damp hands and the pain of the bright light was all too real. I did what I would usually do when in this sort of disbelief and rubbed my eyes some more, hoping I was still just a bit drowsy. 

But nothing changed. 

I looked at myself and was quite curious. I felt my face with my hand to see if I was actually smiling… It certainly didn’t feel like it. Normally this would creep the hell out of me, I would, on any other occasion, scream or run away, but I just stared at the reflection, looking into my eyes as if they weren’t mine. A genuine happiness. I haven’t felt that way in far too long. I felt calm. But suddenly, as though something dropped to the ground, the feeling of calm had broken, like a shattering vase, a feeling welled up inside me. 

A tightness in my chest.

Like someone had just punched me, it was one of a gurgling frustration. I would be happy if it weren’t for this stupid house, things are constantly broken, and this wretched family; it all torments me, every day of my life. That’s when I heard the voice of my father from couple days earlier “Because I said so.” the words resonated in my mind, I could feel my teeth gritting, the sound made my skin crawl... but the reflection just kept smiling back...taunting me. The shrill sound of my mother’s voice beckoned in a continuous annoying ringing in my ear…I shook my head to clear my thoughts but the ringing was still there. I peered over at the clock and looked at the time. 2:34... 2:34... 2:34…2:34? It's late.

I couldn’t possibly sleep now, I was simply too stressed. I had school tomorrow, but I had to deal with this.

“Let me sleep” I muttered half to myself, half to the voices and that face in the mirror. This was when I noticed the mirror had stopped reflecting my actions, and just was a still image of myself smiling. I became angry at this point “What is wrong with you…” I said to it, hoping it would stop. “Just go the hell away!” I growled through my teeth. Feeling rather violent I stared back into my eyes, trying to counteract that incessant grin with my anger. ""No."" It's mouth didn't form the words, but the sound just streamed out of it. The ringing got louder and louder, I tried to cover my ears but it felt like it was coming from inside my head, the voices began circling me and taunting me and that terrible ringing. Then it all just stopped. Was it over? I just wanted to go to sleep so I could continue my broken life. It started laughing, a laugh that sounded unmistakably like my voice... But it was a sound I had never made before... a sound like... true laughter... this was new to me. It bothered me. I was envious. Why can't I experience that kind of happiness? He bothered me.

I had enough. 

The voices all faded away but the mirror kept smiling. “STOP!” I yelled as I punched the mirror, the blood was quick to run down my arm and the few pieces of mirror were stuck in my hand, I could feel them scaping at the bone. The remnants of the mirror on the wall reflected nothing but my angry scowl and bloodied arm. I stared at my hand. It didn't hurt, but I could lightly see the reflection of my own face in the bloodied shards. It still smiled. IT STILL SMILED. ""NO."" I slammed my hand against the counter, the blood spilled all over the room, on my shirt and face.

“And so it happened, Blake had snapped;
though In his own mind, he was trapped.
Broken and confused he wanted to die.
But all he could do was simply cry.”

“The lights flicked off, his mother shrieked, in the other room;
scared, as though she could feel her impending doom.
His father had been up all night drinking
While Blake was pondering and thinking.”

“The sound of the window outside smashing,
rang in his mind, terrifying, echoed the crashing.”

“NOW OF ALL TIMES!?” Blake shouted furiously.

“We enter Blake’s house to a horrid scene,
the smell of blood, nothing was clean.”

“The sanctity of his mind, and house violated,
with adrenaline and fear, his pupils dilated.“

“Sprinting to the kitchen he grabbed a tool,
a knife, very sharp, for he was no fool.
Not afraid to risk his life, with nothing to live for,
This life. And the criminal, he did abhor.“

“Creeping through the house to find the thief,
He heard a loud scream, though very brief.“

In his parent’s room he finds the two mangled corpses, the floor already soaked in blood. His parents had been completely mutilated, each had been stabbed numerous times, now slumped on the floor, eyes still open. A figure stood overtop the lifeless corpses that were once his parents, hunched over, with a bloody knife in hand, the tall man was half visible in the moonlight that came through the window. His skin fair and pale, his face, was itself a conundrum... it was an inexplicable quality. His face looked… off. Like an optical illusion where all you can do is stare and ponder. His fingers were skinny, the joints looked massive in comparison. He looked almost inhuman; but he was unmistakably a man. 

“Awkward” echoed in my mind; perhaps for lack of a better word, as he edged toward me.

""You didn't..."" I said to him.

“‘You’re welcome,’ I stated in a soft, warm voice
to Blake who accepted my words without much choice.”
“I followed him back to the kitchen, as he put the knife down,
The blood dripped from his hair, as heavy as a crown.” 

“‘Its done, its over.’ He quietly muttered to himself.
‘We can sleep now’ He put the knife on the shelf.”

“I climbed back out the window, never there was a mess;
as Blake walked, he had no more stress.”

“His house unviolated but his mind still tainted,
to this new life, he will never be acquainted.”

My wits came back to me. Cold blood streamed down my arms. I walked calmly to the bathroom and looked at the cracked and bloody mirror, the counter was a mess. Between the cracks I see my face, depressed. Sad to the point of a complete bleak. The frown. That was more like it... That makes more sense to me, no longer that disgusting smile. I saw a tear on his face. It was of blood. Feeling around on my face, I felt a drop of blood. Blood on my face? Then I felt something that I did not expect. 

A smile. 

My mind twisted. Reality as I knew it broken, demented, distorted. I looked again at my hand... The shards of glass still glistened in the light, even covered in blood. I saw a piece of bone fractured. I glanced again at the clock, 3:07... ""When did that happen?"" I said, as recollections of what had just happened streamed back into my mind. Did I wake up my parents when I hit the mirror? Then reality hit me in a particularly cruel manner.

For a moment, dead silence.

“MOM, DAD!” I yelled as I sprinted across the house into their room. There they lay. Bloody and mangled bodies, multiple stab wounds on both of them, in the torso, the chest, the legs, the knees, even the face.

I hugged them, soaked in their still warm blood. Yelling at the top of my lungs, “I’M SO SORRY! I’M SO SORRY!” 

Like a pin dropping, the tick of the clock in their room brought me to how real this was.

But only one thought reverberated in my mind. 

This is going to totally ruin my day... 

After about 20 minutes, the blood grew cold, and the corpses began feeling rather stale. I walked around their room, looking for my next day’s lunch money, and as I was walking out, I slipped in a pool of blood. With a loud crash, I continued to lay on the floor for quite some time, I silently muttered to myself

“Dammit, now I need to get some new clothes.”

I began pacing toward my room, taking off my shirt, frustrated by this inconvenience. I threw it on the floor, and it made a sloshing sound. ""Maybe I can wash it..."" My mother had done my wash up until now. I took a shower and put on some new clothes. Clean at last. 

I walked back into my parents room. I stared a little while. Maybe 2 or 3... hours. It was so… Peaceful. This should’ve happened a long time ago.

When I remembered that it was time for bed. 

I began laughing. Laughing as I never had before in my life. Overjoyed. More genuine than any laugh I have ever had. 

Time for bed? I don’t have a bedtime anymore. No one to yell at me. No one to tear my mind apart. I laughed and laughed until I heard my alarm clock go off in my room. 

“Oh, time for school!” I said with a grin on my face.
But without my parents here to test me, this was no race.
Me? This house was now my place. 
I'm here to stay, for I had left quite a trace.
",Reflection,15,nosleep
Dectrek,2,,5,1rbx7r,,12,"All my life I have never believed in luck. It’s just some stupid phrase coined from the minds of jealous or self-absorbed people saying, “Aren’t I the greatest, I just won $50,000 off the lottery! I’m so lucky!” or, “Can you believe that he just won 50 grand off the lottery, that son of a gun.” Now just because I think that luck is a bunch of crap doesn’t mean that I gamble. Oh I gamble alright, I gamble until I’m rich and drunk at the same time. I’ve been to Vegas with my friends, Ron, Jerry, and Max a ton of times and they always say, “Wow Rob, you’re so lucky!” and I’ll either ignore them, or I’ll be too drunk to hear them. I was addict when it came to gambling, but one night, that all changed.

It was another Vegas trip with the guys. I had lied to my company telling them that I was going on a “business trip” and they had completely bought it. I even was able to use company money to pay for the trip! We checked into our hotel room and decided that tonight, we were going to live like there was no tomorrow. I played craps until I was running low on money so I went to the blackjack table and counted cards until I was well funded for the rest of the night. We drank and we drank and we drank until we could barely see anymore. I started to black out so we went to the streets.
	
Now the next events were blurry and I don’t remember all of it. I think what happened was that my friends were telling me that I lucked out at blackjack when one of them said something about me cheating. I got all offended and started taking hits at him and I think we got in a fight. Next thing I knew I was in an alley and was starting to black out, probably not such a good idea to have had that much to drink, and that’s when every turned black.
	
This is when it happened. First, everything was dark and I couldn’t feel anything but then I heard voices. They were cheering all around me that sounded like something exciting was happening and then I got the sense of feeling back. I was lying on my back and there were voices all around me, cheering as if it was a football game. Then the lights went up.

I was blinded at first but as my eyes adjusted to the light, I saw thousands of people sitting in stand around a stage that I was on. I was laying a colorful wheel, something you would see on the wheel of fortune, and I couldn’t get up. Beyond the crowed was darkness and the only light came from a huge light bulb that was about 10 yards from where I was laying. A man was standing on the stage and was holding a microphone.
	
“Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome too our next contestant, Rob Johnson!”

The crowd went wild and the wheel started to spin, slowly at first, but it gained speed quickly. I was beginning to feel sick when I heard “Jerry, press the button when you’re ready!” and the wheel began to slow down. As it slowed I heard the man on the stage yell, “Let’s see how luck our contestant is!” too which the crowed started to yell out colors that they thought the wheel would land on. The wheel stopped on the color green, and the crowd screamed with joy. All around the room the color green was shown with the words “Bad luck” on them. I was deeply confused when I heard, “Well it looks like Rob wasn’t too lucky, stay tuned for our next contestant,” too which I blacked out.

I woke up at the hotel in bed, where I instantly began to contemplate what happened during the night. I came to the conclusion that it was all just a dream and that my friends found me in the alley that I passed out in. They had driven me back to the hotel where I slept the rest of the night away and was now waking up from a drunken dream. Ron came into the room where they asked me if I was ok and what I was doing in that alley, too which I replied, that I just had had one too many drinks. They gave me some water and then told me to get ready for breakfast. The rest of the day was ok up until we went back to the casino at night. I was losing my fortune at craps again so I thought I would count cards at Blackjack again to refund my losses.

My count revealed that the next card too be thrown was going to be a four and I had 17 points on the table. He had thrown 4 aces, kings, queens, jacks, 10, and so on and so until 4 to which he had only thrown three. I knew that there was no possible way that I could lose so I went all in He picked up the next card and laid it on the table, and what I saw I couldn’t believe. He had laid down the ace of spades which I distinctly remembered getting three games ago. I just sat there in disbelief as he ranked in all of my money.
	
I ran to the atm and took 5000 dollars out of my account and ran back to the blackjack table where I counted cards until that was all I could think about but every time my calculations revealed what the next card was, It was always a card that made me go over 21. I kept running to the atm and running back to the blackjack table but I always lost. My bank account was swept clean that night; all of the money that I had worked hard for year after year was taken away from me in a few hours.Ron, Jerry, and Max all said that it was just bad luck but I couldn’t believe what happened that night. It had been a terrible night, but not as bad as what happened when I feel asleep.

I was back on the wheel, and everything was exactly the same as the night before, except I got a new color! This time, I landed on purple which lit up the room with the word “Truth”. When I woke up, it was the next day, and my friends came in and brought me too breakfast. That day, my company found out I lied to them about the trip when all of my bank account money disappeared, and I was fired. The bill for the trip was sent to me but I knew I wouldn’t be able to pay for it. That night I was back on the wheel being spun again for a new color.
This continued for ten days, each brought a new horror such as “pain” or “divorce” to which I was beaten up by some muggers and then divorced by my wife. On the eleventh night, I was standing on the stage with the man holding the microphone. “Let’s give it up for Rob Johnson everyone!” The man yelled and the crowd went wild. I was ushered off the stage and was taken into a room with the guy who had the microphone.
	
“Nice job Mr. Johnson,” He said, “The crowd loved you!”
	
“What was that?” I asked, “I demand you tell me at once what is going on.”
	
“Oh, I’m sorry, you must be very confused. I’m Chris Armstrong, and I run this show. You see whenever someone new comes along, we take the number of big sins that that person had committed in the past 24 hours and we have them face the wheel and its consequences that many times. You had 10 total major sins in that past day so you faced the wheel ten times. You sure put a show on for the audience!”
	
“Sins?” I asked.
	
“Oh yes, you committed theft, gambling, murder you name it! You cheated at blackjack, you became drunk, you beat up a few people, and you committed more theft. We haven’t seen a suspect like you for a while!”

“I don’t remember anything like that!” I snapped at him.

“That’s probably because you were drunk when most of it happened. Don’t worry though; you’ll have plenty of opportunities to make up for them later.”

This is when a thought occurred to me, he said I committed murder but I didn’t remember doing, or who I did it too.

“Wait… who did kill?” I asked suspiciously. 

“You don’t know? I thought it would have occurred to you by now. Let’s see if I can make you realize who. You got into a fight with him after you left the casino. You hurt him pretty bad, and in your drunkenness, you killed him. When he came here, we thought that instead of making him face the wheel, why not have him push the button that stops the wheel from spinning. It was an attraction that brought in a larger crowd than usual.”

That’s when I remembered him saying “Push the button when you’re ready Jerry” and how I had gotten into a fight with one of my friends about me cheating at blackjack.”

“I killed Jerry?” I asked in horror, but then a new though came into my mind, “Wait, if Jerry is dead and he pressed the button to stop the wheel, then does that mean I’m…”
	
“Yes, you are dead,” Chris said as if he knew exactly what I was about to ask, “You died of alcohol poisoning when you passed out in the alley. The past 10 days have been a simulation. Mr. Johnson, welcome to Hell.”

Lucky me.

nisyldaed,10,,9,1r6mcx,,12,"Someone once said ""The greatest strengt is to know your weaknesses."" Luckily I found that out quite Early. 
You might say that I've been blessed with a keen perception, so I always tended to grasp certain concepts and situations quicker than the peope around me, which quickly lead me to thinking that I was somehow superior to others.
Letting these thoughts and thus my hubris overtake me : that was and still is my greatest weakness, but ironically the very cause of my Pride allowed me to realise this very thing, so whether it's a blessing or a curse might be your own perspective.

My story begins with something that should have been a regular day at my university, you know: attending courses, not paying attention, browsing the internet on your phone, etc.
I can't really get into detail here, 
because my memorIes of what happened are really blurry, but I remember a loud crack, a bang and loud rumbling. The next Thing I know is waking up in the local hospital.
From what I've been told, the corridor I walked through that day collapsed without any reason and buried 5 students beneath it. I was the only survivor.

NOw, that event didn't really help with the aforementioned pride, quite the contrary:  I convinced myself that somehow I subconsciously saved myself from the collapsing ceiling and that my surival once again showed that I was better than the others wo died.
Once I fully realized what I just thought I couldn't help but feel disgusted by myself, but this was only the beginning of my descent.
Of course I went back to university after a fEw days, since I only had some bruises and a boken finger, and that's when the prideful Thoughts became more frequently and more aggressive. Word of my survival got around pretty quickly, since it's a small university, so everyone I knew and some people I didn't know came up to me and talked like I was some kind of miracle survivor, or in some cases even a hero. And, needless to say, I absolutely loved that. I also began to notice that I began to be more condescending towards other people. Sure, I've always had my share of disrespectful thoughts about some persons but ever since the accident I sometimes said things aloud and I Always hit them where it hurt, it was pathetic to watch.

After a few weeks things started to go bacK to normal, people wouldn't talk to me that much anymore and this bothered me to no end. They wern't giving me attention anymore. Had they forgotten what I waS? Had they forgotten that I WAS SUPERIOR?
It couldn't go on like this, they needed to be reMinded, reminded of the greatness that was mE, no, IS ME!

Remember the quote from the beginning? I think it's bullshit. Because one of the greatest strengths is actually to be a good liar. And what a great liar I am – I've been lying to you all the time!
They still haven't figured out that I blew up the corridor. Still don't know that I indeed survived the collapsing corridor by an accurate calculation. 

And next time I'll be showing them my true greatness, it will be a lasting reminder.",Pride,21,nosleep
TreasureHouseofDoom,16,,62,1r396v,,13,"Channeling Aunt Lucia’s strength and wit, remarkable as both had always been, I felt myself fortified for what lay ahead, but that didn’t mean I was completely unafraid.  Fear and anxiety are nearly interchangeable in certain situations, and shedding them completely is not always the wisest approach.  Composure maintained, I dealt now with redirecting the bases of these emotions into something productive and controllable.  I remembered my mother’s fearlessness, the way she seized every opportunity to create and do good, the inner power she exuded. This I channeled, too.  Sisters in unison (one living and one passed on) to strengthen me, I was sure I carried now a shield of sorts.  Across the miles, as if she knew the battle I faced, I could almost hear my mother say, “Keep your head up, Julianne.  Stay focused.  Do good work.”  This was her mantra, and as far as I knew, it had never failed her.
Laughter rose from the study again, and I was about to step through the door, open myself to the onslaught, when I caught the fragrance of chocolate on the air, warm wafts from just beyond the door from the foyer to the hall.  I heard the voices of children, conversation and giggling, just beyond that, too.  Instinct told me this is where I was needed most.  Dulcie wanted me to follow her into the study, and in her realm, there was no telling what might happen, but Mary’s presence was just ahead of me, and it was possible I would have the opportunity to observe more of the events that had led to terrible schism between friends.
Doors shut and power out, the hall was dark, and the musty odor of rooms not allowed to breathe hung in the air.  I tried but couldn’t recall if I had smelled this odor the night before.  The chill and dank fragrance felt captive, too, as if I were stepping into some forgotten time and place.  It was completely possible that I was, that I had discovered some portal, that Mary had provided one.  Passing doors, I heard the sounds of the once living in other spaces, the turn of a music box in a nursery, the zip and knock of a trestle-powered sewing machine, probably a Singer like the one my mother used as a plant stand at home, the coos of a baby and the lullaby her Mama sang.  These memories, vital and vibrant, empowered me, too.  There was good energy about this place, and I allowed it to circulate now through me.  
Three doors I passed to either side, and I was just about to open the door to the kitchen, when a fourth door to the right opened slightly.  Through the slim space provided, I heard the singsong voice of Dulcie, coy and friendly, beckon, “Won’t you come play with us, Julianne?” In the background, the festive tones of a calliope rose and fell, and I found myself reminded suddenly of a wonderful memory from my childhood.  My siblings and I had been treated to a day at the North Carolina State Fair, where my mother had introduced us to a man she knew from antiques auctions.  He’d shown us the most glorious old calliope, and he’d had a real pet monkey named Clayton the Scoundrel.  
These are the old tricks of angry spirits, to tease some memory out of us, exploit and make it vile, distract good people from good works.  I knew this, but I longed, too, for simpler days, days when my sister, brothers, and I were among familiar people in a familiar place, days when we were too young and innocent to recognize the darkness in others.  
‘Julianne,” familiar voice from the kitchen prevailed, and as I reached for the cool brass doorknob, I knew immediately whom I would find on the other side.  
“Aunt Lucia,” tears stung my eyes, but joy filled my heart.  Three years she had been gone, on the other side, only her voice to guide me, so much more than most others ever had again of a loved one, but now she stood in front of me, poised, pretty, powerful.  Emanating from her in golden beams was the very energy she had radiated in life. “How can this be?”
Aunt Lucia’s smile was warm invitation into the kitchen.  ‘Forgive me, but I worried you wouldn’t get the fudge just right.’ And she laughed at me as others of our family often did.  I was neither a baker nor a cook, ‘but she is a Kook!’ my sister might have said.
‘These young ladies have just introduced me to Vassar fudge.’ And now I saw Mary at the island in Seth’s ultra swank kitchen measuring out white sugar.  Across from her stood Dulcie, her expression perplexed.
‘Miss Lucia, wouldn’t it all be better with more sugar and perhaps a little more cream,’ she asked, but Aunt Lucia only laughed sweetly.
‘Well, Sweet Dulcie,’ she began as if she had known Dulcie Moseley for years, ‘why don’t you tell me.  Isn’t it a Moseley who sent this recipe to you from Vassar, and didn’t she help to invent this sweet confection?’ Aunt Lucia had such a way with children always.  ‘Never ask a yes or no question,’ she had often told me. ‘Always engage a child.  If necessary be wrong so that they may be right.’ I remembered this as she winked at me over Dulcie’s golden head.
‘Well, no, Ma’am. My Aunt Mae did send this, but she isn’t a Moseley; she’s a Baker, on my mother’s side,’ and she and Mary burst into laughter as if her aunt’s being a Baker who sends fudge recipes was just about the funniest thing they’d ever heard.
‘Or she could be a Boiler or a Cook,’ Mary giggled.  I watched in some awe as the two girls exchanged looks of pure love, deep respect, and as my Aunt mitigated whatever memory might endanger this momentary union. 
Now she turned to me, expression earnest, voice so soft I practically had to read her lips to understand her words. ‘Mary is a pip and an angel, but there’s deep sorrow about her, and Dulcie really is a sweet girl, good and kind, but the anger that rages in her spirit is pure fire. You must handle this all very carefully, cautiously, and you mustn’t lose either your temper or your control.’
This was the way of the women in my family.  Always they’d presume that the younger women were ready for anything, too, that we could accomplish anything we set our minds to, that our minds over matters-at-hand would suffice.
“How did I get myself into this mess,” I said out loud, and Aunt Lucia raised finely sculpted eyebrows, as if to ask, ‘You mean you don’t know?’ and suddenly I was reminded of the walk through the cemetery, the prank gone too far, the Ouija board I’d promised my mother I’d never used.
‘How you came to be in the middle of this is no longer the issue. What matters is how you plan to get yourself out.’ And her insistence that I must disengage myself only after my promise to Mary was satisfied was implicit.  There really was no other way.  Now she only mouthed without even a hint of whisper, ‘Don’t bring home any hitchhikers,’ and I understood her warning.  There are people who live their lives under the shadows of dark, sad spirits, hitchhikers who will never find their paths home. To be under such shadow would be detriment not only to me but also to anyone who loved me.
“But what do I do?” I asked Aunt Lucia.  And perhaps some answer would have come if only I had been strong enough to hold this lively memory open longer.  Instead, I felt the collapse of these exhausted spirits in front of me, and in moments the vision in the kitchen they had never known had faded.  Only red and black trim against the swank white and stainless of the kitchen Seth’s mother had designed remained, or so I thought at first, but as I investigated more closely, I found the buttery print of a child’s right hand smudged where Dulcie had stood only moments before. Moving closer to it, I thought about tearing a paper towel from the roll that stood upright just beside the sink to press it down for some evidence of this impossible reality, when suddenly it combusted to tiny flames and the sizzle against the stainless island carried the salty tingle of tears.
The nature of my gift is such that I cannot press spirits to reveal themselves, and even if I could, I don’t believe I ever would.  Instinct dictates that as little engagement as possible is always the best mode, and it’s a rule by which I live my life whenever possible.  But I knew I’d have to take a more proactive stance to accomplish what we all—Mary, Dulcie, and I—needed, and for that I’d have to examine the house. 
I thought back to the night before, almost literally decades ago considering the journey along which these girls had brought me, and the things Seth had told me about the house.  I knew, for instance, that his father had discovered a secret compartment in the study, that old photos and tintypes had been stored in the tin handkerchief box found in the wardrobe that stood in his parents’ room, that the hall was part of an elaborate addition to join the kitchen to the rest of the house, and that the Ouija board was strictly taboo in the Jefferies household, just as it would have been in mine. I knew, too, that the kitchen was not built in 1870 when the house had been, and that the original kitchen must have stood just past the rock wall in the farthest portion of the back yard.  I did not, however, know where the Ouija board had come from originally, and now I wondered if it had been in the house when the Jefferies had moved in or if it had come into the house with them.
I’d have to go to the study to begin my investigation.  The notion sickened and worried me, but I gathered myself for the inevitable.  My mother had long taught me that the most direct way to gain protection from spirits that might harm you was to go to the Big Guy himself.  Some might laugh at this, but faith was and still is much more than a crutch for me, and anyone who believes in the fires of Hell must embrace the comforts of Heaven, too.  Opening the door to the study, I pushed it open so that the door knob bounced lightly against a chair just to the left of it.  Colder air pushed into the space right in front of me, and I shivered as if I were outside in a snowstorm.  Dulcie was here now, I knew, and she had been waiting for me.  

“Our Father who art in Heaven,” I began, voice bold and strong, “Hallowed be Thy name,” The chandelier above the Dr Jefferies broad mahoghany desk swayed slightly at first and then began to spin from the center, reminding me of the whirl-a-round at the park. “Thy Kingdom Come, Thy will be done—” 
And now Dulcie laughed with much more depth than a child might have, cold echo of the anger that was eating away her soul, interrupted to say, “I’m not the Devil, Julianne. I’m only a little girl, afterall.”
And I strengthened myself for the tantrum I felt welling in her, “On Earth as it is in Heaven.”
“Look at me, Julianne.” And it was all I could do to not make direct eye contact with her, but I did see that she was as pretty in what came close to flesh as she had been in the picture, innocent and sweet looking, and completely mesmerizing in her charming presentation. If I had not known what I did, if I could not recognize the hate that burned her from the inside out, I would have reached to hold her, stroked her golden ringlets, played dolls or drawn with her just as I would have my own little sister, but there was no denying the tenacious embers of her eyes, even as I avoided contact with them.
“Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us,” And now her laughter was maniacal, sad and laughing all at the same time.
“‘Forgive us our trespasses’,” she mocked, “and who is the trespasser here?” The question hovered between us and then seemed to take on an energy all its own as the accessories on Dr Jefferies desk and the loose items throughout the room rose and began to spin as if convection of Dulcie’s anger moved them.
“Lead us not into Temptation,” I continued, spirit emboldened with every word of the prayer I had known by heart ever since I had been a toddler, “but deliver us from Evil—“
And Dulcie’s angry laughter swelled to a cackle that rattled the house, but then it fell, too, as the little girl so consumed by anger became increasingly exhausted as I continued, “for Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, Forever and Ever. Amen.”
I knew the entities that had exploited Dulcie’s sorrow and loneliness were not dormant and would not give up so easily.  Stronger now, I added, “Dear Heavenly Father, Give me strength for the challenges I face, and cast all unkind, mischievous, or evil spirits from my presence.  Wrap me in your loving arms to protect and fortify me.  I ask these things in your name. Amen.”
And now the room became silent, its energy subdued, and the objects that had spun around me lowered then settled in relative proximity to where they had been to start.  I breathed deep solace and was happy to find new warmth about the room and to detect the spicy scent of candles burned perhaps days ago in the air.  For the time being, this was a study almost like any other.  Now I set my task to discovering its every secret free from interruption for awhile.

Spudz_OCD,6,,5,1rgcw5,,10,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

irinax0,6,,2,1rcop2,,12,"First part [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qzk7i/who_is_this_woman/)

So I approached her because what my grandmother told me just wasn't enough. 

She was in the park, on a bench with anther woman.

I said hi, and at first I started just saying random stuff like the commenting on the weather and such things, but then I decided to ask what I want to know. I asked her if I can talk to her about it, and the other woman excused herself.

I asked her a lot of questions, but basically all she told me was that if I really am not Magdalena, she can't tell me all those things.
Though she said if I am her, and she finds it out, then I'll be sorry for lying, because a deal's a deal and you just can't run from it. She said she'll know if I'm lying to her because she always knows. I
 was pretty scared so I tried explaining to her that I really, really, REALLY am NOT my great-grandmother, but she told me ""Don't bother"", and explained to me that if I AM Magdalena, she'll know. ""How will you know?"" ""I'll be.. seeing you around.. so I'll know easily."" Creepy, stalker-ish, creepy.

I asked HOW could I be Magdalena - it's been a LONG time. Even if she was alive she'd be OLD. But she just giggled and wouldn't explain. ""Can't tell you now. You'll probably find out one day. Actually, it may be very soon"".
I wouldn't stop asking and making remarks at how impossible it is, but she just said ""It happens. And she wouldn't be the only one, you know"".

And in the end, she said something like ""Let's say I believe you - but if you are lying... We're friends, but that doesn't mean you can just forget a deal. A deal is still a deal even if we're friends. And you're not being a friend right now."" 
I tried to say I'm NOT lying, I was like ""I'm not.."", but she cut me off , ""Just in case."", she said and then got up and  started just walking away, but she came back and said, almost laughing ""I was on the bench first, you're the one that should go now"". 
So  I got up and as I was leaving, after I said ""Bye"", she said ""Bye bye... IRINA."", with an eyebrow raised and a smirk. As in ""I know it's not Irina but whatever I'll say it for now."" Like if someone says ""He's just a friend"" and then you'd say ""Sure... FRIEND"". That kind of tone.

I'm not sure if I should be afraid.
I mean she didn't do anything to me and she doesn't seem to even want to anything to ME as me, as in really me, not Magdalena, but it's still creepy. Especially the ""I'll be seeing you around"" part. That's basically ""I'll be looking at you"". Kinda scares me.

dws7rf,3,,7,1r8d9t,,10,"I was reading posts today and was reminded of something that happened to me when I was a kid.  

It was an average summer day and I was somewhere in my mid to low teens (couldn't drive yet).  Since it was summertime school was out and like most kids I spent it with friends doing whatever seemed like a good idea at the time.  Usually we would go play in the woods or ride our bikes around.  

That day I decided to call up one of my friends and see if he wanted to hang out.  So I picked up the phone and to my astonishment the line was dead.  I didn't think much of it because I figured maybe they were working on the lines around my house or something.  His house wasn't very far from mine (only a mile or two) so I decided to just ride my bike over and see him.

When leaving my house the first thing that surprised me was that I didn't see any people or cars around.  It was summer in a residential neighborhood so there should have been kids out playing and people going about their daily lives.  Again it seemed like a coincidence.  As I was riding I remember thinking it was eerily quiet.  There was no wind that day which is odd enough in and of itself but the air seemed almost stagnant.

Being a kid it didn't seem like much of a problem and at the time it just seemed like a small thing.  What I remember most now is that not only were there no people going about their daily business but there was not a single sound from nature.  I could hear my bike tires on the road and the sound of the crank and my own breathing but there were no other sounds.  No birds, no dogs, no chirping or buzzing of insects.

I got to my friends house and knocked on the door. 

Nothing.  

I knocked again.  

Nothing.

That was just plain odd.  He had several other siblings and even though his parents worked, I remember thinking that there should have been at least one of them there.  At that point I decided that something was definitely off.  I rode my bike back to my house as quickly as I could and went up to my room and shut the door.  Several hours later my sister came home from work and I went down to talk to her.  She asked how my day was and I couldn't bring myself to tell her about the strange events of the afternoon because I figured that it must have all been a coincidence and I was reading too much into it.  I went outside and everything seemed normal.  Wind blowing, kids playing, dogs barking.  To this day I never figured out what was going on but it was like someone turned a switch and turned off everything but me and then flipped it back and everything was back to normal.  Never though much about it until I started reading /nosleep.  Maybe someone else has an idea of what went on.",The day with no sounds.,17,nosleep

Jonathon and Katie, both 22 years old, broke up two weeks ago. ""Boredom,"" as Katie would put it, is the reason for her diminishing interest in Jonathon.

Jonathon still loves Katie.  Jonathon misses Katie; he didn't want to break-up.  He still looks at her with the same eyes he had when they started dating at the age of sixteen. Jonathon is struggling with the break-up. He's depressed and has called in sick at work four days in the last two weeks. Today is one of his sick days.

He lies in his bed, it's 11:57am.  He stares at the ceiling, wondering what Katie is doing.  Wondering when, or if she will take him back.  He loves Katie, but he can't help but feel anger towards her too.  How could she do this to him?  After all they have been through together, she ends it... because she is bored?  There must be another reason.  

*She must be seeing someone else.*

Jonathon snaps out of his internal back-and-forth and sits up in his bed.  He sighs and turns his head to look in the mirror. 

*I haven't shaved in a week.  Katie doesn't like it when I neglect shaving.*  

He slowly steps out of bed, stands, and looks blankly at his bedroom wall.  His attention is captured the moment he receives a text-message.  Reluctantly thinking it could be Katie, he quickly grabs his phone.  

*It's Katie!*

""We need to talk.  1:30 this afternoon at McAlister's Coffee?  It's important.""

 *This might be my last real opportunity to convince Katie that the break-up was a bad idea. Not too eager though...* 

He slows his thumbs from tapping like an Irish river-dancer, and slyly replies, ""Sure. Sounds good.""  He looks in the mirror once again and smiles. His first genuine smile in two weeks.  

*Now to shave.*

Jonathon shaves, showers, puts on his most decent clothes and decides it would be a worthy gesture to stop by the supermarket for flowers before meeting Katie.  

*Katie always loved it when I bought her flowers.  This will remind her of the good times.*

It's 1:15pm and Jonathon is driving to McAlister's Coffee.  He is nervous and excited.  He hasn't seen Katie in nine days.  

He pulls up to the coffee shop five minutes early and decides to sit in his car until 1:32pm. 

*Not too eager.* 

At 1:29pm, Katie comes out of the coffee shop looking emotionally distraught.  She sits on a bench located in front of the coffee shop.  She notices Jonathon's car and perks up, wondering why he is just sitting.

*Shit.  Now she thinks I am being flaky.*

A whole three minutes too early, he reaches for his flowers and gets out of his car.  He smiles at Katie and makes his way across the parking lot.  Katie gets up from the bench and meets Jonathon halfway.  

""I don't really want coffee.""  Katie admits to Jonathon.

With his most charming smile he replies, ""Oh? Why are we here then?  What did what you need to tell me that is so important?"" 

""I... went on a date last night.""

Jonathon's charming smile slowly turned into a subtle frown. ""You did...?  With who?""

""That's... not important.""  Katie's eyes began to swell as she looked into Jonathon and hugged him.
""I made a mistake. My night made me realize what a fool I have been. How can you ever forgive me?"" 

Katie pulls away to look into Jonathon's eyes once more.  Jonathon wipes her tears away and with the truest smile says, ""Katie, I love you.  Of course I forg...""

The noise begins...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

...

...

...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**


Jonathon, Katie and everyone around them grimace, grab their ears for cover and look to the sky.


**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

...

...

...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

Cars in the street stop dead in place and their operators look out of their windows, wondering where the sound is coming from.

Katie looks at Jonathon with a fear he has never seen in her. ""Jon! What is that!?""

Jon's knees give out.  As he falls to the parking lot, the loud ambient chatter goes silent. The only noise he hears is the sound of the rustling wind and the brushing of leaves on the ground.  He tries to stand up but he can't.  He tries to comfort Katie from the ground, but he can't make a sound.  Katie is standing completely still in place, as though a mannequin.

*What the fuck is going on? KATIE! KATIE! CAN YOU HEAR ME?*

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

...

...

...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

Jonathon, locked in an upward looking position, sees it.

He sees where the noise is coming from.

He notices a wet stain overwhelm the outside of Katie's jeans.  

*She must see it too.*

Everyone around him is paralyzed, but he feels their fear. He feels their need to run, but they can't.

He realizes these are his final moments, he tries one last time to speak.  Though only thoughts are allowed.

*I love you Katie... I love you.*

He sees the first person launch violently into the air, then the second, the third.  It's his turn.  He's jerked in the air in the direction of the anomaly.  The last thing he sees is Katie.  She is the last thing he wants to see.

bebadhavefun,2,,4,1r3ema,,11,"Hey guys, well, I'm a new user but I've been reading NoSleep for about a year now, though I never felt like sharing my ""supernatural"" experiences until now. In time, I'll post more, but I feel the need to start with something that brings tears to my eyes to this day.

It was mid-2011 and I was on my winter break, my mother was working her night shift and I was alone in the house with my little brother (who was 7 years old at the time). 

At around 1 AM, I started to feel sleepy so I turned off the computer and headed to the bathroom to grab some toilet paper in case my flu got worse during the night. 

As soon as I get to the bathroom I notice two things: The first, outside it was raining incredibly hard and the second, the dog had followed me to the bathroom and was whining softly while he waited for me to come out. Being a recently adopted dog (We've had him for a week or so back then) I didn't think much of it, ""Maybe he's afraid of the rain"" I thought as I headed out and closed the door.

That was when I saw it. A couple of meters to my left, through the half open door that leads to the garden, something that made me question my sanity. 

It was a...creature, I guess. Taller than the door frame, covered in thick light brown hair that walked in two feet. I saw it for a split second before it hid behind the wall. I thought I was hallucinating -even though I've never been skeptical- so my first impulse was to open the door to see what the hell was that. It was the moment my dog got in the way between me and the door, shaking, whining and showing his teeth at me to keep me away. As I said, we hadn't had Morrison for too long and I didn't want to get bitten, so I backed off to the kitchen trying to wrap my head around what was going on. 

Suddenly, the sound of scratching on the walls made me jump. It seemed to come from everywhere and Morrison started barking at this. I made him shut up and, in desperation, I grabbed the biggest knife I found in a drawer and stayed there in the middle of the kitchen, shaking because of the cold and the situation I was.

The scratching faded in the rain and for a moment, I thought everything was alright. That until the door swung open and slammed back shut, making me jump and run to get the hell out of there and lock myself in my brother's room with the dog, still holding the knife tightly. 

I remember hearing soft ""bangs"" on the door outside that started to get louder and louder each time and I just covered my ears, praying to anyone who could hear me for it to stop. But it didn't.

When it became too much for me, I gained enough courage to go outside and put a couple of chairs against the door just in case. When I came back inside leaving every light in the house on, a few minutes passed by before I heard a loud bang outside the room. I knew that, whatever it was, was trying to get inside, so I opened the bedroom door and looked down the hallway: The chairs I had put against the door were knocked down and the door was wide open. I could only shake my head in disbelief as I came back to sit on the edge of my brother's bed holding the knife -that seemed to be useless by then-.

I don't know at which point I fell asleep, but my mother woke me up at around 8 in the morning and asked why wasn't I in my room and what was all the mess with the chairs in the hallway. I told her, she didn't believe me and I'm pretty sure I'll never know what the hell was that thing.

PS: Sorry about any mistakes on the writing of this story, english is not my first language. 
",I'll never know.,15,nosleep
IntricateVenom,9,,5,1r2dyl,,11,"I've known that I have had this ability since I was six. Actually it all started when I was six.

I can see spirits. I see them sometimes like normal people, but they have a sort of ""glimmer"" to them. In all of my encounters I have never been to speak to one, but they don't need to; their expressions tell me all I need to know.

As I said, this all started at the age of six. My mother and I moved into an old house that was built in the 1910's. There was another house next to it that was a complete mirror image of the one I lived in. The history was that the houses were built by two twins. One twin was a good man, while the other had a sadistic side. He was a murderer and he alone had killed around 6 people in his house (which was the one I lived next to). To this day, around 20 people have been murdered in that house.

Anyway one night I was in my room staring at the ceiling (I have insomnia so it's quite hard for me to sleep) when suddenly, I got this immense feeling of anger and fury. However, the feeling wasn't coming from my house, or even from myself, but the house next door. I got out of bed and looked out the window and I will never forget what I saw.

Staring out of the window across from me was a man who had to be in his late 40's. His face was contorted into a meanful scowl. He was wearing old tattered clothes. He was staring right at me; right into my very soul. Then, almost instantly, he vanished. I started to cry really loud and eventually my mom came running in. I told her what had happened but she didn't really believe me.

Fast forward to 16. I've been seeing spirits all the time but only when I'm ""tuned in"". This is the best way I can describe it. Its almost like tuning a radio to the right channel. I've found that once I ""tune in"" I can see spirits in all kinds of forms and shapes. However, one night when I was 16, I found that i can see more than spirits.

When I was 16 my friend and I were big into the paranormal and we liked to go to graveyards and such to see what we can find. On this day we decided to go to one of the most haunted graveyards in our state - Dice Roads Cemetary. There have been lots of people encountering things there so we decided to go. 

Apon arriving there, I become overwelmed with a sense of dread, sorrow, anger, sadness and everything inbetween. Besides that it looked pretty normal. We did some walking, some voice recording, normal shit, and finally we were standing outside the car talking when it happened. It was around 3 in the morning when I saw a shadow move. I clicked on the flashlight and moved it over to that spot, yet nothing was there. I decided at this point to tune in and see what I could find. When I was certain I was tuned in, I opened my eyes and immediately wished I hadn't. 

In the graveyard floating were a pair of blood red eyes and they were staring right at me. They were full of hatred, scorn, and just pure evil. Time seemed to have stopped and I just kept staring at those eyes. I couldn't look away. Then, all of a sudden, they rushed forward with lighning speed, out of the graveyard, and directly through me. What happened next is a bit fuzzy. I remember feeling all sorts of emotions and having many intricate thoughts. Then everything goes black. The next thing I know, I awake to find my friend knelt down next to me shaking me. He said that I had uttered one word before i fell. 

Destroy.

The entire ride back i was physically sick to the stomach and had a massive headache.I've never gone back to that place and never will. I'm 17 now, and Ive gotten a lot better at controlling what I see. 

These are only two of the many stories I have to share, but I felt these were thew most important. I just wish that I could forget some of the things I've seen. I also hope others are like me and see where I'm coming from. I'm going to keep working on it, and use this ability to possibly help othersw in the future. ",My Ability,16,nosleep

Hi everyone.

First off, I owe everyone who read and commented my story my deepest gratitude.  I still haven't been able to tell anyone about last weekend's events in person.  Lately its easier to look others in the eye, and I even enjoyed a buritto the other day, but I still can't bring myself to actually *say* what happened.

Yesterday, after reading everyone's comments I made my decision. u/GeneralJiblet, u/BraveGoldHeart, and u/Explodingtaoster01 really got me thinking (and all of those who contributed helped; just knowing I'm not alone was a relief), and most importantly I realized that I'm not powerless in this.  What I do will be *my* choice; on my terms.

I'm not sure how to explain it, but the moment my mind was made up a deep, zen-like calm came over me.  Almost instantly after the thought crossed my mind it felt like a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders; I have you all to thank for that.   

__________________________________________________________________________________

I do, however, need more support from you guys.  Like I've iterated before, I just can't talk about this to my friends or family.  I had some episodes and struggled with depression (doesn't everyone at some point?) a few years back, and I just worry they might think I've finally snapped if I start talking about “aliens” and stuff.

Anyways, I need your input.  I'm sure there's rational explanations for this stuff...so if you guys feel the need to talk some sense into me; *please* do.

Like I said, its like a weight's been lifted from my shoulders. That night; last night was the first time I've slept since the weekend. Today-and this is what has me *unsettled*- my tattoos are...almost disappearing. They've faded a ton, literally overnight. 

These aren't that old, and even the newest ones are just...washing away? They're silly but substantial tats from back in college when I was in the Coast Guard Reserves...and I swear I hadn't noticed a change just a few days ago. The blacks, blues, reds...they're all fading.

I've also had almost a dozen nose bleeds. I know its November; its getting colder out and the air is dry...its just that this many has me...*worried*. I almost fee like I *should* be more concerned, but I'm unable to focus any any train of thought for more than a few moments.  I'm sure its because of how little sleep I had been getting.

Even now, just typing this has me feeling light headed. I'll probably lay down, the glare from the computer screen is hurting my eyes and putting a slight red tint to my vision.  

Thanks again guys.  You have no idea how *truly* comforting it is knowing I'm not alone.

SprightlyMonkey,2,,7,1r98ph,,10,"Most people, no matter what their age, can't really remember many things before the age of 4, barely anyone can remember most of their life before the age of 10. I know that my earliest living memory was when I was 3, when my younger brother was born. It's odd that, after it all, of all the things I could've remembered, it's that which is stuck in my mind. When, after it all, I was left with but a notepad with three notes. A URL, an address, and some jottings. And thus, I take it upon myself to inform you of all that I've learned in these past few hours.

I don't really know who I am any more. I'm a tall, gangly male with long black hair, and the only name I have to go on is the pseudonym I'm using to convey this message. I know that, once, I was interested in psychology and philosophy. These things mixed together to form a fondness for one thing in particular. I slowly became obsessed with working out how memories worked, why we had them and how they formed. Of course, you have the scientific answers, but thinking back, they don't really provide you with much explanation. Very, very few people, if any, can remember their birth, perhaps the single most important events of your entire life, and barely anyone can remember it. Don't you think it odd, that whilst we remember inconsequential things like our first tooth falling out, or how you grazed your knee when falling off your bike, you can't remember being born? People will put it down to a theory called ""Childhood Amnesia"", where adults find it difficult to recall early memories, as children haven't got fully developed limbic systems. But how come there are exceptions to this rule?

Of course, the answer is I don't know. Or, more, rather (as horribly ironic as it is), I forgot. I know that I did research this, I did a load of it. In as much detail as I could. It was a personal project of mine, one I know I'd been working on for a long time. Again, God knows how long, I forgot that too. It all feels like an eternity ago now, considering I've forgotten it all. I suppose that it's my own fault, considering I brought myself into this, I went perusing into areas one should've left untouched, as far as this transcript can tell me. And that has landed me deeper in whatever mire I find myself in than I can assume most others ever have. And that scares me. Not because I fear for my life, definitely not. I am literally nothing now, with nothing to my name but this notebook and what I am writing here. 

I suppose you want to know what the jottings are. Well, they're in two parts. The first parts are like stage directions, with little annotations in handwriting I can only assume is my own, describing the setting (presumably so I can find my way back there). The second part, is a statement. A saying, or a speech or something. So without further ado, I shall do my best to relay this script.

I am sat at a bench at my local green. It's a cold, dark winters evening, with heavy air hanging over me. Across from me, stands a man, who is much better equipped for the cold than I. He's wearing a large overcoat, with the collar rolled up around his cheeks, and a small hat stuck atop his presumably bald head. He looks about 40, the only reason I can tell being the soft amber hue from his cigarette, betraying his wrinkles, lined with a rushed stubble, with awkward tufts slightly bushier than the rest. The wisps keep rising up and obscuring my view of his glassy eyes. If I didn't know any better, I would've said he had been crying, but that's silly. He stands a good inch or so higher than me, and makes an effort not to slouch. Whenever he speaks to me, he addresses me very carefully and politely, referring to me as ""Sir"" or ""Mister"" and making sure to annunciate every syllable as if a single mistake would betray him. This makes his speech slow, but not staggered, he has no difficulty in speaking properly, but he is deliberately taking care. He isn't particularly stocky, but nor is he lanky. He's a perfect medium. He's addressing me, gesturing for me to approach him. He's ushering me on now, waving his hand as if to say for me to fall in behind him. I do so. He's leading me to a flat. (the address is written here, but for your protection I shan't be putting it in until I can confirm it's safety). It's very well kept. 5 rooms. All doors are shut.
He's gone into the room straight ahead of the sofa I'm sat on, shutting the door behind him. I'm not sure how, but I don't think he noticed this.

This next part, is not in the same handwriting as above. It's very intricate, certainly whoever wrote it took their time. There are, however, mistakes. Very obvious mistakes, but I cannot figure out what they're for. I think that that may be why I am writing to you now, to see if you can assist me.

I truly wish I could reward your innovation, I honestly do. In as many years, I have desired a chase such as this. Something I can truly be proud of. 
If you remember one thing, which is highly unlikely, I want it to be that your childhood is something you have to keep. Once it's lost, it's lost.
The infinite possibilities of a child's mind, is often labelled as immature, but tell me, can an adult construct a story from but a pen, paper and some squiggles? Do we consider men like Picasso to be immature, and simple-minded? How can something so infinite, and yet so delicate, be incomplete? You mislabel it as immaturity, when in fact childlike wonder is a blessing. A blessing, lost to age, because it no longer ""suits"" you. It doesn't ""fit"" the world you're entering. That is why you are stripped of it. We act, simply as you ask.

JustAnotherLondoner,1,,9,1r8zg3,,10,"Last year, my brother Liam fell ill and took himself to hospital. He wasn't insanely ill, but due to the fact that he kept fainting and falling into things, he felt the hospital was the safest place for himself to be. After an examination, he was told that an ear infection was causing his balance to be off and him to faint. They kept him in for observation until he stopped fainting and would be safe at home alone. 

He told me that the first night he couldn't sleep. The man in the bed next to him would groan throughout the night in agony. He didn't know what was wrong with him, but it was too late for a nice chat, so he remained silent. 

The second night wasn't much different, but Liam managed to sleep for a few hours, from about 3am until around 10am. He hadn't faint for a while and felt he was getting a lot better, hoping that he would be able to go home soon.

Later that day, the man in the bed next to him awoke. 

""Hi, I'm Jim."" He introduced himself. ""What are you in for?"". My brother explained his ear infection and that he had fainted and fallen into things, and asked why Jim was here.

""Well..."" He began. ""I don't really know. I was only in here for a broken leg initially. Then I fell ill. I think they're keeping me here.""

""What? How?"" Liam asked. 

""When I was close to recovery, I told the nurses that I felt ready to go home. Later that night, I woke up to see a nurse leaving my bed. She didn't see me, but I noticed that my leg felt funny. I think she did something to it. I don't know what... but the next day I fell terribly ill with pneumonia. This was nearly a week ago, and i'm still here, not getting much better. Don't tell them when you're ready to go home... just go."" His face was dead serious. 

Liam was a bit worried about Jim's story, but assumed he was a bit crazy and paranoid about the nurses. He ignored Jim's advice and told the nurse that he was ready to go home. He felt the disappointed gaze of Jim fall upon him as the nurse walked away.

""Well... Good luck."" Jim sighed. ""I hope they let you out."" 

""Thanks."" Liam replied. The nurse later returned and confirmed that the doctor would look at his ears the following day. 

That night, Liam had another restless night. Jim was groaning again, but Liam was beginning to grow used to that. 

Suddenly the groaning stopped. The silence of the night was instead met with the screams of Jim.

""AARGHH. STOP. GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME. DONT YOU DARE PUT THAT NEEDLE NEAR ME. FUCK OFF!"" the curtain was closed around him. Liam couldn't see what was going on. He was too scared to speak. 

The curtain swiped open. Liam pretended to be asleep, his eyes slightly open. He saw a nurse leave Jim's bed. Jim was laying in his bed, holding his legs. 

""A..Are you okay?"" Liam whispered. ""What the fuck just happened?"" 

""I told you, man. The nurses are keeping me here. They saw that I was getting better again and she just stuck a fucking needle in my leg again. I'm not getting out of here any time soon."" Jim replied. He revealed his leg to Liam - there was a small hole with blood dripping out of it. He had indeed been injected with something. 

Liam laid down in shock. Jim decided that now the attack was over, it was safe to sleep. 

When Liam awoke the following morning, Jim was gone. Liam asked a nurse where Jim was, and the nurse apologetically replied 

""Mr Morris passed away late last night"". How could that be? He was well enough to hold a conversation with Liam just hours earlier to his apparent death. The injection. It must have been the injection. 

I visited Liam later that day and he told me of the events. He begged me to sign him out and get him home that day. He was desperate. He was not in safe hands there, after all. I tried to sign him out, but the doctor assured me that it was in the best interest to stay one more night to ensure the infection had completely cleared. I reluctantly agreed. 

I visited again the next day and Liam was in a terrible state. He was pale, his face was sweaty. He even had a temperature... he was in a much worse state to what I had seen him like the day before. The doctor told me it was just a side affect of the medicine they had given him. Liam told me otherwise. 

""They attacked me, Kate. That's the only way i can describe it... I was pretending to sleep late last night and a nurse came in. She rolled me over, and prepared my leg for an injection. You know what they do, they wipe it with some sort of liquid. I startled her when I asked her what she was doing. She told me it was 'just procedure'. I asked her to stop and said that i'd rather not have the treatment. She got aggressive. Called another nurse. One held me down while she injected me. I screamed but nobody came. Now all of a sudden I'm ill. I'm not getting out of here, Kate. I'm going to die in this bed. Just like Jim."" He began rocking back and forth as I tried to comfort him. He was soaked with sweat. 

I asked his doctor what was wrong with him, and the doctor told me it was pneumonia. My heart sunk. It was just like Jim. Liam was right - he wasn't safe here. I needed to get him out. 

""I'll be back tomorrow to get you out of here"" I told Liam. ""They won't let me today... and now that they have a clue that I want to get you out, they're all watching me. I was almost escorted out when I shouted at the doctor. Tomorrow I can do it quietly, when i'm not being watched so closely."" Liam agreed. 

The following day I returned to the hospital. Liam told me the nurse had not returned that night. I put him in a wheelchair and took him to the toilets. I gave him some clothes that I had collected from his apartment and he changed. I asked a nurse to bring me any belongings he had left with the desk, stating that he had asked me to take them home for him. The nurse agreed and brought me his things without a word. We escaped and I took him home. Before leaving, we slyly stole the 'sign out' clip board, and Liam was able to sign it. He was legally free. 

Three days later Liam was found dead in his apartment. The pneumonia had gotten worse and, without treatment, took his life. He left a note. It read: 

""I was taken into the hospital with an ear infection. I left without said ear infection, but with bigger problems. I was abused. I have made a realization; either the secret injections being given are procedures to keep population down, or, they are ways to make medicine companies money. After all, they make money through our illness - they don't really want us to recover. I would not advise anyone who is not dying to stay in a hospital - definitely not alone. There, you will never truly be in safe hands.""

AfterYourHeart,0,,11,1r7cv5,,7,"This is an update from: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r1po8/dead_ends/)

Ok! I have a little bit of time. I’m not sure when they’ll be back so I have to be careful.

That day, the day Pugsley died, Joe and I talked about it after Sophia had gone to bed. He swore he didn’t leave the window open. He always had an encyclopedic memory, remembering the tiniest little things about just about everything, so I believed him. I know I didn’t open the window. I also know that when I left to pick up Sophia, I had to un-deadbolt the front door. Joe quickly went down to check the back door. Also locked. We decided to just drop it and we went to sleep. If I remember correctly, I didn’t sleep well that night.

I wish Joe would come visit me. They said I could have visitors occasionally if I was well behaved. It sure does get lonely in here. I mean, there are others, but man do they have issues! I’d rather just keep to myself. At least I have my art. They even let me try to sell it, well rather, they let an art gallery try to sell them, and occasionally someone buys one. I plan on putting these letters in the back of one whenever this is finished. Hey! Maybe that’s how you’re reading this. If so, thank you for buying my art. I hope you enjoy it.

I remember the day I painted my daughter’s eighth birthday portrait. I had never tried such a thing before, but she was so beautiful that I had to at least try. Her hair was blonde and getting quite long. She liked to straighten it. She had the look that screamed head cheerleader, queen bee, but I always hoped she grow up to be a scientist, or an engineer. She was so smart. With her smile, she could get away with murder. She was missing a few teeth at the time, and a few more were still growing back. That just made her even cuter. Looking at her was like looking into the heart of your childhood. She always made me feel young. I loved going on adventures with her.

The day I painted her, I needed her to sit still for a while, and I wanted to try and make it fun for her. I wanted to paint her smiling, not bored out of her mind. The first step was music. She loved music and she loved to sing. She was pretty good at it too. Then I came up with a great idea. I got her her own easel, canvas, and paints, and figured we could paint together. I’d help her figure out what she wanted to paint and get her started, and then I’dl paint her.

Just thinking about that day helps me almost remember what it’s like to be happy. We had so much fun. We listened to music, sang and danced a bit, painted (she decided to paint me back), and talked about just about everything. She told me all about her new school and the friends she was making. She was such a people person. People were drawn to her and always wanted to be around her. Looking at her, it astounded me how quickly she was growing. When did she get so tall?

At the end of the day we did our reveal. I showed her my painting and she showed me hers. I have to admit, I was pretty impressed by hers. Looks like “artist” could be added to the list of things she could be when she grew up. We decided we’d hang them together in the hallway once they had dried. I wasn’t quite ready for the day to be over, so after we cleaned up, I took her out to eat.

Joe got home after Sophia’s bedtime. I proudly took him to the spare room to show off our paintings. I turned on the light and Joe laughed. I screamed. I explained to Joe that I didn’t do this. That when Sophia and I had gone to dinner, it was just a normal portrait. That someone else must’ve come in and painted over the original painting, altering it. He stood silently, staring at me for a moment. Like he was trying to figure out if this was some kind of weird prank. He then kissed me on the forehead, told me we would figure this out later, and went to watch a movie. After he walked away I turned back to look at the painting.

Whoever had done it had blackened out her eyes. They had also paled her skin, and given her deep circles under her eyes. It reminded me of a picture I had seen when I looked up black-eyed kids. I made the mistake of looking it up at work, and the picture had stunned me so badly, that I immediately drew all the blinds and curtains in the place and covered all the windows. I am usually not that much of a chicken, but for some reason that picture had a serious effect on me, and now there I was staring at my daughter, turned into a black-eyed kid. 

I quickly destroyed the painting. I never showed it to Sophia. She had been so excited to see a painting of herself. The next few days were her scheduled days to stay at her dad’s, so I decided to try to repaint it. The duplicate was pretty good. Not quite as good as the original, but it was pretty close.

The next morning, I went to check on the duplicate and it had been ripped to shreds. I showed Joe, but he shook it off. This time he was convinced that it was some kind of joke. He swore he wasn’t falling for it. Then he went off to work. I sat and cried for a while, burned the painting, and tried one last time. This time I hid the painting, and this time the painting stayed safe.

Ok. It’s almost meds time. I better hide this again. I hate the meds they give me. They make me feel so weird. I don’t even know what day it is anymore.
",Dead Ends,18,nosleep
NightOfTheLlamas,4,,8,1r6rmn,,11,"There are few things that drive me mad. I don’t even understand why they get me so worked up in the first place. I’m not OCD or anything of the sort. It’s just that I can’t stand things such as the sliding door when it is open. It should be closed at all times. The door is just a small problem compared to my shower. It drips. 

At first I could turn the shower handle and the dripping would come to an end. It was inconvenient at times because I would stop whatever I was doing to shut up the *drip, drip, drip.* Sometimes my food would burn slightly or I would miss a phone call cause I was busy pushing around the handle to end the sound. I really don’t mind though because it ended that cursed dripping and that’s all that really matters to me. 

It got worse. When I turned the handle to end the sounds it would start up again randomly later. I would be watching Netflix or reading a good book when I hear *drip, drip, drip.* It doesn’t ever end. All through the day the shower leaks water out in a steady rhythmic beat. It drives me crazy. 

After a week or so I couldn’t handle the sounds anymore. I couldn’t handle the *drip, drip, drip.* I bought a new shower head thinking that would solve the problem. After setting it up I blew out a breath of relief. The dripping would finally end now. I ate dinner that night happy. I closed the open sliding door before settling myself on the couch with my laptop. I was on Netflix and about half way through my show I heard something. *Drip, drip, drip.* Covering my ears with my hands didn’t stop the sounds from making their way to my brain. I could still hear it. 

I tried everything I could think of. I called the plumber but that did nothing. I wrapped a rag around the shower head. That worked until the rag started to drip from all of it’s water build up. I also took the rag and placed it at the bottom of the shower hoping that it would mute the dripping sounds. This worked yet it didn’t. I could no longer hear the dripping but I could *feel* the drops of water slamming against the rag. 

In the end I just spent as little time in my own home as I could. There was no way to be bothered by the shower if I wasn’t even inside of the house. This worked until I had to go home and try to sleep. Which ended up with me not getting a wink of sleep. I would stare up at the ceiling with my eyes unblinking just listening to the shower leak. I would pray in my head that this torture would end somehow.  

I stopped sleeping in my home. I hated going to that place. Whenever my feet hit the floorboards of that house it was as if at that moment the shower started to leak again. I slept at a friend’s house. She never asked questions as to why I wished to stay with her. That was something I was dearly grateful for.

It has been a few weeks since I started to live here. I haven’t felt this much peace in a while. I was heading to the kitchen for a glass of water. It was almost midnight and the sky was pitch black. As I walk down the halls towards the kitchen I freeze. To my left was the bathroom door. Through the wood I could hear a soft *drip, drip, drip.* ","Drip, Drip, Drip",19,nosleep

fennelliott,0,,6,1r1j2w,,8,"I think the scariest number in the world is 1. Singular and individual in it's stance, only separated by 9 decimal points to 0. It's the foundation of other gathered numbers to be made stronger by the additive of another. However, if the unit remains alone it can be a reflection of myself. There are others number out there, but what are they but to be counted, added, subtracted, and divided. In a way, there's solace in being singular, but safety is not reassured.

I can count the number of steps it take me to cross the hallway into my bedroom by the measure of 12 units to create what is called a foot. 15 1/2 feet takes me from end to the other, each print of my callous sole leaving behind an echo of flesh sticking to hardwood floor. Each step is lonelier than the next.

There are portraits to the side of me of my family, filtered out by a camera lens portrayal of vintage black and white with an average border frame 9 x 12 inches protected by glass and wood. The reflection of my bedroom light shines to the side of it, 11 feet more until I reach the shimmering source. However the darkness of the picture reflects something else, more darkness than light, 6 feet behind me.

I cross a doorway that leads into an open room. Two bunk beds found belonging to my sisters, and a faded moon glow behind the blue curtains whipping gently upwards toward me by the open air flowing in. Someone forgot to close their window, and I think to step into their bedroom to close it, but then that would wake them. Also, it would subtract my distance to my bedroom, and I would be closer to the darkness lurking 5 feet now behind me. It reflects my light as well, an edge sharper than the glass that holds the photo of my loved ones intact. More intact than the pieces of my sisters hidden beneath their blankets, soaking a dark color that a small stream of moonlight shows.

I step closer now to my room, the T.V. hissing at me in white noise. I had only gotten drink of water after checking upon the noise that came down stairs. A crashing sound, not like glass but like a muffled collapse on the hardwood floor embedded all around. I would have went to check on my dad to see if he heard it too, but he's with mom in the other bedroom across from me. I know, having seen his shadow creep into bed with her, and the rustle they made to wrap around one another. My mom gave in, and I had passed by before they would noticed or I would have seen too much. She lays quiet now, drooped across her bed in slashes of romantic red, her favorite color.

Feet creak closer behind me in another gained step.

My room is in it's warm glow with the study light turned on, the T.V. static buzzing, and my phone vibrating in the pocket of my pajamas. I stop to look at the text just before my door. I stand as a silhouette with a face lit by the small framed screen fitted in the palms of my hands. I notice the text before I notice the added step, and quickly I read, ""Closet Keeper, Family Seeker. 1 by 1, piece my piece, the family fits in the closet.""

the text is disturbing, even as I step into the comfort of glow, reaching to close the door but instead find myself grabbing the hand of another. Lifeless it feels, sheltered by a thick fabric in tight grip to the something that extends into my back. I don't notice it until the withdrawal of what I thought was only a cold chill running against my spine. More and more I feel the same chill run up and down my body with gathered droplets spraying across or falling down around me and in my uncontrollable fall, I spread out flat 6 feet even. Straight and presented in that same red as my mother. That same sound as my fathers muffle down stairs. and slowly chopped piece by piece like my sibling.

Together we are gathered in the closet, one by one. However we do not form anything greater beyond the mess we contribute to my bedroom floor. Though I was not the first, I am number 1. Alone together, and singled out amongst the living as a dead soul. I am afraid of 1, for even in number there is still me and you. We are individual, and only more bodies prove that we are just that. Alone in fight, and alone in death.

BOATSSnHOESSS,2,,1,1rdzvd,,10,"So when I was 15 my love was having a bonfire on Saturday nights. Although one thing did change that.
I live in way out in the country part of town so having a fire was usual, hearing coyotes were usual, and that sort of thing. So this night me and my friends decided we were going to stay out in a tent tonight, so me and my friend allen went in my house to get blankets and food. This is when I knew something was wrong, a sudden sense of dread came over me as we returned outside to my friend Ryan and Cory running towards us screaming bloody murder. Cory explained what he had heard, he said something made a noise sounding almost like a panther. I went back to the fire leading the pack when i turn on the spotlight (i luckily grabbed just in case) and began sweeping across the woodline, thats when i spotted it. It was a grotesque pure white creature with hollow black eyes staring at us. I was petrified out of fear. My friends ran away back into my house. I stayed. I couldn't move an inch. Then it began crawling at me on all fours, but there was something wrong with it. Its arms were almost backwards on its arms. Then it screached at me. Ill never forget that horrible sounding scream. It made me think of death. That's when I decided I needed to get the hell out of there. I began running back to my house, unaware of where the creature is I looked back to see it crawling right behind me. Thats when i saw its face and claws. Its mouth was filled with jagged sharp teeth and the claws were not animal like, almost like someone carved bone into a razor sharp knife. I gained speed and jumped over the fence at full speed causing me to fall. I got up and screamed and starting waving my arms as if the creature were a bear then I realized it was gone. I walked back home and told my parents. They didn't believe me though.
But to this day 4 years later I have no clue what this creature was or wanted.",Louisiana Demon,11,nosleep
kenandmforever,1,,2,1rc5s5,,9,"Hey, guys. Long-time lurker, first time poster…I guess I finally have something to post about. Everything’s just been wrong the past few weeks. I miss her so much. I know this isn’t a therapy subreddit or anything, but I was just thinking…maybe if I can get these thoughts out, they’ll stop bothering me. It’s just, I should have been paying attention, you know? I should have seen something was wrong. But I didn’t, and now she’s gone, and it’s all my fault.

I guess I should start at the beginning. She was my first serious girlfriend – I’ll call her M, to protect her privacy. Last thing I would want is her family finding out I’m talking about this on some site for thousands to see. Anyway, M and I worked together at a tutoring place on campus. It was my first job, and I was nervous, but she helped me figure everything out. M was really shy – she could almost never meet my eye, and her voice was super-quiet – but really sweet, once I coaxed her into talking. I got the impression she didn’t think too highly of herself; whenever I tried talking to her about her major or anything, she’d change the subject. All I really got was that she was a Bio major, and she was working on some research project about some new “cestoda,” whatever that meant. But she liked hearing about me and my major – English, I’ve never been science-inclined – and laughed at my jokes and everything, so we had a good time.

After our shifts were over, we’d go to the Subways down the street sometimes; I would always offer to get her something, but she always turned me down. She would just watch me eat while we sat together. It always made me feel kinda bad, especially since she was so small; it was like eating in front of an African kid, or something. But she never seemed to mind, so I got over it. We became good friends.

Eventually I asked her out for dinner and a movie. I can’t even remember what we saw – some remake horror flick about mind-controlling carnivorous worms, or something? – but we had a good time. We were laughing through the whole thing, and she kept pointing out the impossibilities and throwing all her science knowledge around. I don’t want to sound weird, but I found it pretty hot.

But by the time we got back to the car, she had stopped smiling. She said she didn’t feel too good, like she was sick or something. She said she wanted to walk back to her apartment – she lived just off campus, and was really big into fitness and everything – but it was like twenty minutes away and in the middle of the night, so I drove her home. She got out, said goodnight, and that was it. No kiss, nothing.

I went home thinking I had blown it, but when we had the same shift again, she was really happy. Kept saying she’d had a great time, and everything. So we went out on a few more dates. I let her pick what we did – she never wanted to go out to eat, but she did teach me how to ice skate, and we went on a few hikes, even some 5k runs. Those were the worst, but it was worth it to see the way she lit up. 

At the end of each one, I kept wanting to kiss her, but she was really sheepish about it. Every time I went in for one, she’d turn her head, or peck me on the cheek before I could. She was always embarrassed about it and apologized, but I figured she just wasn’t ready; she didn’t seem the type to have done a lot of dating herself. That was fine, I wasn’t going to rush her into anything.

The first time we kissed was like three weeks after we started dating – and I won’t say anything but wow. At this point, I realized I was completely head over heels for this girl. She was smart, she was funny, and she liked me, which was different from most girls. We started “going steady” after that – and that’s when everything started changing. The signs that something was wrong had been present before, but they really should have become apparent afterwards. God, I’m so stupid.

She started wearing big, baggy clothes to work – huge stifling sweaters, that sort of thing. I wondered if one of the guys at work was hitting on her or something and making her uncomfortable, but they were all either huge or really friendly, and I didn’t want to ask. She would shake sometimes, too, like she was cold, even when she was being swallowed up by these enormous shirts. I’d hug her and she’d lean into me, but it was like I couldn’t even feel her underneath the clothes. 

She started eating a lot. Like, I mean, a ton. When we went to Subway now, she’d put away two footlongs like it was nothing. I took her out to a few ritzy places, but the portions were always too small, so we would end up getting burgers or something afterwards. I didn’t really mind – it was nice to see that she felt comfortable enough to stuff herself around me, I guess. We were kissing a lot more, too, which was of course awesome. Because of her, I was into hiking and stuff now, so I felt great. Everything seemed perfect. Maybe that’s why I wasn’t noticing the signs.

I stayed over at her place a few times, as things got more serious, but we never went too far. She was still embarrassed about that sort of thing, I think – but that was fine, I could wait. Her couch was still infinitely better than my dorm bed anyway, and her fridge was always heaped with food – mostly meat, granted, but I’m no vegetarian. 

Despite all her eating, though, she seemed to be getting thinner. Her face was paler, and she was more withdrawn. Sometimes she would just stare into space for half an hour at a time, not saying anything, only to shake herself as I touched her or called her name a few times. She started calling into work sick, and when I visited her she would just be curled up on her couch heaped in blankets, the remnants of some sandwich or a pizza box scattered around her. I started to get worried, but I wasn’t worried enough.

Once, when we were making out, for a moment I felt something more than just her tongue in my mouth. The feeling didn’t really leap out at me – it was just a sort of niggling sensation, swallowed up by everything else that was going on – but I kinda stopped, and she drew back and looked at me with curiosity. I swallowed, ran my tongue around my mouth a few times, but decided I had just imagined it. Then, she asked what was wrong, and something flickered in her eyes.

I don’t mean that in a poetic, English-major-y way. I mean I literally thought I saw something tiny dart through her eye.

I freaked out, needless to say, but she was just confused. She said she didn’t feel anything, and even when I shined a light on her eye to see for sure, there was nothing there. I thought I was just going a little bit crazy, so she went to bed and I stayed on the couch. I shouldn’t have dismissed it. I should have taken her to the doctor. Damn it, why didn’t I?

Things got worse. She stopped coming into work entirely, and I began taking time off to go make sure she was okay. Her staring into space was more pronounced than before, as was her shaking. When she got up and walked around, it was disjointed, like she had forgotten how to use her body. And she kept asking for food, all the time. At first it was just sandwiches, then it was hamburgers, then it was just the burger itself. Then, once, she asked if I could just give one to her raw.

I was taken aback, disgusted, but she just looked so pitiful, shrinking into her bed with all her pillows and everything fluffed up around her. So I did. Well, I cooked it a little, but it was still plenty pink in the middle when I brought it to her. She ate the whole thing, gave me a sleepy smile, and fell asleep.

I went back to my couch, silently freaking out. It was all too weird for me. I’d never heard of anything like this. I’d heard about feeding a cold and starving a fever or whatever, but this was ridiculous. I decided I was going to take her to the doctor the next morning, whether she wanted to go or not.

But when the morning came, she wasn’t in bed. I could hear the shower running in her bathroom. Frankly, I was a bit surprised she could even manage to walk that far, as weak as she seemed. But I decided I’d give her some space; if she was showering, maybe she was feeling better.

I decided I’d go and make myself a sandwich. When I came back, the shower was still running, which was weird. It had been more than thirty minutes – I had ended up making myself a second sandwich and had eaten a hot dog, too. I was just weirdly hungry. Anyway, by now I was a little concerned. I had no idea how long she had been in there before I had woken up, and she wasn’t the kind to take really long showers anyway.

“M?” I called, opening the door a crack. “You okay?”

No response.

“M?”

Still nothing. God, the sound of the water hitting her is still in my head.

I stepped inside. The steam was almost blinding; there was a window she usually opened to let most of it out, but it was closed. “M?”

I pulled back the curtain, and there she was, sprawled on the tile, blood pooling around her fractured skull, her eyes gazing sightlessly upwards as the rain pelted her naked body. But that was not the worst part. The worst part was that she looked like a skeleton. I still remember those pictures of the Holocaust victims we all see in high school, where they look more dead than alive; that was exactly what she looked like. She was so painfully thin, it was a wonder she had managed to walk on her matchstick legs at all. Her ribs looked like they were about to poke through her skin. But her belly…that was round and full, like the distended ones you see in those images of African children on the charity commercials. 

I knelt by her, but of course there was nothing I could do. She was long gone. She must have collapsed and hit herself on the temperature knob on the way down. It didn’t look as though she had struggled at all; she would have died almost instantly.

I stayed there for a long time, just staring. A few times, I thought I saw her stomach move – but of course that was crazy. It was just the way the water hit her. Then, in a daze, I left. I called 911 – even though it was far past that now, obviously – and explained what had happened. The lady on the phone promised to send a cops and an ambulance my way immediately, even though there was no need.

Then I sat down, and made some bacon.

I can’t even really remember what happened when they arrived. There were just people swarming all over my house, suddenly. Two big cops started asking me questions. I don’t really remember what I said. They kept asking me why I was eating, and I just kept repeating that I was hungry, over and over. One said I needed to go to the station with them, so I did.

While I was there, they wouldn’t give me any food, not even a bag of chips, no matter how much I asked. They kept asking me how I couldn’t have known she was starving, how I couldn’t have known something was wrong, over and over and over. All I could say was that I didn’t know. She’d hidden it all from me, with her huge clothes and thick blankets. I kept saying if I had known, I would have helped her. I would have saved her. Now I know she was too far gone for that, of course. I hadn’t seen the signs in time, and it was too late.

Eventually, they let me go. Later in the day, someone called her apartment, but I didn’t pick up. A doctor, I think, or maybe a coroner. They left a message. Something about her stomach. It sounded important, but I couldn’t bring myself to listen again. I wandered around her apartment for hours, touching everything that had belonged to her as if it would bring her back. As if I could take back her mistakes, and mine.

She must have had some sort of eating disorder, I guess. Looking back, the way she acted when we first met sounds like classic anorexia…but then it must have changed into something else, I don’t know. Maybe she was eating a lot and then throwing it up – I’ve heard about that on TV.

Sometimes I can’t help but think back to her stomach, how swollen it had been, how deformed. I have no idea what could have caused that. But it doesn’t really matter now, does it? She’s dead, and it’s my fault.

I’m sorry, guys. There’s not a whole lot else I can say. The past few weeks have just been awful. They kept it out of the news, but somehow people keep asking me about it anyway, wondering why I didn’t do something, why I didn’t see. I don’t know. I’ve just been living in a daze since it happened, like I can’t feel anything at all. Nothing seems right. Sometimes my hands kinda jerk on their own, when I’m just zoning out. I keep waking up in the middle of the night, feeling like I’m starving, but I think I’ve been losing weight. Grief, probably. I’ve heard it can do that to you. I really don’t know. I just kinda wish it would end.

Again, I’m sorry. This is a lot to dump on you all, but I just have to get it out. I’m going to post this and then lie down for awhile, I think. I haven’t gone to work in four days now. Just haven’t felt up to it. Maybe make myself a burger – that sounds good. Don’t think I’ll cook it, though. My stomach seems to handle it better when it’s fresh.

Lady_rosalie,6,,4,1rbth4,,9,"I found a journal today while sifting through some things at a little local secondhand shop. They have a lot of old and cool things, so I tend to go there a lot. I decided to buy it and a few other things. I didn't look through the diary, since honestly I assumed it would be empty. Well when I curled up to write something's a few minutes ago, I saw it wasn't empty at all. Or even that old!

The first page was dated September 23rd, 1993. Only two decades ago. It was filled with normal teenage things. The author, a 16 year old named Lily, was worried about school, and the hunky guys and if they liked her. Boring things, yet I kept reading. I couldn't help it. I read things Lily might not have told anyone. It was kinda cool. 

Then I got to October 3rd, 1993. Lily and her (B.F.F4evur) Sarah, as well as a few other girls, Ruth, Emily, and Jessica, came over to stay the night. A slumber party. After doing the normal things, the pulled out a ouija. Oh great, I thought, it would be a bunch of 'scary' occurances. But nope. Nothing happened according to Lily. But it spurred talk of the local haunts. 

""Everyone knows about these places. Like, pinkys cave, that crying statue, there's like, two insane asylums, the screaming bridge, lovers gate and witches gate. Well of course we talked a put them. Emily said she swears she saw a ghost at lovers gate. Yeah right. Ghosts are totally bogus. Well whatever. I decided, with S.E.J.R's encouragement of course, that I would spend the night at each one. So there chickens. I'd write about it too. Don't worry Diary. The times I go will be reaaaally dull."" 

I felt a chill go up my spine and I've stopped. I looked at the last paper pages, to see if it went on. There was nothing. She stopped writing like, a quarter of the way to the end. What's even worse, is the dry red shit on some of the papers. I think it's blood, but it's not like it's soaked. But still...I want to go on, but I'm worried. What if she did go? What did she find? 

I'm going to try and do research on this. Figure out who Lily was, and hopefully, I'll find that she alive, well, and that blood is just from something else. ",The Diary,13,nosleep
RayAllenLovecraft2,0,,8,1r7jhu,,8,"A rather peculiar incident happened not too long ago on a cold, rainy night.  It was a little past 2 a.m. when I left my friend's house.  Its a old Victorian house in a once thriving town.  As I was driving down the empty road, I saw a taxi cab in a left turn lane.  I was able to see it's lights from about a mile away.  The green glow shined through the mist and created this aura on the surprisingly empty street.  This is not uncommon in a large town such as this, but the thing that puzzled me is where it was turning into.  The taxi was turning into a mental institution for the criminally insane.  This event happened to startle me because it was so early in the morning.  I continued to drive home wondering why someone was being released so early.  The next day, I went to school.  My school is only a stone's throw away from the mental hospital.  As I walked out of my last class I saw a familiar glow.  It was that green taxi again.  I didn't think much of it, being a college. I see taxis picking up people all the time.  As I hiked across the parking lot and got into my car I noticed it was still there.  I didn't really pay much attention to it because classes can run pretty late, maybe someone was taking there time walking through the campus.  As I tore out of the parking lot I noticed it wasn't there.  Maybe the driver got pissed and left.  I met up with some friends from class at a Mexican restaurant down the street.  As we were waiting for our food I told them about the coincidence that happened the night before and what just happened in the parking lot.  My friend, whose family had lived in the area for a long time, told me more about the mental institution.  He told me about how they once tested drugs on the patients and preformed lobotomies up until the 1950's.  The room was dead silent.  Luckily, our food came out shortly after the disturbing conversation.  When we finished eating, we talked more about it.  I was becoming obsessed with it.  Why was it there so late? Who where they picking up?  Was it the same taxi? Our conversation was cut short when the bill came to the table.  We were too busy counting our singles and change (we are college students!) to be talking about the mental hospital.  We stepped outside and had a cigarette before we would part ways.  We were standing in a empty parking lot at around 10:30 p.m. when we noticed something out of the ordinary.  We saw the green taxi picking someone up at the restaurant across the street.  It was just parked there.  We abruptly said goodbye and got into our cars.  I drove home without stopping.  The next night at dinner, I told my parents what has been going on.  They didn't believe that a green taxi has been following me around.  Days and days passed and I continued to see the taxi again.  I was getting really paranoid.  I started to take days off of school to avoid seeing it.  My parents were deeply concerned with my behavior and suggested that I see a psychologist.  I mustered up the courage and drove there myself, after all, I am a college student.  I couldn't concentrate on the road.  I was afraid that I would see it again.  I was so bent out of shape, I accidentally ran through a red light while making a right turn.  I heard somebody laying on their horn.  I was shocked to see who I pulled out in front of.  It was the green taxi!  I raced to the psychologist.  I ran as fast as I could into the office.  The councilor was frightened by my actions.  She took me into her office to hide me from the other patients.  I told her everything. She was gravely concerned with my state.  She suggested that I be admitted.  My heart dropped. I started to break out in a cold sweat.  She left the room to make a phone call.  I assumed that she was notifying my parents that I was being taken in.  She talked to me for a few more minutes until she got a call.  Once she hung up, she told me my ride was here.  I was puzzled.  She walked me out of the building and told me she called a cab.  I froze.  I looked out the glass doors and saw the green taxi parked in front of the exit.  I broke out into a violent fit, thrashing and resisting.  I was not getting in there.  Two security guards restrained me and started to drag me in the cab.  We were driving down the same street that I first saw it on.  We got into the left turn lane and entered through the opened gates.  I gotta cut this short.  My computer time is up.  The hospital only gives you an hour a day. I hope you enjoyed the story.

I had two glasses of wine while my clothes were in the drier and fell asleep on the couch around eleven. I woke up at three-thirty with all the lights on, it was raining out. I love falling asleep to the rain. I tried to drift back to sleep despite feeling completely awake. I never felt the sleep pass over me, but eventually I began dreaming. In my dream I was giving my manager a ride home. It was dark and quiet in the city and I was jokingly pretending to be asleep while I was driving. I had my head leaning back on the head rest and my bottom jaw was slack so my mouth was open. But then I felt that I was stuck that way. So he started nudging my right shoulder to make me wake up. I felt panic in my dream. That's when I came out of that dream and back into my living room where I was asleep on the couch. My mouth still agape, my eyes still closed. I was short of breath. That is when I realized that I still felt the nudging sensation. Now, however, it was coming from behind the couch cushion against my right shoulder. I could feel and hear the cushion pushing me back and forth on my couch. It then felt like I was fully awake and the nudging stopped for a second. I took a second to let myself feel afraid. The nudging began again but now there was an orchestra of movements all around on my couch. The cushions under my feet were being pulled upward in short little beats, and the left side of my pillow was doing the same thing. I felt and heard the blanket next to my right ear moving like it was trying to tickle my face and ear. I allowed these hallucinations to feel real, and as soon as I gave in to their reality, I felt the sides of my pillow begin to curl up and over my face. My heart began racing, my breaths were shallow, and I still was unable to move or wake myself up. The pressure of the pillow on my face increased until it felt like I couldn't breath. I was sinking into my couch, the pressure was on my entire body now. I knew I had let my fear fuel this hallucination for too long. I took a giant gasp of air, and woke up. I didn't know how to prove to myself that I was truly awake, so I stayed sitting upright with the lights on and opted out of sleep for the night. ",My dreams won't let me sleep,17,nosleep
Lady_rosalie,1,,6,1re4vh,,7,"So I tried to research this girl, Lily. Nothing on the Internet sadly. I didn't think it would be that easy. After all. I have no last name. Alley Cat, where I got the diary from, is open tomorrow. If the weather isn't bad tomorrow I'll go. 

But I did read more if the diary. There's some normal things, but October 8, 1993 she went to Pinky's cave. This is what she wrote;

""So mom thinks I'm at Sarah's. I'm spending the night or, whatever. She never calls, so I'll be good. I'm at Pinky Cave! It's like, dark so I'm writing with a flash light. The rules are all night stays. Ruth and I made a bet. Ha! She's way going to lose! Then I'll have 50 bucks! 

Okay diary. This is the legend. So like, no one knows why it was built. Or when. Some say moonshiners, some say the city. But it's not on city plans. At all. It's like, a three mile long tunnel made of concrete. Not a real cave! Anyway, so like, Robert Pinkman lived across the street from the opening and claimed it as his. A baby and her mom got caught in a super bad storm and drown in the cave. So now she haunts it, asking where's her baby. (No sight of her so far!)that's sorta all I know. Well I'll write again in a few, I'm going to eat some food. (Chips! Yum.)

2:15am So I fell asleep but I woke up and heard something weird. Like, crying. I'm sure I'm the only one down here. Maybe it was a dream or something. I'm going to try to sleep again.

5:53am I just saw it! I was getting ready to pack it up and go to Sarah's, when I saw it! Her I guess! She was white with this like super long hair and like, sorta an old dress. She was crying, then turned to me and vanished! I like ram out of there. I just now came back for my things. Okay so one thing happened. I can't wait to tell the girls though!""


And that's where that night ended. Not super spooky, I guess. But I still keep getting these chills. Like there's more to come. Pinkys cave, was actually a drainage place, built forever ago. It's on city maps though. Still I heard a woman died there too. But who knows for sure? 

Well there's more, but that's for tomorrow. I'm far to scared to read what comes next, at least at night.

""Fuck that. You need a hospital,"" said my Dad as he arced the car across the road, onto the shoulder, and back into the opposing lane, headed to the center of town. I was smushed against the door and then the back of my seat as he gunned the accelerator, giving the engine a run for its money and losing traction briefly in the process. My heart hammered in my chest and shocks of adrenaline coursed through my body. This was it. I was dying. My mom, my sister, both dead. Now it was my turn. Two minds swam around inside my skull like binary stars poised to collapse together. They took turns, rocking back and forth faster and faster, each feeling the pull of the other as they battled for control of my body. Faster and faster, approaching singularity, vibrating my perspective like an engine in a car, numbing my face and fingertips. Black encroached upon my vision as I drowned in fresh air, and then all was darkness.

""... appendix looks alright. Given her recent loss and the trauma she must have experienced witnessing the crash, it's likely she had a panic attack. Has this happened before?""

""No, never ...""

I opened my eyes. I inhaled. Sickness and death coated the inside of my nostrils. I pictured my sinuses and lungs darkening as though I was inhaling smoke from an electrical fire. Yellowed fluorescence glared down at me from the ceiling. Misery seeped into my pores and tugged my heart in several directions at once. Someone nearby was about to die and so many were suffering.

I heard beeping and someone yelled for a crash cart. Right on time.

I was alive and I was myself. But the definition of ""myself"" had changed. I felt distinctly like one person, yet knew that I consisted of two beings. We had fused together, the silver lady and I, and I was equal parts both. I examined my skin, its ghostly sheen. A greenish corkscrew-shaped worm drifted over my bed, briefly silhouetted against the glow of the fluorescent lights, and sighed dreamily.

""Well that was different.""

""Oh thank Christ, you're awake,"" my dad half-sobbed, lurching toward my side and away from the doctor.

""I'm fine, Dad. I think I had a panic attack."" A small purple leech-like thing with white spots had attached itself to his face while I was talking and slurped at a tear that had just trickled past. It shivered ecstatically and began purring.

""I thought you were dying. I just ... it would have been too much,"" he said, brushing another tear off and inadvertently dislodging the leechkitten thing. It screeched and flitted away with a farting noise.

I consulted my expanded library of memories - from when I was the silver lady. Strange and very hungry creatures loved to gather at hospitals. They fed off the dying, the vulnerable, the grieving. It seemed to be a drug for many of the darker things in the world. I mused to myself that fire was used to keep those pests away before it was used to cook meat. People were so much more in tune with reality before language let the mind shape perception.

The doctor checked me over and kept me awhile for observation. Dad and I left with a small prescription of Xanax and a referral to a local therapist. I knew I wouldn't be needing either now, but also that it would reassure my dad to go. I couldn't think of anything I wouldn't do to make him feel better, and mentally shrugged.

I wanted to go pick up my car, but Dad would have none of it. His tone told me that he'd rather walk through Hell than let me out of his sight right now, and I couldn't blame him. We went straight home, and I stared out the window in fascination. A herd of giant spotted fuzzy caterpillars were crawling across the road on the way out of town, wiggling phallic appendages on their backs quivering with the motion. We rolled the car straight through the middle of them and several popped with a glurping sound, like balloons full of soft, pulpy pudding. A tall, lanky, semitransparent humanoid was licking the red paint on a stop sign several miles later with a blue, fuzzy tongue the size of my dad's knobby hands. It paused when we pulled up and stepped over to the car in two long strides. I was slightly embarrased to notice, before it stooped over, that its wrinkly penis was the size of my forearm. I stared into one set of its chameleon-like eyes and smiled; its other eyes were flitting around and examining the car. It licked the window, leaving a slimy trail that lingered until we were nearly home.

The vast majority of the spiritual wildlife that hides in plain sight is harmless or mostly so, I knew. Extremely weird and illogical, yes, but for the most part its interactions with the world we know are trivial. Hardly surprising that we don't see much of it, considering the human desire for an orderly world: was a tiny six-armed ape just fucking my ear canal, or did that song get stuck in my head on its own? No, no earfuckers here, no sir.

My dad and I were both exhausted when we reached the house. I broke off to the kitchen while dad meandered to the living room. I popped open the freezer looking for my jumbo-sized tub of neapolitan ice cream, and was greeted by a tiny pixie-like critter with the head of a fly. It burst out of the freezer and shook its tiny segmented fist, shivering hard enough to affect its flight.

""Sorry,"" I thought at it, as though I had been telepathic my whole life. Which, technically, I suppose I had been.

""Damn right,"" it thought back. It shot me the middle finger and buzzed off, phasing through the solid glass window and toward the treeline.

Yeah, spirits are like that sometimes.

I grabbed my tub of ice cream and a spoon, because this was not a day for diets. I marched into the living room and plopped down beside my dad, who was just settling down himself. He turned the television on, and it was set much louder than it needed to be. I jumped, and so did the shadowy figure in the corner. It began screaming bloody murder. Shocked, I mentally yelled at it to quiet down, but I apparently didn't get through. Dad almost immediately turned the television down, but the figure only screamed louder and my ears began to hurt. I silently tried to reason with it for fifteen minutes, to no avail. In exasperation, I asked if it wanted some ice cream, and to my great delight it quieted down. I took the tub back into the kitchen, shadow man in tow, and scooped out a spoonful of icecream into a little saucer, which I sat in the sink. I wasn't really sure what it was going to do with frozen dessert, but I didn't really care as long as it was quiet about it. I grabbed my bottle of Xanax off the counter and tipped a couple into my palm, because it was most definitely a day for anxiolytics. I tossed them back and swallowed dry, and then went back into the living room, taking my tub. The living silhouette stayed behind.

Dad left the station on the news until it mentioned the crash, and then he channel surfed for awhile. Between the sedatives and the ice cream, I wasn't paying much attention. I whittled the strawberry down to almost nothing and then half of the chocolate before I realized I was really full and put the tub back up. The shadow man was gone and the ice cream in the saucer had warmed and melted. I mentally shrugged for the second time that day, which reminded me I needed to set up the therapy appointment. I grabbed the sheet of paper with the name and number on it, called, and scheduled an appointment. The earliest they had was about two and a half weeks from then, and would probably last an hour and a half, and could I please come early to get the paperwork filled out. I said I would and thank you very much, then hung up. I wrote the appointment down on the fridge calendar so I wouldn't forget.

I chuckled softly to myself. I was Alice falling down the rabbit hole. I needed a shaman, not a shrink, but I doubted either one could help me, and I thought back to the memories of my mother's death, of the wound in the world that had taken her away from me. I saw it over and over again; each time the person was different and so was the setting. The memories stretched back to antiquity, to the times before the written word, before hatred took the form of words at all. I knew that specter so well. To call it the devil would be misleading. To call it evil an oversimplification. I felt righteous fury well up inside me, a gift of the silver lady, a pure, single-minded longing for cleansing fire.

And then I felt the distinct impression that somewhere dark and far away, an eye had opened and turned its gaze on me.

I heard the voice as an echo carried on the wind from across a great chasm.

""My, Sarah. How you've grown.""

to me
3 minutes agoDetails
Since the no sleep community knows about some of this stuff I was wondering if you guys can help me out and maybe tell me what this thing is?
   Throughout my life I've had a couple experiences that a normal human being might perceive as...odd. Though slightly nerve wracking at times, I've been able to brush them off. They were all dismissed on account of lack of sleep or my stressful lifestyle. That was until four years ago. Four years ago began the string of events that now has my questioning my sanity. Because of what happened and what has continued happening for the past four years I have to sleep with a nightlight when I am alone. Even though I'm almost twenty years old.
   I remember the day clearly. I was fifteen years old. Fifteen and brave. Fifteen and oblivious. What did I know about anything, anyway?
   I came home from school as usual. It was such a normal and uneventful day. Painfully boring, really. It was a Friday and at 15 I didn't have much to do after school. Especially because the weekends were my father's days and he had a strict curfew of before 9 in place. No sleepovers either. I didn't mind this because I didn't have any chores to do. I was free to stuff my face with pizza and play video games all weekend. It was a pretty good setup.
   After playing with my GameCube for what seemed like ten hours, I was ready for bed. I sauntered off to the washroom, went through the motions of bedtime and was soon in what I considered pajamas. Just an old tank top and old gym shorts, really. I climbed into bed without a worry or care. After getting situated, I quickly drifted off into dreamland.
   A couple hours later I woke up. I had to pee. And bad. I sat up in bed and waited for my eyes to adjust. My light switch was on the other end of the room and I'm not the neatest person. I wanted to be sure I could make shapes out so I wouldn't step on anything on my way to the door.
   A couple seconds went by and my eyes adjusted. The room grew a few shades lighter and things were coming into view. That is, except for a spot in front of my bed.
   At the foot of my bed was a large shadow. It appeared to be the silhouette of a very tall person. I sat there, almost in a trance. Dazed and confused. And as I continues staring I noticed something. There were absolutely no features to it. It was just a black mass. That's when I understood. This thing wasn't human.
    I frantically blinked, hoping my eyes were just playing tricks on me. After every blink it was still there. Fucking staring at me. And whatever it was, it hated me. I could feel the malice coming off in waves. I knew it wanted to hurt me. To do something awful. The worst part was I was powerless to stop it.
   Fear washed over me. I could feel ice in my spine, lead in my stomach. I was completely paralyzed. I was at its mercy. My heart felt as if it would burst out of my chest. If that thing didn't rip it out first. I sat there and we stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity. Then it moved. 
   Slowly but surely it came closer and closer to my bed. My terror was reaching its peak. I was drenched in sweat. But I couldn't muster up a sound. That is, until it moved again. Slowly, it bent over me. It was getting closer as if it meant to come face to face with me. I gathered every ounce of courage I had. I shut my eyes and began screaming at the top of my lungs.
   A few seconds later, my dad came rushing in. Tears began streaming down my face and all I could say was ""There's something in my room."" My dad mistook something as someone so he checked my window, which was still locked. Then he checked my closet which was still empty. He dismissed it as a nightmare. But I know what I saw. I slept with the light on that night. And every night since then, when I'm alone I sleep with a small lamp on. A couple of times I felt brave and I have tried to sleep without a light. But I swear I can feel something there. And that is not the last time my own personal tormentor came to visit either. Does anyone know what it might be?",Can anyone tell me what the hell this thing might be?,14,nosleep
BensonHedges1,1,,7,1r8sq9,,6,"Upon arriving home last night, the first thing I did was drag my boyfriend into the room. I was happy he finally had a night off and could witness what I've been stressing out about. Seriously, you should see me. I look like a crack head - no sleep - wrinkled clothes - everything..I have to run in and out of the room to get clothes for the next day. Thank god I haven't had to go into the office.

Anyways, I've spent most of my time in the spare room and kept the door shut. My cat has been incredibly cautious, he's looking around every corner, and just sits on a chair in the kitchen that faces the hallway to the bedroom. He is normally very cuddly, he welcomes me at the door, headbutts me for attention. This has all stopped. The hair on his tail is at a constant stand-up position. I took him to the vet this morning - she says anxiety seems to be the cause. I've got some kitty-prozac, maybe I should take it? 

Anyways - we went out for dinner last night and came home and fell asleep on the couch. Around midnight we got up and went into the room, and there was no chill. The windows were closed, and there was seriously no activity. He thinks I'm nuts, but I swear this keeps getting worse! The only thing I had to show was the dark spot on the carpet...it's grown more of an amber color, looks like rust, and it smells if you get close to it. Not nearly as rancid as yesterday. He thinks maybe there was a leak in the roof or something, but I don't know...

He left for a detail this morning at 5, so I figured I'd get up and moving, I actually felt good about things. Maybe it was just some weird series of events...I will tell you though, I had some really crazy dreams last night. I don't remember them scene for scene, but there were some people who I'm sure I know, but can't put my finger on. All dead - a bunch of dead corpses laying outside all these spots of this new town I've moved to. Outside the barbershop I visited yesterday. Outside the clock tower that I thought looked so beautiful at sundown last night. Dead people laying outside a warehouse - which is where my gym resides now...it felt so vivid. I remember just walking around, and I could literally feel myself bumping up against spirits. It was so vivid that I literally sighed with relief when I woke up and noticed myself wrapped in my boyfriends arms. I felt safe. 

I digress...

The weirdness has crept back though. I showered, had breakfast, and made some coffee...though I've been using the espresso machine because the drip on the coffee pot kind of freaks me out. During my coffee making process, I heard some tapping coming from the bedroom - up against the door. The cat was sitting in front of the door, but not close enough to be causing the tapping. As I approached, it sounded more like scraping, but was really faint. 

I opened the doors, and the windows are cracked open. I didn't do this. The bed looked slept in - we had made it so nicely before he went off to work. And the floor of the shower in the bedroom was SOAKED. I did not shower in there - I used the one in the main bathroom. Someone's sleeping in this bed, someone is showering. Someone is opening the drawers in our dresser. 

I walked into the room, and there was that feeling - the feeling from my dream. It felt like I had to push through dozens of bodies to walk through the door. SO MUCH PRESSURE. You know those days when it's windy as hell out and you're leaving a department store? They have those heat lamps right before an exit and you walk outside into the freezing cold - it's such a pressure change. That was this exact feeling. I felt like I entered a totally different place - it didn't feel like my home. There was so much negative energy...I could feel it. My mind start racing with flashback of that dream I had. I was walking around this town, everything was much grey-er than normal...I felt like I was warped somewhere. It was nuts - it felt like a movie, but I know it wasn't. I know none of this was happening, but I could feel it happen. The next thing I knew - I was gasping for air with my back on the bed. I looked at the clock and it was 8am...somehow I had lost track of about 2 hours. 

I regained composure, walked to the hallway, and my cat just hissed at me. He wouldn't let me pet him, pick him up, anything. Just hisses...and I felt dizzy. I noticed some hairballs and some piles of puke from my cat, which was definitely out of normal. I lucked out, my cat produces very limited hairballs...

I immediately called the vet...

And now I'm home, freaked out again, and the door is shut. There's a pretty constant knocking, scratching, and I'm sure that I've heard the shower turn on. At one point I heard the door open and close immediately, as if someone was peeking out see if I was still here.

sineating,3,,5,1r72fb,,8,"So I'm very drunk right now and I'm sorry if this isn't super coherent.

My friend killed herself last year, in a park. An hour before they found her body another friend called me asking if I had seen her, cause she'd gone missing, and I started calling in-town friends to keep an eye out for her.

He called me again, an hour later, and said ""they found her"" and I didn't understand at first and he said ""what the fuck do you think happened?"" and, well. I hung up and curled up in the corner and cried for a little while. I thought she had hung herself.

I called another friend and she ran over to my place, and hugged me, and bought me a pack of smokes and told me we should walk. It was late, and it was dark out, and I swear to god I saw her hanging from every tree we went past, and she was staring right at me. She was waving around because the wind was fast and her feet were kicking, but she was staring right at me, I swear. She looked so angry.

We went over to a guys house to break the news, cause he's a really emotional guy and he'd need someone to hug while we told him. He cried. I stared at the wall and saw her feet kicking. 

We left, and it must have been 1am and my phone was going off but I didn't want to hear it because I kept seeing her up in the trees, except now she was crouching on top of the branches and looking at me, and there was no rope around her neck and no gun (she took half her face off, and my friend's dad was the paramedic who took her away so I know this)and she was watching me? She was creeping along the branches and moving her hands and watching me.

I went home and cried some more and I was afraid and confused and I smoked a few cigarettes to calm down (I want to go buy a pack right now but)but I could still hear her, creeping along the branches. So angry. I didn't sleep but when I did, I heard the branches creaking under her, the crying in the woods, and the rope creaking. There was no rope, but I don't think it knows.

I visited her grave at night, and the branch of the tree above it (there was no tree I am afraid) creaked and snapped and touched my neck.

I keep hearing tapping on my window at night, and when I work night shift I won't look at the trees, because suicides turn into restless spirits, don't they?

Is she even still there?

So back then, when they just installed this new voice note feature, I was hooked. You record a few seconds of you talking, send, and the other person can listen and reply the same way. So one day I was doing this with my friend, just voice-noting back and forth. We didn't think twice about using an actual telephone because holy shit voice notes! What a time to be alive!

So I was replying to his voice note and sent it. After sending it though, I always press play to listen back to my own note, but this time, there was nothing there. I paused, pressed play again, nothing. Quiet. As if I recorded a normal room. Then I heard a humming, not a machine hum but a woman's hum. I was around 13 or so at the time, and my voice still resembled that of a 13 year-old girl. But this voice was older and it was humming a song, really slowly. Really creepily, as if she was right next to me as I hit the record button previously. I paused it and ran out of the fucking room.

Darrenshan66,0,,8,1r3u6m,,7,"I walked up to the old elementry school with caution. It hadn't been used in years, and the gym had parts of a tree growing through the planks, and an entire section of it had to be torn down for having asbestos in the walls. I got to the entrance and what do ya know? It was locked. I cursed and kicked the door. I was supposed to be able to get in so I could do my project for history class. I was supposed to go to one of the oldest buildings and town and right a report on it, so I thought it would be cool to get first hand experience inside the building. I had even told the groundskeeper I was going to visit the school! But alas, the door was locked. I was right about to leave when I noticed something shining in the grass. Being curious, I walked over and picked it up. It was an old key. ""Could it really-"", I asked myself, turning towards the door. I walked up and stuck the key in and IT WORKED. Excited about my new found courage I ran into the building. The old concession stand for the gym was the first sight to greet me. Its old countertops covered in ancient dust. I pushed open the doors and entered the gym. Holes were broken in the wooden planks of the court where a tree had pushed through. I pulled out my camera and snapped a few pictures. As I looked over the newly taken photos I noticed what looked like a person standing on the stage in the background. ""Hello?"", I asked, hoping that whoever I had seen was kind enough to respond. I got no reply and decided to take a closer look at the picture. ""Must be the light"", I told myself, shrugging away the fear of whomever I had seen. Then I came to realize that there were no lights on. I decided to correct this error and walked to the back of the gym. I flipped the lightswitch and the lights burst into life. The gym became so bright that I had to cover my eyes. I walked into the middle of the gym. I was about to snap some more pictures with the flash off when the lights cut out. ""Stupid old fuse"", I said walking up to the switch. I flipped it off and on again, the lights came back on and I walked to the middle of the gym again. Then the lights turned off again! ""What the hell?"", I asked, walking up to the switch. My jaw dropped when I noticed that the switch was missing. All that was left was torn wires and twisted metal. I ran for the front door but it was sealed shut. I pulled the key out of my pocket and stuck it in the door. I yelped as the key turned red hot in my hand like a live coal. I dropped it as the metal liquified into a puddle on the floor. Just then, the lights in the gym came on again. I walked out onto the court and what I saw made me shiver. Something had left footprints in the dust. They looked like a cross between a skeletal foot and hooves. I gasped and ran to the exit at the back of the gym. I opened the door and ran down a corridor to the door to the outside. I tried the handle but it was locked. I cursed and shook the handle in anger, when I heard something and fell silent. Something was coming down the corridor. It moved on heavy feet, making clicking noises with each slow step. It made shallow breaths, almost as if it was struggling to breath. I covered my nose as the scent of rotting flesh hit me. I stared down at a puddle on the floor and got a veiw of the creature. It was wrapped in a red cloak, with tears in the seams and stains all over it. It's face was the skull of a cow, and it had long arms that touched the floor, the claws on its hands scraping the floor as it walked. I flew into a panic, i kicked at the door until the lock broke. I burst into the night and ran until I was numb, then I blacked out...


Ten weeks later the building was torn down. Some workers reported that they had found a basement littered with human remains. Then the story was never talked about again.

AfterYourHeart,2,,5,1r1po8,,8,"You ever have one of those days, one that changes your life so drastically that looking back you can’t help but wonder where you’d be if it never happened? I know I have. I also know that without that day, I would never be here. I apologize if this is a little blurred. They only let me have “soft” writing utensils. No pens. No pencils. So I’m writing this in artist’s charcoal. I don’t know why they think I’m so dangerous. I swear I’ve never hurt anyone in my life, nor would I! That’s why I’m writing this. I’m hoping that if I write it all down someone, anyone, will read it and understand my side of the story. The biggest problem there is that not even I understand my side of the story. Everything is so messed up in my head; events are out of order, somethings are blurry, others are just plain missing. Who knows, maybe I’m just writing this all down to help myself understand, but where do I even begin? Well, I supposed I already mentioned the day everything changed, so I may as well start there.

Sadly, for a day that sent my life into a quick downward spiral to hell, I don’t really remember much about it. Not the date. Not the weather. I could barely tell you the month. I can tell you this. It was night; well, I guess it could have been really early morning. I was working third shift at the time and I know I was at work. I was cleaning. I was cleaning the bathrooms more specifically. I had just gotten done with the upstairs bathroom and was getting ready to clean the downstairs bathroom.

Before I go on, I should mention that at the time I was working in a foster home for teens with mental and physical disabilities. Since I mainly worked nights, my main tasks were light housework, some dinner prep for the next day, and mainly, stay awake and make sure nothing happened to the boys during the night. It was a pretty easy job as there were only two boys at the time; one 16 and one 18, who for the most part, slept through the night. 

Anyway, where was I? Oh  yes. That night. I had finished cleaning the upstairs bathroom and was about to go clean the downstairs bathroom when I noticed the light in the garage was on. That’s weird. I knew when I got there at the beginning of my shift, that I walked up the driveway, and as it was already dark out, I would have noticed if it were on and it would have bugged me until I turned it off. I’m a stickler for not leaving the lights on. I know that I was deep in thought as I walked up. Maybe I was so distracted that I didn’t notice. I have been known to wander off in my own little world from time to time. Then again, maybe my boss left it on after I had already gotten there.

I decided that I better go check it out. After all, protector to the boys was also part of my job, and the phone was on the way to the door. I grabbed the phone, dialed 911 and put my finger on talk, ready to push it if something went wrong. Since it’s a landline, if I do call and can’t talk, heaven forbid, dispatch will still be able to know the address and send a car out to check. I crept slowly to the garage door. I’ll admit, I was terrified. I probably should have called anyway, just to be on the safe side. I made it to the garage, slowly opened the door, and peeked my head out. Empty. I gasped as I released the breath I didn’t know I was holding. Still holding the phone, just in case, I checked the back garage door. Locked. I let out a small chuckle as I started to relax and I headed back into the house, making sure to lock the garage door, and turn off the light on my way back in.

Crap. I noticed when I walked back in that in my stupid terror I had left the bathroom light on. *Sigh.* At least I could use the exercise, I joked with myself on the way back down the hall. I think I was still feeling really foolish for how worked up I let myself get. When I turned into the bathroom, a scream of terror got trapped in my throat so hard that I passed out.

I came to on the bathroom floor. I was a little achey in a few spots, but considering how hard I must’ve fallen on bare tile, it could have been way worse. Lucky for me, my head landed on the bath rug next to the shower; although, there was a bit of a ringing sound in my ears. It either went away or I got used to it quickly , because after a moment I didn’t even notice it. I slowly got up and checked out what startled me into fainting for the first time in my life. 

The mirror had writing on it. I looked closer. The writing was orange. Orange marker. Washable. Weird. Why would someone choose orange marker. That just seems like an usual choice. I mean, I know there were markers in the linen closet next to the bathroom, but who would look in a linen closet for writing utensils? I mean, it’s just not what I would expect writing on the mirror to be written with.

Wow. I can’t believe I can get so side-tracked, even at a time like this. Focus. Mirror. Orange marker (weird). Writing. Maybe one of the boys did it. Well, of the two, only one of them was verbal and literate. His bedroom was just down the hall. The other boy had his room in the basement. It was a fully finished basement that was remodeled specifically for him. He had pretty severe Autism and didn’t speak or write. I checked my phone. Not that much time had passed while I was on the floor. I decided to go down the hall and check to see if Gabe was still awake. I knew that if he had written it, he’d be giggling in his room, waiting for a reaction.

I opened his door and turned on his light. He was sound asleep. Even though he was face-up he didn’t even flinch when I turned on the overhead light. Now trust me, as the person who took care of him most nights and got him up and ready for school in the morning, I could tell when he was faking sleep. I also knew, in general, how long it took him to fall asleep. There was no way he wrote that.

I walked back to the bathroom. After looking again I couldn’t help but think, it couldn’t have been Gabe. His hand writing is atrocious. The handwriting on the mirror was fairly neat, feminine almost, and slightly familiar. Again, I couldn’t help but shake off a weird feeling, and again I should have called 911. I guess I didn’t want to be the one that had to call the cops while working, which I found stupidly embarrassing. So, after a quick yet terrifying search of the house revealed no one else and all the doors and windows locked, I cleaned off the mirror, first reading it one last time:

*“Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb.
Mary had a little lamb and she threw it out the window
The window, the second story window.”*

	
I couldn’t help but say it in the sing-songy way that my grandpa had originally taught it to me. It was a silly twist you could put on the right part of any nursery rhyme to make it even sillier. He taught it to my sisters, cousins, and I to keep us entertained on long car rides. Sometimes we’d pass it along to any friends who happened to have come with; although we quit doing it by time I was 12 or 13, so I don’t think I was friends with anyone any longer that would have learned the song with us.

I watched TV in the living room for the rest of that shift, trying to distract myself. It didn’t work at all and I jumped out of my skin at every noise. When my boss got there I blamed illness on my incomplete chore list. She believed me as I had never before not finished them, and she wished me better as I hurried off.

When I got home I curled up with my fiance and somehow managed sleep. Then again, I always felt safe in his arms. When he got up to leave, he quietly kissed me goodbye. As he slipped out the door, I slipped back to sleep.

I remember I woke up before my alarm. For some reason I was cold. I peeked one eye open and noticed Pugsley was gone. Oh well. He sleeps when daddy sleeps, I can’t expect him to sleep when I sleep too. I also noticed that Joe had left the window open again. Man, I hate it when he does that. Now I get to lay here and debate whether or not it’s worth getting up and closing the window before my alarm goes off. I decide quickly that if I close the window now, I can still jump back in bed and snooze for a little bit longer before the alarm, but when I got to the window, sleep was the last thing on my mind.

There on the sidewalk below, was Pugsley. The dog Joe, Sophia my daughter, and I had gotten together upon getting this new apartment. Joe had been so happy about having our bedroom on the second story. As I looked down, many thoughts flooded my head. One more than the rest. *“the window, the window, the second story window…”*

I put the dog in a small box, then double bagged the box with plastic bags, and put it in the garage freezer. After all, I still had to pick up Sophia from school. I would try to figure out what to tell Joe and Sophia on the way there.

They’re coming! Crap! They’re coming to check on me! I have to hide this. I don’t want them to find it. If I’m never able to continue, just know one thing. I AM NOT CRAZY!

sangarji,1,,4,1r1huu,,7,"I bought a camera last week and snapped pictures of my four year old daughter. I was excited about showing her those pictures as that would be the first time she would be seeing herself in a photograph.

When I laid the photos in front of her, she held them in her tiny beautiful hands and looked at me with a hint of confusion.

Who is this Daddy?

Its you of course, my darling. Don't you see?

No. Its not me.

Of course it is. Its my beautiful little angel.

But daddy, I don't look like this in glass ( She calls the mirror a glass ) I have blue eyes. This girl has black eyes. I have a mole on the cheek. And my hair is black. This girl has brown hair. This is not me. 

She was not lying. I know her play face. She was being earnest. 

And she was describing Sarah, my little sister who had suffocated to death in the attic 28 years ago.

When she was four years old.

We don't have any pictures of Sarah and there is no way my daughter would've known how she looked. Unless...

00WELVAERT,5,,10,1r17ja,,5,"EDIT: Some spelling mistakes

Hey guys, I'm going to tell three real and inexplicable occurrences that have happened to me so far in my short life (Still a teenager) These occurrences involve a sound, or a sight being there that wasn't really there.
I can't really explain anything that has happened here, but I would like to share. Here it is...

The first time this had happened to me I was very young, around 7 years old. I was a confident little fellow, and after a day of playing with my brother and such I decided to sleep, in my sleeping bag, on the 3rd floor of my dads house alone...

So as I am about ready to start dreaming, with the moon out far and it being past my bedtime, I suddenly hear a man whisper to me.

The first time I had no idea what it said, completely unclear. So I freeze in pure horror, until again he whispers to me.

It still didn't say anything understandable, but at this point I was calling out for help from anyone in the form of some weird exhale of a loud shriek (That is really the best way to describe what I was doing). I was afraid if I called ""Dad!"" it would know I was trying to get away and it would hurt me.

So then it whispers to me, a little louder ""Noo no, it's okay"" ""shh shh"" as I scream for my dad as I remain frozen still from fear of moving a muscle.

Moments later my Dad rushes in to comfort me, as there was nothing there. I tell him what I heard, and even having it being the breakfast table conversation the next morning, my Dad was sure it was just my silly little child's mind playing games.

I slept in his bed that night. I knew what happened was real, it was so vivid and I still remember it all of these years later.

That was my first time experiencing something so inexpiable and supernatural, the second time was during the middle of last Summer.

So me being a stupid little fellow, me and a friend of mine decided to stay up for 2 entire days straight.

It was terrible in the first day, we could barley keep our eyes open. But coffee and monster pulled us through until the 48 hours were near over...

Nearing the end , as we are in the last hours of sleeplessness I had walked in to my room and closed the door to do something that I don't recall. It may have been to change clothes

As I'm changing, I started to hear the moaning and groaning of a person outside my window.

I took a good look outside, and saw no source of sound. It didn't get louder when I had opened the window either.

I had then started to hear my shower turn on, but when I opened my door to try and confirm someone was showering the noise stopped. I had opened and closed my door a few times and the noise stopped and started along with the door.

So I finished whatever I was doing, went in to the hallway and told my friend what happened  and that it was time to sleep. I was exhausted and confused as hell, maybe too tired to completely understand the fear I maybe should have been condoning. But, who knows.

So now comes for the most real and recent occurrence, this only happened 2 weeks ago.

So it was a Monday night, with school being off for Tuesday I managed to get my dad to drop me off to meet up with some girl to meet up with (Around 7:00 at night when he dropped me off).

The night played through, and it was eventually time for me to go (Around midnight when I left) . But luckily for me my ride fell asleep on me (Mom -.-) [More of my fault for staying with her so late]

So I didn't want to make her parents take me home, or make this anyone else's problem other than mine. So me being very tired thought ""Eh, I'll just walk, it wont take THAT long""

So I started off on my little (long as fuck ) adventure! I walked, and walked, and about 90 minutes in around 1:30 AM I'm walking by an elementary school in my neighborhood.

Everyone I have told this to has not believed me. So if you want to talk shit in the comments please don't waste your own time.

There was a leaf bag at the end of the street that connects with an intersection, but I swear to my life the leaf bag had limbs, was moving, and was on a bike.

I stared directly at it for moments at a time and it continued to ride the bike. It rode the bike, moving it's limbs but it was not going anywhere.

So, I just kept walking. Now pretty freaked out I start seeing black figures fly across my field of vision.

I just fucking ran because of that, past the elementary school, until I came across a giant parking lot for the church nearby.

So I took a breath for a moment or two, then I saw someone maybe 15 feet away. It was a pretty normal sized person, but it was wearing a full black coat, I could see nothing but black on it.

That just horrified me, I ran even more because of the adrenaline rush seeing that thing gave me. When I stopped running I could feel my pulse beat like drums. It was so irregular and strange, it would thump a few times, stop for a few seconds, and thump a few times again. I never saw that someone again.

I was very close to home at this moment, so I finished my 2 hour walk that lasted from 12AM-2AM within the next 15 minutes or so. The moment I finally made it home was amazing.

I can't say I know what was going on that night, or any of those times. But I can ensure to you that these things all really happened. I just can't explain how.",It has happened 3 times.,15,nosleep
Cremewagon,1,,5,1r15us,,9,"I'm 26 years old and I have been suffering from chronic sleep paralysis for about 9 years now.  I figured this would be a good place to recount some of the experiences I've had.

**Chicago** -  I was living with my girlfriend in a very tiny basement apartment.  The apartment was dirty and had low ceilings.  In our bedroom we had a bed and what was probably meant to be a closet in the corner of the room, only there was no door on it and no light fixture.  This corner of the room was always dark.  

My sleep paralysis dreams have always been vivid in the extreme.  Every detail is captured exactly how it would be as if I was awake.  It truly is impossible to tell the difference. 

My first incident at the apartment was one night when I fell asleep to my girlfriend watching Bridezillas in the other room.  I could see the light from the TV flashing under the doorway and hear the audio.  

Something was very wrong.  I could sense a presence and I knew it was in the dark closet/corner of my room.  It had not revealed itself, but it was there.  There is no fight or flight response in my very worst experiences.  It is just distilled terror.  I cannot move, cannot breathe, cannot scream.  That's when it comes out of the corner.  It moves very quickly.  Skittering almost.  I can see flashes of pale skin and long dark hair.  It is on the bed in seconds, I can feel the weight of it tugging on the covers.  Then it is on top of me.  I cannot breathe and I am face to face with something so evil that it is seared into my memory.  It is a woman, only she has a tiny face, her eyes are lambent green and she has draped her hair over me, trapping me right next to her face.  I can feel tiny puffs of stale breath on my cheek and the weight becomes unbearable.  I scream and wake up.  

This happened a few times, always the same woman.  Sometimes she would crawl out of the corner and across the ceiling before dropping onto my bed.  Sometimes she would just morph out of the shadows and appear on me.  This happened numerous times at this location and then she just stopped showing up.  

After a year we moved to a slightly larger apartment a few blocks away from the Belmont stop.  Sleep paralysis was very rare for me at this point.  We had lived at this place for about two months when I had another episode.

**Second Incident-**  I had just finished watching ""The Pixar Story"" on Netflix and had paused it on the credits and fell asleep with the lamp on beside me.  I had fallen asleep on my recliner so I was sitting up, which is strange because all of my other experiences I had been on my back.

When I wake up I see a massive being sitting next to me.  To put him into scale, I am sitting in the recliner and he is sitting on the ground.  The top of his head is level with my chin.  This would put him around 7-9 feet tall standing up.  Not only that but there was an aura of power that was palpable and just emanated from it.  He/it is resting there, it is the color of black marble.  I can see beads of perspiration on the skin.  Whatever it is, it is absurdly muscled and well defined.  Every possible muscle is nearly bursting out of the black marble flesh.  I can see the jugular vein in its neck beating with the pulse, black blood pumping through the spiderweb of veins under its skin.  I know now that it is a male.  His eyes are closed but I know they are completely yellow if they were to open.  I know that if I wake him I will die.  I sit there and watch him, he does nothing but breathe in and out as the perspiration rolls off his body.  This goes on for fifteen minutes or so.

When I woke up from this one I had a deep sense that I had encountered something from another realm.  That is really the only way to describe it.  It was too real.  Nothing in my room had changed, ""The Pixar Story"" was still paused and my lamp was still on.  But the presence of whatever I had just seen lingered for a long time.  

Another interesting thing about this one that sticks out.  I've never seen him again.  He just showed up once.  Which I thought was odd, because something as vivid and unique as this entity seems like a perfect thing for the mind to hold onto and conjure up again.  But it's been close to four years now and I have not seen him a second time.  I hope he never comes back, honestly.

**Third Incident-**  And now my last one.  This one happened three days ago.  I live in an apartment in Licoln, NE now and this is the first time it has happened here.  

I was laying on my side when I woke up, for some reason my phone was on and the clock is showing 2:01 a.m.  I live in the basement unit and there are orange sodium lights that shine into my room through the blinds.  One of the blinds is slightly lifted because my room-mate set her coffee there while she crocheted a scarf earlier.  Her knitting stuff is still on the chair.  At this point I start panicking because I cannot move and I know what is happening.  

There is a tapping on the window.  Really quick, light taps, followed by some scratching.  Like a cat is trying to get inside.  The orange lights start casting some strange shadows on the floor and I can see something moving outside the window.  It is moving with intelligence, trying to figure out a way in.  There are tiny puffs of humidity on the window too, so I know something is breathing on it.  At this point, I'm seriously trying to wake up because this is going to get very bad.  It moves over to the far right part of the window and starts tapping and scratching again.  Then it unlatches the window and opens it.  A frail looking arm slips in.  The skin is either dark, dark green or black and slimy.  The rest of it slips and it looks strangely cat-like, only minus the fur, and it glistens in the orange of the sodium lamps.  It just kind of sits there and stares at me with large pure black eyes.  Then it runs at me, only it moves without grace, like stop motion gone wrong.  I manage to turn my head and scream.  When I wake up I am moaning quietly.  

What bothered me about this one though is that my phone was on, and showing 2:04 a.m. when I woke up.  My phone had no reason to be on, the only thing I can figure is that I bumped into it during the episode.  

So, yup, those are my stories and yes, having these experiences have made it difficult to fall asleep some nights.  I've got a lot more of these experiences and I'll probably share them later, but this is enough for now.",I suffer from chronic sleep paralysis.,14,nosleep
the_dark_half,5,,1,1rhyj5,,7,"You know that feeling when you’re all alone and hear your name whispered? Maybe you’ve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop? Had things go missing only to re-appear in odd places? Maybe you’re like me and you lie in bed at night, only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around, nothing. 
Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately, tickling you? You check and nothing was there? I’m sure your parents tell you it’s nothing from a young age; perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination. They probably deep down fear it’s a ghost or apparition. Even they couldn’t know how much worse it really is.  Stop deluding yourself. It’s not a cobweb. It’s not the wind. It’s not nothing. It’s something far more sinister, an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention. 

Some of you, I’m sure, will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house. It’s such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do, it’s the spookiest part of a generic horror movie, because those suits in Hollywood haven’t seen what these creatures are really capable of. If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their ‘voices’. I’m sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed, taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because it’s real form is so terrifying you’d probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear, a zombie-esque state you’ll never awaken from-and that would ruin their fun too early. If you don’t die instantly, seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed; hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and I’ve heard of cases where insides have been liquefied, skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every pore.

The first time I awoke to one in my room with me, it was after I’d given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention. I had thought it was cool, I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me. I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination, until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg, followed by more spindly legs, followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs. Yep, a giant spider, bigger than a horse came into my room. I tried to scream, but that just resulted with me hyperventilating, then vomiting all over the floor. It strode in, all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away, but it held me down with its two front legs, piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devoured-which I was.  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn. I lay in bed, delirious, desperate, muttering for help. My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices, screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me. I passed out shortly after, from fear, blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later, believing to have all been a dream. I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals, birds mostly, wrapped up in what appeared to be spider’s webs, discoloured, drained of their blood and insides. All dead. I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself, dried blood caked on my body and face, puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts, my stomach, my legs and in my hair. 

The second night I encountered one of them, they took the form of my uncle. I lived with my uncle for nearly 5 years while my father was travelling almost every week for business. I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods. He didn’t know what his brother did to me. That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear, I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me. He crawled onto the bed and tied me down. I struggled, but when I did he beat me with his belt, like he had started doing when I was eight years old. I fought as hard as I could, tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably, but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl. The torture that night lasted for many hours, possibly days. I try not to remember it. I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago, when my uncle died. This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me. They’ve only grown stronger with every drop of blood, with every scream and with every hopeless sob I’ve given them.

Their true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that won’t instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane, yet; they like to take their time with their toys. The dreams for me started after those incidents. I have seen what those beings really look like and…just thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking, unable to stop retching. The other day I wasn’t careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train. In my dreams, it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world, but it all feels real. 
Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this torment…but what if when I die, I get sent to their realm, to be their plaything forever? 

It’s not just the occasional brush against my skin, the odd floor creak and the rare moment of ‘is someone calling my name?’ Now I feel them on me at all times, their rough, sharp skin cutting mine, scratching me, violating every single part of my body. Their voices scream and howl at me, maniacally taunting and laughing at my never-ending misery. Even when I shut my eyes, I still see them, their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you. 

Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts, of spirits. Yes, it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering, isn’t it? You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive; you open your mind and let them in. Don’t. What’s out there isn’t human, it isn’t some person with unfinished business, what’s out there wants you to think that, to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it. 

Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window, like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper? That creak outside your room? That faint sensation on your flesh? I hope not, because now you know what’s really there and they’ve always known about you.",Don't give them attention.,8,nosleep
Rhapsodeyus,1,,0,1rgtyq,,8,"Some may recall a story I posted a few months back, about shadow-like figures who visited me on a mission for knowledge, and afterwards, disappeared like ghosts. For those who do not recall, the story is [Curious Visitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4dv2/curious_visitors/).

If you have not read that, well, you probably haven't missed much, but it will help with the backstory for this one if you do read it.

Done reading? Good, let's continue.

This happened last night, Sunday, November 24th, 2013. I woke up at precisely 4:27 AM, and I know this because I watched my small digital alarm clock on my bedside table flip to 4:27 AM as my eyes opened. I also noticed that my lamp was off (I sleep with the light on for safety reasons, since living with cats can be hazardous). However, I could see my plain, black clock in a pale blueish light.

My brain clicked. ""My laptop is on. I must have left it on and the power went out, so it's running on battery."" Then I remembered, quite clearly, turning it off and closing it before going to bed. That's when I felt a weight at the end of my bed, sitting in front of my laptop.

I sat up, looked, and spotted a shadowy figure sitting in front of my laptop. The NoSleep submission form was up. I coughed, and said quietly, ""You could have asked."" Instead of, say, a sudden spin and a glare from Brarger, as I expected, my visitor vanished instantly.

I didn't expect that, and it startled me thoroughly. My previous visitors would never have been so rude, and certainly would have asked my permission to access my personal computer. I shifted, tossed the covers aside, and moved to the end of the bed, to read what it had written.

I now wish I hadn't.

The message ends there. I suppose I interrupted the agent and he fled.

Whether this is genuine or not, I cannot know. If it is a fake by a rogue agent, then its purpose is unclear, but it is certainly unsettling. If this is a prank, then it's impressively elaborate, yet in poor taste.

But if this is real... Then I'll be on my guard. But I have to wonder... What, or who, were they telling me not to trust?",Interrupted Warnings,8,nosleep

Working in fast food is never an enjoyable experience. But by far the worst part is the smell of dirty dishwater. I’m not talking about your run-of-the-mill dishes at home.

I’m talking about 600 filthy dishes soaking together in the same water for 6 hours. It creates a smell unlike anything you can imagine unless you’ve experienced it. It smells like bacon grease, vomit and in the case of one terrible night, human flesh.

It started like any other night; rude customers, a barrage of fry and burger orders, floors to be mopped. The time dragged by with each minute feeling like an hour. It was sometime between 9:35 and 43 seconds and 9:36 and 29 seconds that I heard it. 
THUNK

I paused a second while taking an order “Hello?” said the customer in the speaker. Nothing else seemed out of the ordinary, and things resumed their familiar pace.

That is, until 10:41 when I heard a pounding coming from the walk-in freezer. I left my dish sink to investigate. And my manager, Sandra stepped in front of me. “Where do you think you’re going? Wash those dishes”. She stayed in that spot, arms crossed, unmoving.

I turned back to my dishes, glancing quickly around the corner before returning to the sink. I could swear I had seen that the outside of the freezer was blocked.

I heard the tell-tale beep of a customer entering the drive thru queue.

It was then that I realized that Kelsey, the sandwich maker was nowhere to be seen. I had been so focused on my own misery that I hadn’t noticed that Sandra had started doing both sandwiches and fries. With it being late at night, there had only been three of us there. It was at this moment that with a crash, Kelsey came racing out of the freezer, shivering and MAD. She came at Sandra, howling “you BITCH”, and tackled her. 

Sandra put her hands around Kelsey’s throat and squeezed. Choking, Kelsey backed up to the wall. She flailed, and kicked, freeing herself. She ran towards the back of the restaurant, grabbing the cordless phone. “I’m calling the police, you psycho! How could you lock me in there?!”

Sandra approached slowly, palms out. “A punishment to fit a crime.” Then she grabbed a knife and with one deft movement, pressed the blade at least 3 inches into Kelsey’s stomach. With a shocked expression, Kelsey gurgled, and fell backwards into the dish sink, her hands going limp. After a few seconds, she lay still, and red began diluting into the water. 

“It was self defense, you saw” said Sandra with a sly grin, and wide unblinking eyes. The drive thru began beeping loud in my ear as I stood motionless. Sandra retreated to the office and closed the door. My eyes flicked back and forth between the door and the water. To this day, I still hear that relentless beeping, seconds before I fall asleep. And if there is a hell it smells bacon grease and blood.

frankthompson,2,,7,1redk6,,6,"There exists for all people a point. A point where the quantity of coincidences exceeds what one is willing to accept as coincidence. For a skeptic this point is rather high, while for the naive it might very well be one. Long have I thought of myself as a skeptic, particularly in regards to the paranormal. A scientist by trade, I never accept any evidence that is non-repeatable. Nor do I accept theories based on small numbers of events. I feel the need to preface my story with this short paragraph so that when I present my experiences you understand the viewpoint at which I approached them.

I grew up in a small house occupied by many members of my extended family. As such, rare was the moment in which I was ever alone in a room. Save time spent in the bathroom, someone was always within line of sight. College was much the same, having shared a rather small suite with three other students. Being alone was not a sensation I encountered until my late twenties, having had to live a rather spartan life upon discovering my chosen vocation left work opportunities few and far between; typically tackling this issue by living in small apartments with many other individuals.

I was 28 when I obtained my apartment. My apartment, no one else had any claim to the space. It was a two bedroom apartment, one bedroom utilized as my home office and the other for sleeping. I landed a job with the CDC, and even though the cost of living was higher than what I was used to in the Midwest the pay was more than enough for me to find adequate living space within my budget. I was ecstatic at first, but my enthusiasm rapidly dwindled.

The first nights were difficult. I often thought I was hearing noises within the walls, and after a few days I took to leaving the television on across the hall. This helped me sleep a bit, but the noises continued. Eventually I was content to drown them out with music at night.

I had lived in places with rats in the walls and old buildings that creaked many times before, but somehow this was different. These weren't the intermittent squeak of the floor nor the persistent chewing and skittering of a rat swarm. Odd rhythms with inconsistent breaks filled the nocturnal orchestra. Irregular beats; consistent sounds expressed in patterns I could not follow. The predictability of the music I played over it clashed heavily with the ever-present undersound.

Additionally, the noises seemed to get louder the more ambient noise was present. I first noted this phenomenon on a Saturday night when a rather eventful occurrence must have left the patrons at a nearby bar incredibly excited when they took to the streets at last call. I was awake finishing a manuscript when their merriment took to the streets, and rather than notice the commotion caused by the inebriated I first became aware of an inexplicable uptick in the level of sound coming from within my home. This noise was what broke me from my concentration, and only after it did so did I become aware of the people outside.

I began experimenting with the sound. Recording it, manipulating it. The volume increases linearly with the volume of other sounds, based on some rough audio analysis. I took to sleeping with ear plugs, and silencing all other sounds in my apartment such as to appease whatever is making the noises.

I presented the sound files and my analysis to a coworker in confidence after some time. I had little to fear regarding questions of my insanity, as I had taken some video footage as proof of the location and timing of the events. He was intrigued, but insisted it was most likely something mundane. My theory that some sort of creature or creatures were reacting to the ambient noise levels was rapidly rejected, and I felt rather silly. Still, something was occurring, and he offered to come help me seek out the source of the noise on the following weekend.

We grabbed dinner that Saturday evening, and he and I retired to my apartment shortly after sunset. It was a rather pleasant outing, and I was fairly certain that he was interested in me beyond what I had suspected initially. Still, though, the point of the evening was locating the source of the noise and that is what we set our minds to upon entering my apartment. Or rather, that is what we were planning on setting our minds to when we arrived. The noise was, disappointingly, absent.

He stayed for a few hours more, however, and we watched a movie. When it got rather late I saw him out, after agreeing to see him again outside of work. I did rather enjoy his company, and his presence seems to have kept the sound away. I went to sleep, rather giddy for what the future might hold between us, and slept more soundly than I had since moving. There were no sounds that night.

I kept busy on Sunday, barely setting foot into my apartment. While the previous night was pleasant, it quickly faded into memory as I went about running errands and keeping the rest of my life in order. I had more energy than I knew what to do with, and I meant to make the most of it. I was drained by the end of the day, but I had accomplished many tasks that I would otherwise have continued putting off. I dined alone, and went to bed early. Predictably the sounds returned.

The sounds remained a constant in my life for some time, and while they were present I simply put up with them. Eventually the previously mentioned coworker wound up spending the night for different reasons. I hadn't even thought of the sounds, nor had I mentioned them to him again since that first night. With him there they were again absent.

After a few more months we moved in together, him and I, living in my apartment. When my lease ended we moved to a larger place, and had been there around a year without incident. This week, however, he left for conference that, due to a few projects at work, I was unable to attend.

The noises began the night he left, three days ago. I recognized them instantly, and was unable to sleep. I immediately set up an audio recorder, as well as my laptop recording video and sound. They were louder than ever before, and clearer. I spent all of yesterday reviewing the recordings and analyzing the files from before, comparing now and then. Several aspects remained consistent between the recordings, and I am certain that they are the same noise. This time, however, I captured something different. The recorder I use for work is a new one, and seems to have picked up more of the sound than my laptop and other device. I can understand it, now.

There are voices. Alien and unsettling voices, as though someone taught a pack of cats to speak in disjointed sentences. Snippets of conversations that make no sense, frequently referring to me by name. They know who I am, they seem to be following me, and it appears that they... like me, in some twisted sort of way. The creatures want me to know I'm not alone. They don't want me to be sad, they want to make sure I know they're there, that they're watching me.

I slept in a hotel last night, to get away from them. I couldn't sleep with whatever they were nearby, and hadn't slept the night before. I couldn't sleep much last night either, though. It was almost too quiet... I had to turn the TV on before I could fall asleep. I went home this afternoon, intent on discovering more. A few samples of broken sentences was hardly enough evidence for me to base any conclusion on, and I needed to shake the feeling that I've gone crazy.

I ""borrowed"" a few more recorders from work and set them up around my home. At least one in every room. The plan was to discover where the noises were coming from, based on where the voices were loudest and clearest. They started shortly after dark, predictably. The sound files were sent to my laptop every few minutes, and I compared them on the fly. Consistently they are loudest in whichever room I'm in, or in whichever room has the highest levels of ambient noise (dishwasher and microwave created this pattern). The clarity, however, seems directly linked to my location and my location only. The longer I stay in a place, the better I can understand them. I can hear them... right now. I know what they're saying. I don't have to be alone again. I don't have to be alone... ever. I just have to let them in.

I don't want to be alone... I guess that's why I have this hammer now. I just need to let them into the house so they can be with me... so we can be together. The more I listen, the better it sounds. I can hardly remember why I even left last night, why I would ever want to be alone.

I'm going to let them in now. I need to find out what they are. If I come back, I'll post the audio and update. If I don't, well, someone will find the recordings. The recorders will be missed in rather short order. Wish me luck. At least I know someone will know what happened to me if I go missing.",Lonely,13,nosleep

I have been like this for a number of hours. Right now, I’m desperate. I hear a noise outside the bedroom door, my dog Monty. He pushes open the door which floods my bedroom with light. He jumps on my bed and settles next to me. I lack the strength to push him away so I try and move closer to him in order to feel his warmth. I can feel his moist breath on my neck. It’s kind of soothing. I like it. He even licks my ear. This makes me smile. 
The noise of my mother opening the downstairs door that leads to the garden pulls me out of the light sleep that I fell into. I can still feel Monty next to me; his chest rising and falling with each breath.  Then I hear mother shouting ‘Come in Monty, its bedtime’.

freezessmyblood,5,,5,1r9hka,,5,"So I am a firm believer in the natural world, and I really have never believed in ghosts or anything like that before. But lately, I really don't know what to think. I'll start from the beginning, about a year after we moved into the new house. My room is one of the biggest in the house, with a good sized walk-in closet. I have always had these fleeting thoughts about a ghost or some sort of spirit living in my house. I get that feeling that someone's watching me regularly, especially at night. My room is also very cold almost all the time, though it wasn't when we first moved in. 

Lately though, I've been noticing strange things going on with my closet. At first, I'd leave the room and find the door open when it hadn't been when I left, or I'd find the light on or off when it had originally been the opposite. I always just assumed I hadn't noticed the door being open, I just really didn't want to believe that anything was wrong. But then the closet lights started going out. I know that really isn't anything special, but every single bulb we'd put in would go out within a day. We all just thought there was something wrong with the socket for the light, so we just stopped putting them in. 

Last night, something I can't explain happened and I don't know what to make of it. I awoke early in the morning, at about 3 AM, and I stood to turn my television off. As I turned around from the tv to return to my bed, I saw that my closet light was on. I didn't think anything of it, I just walked towards it to turn the light off, when I noticed two dark shadows blocking the sliver of light under the door. I thought my brother must be in there because we share a room and I was still fairly groggy from waking up, so I slowly walked towards the door to try and whip it open to scare him. I grabbed the doorknob and flung it open. Inside was a woman, standing right up against the doorframe, and she was so pale. Her hair was limp and pure white, and she was dressed in these white clothes that hung from her loosely. As soon as I saw her I froze and we stared at each other for only a second before she screamed the most horrifying, piercing scream I'd ever heard, and the light blew out and she was gone. I slammed the door shut and ran to my bed which, unfortunately, is right next to the closet. 

I stayed there for a while until I must've fallen asleep, because I remember her staring down at me. I awoke in my dark room and there she was, standing over my bed, just staring at me. I was paralyzed with fright, and I couldn't move. She just stared, and as she began moving her face closer to mine, I finally shook the paralysis and yelled. She slid back away from me as though she was levitating and disappeared. 

I'm terrified to sleep tonight because I don't want her to visit me again. Her face is burned into my memory, it was the most unsettling thing I have ever seen. I don't know what to believe anymore",My room is haunted,10,nosleep

DaFunktapus1,0,,3,1r0t4e,,7,"I was visiting my grandparents house with my dog the other day. They live in the middle of no where and the house has its eerie moments. I pulled up to the house. No one was home and they weren't expect to be there for another thirty minutes or so. I got the spare key and walked inside. The immediate sense of pooping my pants hit me as soon as I walked in the door. I ran to the restroom and my dog followed me in. I slammed the door, sat down, and felt heaven. Then I started surfing reddit. I was on this golden throne for about ten minutes when I heard the voices of my grandmother and grandfather talking to their cats. My dog's ears perked up, he stared at the door, then he started whining. I immediately assumed they had gotten home early. I walked out of the bathroom expecting to tell about my glorious victory of the gods. I was very surprised to see that no one was there. I wandered the house, checked upstairs, no one. I checked outside, and there was no other vehicle besides mine. They arrived home ten minutes later. I still haven't told them.

JUVIE_MAKER,2,,1,1rhq9j,,8,"I have a nose for things. No seriously, all my life I’ve had a very strong sense of smell and I don’t mean for the average person. I have an abnormally, freakishly, ridiculously, absurd sense of smell. It’s been that way since I was a kid. Here’s a prime example, when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother (god rest her soul) every month in Daytona Beach for the summer. My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood. I would always leave my Gran’s house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats. One Saturday, after a day of playing outside (when kids used to play outside!) I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air, but something was…..off. There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent. It was kinda tangy, bitter, sorta nutty …just all around unpleasant. Being so young, I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didn’t like it. Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate. She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgust.

Gran:  What’s the matter baby? Come sit at the table and have a slice of cake.

Five year old me: I aint eating that cake, it smells funny!

(Let me just interject for a second.  Now if your family is old school like mine, you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elder’s cooking! Especially if that elder is a family member, you just don’t do it! That is unless you want a black eye, ribs broken, missing teeth… you get the picture.)

Gran: Girl, get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of you!!

Oh geez…there’s that tone. You know it, you know it well. That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off. You know… that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives you’re delicate child-like mind nightmares for a month (or your whole life). Yeah that’s what I was hearing right about then. But still I was adamant. I would not eat that damn cake. That smell! It was just too potent. Now, you might be thinking, what’s the big deal? Surely you’ve smelled worse things than that cake before, which is very true. At that point in my life I’d smelled worse things before (WAY WORSE) but I’d never been subjected to eat those things either. Also, the stench of that pastry….it was just… so very not right. I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong, and that cake was definitely wrong! Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth. With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throat.

Gran: Come over here and take this plate now!

Okay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble. Even if my grandmother didn’t kill me, I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life! I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake. Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify. With every step she took it grew more and more intense! “Girl, you better take this cake!” she yelled holding the plate out in front of her. I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away. “No!” I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip, “I don’t want the cake, granny!!” but my pleas of desperation came to no avail. My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table, her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm. Suddenly, she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction, tilting my face towards hers. She looked down at me with an awful glare. Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Gran’s wrinkled sockets. Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before. “You will eat this cake!” She shouted through gritted teeth. “Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece!” 

I had never seen this side to my Gran before. My once sweet, devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares. My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes. I had never known terror like this. My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs. To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade! But you know what? There was something else I was more fearful of. Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devil-like grandmother, there was still something more bloodcurdling, more utterly terrifying than her…that fucking cake! 

“NO!!!!!!!” echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother. My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman. Her arms flew in the air (letting me go in the same instance) and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenly….CRACK!
The sound of my grandmother’s head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house. Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor. I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum. I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that. I bent down and looked into Gran’s half opened eyes. They weren’t black any more. They’d gone back to their normal brown again. Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all, watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red. 

To make a long story short the police were eventually called. My Gran’s weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body, and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it. Needless to say there were lots of screams. Oh, and you’re probably wondering what that smell was, right? I actually didn’t find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was. I was pouring it into my foster parent’s coffee one morning when it finally hit me…Cyanide. From the smell of it, Gran probably couldn’t have used too much either. Maybe half a teaspoon, give or take; totally undetectable to the average person’s nose…but not to mine. “So that’s what that was, go figure”.  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs. My foster parents passed away later on that day, I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really don’t.  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me? Was it because of what I’d done to Oscar, her cute little Maltese? I mean, if I’d known the oven wasn’t a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently. I was only two at the time. Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommy…that really was unfortunate. I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed. 

But anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I’m an adult now and those days are long behind me. I’m actually on my way to my boyfriend’s…excuse me….ex-boyfriend’s apartment right now. I’m visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with. And guess what? They just had a baby, isn’t that the sweetest thing.  ",A nose for things...,9,nosleep
1234FUCK,7,,3,1rhjmk,,8,"So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation, Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back. Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses. I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared. I mean that’s how I even know about this sub-reddit because I like reading it. And that’s one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation. 


	We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the 16 year old son was the one who had it happen the most. I went through every scenario I could think on the way there, Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal, one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things. Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children. The son was as I said earlier 16 and the girl was 14, they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such. I took a note about it but didn’t dwell on it that much. We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house. Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready. After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV (Point of view) cameras strapped on and started our investigation. My Uncle took the upstairs, our colleague took the first floor, And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own. 


I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walky-talky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker. He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely ( plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going.) Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen. And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness.. It answered back.
My instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were. And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be. My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly “You know who I am.” I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions. It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here. It chuckled again before I heard a small sound. Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it. My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before. I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks.  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement. I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message. My uncle did that a lot; he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible.  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob, it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime. I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open. 


I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door. The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly, even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself.  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room. I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more. I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror. It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing. I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over.  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water. My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out. I also saw a candle and a small match book and that’s when it hit me. My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head…. This was a “three kings” set up.


 I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped. My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help. After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice.. My voice whisper right into my ear. “ Do you know who I am now?” I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong. I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights. I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened. I just held out my camera to him and he took it. Before he watched it he asked me why I didn’t call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did. He looked at our colleague before watching the recording.


 After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in. I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in. and it was as I thought. It was a set up for “ The three kings.” I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was. He didn’t so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket “ and it has been used recently. The bucket was full of water. “ My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation. We went back home and I have decided to type this up. Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house.  


I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house. I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them.

deanjp92,2,,0,1re04y,,7,"When I was about 12 years old, I started making home movies with my cousin Ben and my friend Mark. My parents had bought me a new video camera for Christmas that year. We filmed a ton of crappy short films, some original stuff, but mostly spoofs of existing films, such as The Ring, Saw, and our personal favorite: Dr. Giggles. This was probably because horror films were so easy to make. All you needed was the biggest knife in the house and some ketchup packets. 

Now it was mid-October, nearly a year since I got the camera, and we were getting tired of filming at my house and in my backyard. We wanted to go somewhere exotic. So we walked around the block, where a small patch of woods stood next to the exit ramp of a highway that cut through my town. This is where we would shoot our next film, we decided. The basic plot was supposed to be “two hikers are killed by a mad man with a baseball bat.” 

When we had finished all of the planning, which wasn’t much (we didn’t write scripts), the sun was starting to set. This is what wanted. We weren’t going to shoot a scary movie in broad daylight. 

We made our way to the woods. I carried the camera, which had a light built into it, Ben carried the baseball bat/murder weapon (an oversized, bright red, plastic thing that looked like something out of a cartoon), and Mark carried three cans of tomato soup and a can opener in his backpack. 

This was the basic layout of the area: from the street of the block I live on, there was about 300 feet of grass until you got to the woods. The woods stretched for a little less than a mile, parallel to the street. The thickness of the woods varied throughout, but reached a maximum of about 200 feet. On the side of the woods opposite of the street was a small grassy ridge that made up the highway exit ramp.

When we got to the woods, we looked around for a spot where we could start the film. There seemed to be somewhat of a trail running through the middle of the woods. We decided we would walk the trail until we reached one end and start filming from there. I turned on the light of the camera, as it was completely dark at this point. We started walking. 

There was garbage everywhere. Gas station fountain drink cups, candy wrappers, old tires. The place was a dump. 

“I guess we’re not the first ones to pass through these parts,” I said jokingly, “Is this where garbage trucks dump their loads?” 

“This must be Oscar the Grouch’s summer home,” Ben said as he gestured to a small red tent we were approaching. We all burst into laughter. “Anybody home?!” Mark yelled, “It’s Burt, Ernie, and Big Bird, here for a visit!” The tent came into full view, and I shined the light in its direction.  

Suddenly we all shut up. A pair of big black boots were sticking out of the door of tent. We stopped as if paralyzed. My legs weren’t moving, and neither were the legs in the tent. I realized I was still shining the light directly on the tent and quickly pointed it at the ground. Ben whispered, “Let’s get outta here.” 

They started backing away, leaves crunching beneath their feet, but I still stood there, terrified. I don’t know why I was so scared. It was probably just some poor bum, sleeping out here in the woods. But hadn’t he heard us coming his way?

“Come on man, let’s go,” Mark quietly begged me. I finally got control of my legs. As I was backing away, curiosity got the best of me. I pointed the camera at the tent. 

No boots. 

I couldn’t breathe for a moment. Then I ran. Mark yelled at me, “What? What?!” I didn’t respond, but they ran with me. 

I didn’t know where I was leading them, I just wanted to get away from there, out of the woods, away from whoever was now roaming around, outside of his tent. I spotted a pair of headlights driving on the exit ramp and decided to head that way. We got out of the trees and caught our breath near the ramp guard rail. No more cars in sight. 

I told them what I had seen, and we agreed that we didn’t want to go back into the woods. We would walk along the ramp until we got to the street, and then walk back to my house from there. 

We were just about to leave when Ben asked me where the camera was. Shit. I must have dropped it while I was running. I wanted to just leave it, but I knew my parents would kill me if I told them I lost it. The three of us walked back down the ridge, being as quiet as we could and keeping our eyes peeled for any sign of the camera’s flashlight, which I couldn’t remember ever switching off.

We had just entered the trees when I saw a dim glow just a few feet ahead of us. I walked up to it slowly, and as I bent down to pick it up, another car slowly curved down the ramp, its headlights illuminating the area for a moment. 

In the brief second that the woods were lit up, I saw a pair of big black boots sitting just two or three feet in front of me. I almost cried. I choked on my own breath and looked up slowly, expecting to see a man attached to the boots, but there was no one. It was just a pair of boots, neatly sitting there. I was confused, but that didn’t stop me from running out of there with my friends as fast as I could, gripping the camera tightly with both hands. 

We reached the ramp, followed it to the street, and went home. Needless to say, we stuck to filming at my house from then on.

About a month later, my mom and I were driving home from my aunt’s house after Thanksgiving dinner. We got off on our usual exit. I searched the trees for a sign of the red tent, but couldn’t see it. We were stopped at the traffic light just off of the exit, when I noticed an old beggar standing on the corner asking passing cars for change. The street was full of cars, but he eventually fixed his sight on our car. I tried not to look at him, but I couldn’t help it. Finally I realized he wasn’t staring at our car. He was staring at me. I looked closer. 

Black boots. He was wearing a pair of big black boots. Before I had time to think, my window started rolling down. Quickly, I looked at my mom, who was handing me a dollar bill she had just pulled out of her purse. 

“Give this to that poor man, it’s Thanksgiving for heaven’s sake. I’ll slow down when get up to him.”

I took the dollar from her as if in a trance and looked back at the beggar. He was smiling at me with brown and yellow teeth. My heart was beating fast. I couldn’t breathe again. His eyes stayed fixed on mine. We inched toward him as the cars ahead of us slowly turned right. My mom stopped the car next to him, and I cautiously held the dollar out to him. “Happy Holidays,” he said, smiling. “Happy Holidays,” my mom replied, as I sat there speechless, his eyes never leaving mine.

Even as we drove away, I could still see him in the side mirror, standing there in his big black boots. Staring and smiling.

I swear there is something in my house I dont knw what it is, but its doing a good job of creeping me out. I have always felt this creepyness in my house. I really started noticing it when i was home alone. One day I was in my house when a LOUDD banging on the walls started. I was frightened so I went to run outside. Thats when my bedroom door slammed in my face. I opened it and proceded. I went to my laundry room. That door slammed in my face. Then on to my door connecting my garage and house. That did as well. I went into garage and outside. I was terrified and stayed outside of house until family came home. Another day i was at home alone and was hearing some bangs, by now i became used to it and wasnt as scared. I was on my laptop and was trying to translate some words into a different language. Google was taking a while to load. I didnt realize it did until i looked and my laptop was typing on its own.  The words were in some foreign language. I translated them into english. It said, "" Its a sunny day today isnt it?""  I wrote back ""No its not"". Because it wasnt it was cloudy. There was no response after that.

17minutes,5,,8,1r6us7,,7,"I'm... concerned.  
I was sick last night. Bedridden. It wasn't as bad as it sounds though.. I had a terrible fever, and it caused aching in all of my bones and terrible pain in my eyes and head. I wasn't sneezing though. My throat didn't hurt, my nose wasn't running, it was just the fever. I thought it was strange.  
I tried to stay optimistic, laughed it off. ""Hey, I don't have to go to class tomorrow!"" ""What if I'm going to be the first zombie? I'll have to type a story like that up for /r/nosleep.""  
Sleeping was difficult. The heat was unbearable but simultaneously, being outside of the blanket was far too cold even with my space heater on. I kept falling in and out, I'm not even sure if I got a wink of actual sleep. I'm beating around the bush.  
I woke up at 12:19. It's a curious case, I'm sure: How I recall such a vague moment in time. I'm sure the reason that number is burned into my head is because, well, it didn't change.  
I managed to force myself out of bed and grab a bite to eat, hoping a little bit of nutrition would help me feel better. Well, what's a better way to combat sickness than some leftover pizza at midnight? I grabbed the remaining pizza, threw it on a plate, and went to chuck it into the microwave. It still said 12:19, which I considered odd. I was positive that what I'd done since I woke up long extended the time period of a minute. I disregarded it, shit happens. I punched in two minutes and pressed start, but nothing happened.  
I was far too sick and far too tired to deal with a broken microwave, so I decided to just eat it cold.
I went to the living room where it was cooler and sat by the window. I love looking out the window at night. It's always so calm and serene, and no, I'm not afraid of something jumping out at me. There is a traffic signal within view from the window which always mesmerizes me. I don't know what it is, but the reds and greens stand out in the otherwise gray Massachusetts scenery.  
I had finished the pizza. I thought I'd eaten it fast, considering the light never changed. I threw my plate away and went back to my bedroom, only to see the clock staring right at me.  
12:19.  
I would think it was a weird dream. I have those a lot and they're always vivid. Dreaming vividly is sort of an ""unconscious talent"" of mine. The only thing is, when I opened the fridge in the morning, there was no pizza left.  
  
UPDATE (1 day later): I didn't have any odd experiences last night. Although I was scared to sleep in the dark due to my spending all night on nosleep, I slept well.

OsamaBinHiding,3,,1,1rhxdo,,6,"Last night was like every other night for me. Have dinner on my own in my small, yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV. Around 9 or 10 o'clock, I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time. The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was 12 o""clock. 

""Where did the time go?"" I thought. It had only felt like a few minutes. However, this was a normal occurrence for me. The world kind of, disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me, I can't break out of it.

I had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought ""Fuck, I better try and get some sleep"" 

See, I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city. So it isn't uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head. I wouldn't consider myself someone who doesn't get scared easily but when you're familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window - you tend to grow some thick skin.

Last night wasn't like any other night in my flat though. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was alone. My flatmate - let's call him, Evan for the sake of the story, was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but he's away a lot so I'm used to spending a long period of time on my own. My usual night routine of showering, brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something. My drawers were all pulled open. 

To most people, this is probably nothing - but for me it wasn't normal. I suffer from borderline OCD and everything, especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order. I hadn't left my flat today either. 

""I'm too tired for this shit"" I thought and went to bed. 

It's weird though isn't it? That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe, like nothing can hurt you. I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night. Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safe.

Well, not anymore for me. Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards - no biggy, right? However, as I drew closer to conscientious, I realised that these creaking sounds weren't coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bed.

And that's when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold, coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed.

TaylorBonaseraSr,0,,2,1rhb2e,,5,"I can explain why I'm so afraid of mirrors, or anything that could reflect light, even a glass door. It's so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes, but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible. She broke my mirror the first time, just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces. It was such a pain to have to clean all that up. I got at least five cuts. But she didn't care. At the very least she didn't laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster. At least she was nice enough to check herself for that. Anyway, I got my mirror replaced. She didn't break the bathroom mirror again, but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it. I don't understand how she did it, it's pressed up right against the wall. She'd have to ram her body sideways. She didn't even have any visible cuts. She told me she was sorry, and that she would try not to do it again. I believed her, and she was true to her word. But soon enough, I hear the crashing again. But this time it's my door. The majority of my glass door has been smashed through, but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo. No one lives here that has a body shaped like that. The other times I checked her she didn't have any cuts on her, but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her, but she couldn't explain what had happened. When the doctor asked, neither could I, because I hadn't been there. It's strange how selective she is; she won't smash into anything except mirrors or glass-looking things. Anywhere there isn't this kind of stuff, nothing bad happens. She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that, and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. She talks to me about it so often I feel like I'm beginning to share the feeling.

It's starting to unnerve me, and I don't want to live with her anymore. But I can't break the joint liability contract. She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection, so I did. But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks I'm not looking.

One day I'd had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room. It couldn't hurt, just for a little while when she couldn't see. She wouldn't notice. But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection, I saw her standing there. So close. She was so ugly. She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face. She followed me here, to my own room. I couldn't turn around. There was no point. I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldn't keep a straight posture. She was laughing at me.

But I'd heard that laugh somewhere before. And I'd seen that face before too. It looked so much like my own. She must have heard my thoughts, because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection. I couldn't stand the sight of her face anymore, it was so scary. It'd been such a long time since I'd spent so many minutes just staring at her. I had to take control. So I bashed the bedroom mirror in, balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skin.

It'd been so long since I'd last done that. Now every time I look, I can see her, feel her, I see her staring at her...our...reflection, through my eyes.",My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep
WillOTP,2,,1,1rc02m,,4,"My house is relatively an uneventful place. In the middle of nowhere in a Hollow in some backwoods hick town. It is a plain double wide, only here since 1994, scattered among normal homes. Dressed up to look like any other house, it is overall a lovely place to live. There is nothing noteworthy about this house until you stay a night in it. 

As my best friend has said himself, something about this home at night simply does not feel right. It feels odd. Strange. Thick air and eyes on your back. The backdoor of my kitchen is the worst, like someone is just waiting for you to turn around. Sometimes I struggle to stay alone in it, but for the most part I cope. 

That is, of course, until this morning. A late night's reading left me tired, in need of stretching, I wandered through my hallway into the kitchen. 

If you've ever been in a double wide, you'll know what I mean when I describe the layout of my home. 

My kitchen is partially open, a large walkway into the home only interrupted a wall with a pair of frosted glass windows peering in. If you walk straight, you'll come into my living room. On the left, through a short walk through the living room, is a bedroom+bath combo. On the right a spare bedroom, and another bedroom+bath combo (My room).

Sometime between 6 and 7AM I repeat a habit. I turn the TV on, turn on the living room light, and I wander my way into the kitchen. Making my way to my back door, peering out of the window at my yard and the graveyard that lies such a short distance away. I get goosebumps, as I so often do, wondering what makes me feel this sickly. Pushing it down into the pit of my stomach, I wander out of the small room into my kitchen, deciding to just go back to my room.

Walking back through the home, watching the colored laminated on the floor pass by, I look up and pause in horror.

My TV is on but I hear no sound. The colors pass by in my vision without any thought in the world. I am not focused on them.

I am focused on the massive white figure looming by my couch. I hear no noise it makes no noise. It stand tall, if you could call it standing - 6'5 perhaps. There is nothing special about it at all. I see no arms, no feet, no features.

And it was snow white. From top to bottom, there was no difference in color.

It doesn't walk. It has no feet. It wouldn't be so inaccurate to call it a white shadow, a shape similar to a person but without their details, but even more a blur.

It glides over the floor, passing through my living room to my bedroom without a sound or a movement except the position of its body. 

A few moments pass as I watch it go, and only once I hear my TV sound in my ear again do I move, running up to look in my bedroom only to find it as it was before, and nothing inside. 

Nosleep, forgive the corny title but I don't know what else to call it.

TreasureHouseofDoom,12,,75,1r7ztj,,3,"Dr Jefferies study lay before me, energy cleared and house relatively empty, but delving into other people's personal space isn't as easy for me as it may be for others.  Always, my parents have cautioned me and my siblings about the dangers of disrupting others' heirlooms, cherishables, and privacy.  I knew for instance that each of us has deep connection to those things he or she treasures, even if we are not personally aware of any sort of psychic ability and that some items carry with them certain protections.  A locket passed from mother to daughter, for instance, may have compound energies susceptible to unleash if disrespected.  Bring into this potential release of energy against an interloper a variable such as a holy relic or other spiritually imbued item and forces not easily rectified are to be expected.  But more profound than these fears of conflict beyond my control was the deep seated notion in me that all people, those among us and those just beyond, ever beyond, are entitled to their privacy, respect beyond measure, peace.  I'd done a pretty good job of jeopardizing such peace, and now it was time for me to make things right, but maybe, too, I would be able to bring more than satisfactory comfort.  Perhaps this predicament would be remedied with two little girls finding their way to Bliss.

""Whatever Bliss is."" I heard someone say over my shoulder.  Just to my left was a door that I presumed opened into the first room to the right of the hall.  Foreboding consumed my thoughts only a moment before I pushed it out of my mind and far from my heart.  Mama and Aunt Lucia would have called the voice ""Naysayer,"" and I knew far more than I needed about its powers.  

'The only power Naysayers have is anti-power,' I remembered my mother saying. 'They're the weakest link on a dark, rusted chain.  When all else fails, Naysayers speak to hinder what must be done for Good.' I must have been very young when I heard her say this, and I wasn't even sure she had said it to me.  Truth was, respect for privacy aside, I was a bit of an ease dropper by nature, and as far as I knew, she had been speaking to a friend or relative.   But the information, this reminder over time, was powerful strength to me.  I pushed the Naysayer from my mind.

There are two very important techniques to remember as one sets her mind to investigating scene and history.  First, proceed in an orderly and logical manner as often and well as possible.  Turn over every clue for deeper consideration, but remember to return every item examined to its proper place whenever feasible.  Second, follow instinct and revelation as each presents itself.  Order and Logic have their places, but in highly energized situations, short cuts sometimes arise.  Consult your inner voice in regards to each, and if that voice is true and strong in most situations, trust it now.

Having been involved in vintage house restoration through my mother's real estate dealings, I knew a thing or two about the sorts of places used as secret compartments.  Knobs on banisters, loose boards, trim and façade might function as easily concealed opening for places to hide cash or jewels, even the sorts of things others might never suspect had any value at all.  

Quick inspection of the study revealed a few components that might serve in such a fashion.  Among them were medallions at the corners of the door and window frames, along the elaborate built-in bookcases, and to the left and right of the fireplace, attached just beneath the mantle shelf. I presumed such opening would reveal a deep but narrow space.  Two doors, three windows, and an entire wall of shelving equalled 28 medallions.  There wasn't time to waste, so I decided the best method was to eyeball each for lopsidedness or failure to sit flush in place.  Any looseness might indicate wear and tear surpassing stationary use. Using the chair instrumental in bringing the ouija board to our attention to begin with as stool, I set myself to this task but came up short when I discovered each of the medallions at the windows and the doors paint sealed.  And the medallions along the shelves were all flush.  

Glad not to have wasted too much time in this pursuit, I set about removing books from shelves, five at a time, flipping through each carefully, feeling the plank of the shelf beneath and the wood behind to detect any anomaly.  This was time consuming but revealed nothing out of the ordinary.  By now I was becoming dejected and increasingly worried.  The sun lower in the sky, I saw beams of it peeking past the drapes at the center of three tall windows.  Now I pulled each to its corresponding side, let mid-afternoon light push through.  At first I only warmed myself in this, wondering why I hadn't bothered to bring more light into the room to start, but now I noticed something I hadn't before.  With my back to the door, it would have been virtually impossible to detect.    

From the outside of the study, the door was virtually mundane--heavy oak painted white, thick framework, medallions at the corners, nothing more. But from the inside, a fretwork panel of heavy design was fitted to meet the top of the door from corner to corner as if a transom window were hidden behind it.  And now, light pouring into graze the top of the desk in the center of the room hit a finely polished desk set, ricocheting to the fret work and passing through.  From behind, tiny glows of red and ember were cast against the white paint gingerbread.

Excitedly, I carried the chair across the room, stood on top of it hoping to budge the fretwork.  There was no such luck at this height.  I looked for something sturdy  to make me taller, but there wasn't anything else in here suitable for that. I'd have to grab a stool I'd seen in the kitchen earlier.  It troubled me to leave the study unattended, and I was not unafraid to travel the hall to the kitchen again.  The energy pushed from this room might have concentrated along that dark corridor, and--tired as I was--I worried that my resolve might be weaker now.   The best path, I decided, was through the front door and around the side of the house, and besides, 'I could use the fresh air,' I thought.

Opening the front door, surprise of warm air pressed against me.  For the better part of the last twenty-four hours, chill had held me in its grip, and now I basked in the warm mugginess of a typical Alabama fall day.  'Storms on the way,' someone said from the front walk, and when I looked down from my place on the porch, the broad smile of a tall man greeted me.  It didn't occur to me to wonder what he was doing here, and perhaps I already knew who he was.
'Miss Lucia, she's a fine woman, she told me you might need a few things,' and I walked to meet him with a firm, thankful handshake. His grasp was strong, and for a moment I pondered whether or not he might be just some local with a keen sense of what most couldn't see, some bright energy my aunt had detected from the other side, but his overalls and flannel shirt were old-fashioned even by farm standards, and the glow emanating from him spoke of peace and tranquility not found here on Earth.

'Name's Big Roy, Miss Julianne. And I'll help however I can. You got to know I love both those little girls.  Not one of them's an angel, but neither is they a devil.' And I was glad to find his grip strong now, if only for a moment.  He must've been a real force in life to bring such energy to me now.

""I've found a fret panel above the door in the study, Big Roy,"" I said.  ""And I need a ladder and maybe a hammer to remove it.""

Big Roy looked down for a moment, considered the peace of Heaven against the Hell of Life perhaps, then spoke.  'No, Ma'am.  What you need is a No.2 Goodell Brothers screwdriver.' Reaching into a pocket at his hip, he pulled out a relic to share with me.   'I made that fretwork for Mrs Moseley, put it up to hide a few things.' 

His dark marble eyes clouded, and he looked past the house to the back yard.  I followed the path his thoughts traveled, and suddenly we weren't in the front yard anymore.  Ahead of us stood the original kitchen, rock wall reminder of the boundaries between two converging worlds.  Within, two little girls working on some secret danced across the windows in silhouette.  The smell of fudge was heavy again, and laughter wafted, too, on convected breeze.

'That'll be Vassar Fudge,' Big Roy said.  'Never could stand the taste of it.  Mrs Moseley won't like it in the house, not since the fire.  But I swear, this place always smelled of barbecue and chocolate after that.' He shivered, tear at his eye, and I placed my left hand to his right arm, felt the sinew hard work makes, the strength of spirit hard life breeds, the exhaustion such projection brought from him. His memories were clues I could not cast away, but feeling the drain it made on his soul saddened me.

""Is this the only way, Big Roy?"" I asked sincerely, but he only smiled sadly back at me.

'Whatever it takes to bring peace, Ma'am.' Such is the nature of love and sacrifice, and now I committed the lessons Big Roy taught to memory, heart, spirit.

His pulse quickening at my fingertips, I felt the rush of energy course through me, inflate my heart.  Now was the time to prepare myself for the sort of vision that could drive some to madness, and just as I realized this, heat burst against my face like revelation of Armageddon.  Closing my eyes for only a moment, I turned now to see the pretty kitchen erupting in flames.  The shrieks of little girls trapped inside overwhelmed me, and now Big Roy ran toward the house as he had that day so many years ago, relived horrible moments, to break a window.  And there was Mary falling through to fall into his strong arms, but she reached back, scrambled to retrieve her sweet friend, the girl who might have been her sister always.  Big Roy pulled her more tightly to his chest, held her against the struggle she made, and ran from the porch, the pop and sizzle of pine planks harmonizing backdrop against the excruciating, rising melody of Sweet Dulcie's screams. 

Puddle of sweat and tears, I prayed for strength to continue as wails echoed through me.  And now I felt the whistling brush of silk against one cheek and the coarse scrape of wool against the other as two mothers ran to collect babies, only one to have her arms filled with a bundle of love ever again.  Big Roy passed Mary to her Mama's arms, and now he rushed to pull Mrs Moseley from the porch, just as the pretty gingerbreaded roof above it collapsed in spark and flame.  

Salt of sweat and tears at my lips, I wretched as the fragrances Big Roy had described--barbecue and chocolate engulfed me.

Darrenshan66,1,,3,1r0xps,,3,"I ran through the cornfield, I wanted to get out of there before the storm reached the field. I had just gotten into my truck when I remembered I had left the hose hooked up to the irrigator. I got out and ran, the wind was picking up and the sky was becoming dark. I had just reached the hose and was about to turn off the water when I noticed something move out of the corner of my eye. I quickly turned to look at whatever was there, but all I could see was the wind violently shaking the cornstalks. I shrugged and disconnected the hose. I was right about to return to my truck when I noticed something... The sky was now pitch black. The only things I had to light my path were the tiny flashlight on my truck keys, and the occasional lightning strike. I ran in the direction I thought my truck was in, I stopped running when I realized that thanks to the dark, I was completely lost in the field. I noticed a dark shape sticking out of the corn in front of me. I stuck out my hands and slowly walked toward it. It felt like it was made out of metal, so I turned on my flashlight to get a better view. What I saw made my blood run cold. The huge object that was buried in the dirt was my truck! It looked like it had been torn apart and thrown! ""Who the hell?"", I said, looking at the destroyed vehicle. Suddenly, I heard a voice whisper in my ear... ""Dont you mean WHAT the hell?"" 
I jumped at the sound of the voice, I turned around and shined the flashlight in the direction the voice came from but nothing was there. ""Who ARE YOU?"", I screamed ""YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?!?!"" I stood, waiting for an anwser, when the flashlight went out, then some unseen foe with tremendous strength wrenched it from my hand. I took off running into the rows of corn, the storm had picked up and I was being drenched with the now falling rain. I ran until I slammed into a wooden object in front of me. I dropped to the ground, the pain in my nose and the warm and sticky feeling in my mouth told me my nose was broken. I looked up at what I had hit, a flash of lightning revealed that I was staring at a cross. It was made out of crude wood and was held together using an old, crumbling rope. I slumped to my knees and stared at the sky, my eyes burning from the rain. ""God!!! What is doing this?!?!"" I received no reply.
I looked around wildly and shouted ""Where are you?!?? What do you want?!???"" I shuddered as a familier voice whispered back ""YOU""
Suddenly, I was picked up and thrown into the cross. It snapped as I barrled into it. I rolled into a nearby row of corn and stood up. My leg was in horrible pain. Lightning flashed again and I saw the splintered remains of the cross sticking out of my leg. I limped as fast as I could, my leg was killing me. I felt something quickly aproaching my back. I told myself ""Don't look back just keep running!"" I burst out of the field and dropped to the ground. I ran my hands along the ground and was overjoyed to feel asphalt. I stood up and limped down the road. The clouds parted above me and the moon shined down on the field. I came to an awful realization. Although I could see the corn whipping back and forth, I couldn't hear any wind. A dark, large mass burst out the the field and landed on the road. The clouds covered the moon again as the creature unfolded to show its decrepid features. It was completly covered in a black, whispy cloth that was torn and reaked of decay. It had two red glowing eyes burning in the center of its dark face. I turned and tried to run, but I dropped. The creature took massive strides toward me, It was at least eight feet tall and I noticed it wore a hood. I got up and sprinted down the road, pain ruptured from my leg but I ignored it, I ran inside a barn and locked the door. I sat on a stack of hay bails and listened. I heard silence. Then, as if it were a faint whisper, I heard my name being called outside the barn. Cameron... Cameron... I covered my ears. I saw the door fly open but nothing entered the barn. I slowly took my hands away from my ears, tears rolled down my face. I lost all control and yelled ""Why did you leave?!??!!"" All the hairs on the back of my neck stood up as something right behind me whispered ""I didn't.""",The Storm,6,nosleep
SeaDweller7,2,,2,1rhilw,,4,"I go to a regular school, its kindergarten to year twelve, so its pretty big. But, my school is an old public school, and the principle is ancient. Me? I am in year twelve, and I’m graduating next year, and my friends said I should share this story with you guys. 

Ok, where to start? Well, at my school we have a pretty serious problem with bullies, and when I say serious I mean it. One year our school was even on the news, but it was pretty traumatic. When I was in year nine, there was this little girl in fifth grade, called Melody. Her and me sort of talked sometimes, as she was a new girl and I was her school buddy (to show her around and stuff) She was a sort of short, curly brown haired, blue eyed and geeky girl. Glasses and all of that stuff, so your stereotypical nerd. Which pretty much was what she was.

After I moved up in to Tenth grade it was pretty clear that she was being bullied. Instead of gossiping or playing with the other girls, she just sort of walked around the school... bouncing a tennis ball and wandering around the grounds of the school. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Then, half way through the year, school was stopped. During lunch they lined us up and called our parents. Sent us home. They just said there was an accident. My mother and father lived in Melbourne and I lived with my uncle and aunty, and they’re pretty laid back and all ‘come home when you feel’ so I stayed at school.

I saw five year six girls with that sort of ‘we know nothing it wasn’t us we didn’t do anything’ look on their face before I saw an ambulance and a white body bag. Out of the end of the body bag stuck out locks of curly brown hair, and the always-screeching birds seemed to sing a sweet tune. A melody.

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Last week we had a substitute teacher who started screaming at a girl who was outside bouncing her ball after the end of lunch bell had rung. She didn’t realise Melody wouldn’t listen. 

No one knew why the back stairs from German were out of bounds for two months, and why the German teacher quit. No one asked why those five girls we’re stared at my Melody’s sort of... ghost.

I pieced it together. A simple push, a simple tumble. A simple death.

No one cares, all the kids just skip past her, all the laughter swallows up her silence. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

The doctor said that he can live normally without a heart transplant but we have to be alarmed all the time. Timmy is six now. My wife passed away when she was giving birth. I took good care of him since then. This morning I was drinking my coffee as always. Timmy was sitting at the table having breakfast and he was so pumped to go to school for the first time.I left some coffee in my mug and went to have a bath.i was in there for like ten minutes and when I came out  my son was already standing in the door and just made me hurry. I put my clothes on fast and opened the door for my smiling son. He was just smiling all the way. I'm much taller than him but he was always meters forward. "" Don't rush kid! "" He stopped. Turned back and looked in my eyes. The next moment he was lying on the ground. I ran to him. His heart just suddenly stopped. I Couldn't do anything. I tried to CPR but nothing .. My son's dead body was just hanging in my arms. I cried. The only one who I had left me. Timmy was dead.
At the morgue the doctors sent me home to rest. They didn't know why his heart stopped. My tears were flowing continuously on my way home. I stepped in the door, took off my jacket and put my keys on the table next to my empty mug. I wanted to sleep but I couldn't. I washed my face in the sink and as soon as I looked into that fucking mirror I cried. I lied in the bed for hours but nothing.. I just couldn't sleep. Suddenly I widely opened my eyes. My pupils shrunk. I've put my keys next to my empty mug. Slowly walked out to the table, looked into the mug. Some sugar left on the bottom. The sudden realization made me feel sick. I was about to throw up. I felt guilty.

That's how my Friday morning started.  7AM, and I haven't even had any coffee yet.  In hindsight, it turns out that I wouldn't need coffee.

I never liked that address.  It was a creepy looking compound.  Perhaps you want to call it a lot or a property, but it was always a compound to me.  Somewhere where bad things happened, they were just really good at keeping them inside.

We left the station, and made our way 10 minutes west.  It was on the outskirts of the city, and the sirens tore through the only road leading there.  As we pulled up, we saw a female with black hair, matted with blood and in a white gown.  She was lying face down, and we should've stayed in the medic.  We were told to wait for police, but during shift change...that could take forever.  She could be dead by then.  We strapped on gloves, threw our trauma bag over our shoulder and made our way to our patient.  The first thing that hit me was the twitching.  She was twitching her fingers and toes.  I saw the hair curled up in small concentrated spots in her hair.  It wasn't until we got closer that we realized why they were curled up; they were twisted by a drill bit.

We rolled her over, wondering what sick fuck got a hold of her, but the other side was worse.  She had been crushed, but evenly crushed.  It was as if it was done by a machine.  She was flat as a piece of three-quarter inch plywood.

Well, she was dead and there was nothing we could do about it.  ""Injuries incompatible with life"" was what our protocols stated.  That means that we didn't even have to try, because trying was futile.  We sprinted back to the medic and looked around.  Nothing.  We couldn't even see the patient.

Then it hit me.  We couldn't see the patient from the road.  There was nothing even slightly resembling a pedestrian around here, and we couldn't see her from the road.

""GET IN THE UNIT""  ""GET IN THE UNIT""  My partner was wheeling and I was healing, but my screams of concern weren't loud enough or fast enough.  He yelled, and I saw something that I'll never forget coming out of those woods.  They were everywhere, and they were surrounding us.  Their teeth were sharp, they were covered in blood, and they looked like some sort of hybrid between a little girl and a black hole.   We ran, but the only place to run was through the open gate.

We hit our little red Mayday button on our radios, which opened up the channel of our lapel mics.

LadyVengeance0,2,,3,1rdv1z,,3,"I woke up, stretched my arms and got up.

It was mid-summer, already warm and sunny and the birds outside were twittering.

I don’t know why but I was in a very good mood. I took a look out of my window, a very peaceful neighborhood.

My neighbors were working in their beautifully manicured gardens. I used to greet them but around 2 weeks ago they started to give me this strange look when I walked by. It was obviously weird to them that I was trying to be nice to everyone. I’ve never been like that, but I think I finally realized that life is more than just regrets, lies and all that bad stuff that happens every day. I mean, I got a new job, after 5 years of unemployment.

I went straight to the bathroom and brushed my teeth. I caught myself humming which I normally don’t do. But whatever I did, I couldn’t miss the feeling that I forgot something and I couldn’t remember what it was.

""Man, you look awesome today."" I said to myself and I gave my reflection in the mirror a wink. Just like I said, I felt good. I went downstairs and headed to the kitchen. I decided to prepare breakfast for me and my parents, just because I felt like it.

""Good morning, everyone!"" ""Good morning, darling."" My parents sat there in front of the TV, watching their favorite show. They recently started doing that; getting up early and watch TV. I stood there in the kitchen and asked: ""Scrambled or fried?"" and they would answer ""Whatever you like, sweetie pie.""

""So what are you guys doing today? Will you just stay here and watch TV again? We should enjoy the wonderful weather as long it’s warm outside, but I’m really sorry. I think I can’t join you, guess why!""

""…""

""Well, I have a new job, as a barkeeper. I think it will be a lot of fun, but I have to hurry now before I’m too late for my first day of work. I know you don’t like this and you would rather want me to have a normal job, but I can’t change it. It’ll do it for now.""

I was really excited. I opened the door, took a deep breath and realized that Mrs. Cartridge from next door was watering her flowers. I waved to her with a big smile on my face and there again, she just responded with that distracted glance. I don’t know what this neighbourhood was up to, but I could tell it was no good. They didn’t even like me from the start. As soon as we moved into this house, you could tell that these people didn’t want you to stay.

I still can remember this one Halloween. I think I was about 12 years old and I’ve always been a big fan of horror movies. My parents wouldn’t let me watch them, but I did it secretly when they were asleep. So I wanted the best costume ever: I only wished for a hockey mask and something similar to a machete. I wanted to look like Jason from the horror movies. My parents weren’t really happy about it, but it was Halloween, so what? I really enjoyed scaring the other kids, even the older ones. There was just one problem about it; for one kid this wasn’t as amusing as it was to me. He was so scared that he literally pissed his pants and of course he told his father about the incident. He rang at our house and told my parents that they would regret buying me such a costume, they should better take care of me and my strange hobbies and that I wasn’t even close to normal. What a stupid thing to say when you don’t even know me. 

Guess what he did the Halloween after. He grabbed me, threw me in his car and drove to the nearest lake. It was at the end of October and damn cold outside. He ripped my clothes apart and I really tried to fight back but this man was about 6.5 feet tall and very muscular. He forcefully put my head in the water. I thought I would die; that he would drown me in that damn lake. But he dragged me up again and asked me: 'Who is scared now, huh?' and then he would continue this over and over again. He left me there, naked, freezing, gasping,… but I felt nothing. I was empty. I went back home, all the kids were laughing at me, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to get home and get some rest. I never told my parents about what happened that day, but I could tell that this was just the beginning of it all.

My relationship to my parents was never that good. We argued a lot, we insulted each other… They really pissed me off sometimes.

""Go and get a job already!"" ""Stop sitting around like a lazy bugger."" ""I wish I’d have never been pregnant with you.""

Harsh tones, rough times, but in the meantime I started to understand their worries and doubts. Maybe that’s why our relation was getting better now every day. I got up off my ass and did something. I looked for a job, I’m cleaning the dishes from time to time, because my mom started to rebel and stopped doing anything in the household. That’s also the reason why it started to smell so bad in the kitchen. I now was a busy man; I couldn’t clean the house all day long. I had better things to do. I don’t even know if my parents liked what I was cooking for them. They didn’t eat at all, sometimes they only tried one fork saying to me 'You did a great job, honey, but we aren’t hungry.' I know that my cookeries weren’t the best and they just wanted to be polite and nice. So I had to throw away almost all of the food. The leftovers started to moulder and oozed a disgusting smell. I’m a messy person; I don’t really give a shit if my room looks untidy or the dishes are dirty.

My first day at work was really exciting. I’ve worked as a barkeeper a few years ago. I was still good at mixing drinks and serving them. I really enjoyed the atmosphere in that bar. It smelled like old wood and some of the lights were broken and therefore it was quite dark in there. Most people who came in here were at least 50 years old. The few women that found their way in here were prostitutes, looking for a cheap jag. I envied them so much; you earn money having sex with other people. And they made good money out of it. You can judge me, but I have my own opinion about that topic. If I was a girl, I would do exactly the same.

""So, and you’re the new barkeeper here? What a hell of a man you are, such a lovely face. You shouldn’t even be here, darling"", one of the prostitutes hit on me. ""But I really like it in here. Dreary places always attracted me. And on top of that, I got to know you, my dear lady."" ""My name’s Adora. Pleased to meet you. So, what’s your poison?"" 

We really enjoyed each other’s presence and talked a lot; about her job, about her family in Texas, etc. She asked me to come with her after my shift had finished. One thing led to another and we ended up in her bedroom. I waited ‘til she fell asleep and sneaked out of her apartment. I rather sleep in my own bed than somewhere else. I was hoping that my parents were already sleeping, but when I got home I saw them sitting in front of the TV. It was 4am in the morning, did they seriously stay awake ‘til I got home? Just to shellac me?

""I’m sorry that I’m so late… I hope you’re not-"" ""It’s okay, honey. Don’t worry."" I felt relieved. I ran straight upstairs into my room and lay down on my bed with a big smile on my face. My life couldn’t be any better.

I woke up, stretched my arms, yawned and took a look out of the window. It was raining, but still warm outside. I strolled into the bathroom and brushed my teeth. I recalled what happened yesterday and a smile lighted up my face. Having finished brushing my teeth I headed downstairs to prepare some breakfast. I greeted my parents delightfully and decided to make some pancakes. The only problem with that was that all the clean dishes and pans were gone and so I had to scrape the mouldering leftovers off of them. I know that’s not really how you should do that, but I had to hurry, otherwise I’d have been late for work.

""I hope you don’t mind that I used the dirty dishes to serve the pancakes on. I’ve got an idea. Maybe we should go out for a ride tomorrow; you both haven’t left the house in weeks now. Dad, I know you hate your boss, but maybe you should consider going back to work next week.""

So, what’s the plan? Maybe we should drive to the lake and go fishing. That’s a good idea. It’s been years since Dad and I were going on a fishing trip together. I went to work and there again in the right corner sat Adora with her two friends.

""You nasty boy sneaked out of my bed last night. I thought we had a lot of fun."" ""We did. I just wasn’t comfortable sleeping in another bed than mine. I hope you’re not angry with me."" ""No, it’s okay, cutie. Do you have plans for tomorrow? Maybe we could stay all day long in my bed and do – you know – dirty stuff."" ""I’m sorry, but I promised my parents that we’re going to the lake for a few hours, but maybe you could join us! That would be great."" ""I don’t really know, honey. I’m not that kind of person you should introduce to your parents."" ""Don’t be silly. We’re just chilling at the lake for two hours and afterwards we can do whatever you want.' 'Well then, if it’s just for two hours, I’m okay with that.""

I was excited like a little kid on Christmas Eve. I helped my parents to get in the car. Adora said she would wait at the lake, so that my parents didn’t get to know where she lived because it was some kind of embarrassing for her showing her poverty. When we got there, Adora approached the car, opened the passenger door and bursted out with a high pitched scream.

""What the fuck is wrong?"" I asked her. ""Oh…my…god…"" With tears in her eyes she ran off. What the hell was that? I don’t know that freaked her out that much. ""I’m sorry guys… I really thought she was something special."" ""It’s okay, honey. Don’t be sad. For everything there’s a season. Maybe she wasn’t the right one for you."" ""Thank you, Mom…Dad. I love you."" ""We love you, too, son."" 'Maybe we should go home for today. I’m not really in the mood for fishing right now.""

I drove back to our house and now there was Mrs. Cartridge again. She was cutting her rose bed. When I opened the door to help my parents getting out of the car, she dropped her garden shears and clasped her hands over her mouth. She looked like she saw a ghost. People these days… just annoying.

We were sitting in front of the TV and watched one of my favorite shows. I felt comfortable spending time with my beloved parents. I can’t remember the last time we just sat there without arguing; being a family again. Suddenly, I noticed piercing sounds of sirens from outside. Police cars stopped by near our house. What happened? Was Mrs. Cartridge in danger? What if something happened to her? I would never forgive myself. I could have helped her.

""This is the police! Open up!"" They pounded wildly against our front door. What the hell was going on? ""Open the damn door! Otherwise we’re coming in!""

What? No. I gave in and opened the door just to check out what the hell they wanted from us. They bursted into our hallway and pushed me aside. All of them were armed. There were about 3 or 4 police cars parking in front of our house. What the hell was going on? Did Mrs. Cartridge call the police? Why? One of the police officers went into the living room and yelled:

""Oh my fucking god… guys… two dead people in the living room. Man, that’s fucking disgusting."" The police officer came back and gave me a disguised look.

'""You crazy motherfucker. Get him the handcuffs on. He might be dangerous."" ""What? No. I’m not dangerous. I was just sitting there with my parents watching TV. This is not a crime!"" ""'You have the right to remain silent when questioned. Anything you say or do may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right…""

All I heard were the sirens and all I saw where the lights everywhere. I felt like I was in a movie, that this wasn’t real. They can’t arrest me. I’ve not committed any crime.

""Estimated time of death: 3 weeks ago. That’s why the neighbors complained about the smell. The cause of death is currently unknown, but what we can say is that they died an unnatural death.""

I just wanted to have a normal family, without any rhubarb. I’ve never loved my parents that much as I did the last 3 weeks. It was so calm and peaceful…
",Just an ordinary day,6,nosleep
Lnzy1,2,,1,1rdoii,,6,"My Grandmother made porcelain dolls, filling her golden years and every inch of available shelf space in the modest desert home she shared with my Grandfather with small breakable people. They were all dressed in elaborate frills and lace, hand crafted bonnets and daintily painted faces. They never scared me as a child as you would think a house full of unmoving glass eyes would. Instead, they compelled me to play and to dream. For my fifth birthday, Grandma gifted me with a pair dolls I named Lilly and Lanis. They were twin baby dolls dressed in bright pink and blue corduroy overalls. I took them everywhere and they filled me with the assurance that I would be a fantastic mother. One day as I helped Grandma clean out her shed, I knocked over a piece of wood that smacked int the wall. A panel of the wall popped off the nails holding it in place and tumbled to the ground with a clatter. Through the dust tinted air, I spotted a large metal tin inside. I instinctively went to reach for the item when my Grandmother slapped my hand away and quickly replacing the misplaced board, securing in place with a heavy tool box. 

“Leave it be,” she told me sternly. The next morning as we readied to leave and return home, I slipped away and back to the shed. With some effort, I was able to push away the tool box and the board fell away with a sweep of my hand. I quickly pulled the tin box out and opened it, an unbridled urge to know pulling at me. 

It was a doll. 

Its dress was of a deep maroon lined with soft black velvet, ready for the deepest of winters. Its face, white and pale as any porcelain, was in fact made of wood. Her eyes had been covered with a red ribbon. Before I could examine the doll further, the sound of my mother's voice jolted me back to reality and I hastily shoved the doll my bag. When I got home, I sat on my bed with the doll, pulling my fingers through the wiry black curls. The red ribbon was tied with an impossible knot so I went to the kitchen and fetched a pair of scissors. Stripping off the ribbon, I beheld the deep amber eyes of the wooden doll for the first time...

...and I felt a twinge of unease. 

It was only after seeing the dolls face in its entirety that I realized...how wrong it looked. The eyes seemed to focus straight at me with unnerving intensity, not the vague dead gaze of Grandma's other dolls. The eyebrows were painted a tad too narrow,and the sides of its mouth drooped ever so slightly. The doll looked...angry. I put the doll back into my bag and set it aside. 

A few nights later we received an abrupt call in the middle of the night. Grandma has passed away suddenly of a heart attack. While I changed my clothes, I looked up and noticed the items my dresser had been disturbed. My pink bejeweled box of assorted costume jewelry and nick knacks had been pushed aside and in their place sat the wooden doll. I stared at it for a moment, trying to think back to when I had placed it there. My mind was a jumble with thoughts of my now dead Grandmother and windowed Grandfather. The doll was insignificant. So it was only later after I had returned from a long day of mutual grieving with relatives that I notice the expression on the dolls face did not appear as severe as I remembered it when I first beheld it. I chalked it up to being my own imagination and let the thought escape my mind.

A few days after the funeral, I came home from school to find Lilly and Linus, the dolls Grandma had made for me, broken on the floor and in pieces. Their brightly colored overall slashed. I wailed at the sight of them and tried to put the shattered faces back together, tears of anguish at finally having a real sense of my loss. It was not just the dolls themselves, but the glow of warmth from my Grandmother's touch seemed to have left them. She was not coming back. And I cried. Above me, I did not notice the vague smile on the wooden doll's lips. 

I cried myself to sleep that night. It was windy and the loss of my dolls had left me in little mood for food or entertainment. I cuddled up with my well worn Little Mermaid blanket and eased into a dark nothingness without dreams. I awoke abruptly during a particular powerful current of wind as it pushed the tree branches into my window. I sat bleary eyed in the dark for a moment when I heard a soft sound of what sounded like foot falls. They were soft and rapid, seeming to come from under my bed. I assumed it was my kitten, Gizmo. So I laid my head back onto my pillow and waited for sleep to return. A clatter startled me back to alertness only a moment later and I looked around my room. One of the doors to my closet, which always remained closed (because monsters, you know) was open a small crack. Immediately my little brain began to race with thoughts of monsters with teeth and long claws and wide black eyes. Almost as if to answer my thoughts, there came another clatter from the closet. I jumped out of bed, grabbing the nearest piece of armament available to me: a plastic princess light up wand. I held it close to me as I approached the closet. As I drew nearer, I heard a most discerning noise as the closet door began to creek open. 

A giggle.

I ran toward the door, slammed it closed with all my might, and rammed the princess wand between the handles of the closet doors just as they began to shake violently. I pulled away and bolted out my door and down the hall to my parents room. I slammed their door closed, locked it, and swan dived into the warm confines of their down comforter. While far from happy with me, they did not throw me out. 

The next morning, my Dad asked me what had scared me.

“There's a monster in my closet,” I told him. He smiled patiently at me and got up to dress for the day. He looked at the door and shook his head, unlocking it and stepping out into the hall and paused, looking down. After a moment, he looked back at me with tired eyes and asked, “Did you forget your toys?”

Confused, I looked over the edge of the mattress down to the floor where my father stood. Just in front of the doorway to my parents room were the shattered plastic pieces of my princess wand...laying at the feet of the wooden doll with her mouth stretched into a wide grin.

LadyCorvus,0,,1,1rcaqz,,5,"She’d always been the one with the smirk, biting commentary, and quick wit. She’d been called a verbal sniper by her closest enemies, for her tongue was double-edged and if there was a compliment, a tongue-lashing was never far behind. But here… o, here… here it was if she’d been struck dumb, her mind numb and tongue leaden, all that was left to her was the steady, forlorn moan that seemed to resonate; emanate from the very core of her being.


Having no idea of where she was… well an echo in the back of her mind gave her one that she pushed at, tried to reject though it kept at her, nagging like a small wound that would not heal. The idea finally escaped the confines of her will as her morale flagged, though it refused to be defeated just yet. 


This place was of no earthly plane, the landscape … surreal and terrifying. The cold, reasoning bit of her mind that fought to make sense of what she saw, and to remember what had happened up to this point; had brought her to this one conclusion, told her something she could not, would not accept. 

Rising from the ground where she sat… had landed?...she made herself walk, it had always helped her think things through in the past and she clung to the familiar in this unfamiliar place. Shrieks and inhuman laughter filled her ears, sulfur and ash clung to the inside of her nose, mouth, and throat. She wondered idly why she did not cough at the abrasive air even as she wrinkled her nose at the smell that was reminiscent of all she’d been told of Hades or a post-apocalyptic event. 

The trees here were bare, smoldering, though oddly still standing; branches reaching out from side to side like angels that had somehow become dracoliches with outspread skeletal wings. She repressed the small shudder as she passed under them, heading towards the sound of water with a growing thirst that would not be long denied. It was with no small relief that she neared the water. Sinking to her knees gratefully to partake and clean her face, she stared at the surface; it was covered in a dark crimson ash, unlike any she’d ever seen before. 
   

Trepidation filled her as she tried to lightly skim this from the surface, hoping the water to be potable underneath it. It was when she saw her reflection and what it was reflected in that she knew she was truly defeated this time; that this whole thing was out of her ken or else she was out of her mind. For what she saw upon her cheek, reflected in the viscous, mercury coloured water resembled a barcode that had been seemingly branded there. It read May 4, 2099 # 6498-066.


“What in the hell?” 


She jumped at the voice before realizing it as her own, albeit harsh, torn, and ragged sounding. Gone were the dulcet feminine tones she’d cajoled, taunted, and teased with. As she fell back from the water; this bloody excuse for water, the realization hit her hard. With growing horror she scrambled back from the bank, sobbing out a prayer in a voice as broken as her faith.

Dylando,2,,0,1rbgs5,,3,"Connecticut is a beautiful area. You can live a peaceful life out near the woods, or live in a somewhat busy city, both walking distances away, and both having perks. Out in the forest, you have neighbors, but they will almost never bother you. In the more busy areas, however, you can find whatever store you need in a matter of minutes. As for myself, I've always been fond of quiet neighborhoods. I love the fact that I don't need to be bothered by noises or people wherever I go. You can actually be in silence, just you and your thoughts.

Growing up where I used to be, however, proved to be unnerving. Most of the time, I could wake up in the night, and just be. There was no need to be doing anything, and there was less of a need to be hearing anything. One night seemed to be quite the opposite.

I woke up at a point around midnight, and listened to the silence of the night, and I liked to do. I usually fall asleep no problem after that, but I had trouble, almost as if something was outside, waiting. Then I heard it. I was quiet at the start, coming out from our living room, down to our ling hallway, where the bedrooms lay. What I had heard was the click of high heels on stone, excruciatingly slowly, coming down the hall. After a minute of this, the clicking stopped altogether, *right outside my doorway*. My scared self, knowing my door was open, clicked on the small light next to my bedside, and I calmed down. It had seemed to be the house settling, as I could only see the wall outside my room, and the shadows emitted from the light in my room.

As the years passed, my family had moved out of that house, and began to rent it out to people. Since we only moved up to the end of the road, we decided to keep our garbage barrels at that house, so that we had no reason to trudge up and down a hill to move our barrels weekly. During these passing years as well, I had suppressed this memory of the clicking, and other minor occurrences that happened during our stay at that house.

Two years ago, The usual routine happened. I would be the one to bring down any garbage bags down to the barrel, and walk back up. Normally, I'd do this after dinner, and it would still be light out, but because light is limited in November, it had quickly became dark at only 6:30. This day was no different, so I casually walked down our road, garbage bad in hand, to our old house. Before getting to the barrels, though, I stopped dead in my tracks. Something just seemed off about tonight, even though, just like every other night, everything was quiet. But this quiet wasn't one that seemed to be peaceful, but more of a deafening silence, as though some force is compelling everything to stay quiet. This fear quickly vanished, as I saw how silly I was. *Everything was fine*, I assured myself. Walking passed a porch light near my neighbor's house, I saw my fine, slender shadow dart across the ground and lay the end in the empty parking space for cars at this rented house. As I walked to the barrels that lay at the side of the house, I was greeted by the sound of clicking high heels on pavement, and the motion sensor light go off at the parking spaces. As I tilted my head up to say hello to the renter, I had realized that there were no cars in the parking space, meaning that the woman renting the house was out for the night. I had also came to realize that the shadow that was mine had tripped the sensor, and that the shadow coming from me did not belong to me.",Shadows,3,nosleep
InsaneFang,0,,7,1rbeal,,5,"It was any other normal day for him, walking home after school. Billy was old enough, his parents thought, to walk home alone, he knew not to trust strangers and all that. He walked along thinking about his friend hadn't been at school, and he was a little worried, he never missed one day. 

He was walking when he walked into a lady, she had things scattered across the ground, he knew he should help her pick the items up. He picked up the last of the items across the ground, and he looked up and got a good look at this woman. 

She was in her mid-forties or early fifties, she had black hair, was white, brown eyes, and her face was a little wrinkled. He didn't even realize what he picked up, when he handed it to her. It was a knife covered in what looked like fresh blood, when he saw that, he started to back away. 

She smiled, and said ""Now don't run dear, you'll only make it harder on yourself.""

He opened his mouth to scream, but no sound escaped. He turned and started running down the street, trying to escape the woman with the blood stained knife. He ran forward, never looking back, and he finally saw a house, and he ran up to the door, and found that it opened. Grateful to this, he bolted inside, and closed the door. 

He peeked out the window to see if she was following still, he noticed she had slowed down, and was laughing. ""Hopefully she's just a crazy old woman who likes to scare kids for a laugh..."" He panted quietly.

""I don't chase kids for a laugh."" He heard beside him. 

He looked up and there stood the woman, he opened his mouth to scream, but she quickly covered it. ""Now, now, dear, be quiet, it'll be easier."" He tried to shake her hand off his mouth, but she only clasped it harder around his mouth. ""I said to be quiet, dear."" 

He looked up at her, terrified, what was she going to do? She smiled and said ""There we go, my dear."" 

He closed his eyes, hoping, just maybe this was all a horrible dream. Please, please, oh please let this be a horrible nightmare...I don't want to die! Oh how he wanted to speak aloud, but that was not wise in this situation. 

She said ""Now I'm going to feed you some of my special soup. I never get any visitors often to share it with."" Now he was beyond confused, crazy woman with knife, who chased kids, was offering him soup?

She steered him to a table, and sat him down, she sat a bowl of steaming liquid with chunks of meat in his face. It smelled like chicken, but it had an odd smell that lingered in the chicken like smell. He made a face, and said ""I think I should go home, my mamma is probably worried about me, ma'am."" 

""Not till you get soup of my fine soup in your system.""  She replied

""My mamma told me not to accept things from strangers."" he said, getting up.

""Well then, my name is Linda. Now what's yours?"" 

""I ain't allowed to tell strangers anything about me, ma'am."" he said

""All you have to say is your first name.""

""I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't."" 

""Come on, please?""

He looked so nervous, and he finally said ""It's Billy, ma'am..."" 

""Well isn't that a nice name, Billy, well now that I know your name, and you know mine, we aren't strangers anymore.""

""I'm sorry, ma'am, I don't think it works like that. I'm sorry, but I really have to go."" 

""At least eat one spoonful of my soup...just one please, I never had anyone try my soup and be able to tell me if it tastes good.""

""Well I guess one bite wouldn't hurt anyone."" 

He went over to the bowl, and got himself a spoonful, the broth was a reddish color, the meat was dark like that of chicken or turkey. He put the spoon past his nose, and the smell that was lingering with the chicken like smell hit full force, and it was so putrid, he almost wanted to gag. But he had to be nice to this lady.

He forced the spoon into his mouth, the meat tasted like none he'd ever had. It didn't taste like chicken, or anything else. It had an odd salty taste with a metallic taste to it, kind of like blood... Wait, that knife! He tried to spit the soup out, but she forced his mouth shut, and said ""Now swallow, dear."" 

She forced him to swallow the broth, and he felt his eyes grow heavy, she put something in th...

Hours later, he woke up, the bed not his own, and the room was different. Please tell me I'm dreaming, where am I anyway? She came in, and the memory hit him. He tried to get up, but he was strapped to the bed. He tried to scream, but there was something knotted in his mouth, like a rag. 

""Well I've never had anyone to talk to, but I've always wanted someone to tell my secrets to, you know? Be able to be understood, and all that."" She sighs 

He couldn't talk, so he just laid there staring at her, silently pleading for her to let him go.

""You know that soup, I put special ingredients in that there soup. It has my special red broth, with my special meat. I have to get it in a different way than any other meat. You'll see how I do that later...or actually maybe very soon.""

He tried to fight against the ropes holding him down, but she merely chuckled softly. 

""Don't fight, dear, I just want to talk to someone. Now where was I, ah yes. During my days, I must have this special food ten times a day, it's so addictive. But with my running around to get it, I can stay thin, and not be fat like those lazy people who eat all day and night, and never move. Shame, such waste of ... oh never mind that.""

He felt like crying, and he felt salty tears start to form in his eyes. 

""Oh don't cry, you'll go home soon, well...to the home most of us are promised in the end, you'll have a new body..."" She sighed as if remembering something joyful. 

She lightly patted his knee, ""Well, I really can't say much else about what I do, it's time I show you."" She untied him from the bed, and said ""I shall lead you to your new living quarters."" She led him through the kitchen and into a dark room.

The smell inside was putrid, he wanted to gag, but the rag in his mouth kept him from doing so. The lights in the room turned on, and he saw the most gruesome sight. He finally opened his mouth, and screamed, though his attempts were muffled by the rag. 

The room was covered in dried red, there was meat hanging up, the freezer cool enough to keep it fresh like all other big freezers with meat in them. But this wasn't ordinary meat...it was..

He didn't finish his thought, because he felt a stabbing pain, and he fell down, and felt the world go black.

She later came into the freezer, grabbed one of the hanging meats, and went to the kitchen, and started to cut it up, and prepare some soup, while in the freezer, there was Billy's blood blending with the other dried blood, and there he hung, lifeless...like the others, the other dead kids...

kailey16,0,,7,1r8ylh,,2,"So, about a year and a half ago my family moved into an old farm house that was built near the end of the 1800's. My whole family absolutely hated it there but I was oddly drawn to it and loved it, I have no idea why. 

On the first night we stayed there my best friend stayed the night with me, because the first night is always creepy no matter what. Now, supernatural things were drawn to my best friend. She could sense them and they always came to her. Once she stepped foot in that house she wanted to leave. But of course she refrained from telling me until after I moved out. She also didn't tell me about what happened while I was asleep. 

Before we went to bed, we decided to watch a movie. Then we just left it on the main menu and went to bed. I guess around 3:00 AM, she woke up to a bang in my room. From where, she couldn't exactly tell. But it was definitely my room. Then the tv went out to that gray and black fuzz and really loud for about 30 seconds, then went back to the main menu. She said she was shaking from fear. She refused to come over anytime I invited her after that.

Again, she didn't tell me about any feelings or anything until after I moved out.

I've always been interested with the supernatural, but nothing of the sort is drawn to me. I'm kind of happy about that, kind of sad. But I must've been the most interesting for whatever was in that house because it was drawn to me and it made it clear.

This house had two bedrooms upstairs, two bedrooms downstairs. It also had a living room that was recently built onto it so it had separate air condition and furnace.

It was mid-winter and the furnace on the original part of the house wouldn't work. At all. We got it checked out probably 4 or 5 times and they couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. 

My sister and I had the rooms upstairs but she couldn't handle the cold so she ended up sleeping in the living room with the separate furnace, so I was alone on that floor. 

Around the second week we were there, I was getting into bed with my 4 blankets and multiple pants and sweatshirts because of how freezing it was when suddenly I heard a huge BANG on my door. This freaked me out so I just grabbed my bible and prayed for whatever it was to go away until I felt better. Then it started happening every single night when I got into bed. Eventually it didn't bother me. Like whatever was out there was just wishing me goodnight or something.

In my room, I had a guitar and keyboard. One night, around 2:30 I woke up to the sound my guitar strumming. Assuming it had fallen over, I got up to pick it up then when I got there it was still exactly where I left it. Confused and a little freaked out, I just decided to go back to bed. Then, the next night I woke up to light. I sat up and saw my keyboard lighting up like it was being played. Then I got even more freaked out.

The bangs along with this demon ghost thing playing with my instruments happened almost every night.

During the four months I lived in the house, I went into a depression. Which is really only weird because I never have before or after. I didn't do anything, I slept all day, I didn't eat, I was mean to everyone, I really hated myself, and I contemplated suicide. Also, I had a migraine. Not multiple migraines. A migraine that literally never went away the entire time I lived there. I tried multiple different prescribed medicines and all of them just made it worse.

The weird thing is practically the day I moved out, it all stopped. I wasn't depressed anymore. My migraine went away. I was just happy again.

After realizing the coincidence, I looked up some stuff knowing that there was something in that house. Depression can be form of possession. Not as bad as all the stuff you see in movies with them becoming demons and doing back bends and crap. But I'm positive that whatever was in there attached itself to me. And by the way it made me feel, it seems like it wanted me to hurt myself. 

This story might not send chills down your spin like some others do, but I can't even think about it without being terrified. 

And the weird part is I have to pass that house everyday, and I'm still drawn to it. It feels like home. ",It feels like home,9,nosleep
aricat2000,3,,6,1r83z4,,2,"     I'm not going to say my house is old, because it's not. It's only 15 years old, so there is no reason to be hearing thuds coming from my ceiling downstairs. I understand that in a basement, you're going to hear the footsteps of anyone upstairs. But this noise is only around when I'm the only one home. My pets come downstairs with me whenever I go down there. 
     It started about a week or so ago. It just being a single, soft footfall. Everyday, it doubled and got louder. My pets huddle around me when the noise starts, scared of whatever is causing the noise. When it starts up, it's a soft footfall like it was when it first started then it gets louder and becomes two footsteps. It gets louder and faster as it approaches the stairs. Imagine someone speed-stomping all over your upper floor. It's pretty creepy. 
     I heard it come down the first step today. I sat here at my computer, frozen. I don't know what it wants, but I'm scared for the safety of my pets. My parents don't believe me and the thing is never out when someone else other than me is home. 
     I'll update you if it continues.",The noise in the ceiling,8,nosleep
xDrAlpakax,0,,6,1r3mwk,,3,"If it were any other day I would've just walked by, completely unaware and uncaring of what would happen if I approached this, what I percieved as a man. The simple chain of events that occured that day were miniscule and unnoticeable to the naked eye, but differentiated the outcome of my life. If you can call this life, it's a prison. My personal holocaust. Hell. Whatever you call it can not be descriptive enough to effectively describe the torture inflicted every day.
Let me start by saying I was just a normal kid from the suburbs. Imagine a white kid and you had me. 15 years old, 139 pounds, 5""9, need I get more descriptive? I was unnoticeable from the crowd of what seems like millions of other identities that were more important, more athletic, and more human. Not that I'm some alien in disguise, that's not what this story is about. Im just saying that.. well I didn't play nice with others. I'd always get into fights at school and in trouble at home. But I had a single core group of friends that I could rely on: Andy, Sam, and Marcus. 
That just happens to be where the real story begins, when all of us planned a trip up to a cemetery a few miles up the road from my house that had an infamous reputation around my neighborhood. Legend had it that there were a few unmarked graves placed in rediculous formations that no one could identify. No one knew if they were human corpses or not. So I guess thats why we were going up there, to solve the mystery; solve the puzzle. Why and what were these graves? When did they get there? 
We left on Friday evening and started walking north to the graveyard. The walk there involved the normal teenager conversations you'd expect from a couple of rejected kids with no one else to talk to. No weird signs, chills, premonitions, nothing. Just like we were walking to school. Completely normal. Normal... tell me again what that is? I havent caught a glimpse of normal in years. Help me..
We were nearly there and, of course, Andy has to stop to piss. Like we didnt just leave the house an hour ago. Why couldnt you hold it.. damn it Andy there was probably a public bathroom near the cemetery, we were ALMOST THERE. As he walked to the woods, the rest of us realized that we could see the cemetery from where we were, so we yelled at him and told him to catch up to us when he was done. As we approached the gates, some ravens flew away. Actually, they didn't fly away, necessarily. They flew towards us like we weren't as dangerous as what lied ahead of us. Of course, none of us thought anything of it, they were just startled birds right? Maybe they were, I don't know anymore. For all I know we all imagined it. An illusion created by some other being, form, your guess is as good as mine. 
We entered the cemetery and walked through the aisles, internally mourning for their familys' losses. Not that we knew the people six feet deep or anything but it was weird, its like I was dealing with the deal of a family member or close friend; they werent my emotions to bear but they were given to me regardless. After we seperately collected ourselves, we made our way the the main attraction, per say.  It was a giant stone monument in the middle of the open area we were stading in. It was an angel that was kneeling over a grave, and quite honestly it was creepy.  We walked up to it and inspected it. It's faded color, rain stained tears on its face, and sheer size were intimidating to say the least, but we set up our stuff in front of it because there were no other places to stay. 
After we got done, we decided to look for the unmarked graves we walked all this way for. We went left first and planned on walking counter clockwisr around the entire place until we found it. Left. Why left.. every choice was the wrong choice.. why not right.. 
We started walking past countless graves, and once we were walking for a good 5 minutes and couldnt find anything, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked at Sam and Marcus and they had the same ghostly shocked face as I did. They both felt it too. We all whipped around to find a man in normal black clothing: jeans, a black t-shirt and jacket, and a black hat. We came to the conclusion that he was an undertaker or groundskeeper or something, and we calmed down a bit.
""What do you kids think you're doing?"" said the man.
Sam replied, ""I.. err, we apologize sir. We were just looking around to find some weird stuff I guess.""
""Well you shouldn't be here, you're not safe at night. No one is."" 
""I think we'll be fine, there's just a bunch of dead people. What's the worst that could happen?"" Sam said
""You're looking for the unmarked graves aren't you?""
I said, ""How did you know?""
""Follow me.""
We all thought this guy was weird, but weird at most. He was scrawny and greasy. Not the kind of person you would normally carry a conversation on with. But we were all curious and had no idea where we were going. At that point something came to my mind; where's Andy? I told the man that we had to wait for my friend, but he said that he found him earlier and he was taking us to him so we can regroup. We hadn't seen him walk back in.. but we followed nonetheless.  
He led us to a secluded spot in the woods where we couldn't see the rest of the graves, where I surprisingly saw Andy standing unharmed, it seemed. As we approached him he murmured something which was undecypherable from the distance we were. We stepped closer, sensing a disturbance as if we were being pushed back mentally, but physically we were moving forward like a magnet. We got closer and closer and realized that his feet weren't... feet anymore. They were what can only be described as roots, binding him to the earth and not letting go. His eyes had turned to complete blackness, reflecting the darkness that now described his soul. 
There was nothing we could do, we tried and tried to get him out of the ground, but we couldnt do anything.  He was rooted too deep. What happened to him? We turned around to get help from the groundskeeper, but he was gone. Andy started to make noises from behind us.. we thought it was Andy. We turned around.. there was nothing. I mean nothing. Arid, dry, barren ground in the dark night. Andy was gone, the trees were gone, graves, everything. Just nothing. I turned to find Sam and Marcus and they were gone. Just me, alone. 
I began to walk to find some sort of shelter or safehaven or some sort to get out of this place. My shoes began to fall apart about an hour into the journey, forcing me to take them off and walk barefooted. I then walked for a few more hours on my raw, bloody feet just hoping for water, even a drop. So thirsty.. but I found nothing. The last thing I remember from the desert was laying on the earth, praying to whoever to get me out.  Then I passed out. 
I have no idea how long I was unconcious, but I woke up in a small grey room that had a single window on one of the walls. I mustered up all the strength that I had to somehow crawl over to it. I had will to find out where I was, and I did. I looked through the window, and there was.. me. On a medical table. Tubes running from my arms, some red, some clear, some green. All alone in this cold metallic room. A man walked into the room from a deadbolted door on the right side of the room. It was the same man I had seen in the cemetery. He walked up to my body and started inspecting me from head to toe, looking for something.. I dont know what. After he finished his search, he looked up and turned around. And stared at me. Through the window. 
""I am real. You will never be again. This is the reality, and you are trapped inside of your own mind, able to go wherever you wish, do whatever you want. But you will only feel when, or what I allow you to. Your flesh is mine. If I prick out your eyes, I may still allow you to see. But you will feel the empty, cringing pain constantly. If I cut off your leg, you can still walk. But you have to deal with the torture. Forever. Until I end your pathetic little life, which is what it has always been. Pathetic.  You should thank me, actually, for now I've given your life some purpose. You serve me now.""
And this is when I looked back at when I was at the cemetery. Me, Marcus, and Sam. This man touched us on our shoulders, we had all the opportunity to get away, but we didn't.  And by the way, how many arms do YOU have? Two? Or three...",My New Beginning,9,nosleep

I wake up in a cold sweat, my skin tingling with goosebumps. There is someone standing at the foot of my bed. I try to scream but the sound is stifled by a hand tightly over my mouth. I try to move, but I am being pinned down with a near crushing force. All I feel is pure terror and confusion. There are foreign thoughts in my mind. Reality seems vivid and dark.

The figure at the end of the bed comes into focus. It leans in, the featureless face right in front of mine. I try to scream again. The unseen hand clamps tighter. The being speaks in a slow, whispered voice. I cannot understand a word it's saying, but I can feel what it is trying to convey. Snippets of phrases come into my mind and emotions wash over me. I can feel the creature's disappointment and rage. I can hear the phrase repeated over and over again, ""You will die someday and it will mean nothing.""
It tells me that every soul is horribly alone after death. It tells me that hell is real. It tells me not to waste my existence, because someday I will not even have that.

It reaches a hand towards my face and presses on my forehead with its finger. The pain is unbearable. It feels like my head is shrinking and expanding at the same time. There is a sound louder than I have ever heard and then a silence more pure than in the vacuum of space. The finger presses harder for a split second. I catch a glimpse of the being's face. A lump appears in my throat as a realize who's face I'm looking at. Tears well up in my eyes. It's me. I'm wrinkled and my hair is gray. I look... dead. For a moment I realize something horrible which I cannot quite remember. Then I plunge into unconsciousness.

I wake up at around 11 am. I have experienced sleep paralysis before, but it has never been so disturbing. I am shaken. I write down what I told me. I get some breakfast and play some DOTA, forgetting about the whole thing.

My brother wakes up a few hours after me, and comes into my room to show my a new model he rendered on his laptop. While we're talking, he asks me what's on my face. I'm confused, and go to look in the mirror. What I see chills me to the core and arises bile in my stomach. I am speechless and my eyes water. What I see permanently changes my view of reality. 

There is a burn mark on my forehead about the size of a finger. ",Sleep Paralysis,9,nosleep
LittleMM,0,,10,1r2ocz,,1,"This story happened when I was in college.





My school is in another town so I had to live in student suites by myself.
My family is not rich and since I have a mild heart defect, I always feel weak and don't have enough energy to take a job after class. So in order to release at least some of my parent's financial burden, even though I'm a girl, I always chose the cheapest dorms to live in.





I've been living in four different dorms during my college days, all very old and small, one of them might even be actually haunted, but this story is not about any of them, at least not fully related. It's about something else.





On my way to school there's a juice stand, I always stopped by and buy a big cup of freshly squeezed juice after class. (Oh I forgot to mention, I went to night school and school ends at 10:00 pm.)
Since I buy juice from them almost every day even on my off days, I became quite familiar with the owner and will chit-chat with him while he's making juice for me.





One day when I was waiting for my juice as usual, I noticed that there's something on the ground at the corner of the road not very far from the juice stand.
It's a glass milk bottle with one single yellow flower in it. A five-petal flower with a very short stem and no leaves.
I was curious and asked the juice stand owner: "" Did someone died there? ""
He answered: "" I had the same question but, not that I know of. ""
Since it's not such an unusual thing, I didn't give it too much thought.





But after about two weeks I started to notice something odd.
The milk bottle was still there and the flower kept staying fresh!
But there's not even water in the bottle! It should dry out pretty quick without water.
I took a closer look and confirmed that the flower is not an artificial one.
That means someone's been changing the flowers frequently if not daily!
I got more curious and asked the juice stand owner if he saw anyone came to change the flowers, his answer was no.





It's actually quite sad to really think of it. It's probably someone very dear to the person who brought the flowers that accidentally died there. Maybe by a car crash, or maybe even a murder!
I talked about these wild assumptions carelessly and then I said goodbye to the owner with my fresh juice in hand. 





I went back to the dorm, my room is the first one on second floor, when I was stepping upstairs I could hear two girls chatting and giggling, they're my classmates, we took different classes so we didn't meet at school today, we were supposed to watch horror video in my dorm today and I totally forgot about it! When I reached the second floor I saw them standing in front of my door. The guy living next to me saw them at the entrance and let them in. They love watching horror videos at my place because the creepy environment offers an extra "" ambience.""




"" We were just talking about how creepy your dorm is! "" one of them said with a cheerful tongue.
"" Even this hallway seems haunted, why is it so dim? "" Added by the other.
"" Thanks guys for trashing my lair for me, like it's not a dump already. ""
I smiled.
Then we watched the video together, it's overall just another eventless night.





The next day after school, when I went for my daily juice, to my surprise I found that the bottle of yellow flower was gone. It was still there on my way to school!





"" Did you see who took the flower? "" I asked the owner.
"" That's odd, I didn't notice that it's gone! "" He answered.





I couldn't stop thinking about the yellow flowers on my way back to the dorm, I couldn't explain why I was so obsessed by it, I was so curious about the mysterious person who brought the flowers and why nobody ever saw him/her even when obviously the flowers have been changed so frequently? I was walking carelessly with my mind wandering somewhere else and the next moment a scene stroke me.





The yellow flower! It's there! Near the entrance of the park!
Someone moved it there, but why?
It's not likely that someone died there too, is it?
It's been curiouser and curiouser, but I couldn't think of it anymore.
The mid-term is approaching and I'm only half way done!
Can't waste my parent's money for a bad exam result.
( Yes, some of my classes still give exams. )
Thinking of it, I walked faster across the park.





There's no one in the part except me, and the street lights are so dim, they seemed dimmer than usual. One street light flashed when I walked pass it, I swore towards it: "" Great, now even you're trying to scare me, you asshole! ""
Then I turned back to the road,





That's when I noticed something near the bench about 20 feet ahead of me..... suddenly I felt a chill down to the bone..... the bottle of yellow flower..... why is it there???
Did someone put a bunch of flowers here and there on random spots? Or.....
I had to find out, so I backtracked to the park entrance..... no flower there..... that one was gone. So what does it mean? Someone's moving the bottle around .....for what? And most of all, how did I miss him/her? There's only one way in this small park!





It's not like I could do anything about it so I eventually carried on.
This time, the same bottle of flower appeared again in front of the convenient store right across the street of my dorm.
People were passing by , no one seemed to care, and I thought: "" Why should I? "" It's obviously none of my business.





So I entered the dorm building and went upstairs, but started to think how the bottle of flower seemed to "" followed "" me..... the chills came back, I almost reached the second floor, but I froze at the staircase. My body went all stiff I couldn't move, my pupils probably dilated like a panicking cat!





It's there.





The bottle of yellow flower, sitting there in front of my door.
A hundred thoughts flashed by, "" maybe someone's playing a prank on me, maybe it's a joke, but it's not funny. and by Whom and How??? 
I don't wanna know anymore, I'm moving out of this place! I know it's nothing to do with my dorm, my dorm is fine, it's not haunted, it's not the issue, but whatever!!!"" 





Before I realized, I already ran out of the dorm building and was on the way to my friend's house, and I didn't even remember how I got downstairs.





I couldn't stop mumbling to myself:
""I don't know if it's a prank or not, I don't care, I know there's nothing wrong with my dorm, it's the cheapest but nothing's wrong with it! and what kind of sicko would do such thing to me? Who would it be? Who could have known?
It's not possible 'cause I was pretty sure the dorm was empty that day, it's Saturday and everyone else went home except me! 
.....That cat..... it was an accident, I didn't mean it..... but it's not possible! No one could ever know! 
I don't care, I'm moving out right away. I'm moving out tomorrow!""

Motleigh,1,,5,1r09ur,,3,"I was about 12 or 13, living in a ranch style house in Southern California, when I had one of the creepiest experiences of my life. I was sleeping in my bedroom with the door slightly ajar. My bed was tucked into one corner of the room. The head of the bed was against the same wall as my closet door. The closet door was a large, sliding mirror. The door to my bedroom, which was an average door, was at the end of my bed. When entering the bedroom, one would have to walk past the end of the bed.

Some time in the night I woke up. I don't know why I woke up and I don't remember anything in particular waking me. The room was lit enough for me to see my bedroom door swing open about a foot. I did not see a person open the door. I did notice something crawl around the end of the bed and crawl up the side of the bed towards the head of the bed.

My first thought was that a dog was coming in, but when the thing reached the closet and slid open the closet door, I was certain it was not a dog. My best description of what I saw is a person crawling on all fours. I saw a dark silhouette, from the corner of my eye, crawl past where I was laying in bed. After the closet door slid open, the mysterious being crawled into the closet and closed the closet door behind itself. I was so terrified that I could not move. I laid frozen from fear on my back, in my bed, until I feel asleep. I was too scared to move or scream. I was awake for about an hour, unable to move, before I dozed off.

The next morning I woke up slightly confused, but I immediately slid open the closet door. I was not as afraid because the sun was shining outside and I felt that if it were going to harm me, it would have done it already. Inside the closet was my usual mess of clothes piled up on the floor. There was no monster or animal in there anymore. I did forget to check under the bed though...

oliviaclaire,0,,4,1r09ds,,4,"I apologize in advance for the length of this post.

The clock read 12:00. Not unusual for me to be up this late. I sat in my bed watching television and reading my usual horror novels. I, like many of you, are quite into horror and the paranormal. I began to feel hungry, so I sat down my book and began to descend down the stairs to the kitchen. I reached the kitchen and began to search for food. I felt quite uneasy with my back turned to the rest of the room. The feeling of someone watching me soon became overpowering and I had to turn around. That's when I heard it. Tap... Tap... Tap... It sounded like a finger tapping ever so lightly against the window in my kitchen. I was frozen at the sound. Though it was a light noise, compared to the deafening silence of the night, it might as well have been the loudest noise in the world. I shifted my glance to the window only to find... Nothing. I brushed it off and returned to my bedroom. As the night continued to drag on, I felt a growing unease in the pit of my stomach. Like something wasn't just right. I noticed my phone was dying, and reached for the charger plugged into the outlet next to my bed. I then heard something that chilled me to the very bone. Laughter. Very quiet. Very faint. But there none the less. I leaped from my bed and ran downstairs. I reached the living room and turned on the television, struggling to catch my breath and regain rational thought. It could have been anything, right? Eventually, I let the sound of the television push the experience to the back of my mind. Then it came again. Tap.. Tap.. Tap.. Louder this time. I was stricken with panic. I refused to let myself look at the window. 
""Just ignore it and it will go away""
Tap.. Tap.. Tap..
""Ignore it.""

This went on for 30 minutes at least. It began to drive me crazy. The tapping became incessant. I then did something I haven't done since I was a child. Retreated to my mother's room. I walked in with tears of complete and utter terror streaming down my face. Reluctantly, even though not much of an explanation was given, she allowed me to stay the night in her room. 
I climbed into the bed and began to let sleep take me. I felt safer in the comfort of my mother's room. Then, just as my eyes began to feel too heavy to keep open, I heard it once again. Closer this time.

It has been a little over a year since I last wrote - just over a year since the last nightmare.  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured, that, as Dr. Lough suggested, getting it out of my head and into a journal would help.

I read back over my last and only journal entry, as I tried to describe the nightmare.  It is so chaotic and scattered, yet I'm unable to find any other way to convey the details.  That is the terror of the dream at its core - utterly chaotic.  Jerking from one sensation to the next, the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be, to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion.  All of this, in layers of sleep - waking to the comfort of my mother's figure, only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out, with her eerie voice echoing through my body:

""You're connected now.""

Even now, in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages, I'm struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper.  Each detail seems to tie into the next, only to fall apart when I try to see the whole.  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr. Lough could make?  Is this what schizophrenia feels like?  I have no way to explain it.  It is as though there is a novelist's grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene, unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding.  I'm fairly certain this entry, and perhaps any subsequent entries, will be just as erratic.  I just cannot force these thoughts together.

So much has changed in the last year, it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me.  I have a son now, nearly 6 months old.  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote.  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace?  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father, the changes to my life, the responsibility, it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious?  I can't help but think it must have played a role.  It has been a blur, so many other things seem to have fallen into place.  Though they are exciting, it seems predetermined, somehow rushed.

Over the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in.  I knew I would live there once again - returning it to ownership in my family - though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly.  Rachel's grandmother died, leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together.  It was Christmas Day, the day she died - I guess her last gift to us.  Three months after my son was born, we were moving back into the mountains, back to the walls I had called home as a boy.  

One thing I feel for certain, this home is the source.  The nightmare started here, always took place here, was always fueled here.  I'm beginning to remember things, or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades.  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this house.

As a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase, which opened onto a hallway, always with my head down staring at my feet.  Left, at the end of a long hallway was a guest room.  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them.  Right, across a short landing was my bedroom.  I had trained myself to never look left at night - as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows.  If I would look up, I would become stuck in fear with the reflection.  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass.  My feet became rooted in place, the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me.  The nightlight would flicker in then out, each time causing my shape to jump forward, as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness.  I never remembered breaking loose, turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep.  I would wake up in my bed hours later, staring at my hands, inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare. 

I learned, I kept my head down and did not look to the left.

Our first night in the home, that muscle memory followed suit.  After turning off the main floor lights, I climbed the staircase.  My son was sleeping against my chest, his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder.  My head was down as I crested the top step, turning to the right, towards my room which was now his.  As I neared the bedroom door, his forehead left my shoulder.  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck.  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head.  I didn't need to look at his eyes, I knew.  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand, reaching down the hallway to the windows.  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle.  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door.

My grandfather walked home through the ranch, when he hears twigs break behind him. He turns around, only to see a shadowed figure about 20 feet behind him. He presumes this is his wife, playing a prank on him. however, he finds it strange, because the figure literally looked like a person painted black. Like a walking sillouette. He laughs and continues walking. Then he arrives at his home where, to his horror, his wife is sound asleep.

BLOODPIRATE,6,,2,1rdmz3,,4,"Fear is a strange thing

an unpleasant emotion caused by the belief that someone or something is dangerous, likely to cause pain, or a threat.

That's the definition of fear.

Everyone has it, but no one wants to admit it. People fear fear. Not me. I usually embrace fear, and openly invite it into my life. But, I usually get to control what scares me.

Not last night.

I was laying in bed, reading some stories on /r/nosleep before I went to bed like I always do. Like I said, I invite fear into my life.

I never believed any of the stories that were on here before.

My thoughts have changed.

My room has a bathroom with two entrances, one to my room, and the other to my sisters room. While I was reading some stupid story, I heard a noise coming from her room. I knew she was at work though so I just brushed it off and kept reading. 

I heard the sound again.

This time I decided to go check it out. I chose to use the door that leaves my room to get to the door to her bedroom this time, for whatever reason.

I opened up the door to her room. I could've sworn I saw something jolt to one side of the room. But, I went in further and discovered nothing. So I went back to my room.

The door to my bathroom was open. The light was still off which have it sort of an ominous and demonic look. I walked in and turned the light on. 

Nothing.

I turned around to leave when I heard more slamming noises. I turned back around to go to my sisters room when the light turned off.

I struggled to find the door knob, but when I finally did, the door wouldn't open. The other wouldn't open either. I started screaming now, but no one could hear me.

I sat down on the floor, hopeless. I've never felt fear like I did when that same shadow from my sisters room grabbed a hold of my neck. I couldn't even breathe because it's grip was so tight. I couldn't tell if I was blacking out because even with my eyes open, the room was pitch black. 

All of a sudden it let go.

I laid there, crying as my brother came bursting in the door. He turned the light on and shook me. I couldn't believe what happened. I got up and looked in the mirror. My neck hand bruised hand prints around it, and my back, chest, and arms were covered in scratches that formed weird symbols.

Ever since that day I have believed every story on /r/nosleep. You may not believe this but I don't care. I know the truth and that's all that matters.

This was carved into my back, I have no idea what it means:

dagronBorn,1,,1,1rcebp,,3,"For some reason or another, the paranormal loves my family. No matter where would move or what kind of cleansing ritual we would perform, something would make itself known. The earliest account that I can personally remember is from the age of five when my family and I had recently rented out an old house in desperate need of repairs. My father struck a deal with the landlord that if they were to bring the rent down considerably, he would fix up the place which would in turn up the property value.

The house sat on a few acres of land and had tool-shed in the back of the property which contained an old, sealed off well (this doesn't play into the story at all like the ring or some shit like that). The house was a small, single story home that was separated into two halves by dividing wall, but were connected via an old, red accoridon-style doors that had been faded with time. 

The left side of the house was cold. Always cold, even in the heat of the Texas summer we moved in. There wasn't much to the left side of the house except for large sitting room, and and old restroom that was filled with old junk that had been left behind by the previous tenants. I can still fell the cold upon my skin, and the invisible eyes that seemed to stare from every corner of the room. Needless to say, I never ventured into that room unless I was heading out the front door that just had to be on the left side of the house.

The right side of the house wasn't that bad. I never remember it feeling uncomfortably or eerily cold, and the feeling of being watched wasn't there. The right side of the house contained the living room, kitchen, my parent's room, my younger brother's (he was just about two years old at this time) room , my room, and the tiny bathroom we all shared.  For the first few weeks everything seemed normal, like this was going to be the first place in a long while we wouldn't have to pick and move suddenly (my family was like a roaming pack of gypsies when I was younger, never staying anywhere for too long). But, oh, did we have another thing coming.

The first unexplained phenomena I can remember was the soft, sweet voice of a woman who I would sometimes mistake for my mother calling my name. I would bound into whatever room my mother was in to see what she wanted, only to find out that she had not called for me. I brushed it off thinking that I was just hearing things that weren't there, just a case of a child's overactive imagination. Until it kept happening. Every. God. Damn. Day.

The second thing I noticed were my toys. I had fixation as a child to set up all my action figures along my room on whatever ledge was available. Window sill? Check. Dresser? Check. Makeshift step pyramid like display created from VHS tapes? You bet. Whenever I would leave my room to visit the restroom, or get a drink from the kitchen, and then come back to my room, my toys would either be facing the opposite direction I had placed them or they would be knocked to the ground with enough force to actually break more than a few. And, like the voice, I tried to explain it away until I eventually started to place my toys in a shoebox under my bed so that they would be safe. I still miss all the brave action figures that I lost to that house. Rest in pieces my dear friends.

The next few occurrences I witnessed firsthand, and they involve my younger brother. Cody, my brother, would be heard giggling and laughing and cooing in his room and if you were to check on him to see what was so funny, the rocking chair in the room would cease to rock as if someone saw you come in and stopped rocking. And if you attempted to remove Cody from his crib, he would scream and cry and reach for the rocking chair. When he was older, but still young enough to remember he once asked about the ""ugly lady with the pretty voice"" who would sing to him and make him laugh. 

One night when we were all sleeping soundly in out beds, my father gets in from a long day of construction work only to be greeted by a crying toddler in need of a diaper change. My father went into Cody's room, picked him up and set him down on the changing table. After cleaning up my brother and laying him back down in his crib, my father was free to go to sleep himself. The second his head hit the pillow though, he heard a commotion coming from Cody's room. He gets up, grabs his .38 and checks it out, thinking an intruder may have used Cody's room as their entrance point. Instead he is met with diapers strewn all over the floor. There was a shelf above the table that my parents placed the diapers and wipes on, and the diapers were stacked neatly enough were they wouldn't tumble. He thinks nothing of it, stacks them a few less this time and them proceeds to head back to bed. Then he hears it again. He walks back to the room to find the diapers on the ground again. My father stacks them up a little less this time, then goes back to bed. This same routine happens for the next hour and half; at one point he had put a solitary diaper on the shelf only to have it thrown on the ground soon after by some unseen force. It was them that my father knew it was time to move again.

That next week we rented a u-haul and began packing. We had just finished packing and moving everything to the truck and my dad was the last person coming out of the house. Everyone else was outside, myself included. My father had large box he as carrying out to the truck and was passing through the accordion door when something pushed the door shut on him hard enough that it took it my mom and myself to pry it open! He at first thought I was playing some kind of joke on him, but was even more fired up to leave once he learned I had been nowhere near that door!

The last I heard about that property was when I did a google map search only to find the parking lot of a Wal-Mart. I always wonder if they have a problem in the baby aisle. Specifically with the diapers. ","First they want us gone, they they don't want us leave...",4,nosleep
YouoTheNinja,6,,2,1rblw9,,1,"Midnight Snack.

I hear the repetitive sound of raindrops crashing into my window.

A storm is coming.
 
My phone continuously vibrating, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, who liked what, who posted where, what they did, who they like, who they hate. 

Personally I don’t give a fuck, but for some strange reason I always check the notifications, I guess that’s just another reason why I can’t just fall into a deep, relaxing rest.

   I sit here laying down, staring at the darkness of what I call my ceiling, imagining shapes and creating figures in my head. I can’t sleep, this always happens. I get up from my warm bed and crawl to my refrigerator; “Midnight snacks are the shit.” I mumble to myself as I open the ridiculously cold appliance. “It’s not even midnight; it’s like 3 in the morning, so much for a midnight snack…” I mumble again. Something’s odd though, the fridge is super cold, like you know when someone opens a refrigerator in a movie, and the frosty musk slowly rolls out of it, covering the floor with smoke; that’s happening right now. I grab a bottle of water; it’s got a slick layer of ice just forming on the top of the water. --I’d always break the skin of ice with my finger when I was little, still do. I take a sip of the icy water, and I feel my tooth ring. Cold water always hurts my teeth.

   I begin back towards my bed. The rain has become worse and worse, almost violent now, it sounds like someone left a faucet running or something. I get to bed; it’s chilly, like the underside of my pillow. That little trip will just probably make it harder for me to fall asleep.

…

I’m running and I trip.

I hate waking up from a dream like that.

This rain is insane, I make my way towards the kitchen again, it’s almost 4 now, I don’t get why I can’t sleep, the kitchen is probably twice as cold as it was when I last was there. The fridge looks like has perspired, and the sweat around it has frozen over, I scrape my name into the frost.

M- I- C- T- H-

Should I make a frozen dinner…? 

I try to open the freezer door, but it’s frozen shut. 

I pull harder, and harder.

It won’t open. 

I grasp it firmly and thrust downwards, it flips open and I fall back, and I hear two thumps after mine.

I look over and there are my parents, frozen with an expression of fear.

My heart drops to my stomach, my palms soak, my eyes freeze wide, my face is blank. 

I can’t say anything, I try to scream/

Louder/

LOUDER!

Nothing- All that comes out is a gasp for air, and my body goes into auto-pilot. I sprint outside.

I collapse. Drop in the middle of the road.

Covered in red from the violent rain.

I’m looking upwards, completely broken by what I’ve seen…


Tens upon tens of bodies tied up from branches hanging upside down.

ephique,5,,3,1r8wrl,,3,"It was Friday and myself being unemployed at the time, was up for something to do. You see, my girlfriend was invited to a party by her new friends from her drama-crew she recently joined and she wanted me to join her. This party took place on the other side of our suburban ruin of a town and it made common sense for her to message me the location whenever she knew the exact address; again, she didn't know these people that well.

Around 9 pm I left our apartment to head to the party, still not knowing the exact location I figured I could at least walk to the bus-station that had buses taking me to that part of town. Luckily I got a message from one of her new friends on the way there. Describing how to get to the destination. My girlfriend hadn't paid her phone bill and had to use a friend’s phone to message me, she has done this before. She hates her network company.

I took the bus, taking me as far as I could bus-wise. After that I had to get a taxi, the only taxi driver I ended up finding had never driven anyone to that location before apparently; I'm guessing the drama-people pretended they had taxi's whenever they needed one. Good practice.

The taxi driver, who I believe was Mexican dropped me off at the address and headed back for the city shortly after. I had no idea her friends was throwing a party out in the middle of nowhere, and it was getting really chilly so I didn't spend too much time figuring out the mysteries of the universe out there; I ran up to the door.

My first impression was that this must have been the most quiet party in the history of parties. I heard no music, no laughing, no tapping. Nothing. Before I knew it I was banging on that door, it had no ringer or anything, I had to pound that thing. No one opened.

I felt pretty confused at this point, I did still have my phone though. Although calling my girlfriend was no use 'cause I already knew her network always shut off inbound and outbound calls and texts whenever she hadn't paid. Out of desperation I phoned her friends number, but no one answered. I assumed they were partying too hard to hear the phone ringing and I found myself mislead by a tired taxi driver who took me to the wrong house. That's the only explanation that made any sense to me what so ever.

Now, I was out of options. I couldn't walk back into town 'cause not only would I not know the exact roads out there; but it was also ridiculously freezing outside. I tried banging on the door again and again, maybe an old couple lived there or something and they would wake up if I hit that door hard enough.

I ended up smashing the lever on the door accidentally, the door wasn't even locked. I looked around to make sure that no one was watching me because I did realize that being desperate or cold wouldn't really vouch well in court. I couldn't see anyone so I sneaked into the house. Whenever I had made sure no one was in the first room of the house I closed the door behind me. Not being sure what I was looking for, I walked around aimlessly trying to figure out if anyone was home or not; my mind started to wander off into finding explanations. I remember one being that they were playing a prank on me, which wasn't a bad theory since the door was after all left unlocked.

I didn't check much of the first level of the house before I started walking up a great set of stairs leading me in a spiral upwards. It was very creaky so if anyone was awake in this house they'd easily hear me at this point. I figured no one was 'cause the entire house was dead silent with the exception of the noise I brought into it myself.

Upstairs I found a bedroom just across the hall from where the spiral staircase ended. It seemed to belong to a girl, a small girl. It was an empty bed in it and paintings on the walls, you know the type kids do in pre-school that parents end up pretending are works of genius to make the kid feel better and gain confidence? Yeah, those kind of paintings.

I got shocked by my own text-message signal that I stupidly left on way too loud, it was from an unknown number; I was hoping it was my girlfriend or her friend explaining the mix-up or something. The text said:
""Alright, we are all set! I hope you haven't fallen asleep my little unemployed darling. Make your way to 24th Radcliffe Street, it's not too far from the super market by the bus-station.

Sunny day in Nevada. Families having lunch outside, fathers teaching their sons how to grill steak, playgrounds
filled with kids. Every year I plan a trip with my son. Nevada has really nice caves in it. When I was little,
my father always took me there and so did his father. I didn't want to break this chain. I told Jake, my son, about that
cave that I used to visit but I did not have enough time to take him there until now. He was still sleeping when
I stepped in his room.
""Honey wake up!"" Jake opened his little eyes and whispered:
""What?""

""We are going to see the cave I told you about!"" he instantly jumped out of his bed and become so excited that
I can't even tell about it. He got dressed and ran to have something to eat. About five minutes later he was screaming
from the garage door.
""Hurry up mom!""

One hour car ride. Not the longest one he ever had. He kept asking me about the place. I just smiled and told him to
be patient. As soon as I parked the car, he blasted out the door and ran to the back of the car to grab two flashlights. 
""You ready?"" I asked him. He obviously was so we started walking towards our destination.
It was dark in there. Darker than anywhere else. Flashlights on.  He just kept pushing forward. Sometimes I couldn't 
even catch up with that little kid. After a sharp left turn I saw him standing there. He found it. The biggest hall 
in the cave. Every wall was shining when the light of our flashlights reached them.
""Beautiful isn't it?""

""It is indeed!"" he answered. He turned his head towards me but it was only q light at a corner 
that he could see. He totally crapped himself. ""Mommy wait for me!"" He started running towards the light 
that he could see. It is a maze down there. - MOM! - he screamed.
""I'm here honey!"" He caught up with me. He just gasped there and started to be a bit relieved as he realized 
that he was not alone in that dark cave again.
""Hey calm down little boy! I'm not leaving you here!"" went closer to him and whispered:  ""Or am I ?

I'm fully aware that I'm sleepwalking but I can't stop myself, lay down again or do anything about my actions. I start walking out in a big hallway (this is where the main door is located), then I enter a smaller, much more narrow and dark hallway, and in the end is a small wardrobe-like room which is truly pitch black. This scared me a bit since I am afraid of the dark but I just keep walking, I don't even consider NOT to walk in to the wardrobe. So I find myself inside this pitch black tiny room and I close the door and I lock it. Once I have locked the door i just panic, I'm not afraid but I simply can't stop screaming, I remember the scream so well, it was a true scream of despair, I screamed at the top of my lungs but I still was not scared. I started to bang the door, the walls, everything while screaming and crying as hard as I could. Finally my boyfriend comes to the rescue and the door was open now, he just grabs me and tells me I was sleepwalking and I just said ""I know"" in the sternest voice. He's scared out of his life and crying and I just looks at him like he's crazy and then i just go back to bed like nothing happened.

ephique,0,,0,1rikrx,,4,"I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom, dad and big sister. We were a normal family, neither happy nor sad, somewhere in between. I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano, practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs. It was also some sort of medicine for me; it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes. You see, my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting. I hated it; I hated hearing her yell at my poor mother.

During a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad, making sure that I didn’t have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible. My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up. I remember jogging most of the route home, since my dad sounded so serious. It gave me the creeps to say the least.

I jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house. The kitchen was the first room you’d see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs. As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably, something had definitely happened. My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch, he told me to sit down as well.

I was scared and curious at the same time. Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didn’t bother caring too much about any of my sisters business, so I could figure out that this wasn’t about my sister. I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible. My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say, as if he didn’t know how to explain something to me.

Finally, after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time. He said: “Your mother…” and then he needed to grasp some air, and he continued: “Your mother has passed away.”

I was eight years old and I couldn’t grasp that concept. I didn’t understand death, or that my mom was eternally gone. I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards god-knows-what, I remember thinking how unfair this was. I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly, he didn’t know what to do and he was in shock at the time.

My sister continued crying, she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didn’t actually care to know at that precise moment. She was just being desperate and no one could blame her. I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there, I thought that was why she was crying so much. I didn’t shed a single tear; I kept it all inside. Of course that didn’t mean this incident didn’t haunt me for years, I never stopped thinking about my mother. 

The aftermath of my mother’s death is what has been shaping my life the recent years. My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane. My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital. Something I didn’t even think existed when I was eight. This resulted in that I didn’t get to meet my sister very often, my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge; but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was. I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it, and I didn’t blame him. 

I was guessing that my sister wasn’t doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by, something that troubled me; I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad. It felt so dead, and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died. We didn’t do anything, I literally spent all time at home in my room, making or playing music. Me and my dad didn’t even greet sometimes when I came home from school, it was depressing. My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mother’s death, something that I’m about to get into.

You are probably wondering how she died by now, and it’s a legit question to be asking. The best answer I could give you is that I don’t know. My dad has always told me she died of liver-failure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me. It didn’t add up, my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didn’t drink. I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasn’t mature enough to hear the truth. In addition to this, whenever I asked my dad about this matter he’d get heavily upset. Nowadays I never ask about my mom’s death, nor do I even bring up mom as a topic.

Years went by and I ended up being fourteen. It kept going like I just described, I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house. My dad did work, he had the night-time shift at a local bottle factory, I’m not joking, he actually made glass bottles for a living. He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister, they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job. You guessed it, the bottle factory.

I was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen. My school was the type that had an after-school library that didn’t close till 11 pm. I didn’t need any of the books or supplies that the library offered; I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa. Either way, I hadn’t seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldn’t see her again for another two. 

When I arrived at the house the front door was open, “This is odd?” I thought. Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mother’s old jars. It’s never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door, number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys. It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it. The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door, around the lock. I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone, ready to call the police. 

This is when I heard something coming from inside the house. I was dead scared to say the least, this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse, I didn’t know. It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor, trying to move it. It was so dark as well, I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door, technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights. I started to slowly pace into the house, walking towards the noise. This is where I had to make a decision, was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark? I picked the former. I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window. It was my sister, naked. My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation; it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital. 

I switched on the lights in an instant. She had redecorated the entire kitchen, in the dark. Of course it all looked hideous and random; she didn’t know what the hell she was doing. I remember being in a slight discomfort, I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life. I also hadn’t seen her for a good couple of years at all. She didn’t look very comfortable either, she looked like she didn’t know who I was and was wondering what I was doing there.

I uttered “Linda?” out loud, that was her name. She didn’t respond, she just continued standing there looking at me. “Don’t you remember me, I’m your brother.” I still couldn’t get any feedback out of her; it was as if the wheel wasn’t spinning at all. I wasn’t sure what the protocol here was, not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured I’d try to call dad, before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered: “Don’t call dad.” This is when I realized she couldn’t be completely empty inside after all.

“You don’t want to call dad.” She continued.  I had no idea what to do, I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place. Luckily my dad got home at that point, not coming from a finished shift at work. He had a good five hours at least left, I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation. My father ran into the house as fast as he could.

This is when something I didn’t expect happened, he told me to leave. He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house. I asked him where I was supposed to go, he told me to wait in his car. Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didn’t think twice about it, I ran out to the car. As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times, I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts. I had no clue what the two of them were discussing, although I never saw my sister move her lips so I’m guessing my dad did most of the talking. 

After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car, he joined me inside. I remember asking why he didn’t bring Linda with him, “Don’t call her that name!” he shouted in response. I was so confused at this point. Dad started the car and drove me to my only friend’s house; I didn’t see him very often though. I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point, I didn’t really create any friendships. I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friend’s doorbell, his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused. I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight. I didn’t even know what was going on to be fair.

Whatever he told them worked, I got to spend the night at my friend’s place. Tim’s place, to be exact. It was pretty awkward I remember, I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish. We got to be desk-mates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester, so we weren’t very close. 

It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after; I guessed that made it easier for my dad, leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to. He did, but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tim’s parents, both trying to justify me as Tim’s best friend. I don’t know. Tim didn’t have many friends I guess.

On the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me, as if I was mocking him. I remember how desperate he looked, as if he had no fire left in his heart. He uttered the words: “Do you think I wanted any of this?” as he grabbed his hair in regret. “All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances, and I’m not blaming you when I’m saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours.” Is what came out of his mouth next. I tried to comfort him, telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not; I really didn’t have a lot of cards in my deck at this point. I mean my dad was basically losing it.

When we got home he told me that he was sorry, and that I should go up to my room. I did go up to my room but I got to tell you; I was starting to get very anxious about my dad. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on. I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online, I couldn’t sleep so pulling an all-nighter was my only real option. I was reading “A Brief History of Time” for a science project in school, I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes. I figured I’d go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway. I saw my mother standing just outside, looking right at me for a fraction of a second. Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane? It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink. 

The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night, I kept thinking about it as I couldn’t sleep. She looked deranged, scared and raw. The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white 50’s movie. I kept begging for the sun to rise up, I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what you’ll see. I might have been fourteen, but I can openly admit that I was dead scared.

It finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs, still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway. I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice. I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said: “I think I need help.” While holding the glass of juice as if he wasn’t sure he was going to drink the rest of it. I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasn’t sure, that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately. He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf, he thought that could give him some relief. I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea, jokingly adding that it’s better than hanging around the house doing nothing. He looked offended when I said that, something I didn’t really understand since he obviously worked all night, so that would justify him sleeping through the days.

I understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died. Well, it’s hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times, and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liver-failure. I mean it was possible. Imagine if it was true, and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me. That’s the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thing.

Having that explanation out of the way, I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time. It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf; I just walked into his room unexpected. A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room; it looked similar to an office which is nothing he’d ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory. He was actually sitting at his desk. Not only that, but the desk was flooded with paper-work of some sort, maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day, something he could manage from home. I didn’t ask; I had a big enough question for him as it were.

I dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured I’d sit on it. It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable, better than standing up anyway. Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying: “You want to know about your sister, and what happened the other night. Don’t you?” This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt, bringing up mom here would have been a car-crash. I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister. He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me: “Your sister is not right in the head; she’s in a mental hospital.” I couldn’t believe he hadn’t figured out that I would have known this by then. Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didn’t know. He explained the context, telling me that she couldn’t take our mother’s death. A tear started climbing down his cheeks, and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine, and then I left the room.

I realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business. I had no idea how I’d ever get the truth about my mother out of him. When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again, the image of my mom started crawling back to me. The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway, was my mind playing tricks on me? I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere. I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had, not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before. 

Night landed again, I hadn’t spoken to my father again that day. I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night, I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought I’d see my mother again. We all know you can imagine things in the dark, kids do it all the time. It’s as if your mind fills in the gaps, but that incident the other night was different. I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that I’d open the door to the darn hallway, and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer. I’m not going to lie, I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out; there was no sign of my mother. I turned on the lights and went back into my room.

Still not wanting to go to bed, not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured I’d listen through some of my older songs. I had loads of them; most of which weren’t very good however. I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good, especially not at writing my own songs. I guess I was decent at playing other people’s songs. I basically went through my songs in chronological order, it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years. 
It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs, and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine. I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before; it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs. Knowing that this wasn’t an overworked track yet, it was made just days ago and I hadn’t gotten around to mastering it yet, I figured I wasn’t going to give it more of a thought. That was until the neurons fired, that track was made the day I couldn’t sleep, the day I saw my mother in the hallway. Being a bit gullible I figured that I’d give it a go using my acoustic headphones. I tried everything. I played the song backwards; I cut out bass, middle frequencies, high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples. I couldn’t hear anything suspicious, just that white noise. 

I was a bit disappointed, at the same time relieved. Although that white noise shouldn’t have been there, nothing in my room could have made a noise like that. I didn’t want to over-think the situation, so I ended up hitting the bed. Later that night, as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before, slowly dozing off to sleep. I hadn’t been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when you’re in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you. I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere. Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise, it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder. I continued lying in bed, trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred, this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room. It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work. It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice; very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian. 

It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from, I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar. I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights. I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch, for the blink of an eye, just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again; just as the light went on. The same stare, same face, still that black and white filtered look from before. I got so shocked I fell down on the floor, the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant. I wasn’t sure what to make of this, and I definitely didn’t want to tell my father about what I had seen, knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital. 

I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldn’t let me sleep, I just couldn’t sleep at all. I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up, these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter. I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become. Whatever this all meant, and needless to say; I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

I met my father in the kitchen the next day, he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him. He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his work-crew later that afternoon. I was happy for him; he deserved some time out of the stress. After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added: “Have you been thinking of your mother lately?” As if he could read my mind. I told him that I was always missing my mother, and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately. He stated that he thought I had. I had no clue why.  Short after that he left for playing golf.

I kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night, I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing. In fact, I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed, how could it have been on? I had no idea. 

Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers. I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours. I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk, it got me a slight reminder on how he hadn’t gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet. The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort, as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company. I don’t know how I’d describe it better than that. After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address, I remember wondering why dad wouldn’t show me something like this: 

“Daddy, why didn’t you visit me last weekend. I thought you were coming back, I was waiting for you. I’m sorry if I made a scene, I thought something had happened to you! I ran to you because I wanted answers, no one has answers here. I’ve been getting visits lately, why can’t you come to me at the same time?”

I fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you, my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five year-old in this state. On after-thought I guessed my dad didn’t tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasn’t in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges. Although thinking about it, that doesn’t sound ridiculously different than a mental hospital.

The rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of work-related things and records of local police-investigations. Why would my father be looking into cases of murder, pedophilia, rape and almost anything you can think of? It wasn’t really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up. I knew he had a friend in the police force, that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them. I didn’t even want to know at the time, I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadn’t slept in far too long.
I apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that I’m dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there, I’m only taking precautions to make sure that I’m telling it right. If I’m finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right. 

My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work, which made complete sense. It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room, I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar. This time I wasn’t using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again. My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before, something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time, I wasn’t worrying about that. I was thinking about my mother showing herself again. Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itself.

Not too long into that night I started feeling sick of being in-doors for so long, and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing. I remember being on the sane side of the fence, thinking critically and trying to find solutions, not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell. I figured I’d take my bike down to a local gas station, not more than ten minutes from my house; I wanted some chips, candy and maybe a couple cans of soda. 

I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off; I got there faster than I thought I would. It wasn’t cold outside either; it was a pretty smooth night. After grabbing some generic brand of chips, Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left. I didn’t spend much time in the store, but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen. With no bike, feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home. 

Something out of the ordinary happened after this, and I wasn’t even sure if I was seeing things at first. I was walking on this huge open road; I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road. It was tied together with the forest behind our house. It was the type of road that didn’t have any traffic other than truck drivers, passing once every couple of hours at night. I didn’t want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what you’d imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear. I assumed she was looking for me; she was definitely staring at me. 

I continued walking, not necessarily fearing my sister. It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her, that she would never have done anything to hurt me. As I approached her she didn’t give me any response what so ever, she was just staring at me in a light-blue scrub-coat, looking lifeless. I had reached talking-distance; I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like one of those scenarios you can’t be prepared for in real life. She had started to shake a bit, I couldn’t tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous. I asked her if she was looking for me out there, and if she had escaped the hospital. She didn’t respond. I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me, as if I was a threat to her. 

After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back. I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon, or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it. She started to slowly bring it forth, it was a plastic bag. From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasn’t heavy, or dangerous for that matter. I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag, then she started to stretch it out to me: “I took this from your house the other day, I’m sorry. I think this belongs to you. Jonathan.” 

I do realize that I never told you my name, it is indeed Jonathan. I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even; she seemed to be so out of it. I remember grabbing the plastic bag, she wouldn’t let go of it too lightly either, it was as if she still wanted it. After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence, she wouldn’t stop staring into my eyes during these. Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad. Shortly after she started walking towards the forest; as if she knew where she was heading. 

I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister, whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit. I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dad’s car, acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch, as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister. I didn’t even know if I wanted him to catch her or not, she was purposely running away from him. He dragged her into his car and they both drove away, heading the direction he was originally going. This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital, and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times? Something wasn’t right, I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasn’t anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her. Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school, but that doesn’t change the logic of it. He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister, since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thing.

I ran the rest of the way home, trying not to drop anything; I still had all the items I bought at the gas station. I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did; I had no clue whenever he would get back, and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me. I couldn’t spot my dad’s car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house. I didn’t bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything, I made my way back to my room as fast as I could. I don’t really know why but I locked the door after me, as if there was something to fear. I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on. I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside; as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me. 

I never really thought of something until now, and that is how my sister could have found me. It must have been a coincidence, or she had been following me for a while; knowing she couldn’t approach me in the store. I don’t know.

I looked into the bag, it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room, and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen. After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever, for example there was a roll of tape in there. I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items. The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos, most being after mom died. The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks; they weren’t even dry, I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag. There was only one thing left in the bag, an usb-stick. 

I took the stick out and threw away the bag. Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house. The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasn’t sent to the hospital yet, but it was pretty much pending already. In fact, most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away. On one of them it’s my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing, she actually wasn’t acting too badly the first couple of weeks. I guess she didn’t process our mother’s death until later or something. Another photo is of dad’s old car, he had to sell it in order to compensate for our family’s financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had, my mother’s candle business. He loved that damn car with his entire heart; we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car. 

There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter “x” behind them. It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me. I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking. I figured my sister must have had done this, for what reason I was about to find out. I kept staring at the first picture; it was the one I told you about earlier, the one of my father’s old car. It was a Pontiac from the early 80’s and it must have cost him a fortune. I never had any particular memories of the car; I remember it spending most of its time in our garage.

I kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadn’t use the car more, he obviously loved it. The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper, for selling it of course. I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat. It wasn’t very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent. She had the same drained-out appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room, and this was taken after her death. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. I remember dropping the photo out of shock; so many thoughts started circling inside of my head.

dinofinger,0,,1,1rie11,,1,"    17^th May 2007.
I followed my dad went to Grandma's house. My cousin who lives with grandma, had a suspicion that something had happen to Aunt L &gt; *Her initial would be appropriate here* &lt; Aunt L was never in her sound mind but she prefer to live alone which is the best option avoiding the troubles she would cause to others. Grandma has a problem of [nagging](https://www.google.com/search?q=nagging&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a) disease which makes more Aunt L better suit live far from her lectures. 

Back again to my cousin, who received a call from Aunt L's neighbour. Her respond was *there was a sudden silent for the past four days*. Aunt L was never a social person who goes anywhere she wants and always out. She prefered to live in her tiny apartment secluded only her herself and herself she enjoys being with. But her neighbour help us to watch for her just in case for anything. So we respond to go and visit her house. My father, my cousin and I, the three of us went together with nothing held us back. 

As we arrive by the door, we knock and knock. From the window we can see noise screen from her small tv at the corner. But there was no sign of her. Somehow her grill lock and the door were changed, the key my cousin brought didn't fit at all. Maybe she doesn't want us to barge in anytime we want. My dad took the liberty to call the locksmith while giving positive thoughts to my cousin that everything was fine. 

30 minutes pass. The locksmith do his magic and opened the door. Such stench came out in full loaded right to our faces. Right in front of the door we can see Aunt L laid still in the toilet facing the floor. A 15 year old me shocked and I just watched her body in strip condition only a towel covered her other half and her faeces was right below her and all over behind her. Yet she is still alive, blinking and gasping.

My dad pull me back allowing my cousin to go in. I can still feel my father clenches my arms so tightly when he saw his sister. He said ""*[I better call the ambulance](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-an-Ambulance)*"", so he did and left. My cousin call me out to help pick her up. But she was too heavy, we can't even push her to the side. So my cousin rinse her with water to clean her off. I was told to took a towel and wipe her face. I could say her face was in a total blankness. 

25 minutes later the ambulance arrive. They took her with a stretcher. Both of us went down to send her off. I can remember certain vision of some neighbours pry on their window looking out what was happening. My dad went together with Aunt L, so left me and my cousin. Soon my mom and sister arrive bringing cleaning equipment. We spent whole 3 hours cleaning her house. Based on what I heard my cousin said ""*The man who always deliver her food got no respond from her for three days. That's when he ask the neighbour if she had gone somewhere. I bet if we were too late, she might have gone by any minute unconscious on the floor*""


    18^th May, 2013
We had her funeral in the day after the day we thought she would died 6 years ago. Funny the coincidence of the date just *one day after* we laughed. My cousin gave a speech said she was a fighter. Indeed she was. I think her life is better after that 17^th May living in the retirement home. She was more happier than before she was a shut-in. R.I.P Aunt L, our auntie we always concern hereafter. ",Brief moments,2,nosleep

As I was doing this, the big rocking chair next to his litter box was swaying, and I gave him a quick glance. I felt him sniff at my ear. He then jumped off the chair and walked into the kitchen. I thought nothing of it for a few seconds, then froze. ""Oliver!"", I called. I then walked to the door and looked outside, he was napping on the steps.

echoes007,4,,2,1rhee9,,2,"I’ve always been a non-religious person. I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything. To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily. But I’ve always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff. I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this “religious experience” we all want, but I never got it. So, after a while, I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God, or spiritual experience, or anything that’s real, that will make me see life in a whole new perspective. Naturally, this got me down and depressed a bit. It was then when I started seeing 11:11 everywhere. It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines. I remember vividly, my heart stopped, and I remember a sound, like a blender going off in my head. When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me, I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box. It read 11:11. This stuck with me for a long long time. I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was 11:11 in the morning and 11:11 at night. As if reminding me that it saved my life. This was going on for a while, when I went as far as Googling what it was. Unfortunately, the 11:11 thing was associated to some spiritual stuff, things I thought were bullshit to begin with. But still, 11:11 was always there. Slowly I stopped thinking about it, and my 11:11 experiences were less and less. It wasn’t until last week when I was driving home (I was butt sober) from an event when it started raining. My tires and brakes were messed up and I didn’t get a chance to change them, and besides, it hardly ever rains in this town, so this came as a surprise to me. As I was driving up a hill, I lost control of my car completely on the wet road, and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car, but I couldn’t. This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road. Again, when I snapped out of my panic mode, the first thing I looked at was the time, and it said 11:11. I’m not one who believes in coincidences, but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me. Even though I don’t believe this stuff, there is NO way that could happen. Has anyone else experienced 11:11, or has randomly been “forced” to look at a clock when it’s 11:11? Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSD/DMT I took? ",11:11,4,nosleep
Jerbsybear,0,,0,1rh5g6,,2,"There are tales of a man committed to Central State

Who killed his wife and children while he asphyxiates

His doctors with the bloody spinal cord

Of his fat nurse, who cares if she was old

When the guards rushed in, it was no problem at all

bashing their brutish faces straight into the wall

Bursting through the heavy front doors

He killed everyone on the first floor

No one would stop him, no, not this time

5 years of waiting, no stopping on a dime

He had to get out on this night

To meet his lover, one at first sight

Taking his science class, year after year

Convinced that she loved him, held him dear

Called her ""favorite student"" and all

Had her parents give him a call

To invite him to dinner, on a cold winter's night

Slaughtered her family, their faces were a sight

In the judge's court, he mercilessly pleaded insanity

When, in reality, it was egotistical vanity

If he couldn't have her, no one can

To kill her new parents was the plan

Standing outside of the house that was soon to be theirs,

Looking to seek justice, to seek what's fair

So as he broke in and brandished the knife

She knew he was back to take a life

So quickly she fled into the night

Leaving behind more victims, as she took flight

She ran two miles straight to the highway

Waving for anyone to stop, to go her way

As hand grabbed her from behind the bushes

His knife drives deeper and deeper as it pushes

Past her vitals and deep into her heart

All flashbacks of her life seemed to fall apart

As he whispers ""This...feels so right""

Her mind tries to escape into the night

The fires of his greed are not yet doused

As he tries to get back to the house

He plans to take another life

While sharpening his serrated knife

""Am I next, is he coming,"" you cry with fear

InsanityInABottle,0,,1,1rgw03,,2,"“Extra, Extra! The Piggy killer is at it again!” Yelled the paperboy, holding a darkened paper above his head, screaming the same phrase over again, as if it was no big deal. I walked towards him and asked him “How much?”
“Only ten cents sir.”
“Ha. Must be a pretty good story then.” I said, as I fumbled for a large dime. I handed it into the boy’s hand, it’s gleam bouncing the light of the sun, veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes. I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper, quickly turning from the boy, hearing “How about a tip sir?”
“How about you wipe your ass with the metal I’ve already given you.” I said back to the boy, who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers. As I walked along Hero’s Avenue, I kept the paper open, reading it over again. In large font, shouted “Piggy killer’s new victim!” with a picture of a woman, apparently known by the name of “Jessica Turrow.” She wore a large smile on her face, as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast, I presumed.
	The article read “The psychopath, depicted as a man with a pig’s head on worn over his own face, has struck again. Witnesses described him as large, while wearing a reddened trench coat, then finally, a bib, which read the term KISS THE COOK, slathered neatly against his chest in gore. He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual, was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn. We had identified the victim, through a ring found on the hand of the woman, who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church. If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description, contact the police immediately, or you may be his next victim.”
	I laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands, all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another, threading the needle on the two way street, not large enough for two cars to fit on.
	I walked towards the police station, which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop, a brothel and a printing office. A police car drove by; it’s loud horn sounding, flashing red and white, reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes. I walked into the station, the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose. A man screamed from across a large waiting room, looking down at the paper, then looked up and said “Oh. It’s the wonderful Flynn. Of course my dear, come, come.” I walked past him, glaring at his smug face, and then opening the door into my office.
	A man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me. He smiled and said, “Well hello sir, I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killer”
“The pig one?”
“Y- wait, there are more?”
“I believe there are, just they might not like attention as much as our friend here.”
“Well… thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept, but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer, coming out of his lair.”
	The man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk, arranging them appropriately. “So, if you look at these pictures, it was for when he first got into the business, holding small weapons, all identifiable, all related to the cutting of meat. Then as you look to the left, these are the later pictures, which are of him coming out, holding bodies on his shoulders, sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up, putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself, all the while in his pig mask. But, he seems to be getting careless. He cam outside, barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo, his face seemed veiled in… something. Something sticky, something gruesome. But if you look closer, you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face. Large, hooked nose, eyes, clouded in blue, teeth, sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouth.”
“Ha. So you’re basically implying that you’ve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it? I beginning to suspect you’re the killer!”
“But that would be silly. Why would a crazy give himself away?”
“I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”
“I believe this conversation is getting a bit heated. I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought I’d tell you where I’ve seen such events. Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on 1800 Bellcove Street? Well there’s your place. Sir!” said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag, which smelled of defecation and nickels. I watched as he slammed the door, then sighed and sat down on my desk, rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter, updating the information I’ve received from the man.
“Mysterious man visits police station, says he has a lead on the piggy killer. As you all know, the notorious killer has crossed the line now. Enough to even be called a serial killer! What a sick bastard he is.” I continued being as pessimistic as possible, updating the paper, then grabbing my camera as I finished the article. Typing in my name, finishing with my name, saying “Written by: Flynn Covetail.”
	Darkness was beginning to shroud the air, perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment. Light rain was spattering against my window, racing down to the bottom of the screening, only to fall against an umbrella below. As I left my office, throwing on my coat, I screamed to the man in the front desk, “Going out to…oh, let’s see...1800 Bellcove Street? If I don’t come back, Phone someone.” I said with a laugh, while walking outside.
	Instantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on “Western Lagoon highway” as the frivolously worthless people would say. I walked down towards the street, which was naught but four blocks from here. I passed by Dontell’s Donuts, Redgar’s Rotisserie and Salam’s Spices, all involved in the fattening of desperate cops, as only fattening diners were located near the station, so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against us.
	I reached the butcher’s place, which had been looted to hell by the anarchists, who were just a group of thugs that didn’t do shit to overthrow the government. The door had been pried off it’s hinges, yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains, hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe. Within the butchery, the first thing I noticed was a bed, a homeless man sleeping on it.
	I simply ignored the bum and walked around, searching for anything considered suspicious. I walked through the door, smelling the bum’s shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could. I looked through the shop, behind the counter I found several rusted knifes, which were corroded to the counter, which was a wooden rotten thing, with three cutting boards lining it, all of which nobody needed. The front of the shop seemed completely normal, but I listened to the bum waking, instantly screaming, “Who’s there! I will kill you if you’re trespassing on my property!” I laughed and screamed to him “I suggest you run out of here, or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes.” I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor, running towards me.
	I quickly turned, backing up against the wall, my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!” I shot to the side of the man, who quickly bolted for the door, a rat following closely behind him. I sat for a minute, catching my breath, while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion. As I stood, I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my head.








	Ha. Damn fool didn’t even know what he had coming. Shouldn’t have fucked with my grandpa… shouldn’t have yelled. My ears hurt. Are they ringing? Why the FUCK am I here? I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air, the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face, the pig’s blood leaking down my neck, warming me, keeping the cold away. I looked at my setup, which was simply the back room of a butcher’s shop, a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a room.
	Blood dripped into wooden bowls I’d gotten from the shop, the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling. Pigs, cows, chickens, even a few deer, but the most stubborn of prey, the pigs. The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling, their wrists cut, their feet missing, their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths. The damned pigs that walked the streets, reading their stories about who? About me! The beautiful man, who is dealing righteousness to the crazies, to the rich. Though they think that they’re so safe in their leather homes, they should be the ones making chairs; their dried hides need to be a part of furniture!
	Oh, what an inventor I will be! But the best part is, nobody looks twice at the photographer. Nobody looks at who’s behind the camera; they only care about the picture! And I am finally the one in the picture! Flynn, the little anus that believed he owned the whole world, because the police were backing him up. NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCH!
	I whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express. I raise him in the air, catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck. This self-conceited asshole needs one thing. A hook curving through the cheek, wrenched from his cheek. He thought I was the killer? NO! THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORD!
	Oh! My friend is waking up! Finally a new toy to play with. Oh, what a joy he will be! Oh no! What will I say to him? I guess I’ll just wing it. I guess I’ll just talk to him.  Where will I display this beauty? Ooh! The police station! Mmm, how delectable would that be? To show the pigs that even their weapons can’t defend them from me. THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME! I am a hero. I love being a hero and don’t try to talk me out of my heroism! I AM AMAING!








	My eyes slowly opened, to find a man in a pig mask, the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on it’s face. I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts! Why does my leg hurt? Where the hell am I? “Oh… you’ve awakened!” spouted the pig; it’s squeaky voice ringing through my ears. I screamed, “Help me! Help! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” 
“Now that’s not how you treat a guest, is it?”
“Fuck you.”
“Oh… language, language my dear friend. If you even try saying something like that, I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend Mr.Squeaks over here!”
	I looked to where he was pointing, which was a large column in the room, a decomposing rat nailed to the pole. “Somebody is going to catch you. They know where I am!”
“Oh, I believe they do, if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say!” said the phsyco with a smile. He pointed at the ceiling, which had two hooks on it, chains hanging from them and a headless man, blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness, into a wooden bowl. “Why are you doing this to these people?”
“Okay, okay, story time. Oh yay, stories! FUCK OFF GREG, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!”
	I looked at the pig with doubt, pain shooting up my leg, throbbing slowly into my brain. “SO, let me tell you why I love my job, okay? Okay. So, when I was twelve, I thought, I’m going to take pictures of weddings! I’m going to take pictures of people in love, because everyone else’s happiness, is mine.” He said this, while pinning his right hand against his heart, which contained an extra few layers of flesh, sewed against his own, along with a tattoo, stolen from his victim.
	“Okay, so anyways! What do ya know! I’m doing that now! I am a photographer! I love people being happy. SO, I one day, was at this one glorious wedding, full of lovely people. I had started talking to a woman and a little, oh what is it called? Fetish of mine was developed. As we were in bed, I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know, I have a few other… kinks. I wrung my hands around her delicate throat, stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth! I felt the rush as eventually, she started to fuckin’ bleed! WHAT A WHORE! She began to cough up blood, she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat, landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched, did I realize how wonderful blood tastes. Rich, creamy, delicious, blood, coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps. I invented ways of sucking people dry, licking them dry! Well, at first I was only an amateur, but, as I got better! Oh BOY did I start to love my job! Every wedding became a slaughter, every wedding gave me a new friend, because after all, nobody cares about who’s behind the camera! NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITS!
	So, pretty boy, I believe it’s time; you… started looking into my eyes, whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body.” He said this as his hand slid down from my chest, slowly down to my cock, grinning, spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed, slid a blade against it as chopped it off. I screamed out loud, blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled, then I fell asleep, never to wake again.

ReiKoroshiya,0,,0,1rgsca,,2,"Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life. Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me out.
how about I start at the beginning that seems easier. Well back in elementary, I was that kid the kid that really no one liked. I had a friend here and there but that's about it. I was basically a social outcast, 
I never really got my work done, I still don't. Note that I was a very, very angry child and no I was not spoiled if that's what your thinking, im the oldest of 3 kids who had been and are growing up in poverty, but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheap.
I had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head. I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the 3rd grade I found an author by the
name of R.L.Stine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interests.
A few of the simple things had scared me, and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind, I don't remember much about my childhood at all.
I don't know why I can't but that's just how it is. I do remember bits and pieces though, not anything like birthdays, mind you. Here Ile give some examples, I remember
when I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes, I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away. Years later I went back and found it, and of course it wasn't scary anymore. Another example
would be when I saw a ""witch"" in my closet, but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there, I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back on.
Once he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again. I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the room
and they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently 
about it. I can't remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly. Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldn't understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys, I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bed(I got top bunk). Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years, not much really
they don't seem to want to talk much about when I was younger. I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church, and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of me.
keep in mind I don't remember that about going to church, as a matter of fact I don't remember going to church at all. hmmm.... well skip forward to middle school where I had
actually made friends. I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny. I could barely even go a week without at least one detention. Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too, now
drugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that, but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I mean
certain ones that is, the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do, smoke, drink, etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and there
is no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I can't afford it and because of that im drug free. Not to much
happened in middle school, only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams (oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so if
say I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it, I also talk in my sleep) which sucks ass, The vast 
majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be home
free. I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won, even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldn't consider it a nightmare. I got my own room in the basement which was nice, and well my brother he was, how do you put it? 
Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that. Electronic malfunctions had started occurring, like waking up to my radio playing static, my alarm clock started to malfunction, etc. I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock 
went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear. Skip forward to highschool in the 9th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a change.
I read the hell out of creepypasta's and found some really cool narrators for them, listening to those was very enjoyable I didn't read scps often and I found a very long series called the holders.
Near the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didn't have a bad feeling to it, the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any sense.
Jump forward one more year, I had flunked my freshman year because I don't do my work. On those professional tests that they make you take S.A.T's or some shit I did 
insanely good on those like I should be an A- student overall. Now i reside in alternative ed. Im 15 right now. I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead of
Baptist a few months ago. Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymore.
That thing I actually saw it, I fucking saw it, it was short like about a foot and a half tall. I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleep
with my blankets over my head. Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away 
from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me. I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it I
think it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day. It might have seen me and it might be watching me type this.
It is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really, really dark, everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around it.

highchairchildren,3,,1,1rgqmu,,2,"I'm looking for any input. If anyone has had experiences like this, is there a way to stop it?

So this started about two years ago. In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling, like something bad was going to happen all the time.  I was anxious, always alert and never at rest. I hardly slept, primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer. 

Then, I started seeing things.

When I say seeings things I don't mean like hallucinations, well not really. I'm not crazy. There were never any voices and there never have been. It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes. 

Mostly accidents.  It happened once while I was sledding.  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about 20 ft. or so where it met a busy road. Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes, people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill. A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened. I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by. There was blood everywhere. I snapped back to reality and looked around. Everything was fine. There was no blood, nobody was hurt, just kids sledding around having fun. 

I continued to have random ""visions"" for the entire year. They varied in severity. The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards.  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner.  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove.  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash.  As I was seeing it, I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove. In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed, begging me to stop.  I snapped back and couldn't speak. I teared up and thought I was going to puke.  I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, sat down on the ground and cried. I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life. I got up and reentered the kitchen, finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened.  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness.  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldn't come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me.  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldn't afford. 

Then it stopped. As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than I'd had before.  It stayed away for a while. I mean really a long time.  I was vision free for an entire year.

I was prompted to write this because I had another one the other.  The first in over a year but I am scared. I don't want it to start again.  The most recent one was more subtle.  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg, somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere.  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain.  Then I flashed back and it wasn't there. I hadn't even cut myself.

I know this must sound crazy, like some Final Destination bullshit.  I swear to you I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't have hopes that someone could help.  Any input is welcomed.",Can anyone help?,3,nosleep

Sure your parents tell you it's nothing and when you get older you grow out of it but there is always something in the back of your mind that makes you afraid of it. 


Maybe your claustrophobic of the thought of the darkness surrounding you, consuming you to the point where you are trapped not seeing the light again.

Grumbling to myself, I drag my feet to the car, get in and turn the key.  Nothing.  Just great.  Well, at least it’s only about a three-mile walk home.  I pocket my keys and think about grabbing my rescue knife for just a fleeting moment.  It’s not the best of neighborhoods but I should be fine walking home.  *Leave it*.

As I make my way down the street, passing one unspectacular building after another, I notice an attractive woman walking a few steps ahead of me.  I smile to myself and try to remember the last time I’ve been with a woman.  She glances back, notices me leering at her like an inexperienced teenager. She slows down.  

*Is she smiling at me*? 

“Hey there, you’re looking a little down.  What’s wrong?”

“N-nothing.” 

It’s a wonder I was able to stammer out any sort of reply.  She’s gorgeous, why talk to me?  Soft face with bright blue eyes that I could only stare at in wonder. Plump lips, coated in pink, oily lip-gloss.  Her jet black hair billowing lazily in the wind.  That damn smile.  

“Well, I was looking to have a good time and you’re more than welcome to join me hun.  For a price.” 

*Oh, now it makes sense. Well, screw it, why not*? 

I nod my head in reply and agree.  I follow her, mind wandering onto more…primal needs.  I should have been paying attention to my surroundings, noting the darker and more abandoned area where I was being led.  We’re walking up old, brittle concrete steps that must have been laid down decades ago before I think clearly again.  Too late to take note of my surroundings now.  The iron railing I grasp is cold and worn down but rough from all the years of exposure.  The air is thick, heavy and smells moldy.  *How can someone even breathe in there*?

We enter the loft.  *Was there something on the door*?  *Did she give me a name*? *I can’t remember anything*. *What was I doing here again*?  My view suddenly shifts to something out of an old video game.  I get a bird’s eye view of the place. It’s all pixelated 8-bit graphics.  One other woman was walking around but I can’t make out any of her features.  *This is…odd*.  I feel a light touch on my shoulder and the whisper of soft words, stealing my attention away from everything else to once again focus solely on her.  Her breath was warm, causing shivers to tremor throughout my body.  My view violently shifts back to my own eyes.  I look to the beautiful, mysterious woman with nothing but a blank look in my eyes.  

""Make yourself comfortable on the bed over there.  We’ll have to wait for our bodyguard to get her before we can have any fun.  He can’t make it until the night so until then, relax."" 

I should have found that last statement weird.  *What time was it*?  *Wasn’t it dark out when we were walking here*?  *Why do we have to wait for a bodyguard now*?  *I’m already here*.  *If I were to do something, wouldn’t I have already done it*?  *Forget it.*  I flop onto the bed and lay down on my back, right leg extended while the left is pulled up as if I’m mirroring the number four with my legs.  The other, indistinguishable woman joins us.  She cuddled up next to me on my right side further emptying my head of what little rational thoughts I had left.  That sweet voice was back in my left ear, talking to me as if I was the most important person in the world.  *When did she make it onto the bed?  Wasn’t she just standing by the doorway?*  

She drapes her unnaturally soft leg over my left leg and blithely draws random designs onto my chest with her fingertips. 

""Alright baby, relax, we’ll be having fun before you know it.""

I can’t wipe this stupid smile off my face.  I close my eyes for what seems like a moment.  When I open them, something is wrong.  Very wrong.  The room that seemed so inviting is now dark and cold.  I can’t see a doorway, just an empty shadowy space that seemed to stretch open like a hungry maw twisting my vision as the room seemed spin uncontrollably.  My heart pounds in my chest.  I look to my right where the other woman once was.  She's gone.  The familiar weight is on my left but I can’t move my leg.  I need to get up.  I need to leave.  I can’t be here anymore.  Get off me!  

The form next to me shifts, straddles me.  Her arms are straight, each palm flat, firmly planted next to my shoulders.  The long, black hair is in my face.  I can feel it faintly brush against my skin.  I try to move her off of me but she won’t budge.  I’m pinned down like a helpless prisoner.  She slowly begins to raise her head.  I notice her once beautiful eyes are now shut.  Bulged, gray eyelids are all that I can see.  Her entire face is now dull, pocked with blemishes.  I start to breathe heavily, close to hyperventilating.  The head continues to rise.  Wake up!  Oh God, wake up! Sometimes wrong!  I try to move again.  My legs won’t work.  My arms won’t work.  I can’t tear away my eyes from her dead, leaden face.  I start to scream.  

My eyes snap open.  I’m home in bed.  I still can’t move my legs.  There’s heavy pressure on my chest and I can’t stop breathing heavily.  There’s a slight outline of a woman above me, face now unrecognizable.  I can still feel her hair on my face.   *Get it off*!!  *Was she laughter at me before I woke up*? *Roll over*.  *Turn on the TV or light or something*! *Anything*.  *Relax….relax…I’m never sleeping on my back again*.

Johnvincent1,0,,2,1rbvri,,1,"The closest thing I have ever documented to a legitimate ghost is a photo that my aunt took last month. My family (mother, three aunts, five cousins and six or seven second-cousins) went to visit my grandparents on their farm in Cairo, New York. The little sparsely inhabited town is about 100 miles north of NYC and about a three hour drive from our home on Long Island. I've been visiting my grandparents up there for years now and have been visiting the farm every summer since I was born (and winter too since my grandparents moved there permanently after they sold their home on LI about 8 or 9 years back). I'm very comfortable up there, even though nights are sometimes a bit eerie due to the streetlights being either nonexistent or widely spread and the nightly barking of wild dogs in the woods surrounding the house.

Anyway, I'm going to try to keep this brief. To the story now.

My aunt and her boyfriend are recently engaged and my aunt used this little opportunity to bring up her boyfriend's parents (who are Italian immigrants) with them to meet my grandparents. This was the first time they ever met in person and the two couples seemed to hit it off quite quickly. It made sense because my grandfather is Italian and pretty much thought that my aunt's boyfriend's parents were really nice and intriguing people, I suppose. 

The time passed quickly and before anyone knew it, it was 2:30 AM. My aunt and her boyfriend decided it was time to take his parents down the road to their rooms at the Bavarian Manor. 

The Manor is a 150 year old Inn that spans many acres and boasts gorgeous lakeside rooms and a peaceful atmosphere. As well as some pretty spooky vibes now and then when the hour is late.

So my aunt and her future husband took his parents down the road, walked them to their rooms and then back down the stairs and started to head back through the lobby when my aunt's boyfriend stops. 

""Hey, this is weird. Did you feel that?""

My aunt looked at him, puzzled. ""No. What are you talking about?""

He shook his head, ""I don't know, I think I just felt something pass us. Something cold.""

My aunt said at that point, she actually did feel a little cold and this scared her. She wanted to leave.

""Wait,"" he said. ""Let's just take pictures. Just one each, me and you, of the lobby and if we don't see anything we'll get out of here. I just have this weird fucking feeling.""

My aunt just looked at him and agreed to do it because she just wanted to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. So she took a picture. And then he took a picture. He looked down at his and frowned. 

""Nothing,"" he grunted. ""What about you?""

He looked over at my aunt and her face was utter stone.

""What? What are you looking at?"" He moved closer and peered over her shoulder. He shivered as he stared down at the phone and saw this...

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/3SAE9Of)

They then sped home and showed everyone who was still awake the photo. Everyone seemed to have the same reaction: Complete and total shock. No one could believe their eyes, and as a family of believers (in the supernatural) we all felt a little shaken to have this (even if it is but a shred) proof from a source in our own family who we know is honest and has no reward to gain in something like this. She just snapped the photo... And that's what came out in it. I still get the chills thinking about going back up there again, which I'll be doing next week (the day after Thanksgiving and for the whole weekend). I'd be lying if I said I wasn't preparing to venture over to the Manor to do some... ""Hunting"" of my own.

Last summer i got a job working at a local car yard. I would usually just strip cars of their parts. It was a nice job but the heat was unbearable. I remember having to go inside every 30 mins just to take a break. one day i was at my station pulling apart a rear end. i had left my tool on my table when i had left to go inside. when i came back out i noticed the tool was gone. i looked every where. i gave up and borrowed another tool from my co-worker. later that day i was locking up what we called the backyard. the backyard was basically a large field where we placed all of are cars. when locking the opening to it i found my tool near when of the cars. i thought maybe the guys there were pulling a prank. i asked them but they said they had nothing to do with it. as the days went by, more and more odd things took place. while at work one day i had noticed the gate to the backyard kept opening and shaking. i thought it was just the wind but something in my mind knew it wasnt. i went to go check it out and see what was making it go back and forth. as i approached the gate something moved behind the car. i yelled out but nothing happened. i stood there for a few minutes, my heart was pounding in my chest. soon i saw movement again i stepped back and without warning a tall dark figure rose up. i stepped back not knowing what to do. i ran back to my station where i had kept a gun. i grabbed the gun and ran back but nothing was there. the next day we put motion sensors just in case the intruder came back, nothing happened that week. the next week i was driving home late and noticed someone was behind me. this was very unusual, since i took a dirt road home. the car soon stopped and turned out its headlights. once i got home i noticed my front door was opened. i sat there in disbelief staring at the opened door. suddenly a dark figure came out of the door. we made eye contact and the figure fled back into the house. i ran inside with the same gun i had at my work. i searched the house for the next hour. the house was a reck, everything had been torn. i was in complete shock not knowing what do to. i called the cops but they weren't much help. the next night i woke up heard banging out side my window. i turned on the porch light and outside there were three men in dark cloths whispering. i soon as they saw me they all looked at me and said something i could not understand. i ran outside but they mysteriously vanished. the following morning i noticed two weird symbols on the wall they had been near. ive tries washing it off but i wont go away. i have since left my job and have never seen them again

ChainerSummons,0,,10,1r79o3,,0,"First, allow me to assure you that I am certain of my sanity and of my cognitive abilities. My name is Zachary Wilhelm.

My logic- whether it is flawed or otherwise, leads me to believe that each person knows fear. Viewing these fears in those I observe shows that it is safe to say that each person has rooted, elemental fears.

More accurately, we are afraid of the unknown within the dark, or more commonly the uncertainty of the future or that of death and what lies beyond.

It is said by some that at one point such irrational fear was more than a leftover disposition from the dawn of mankind. I believe that this collection of fears served our ancestors well, and that they continue to serve us.

I assure you, this phobia is not some obsolete racial trigger. We need this now as much as ever.

There are some of us, maybe even a few of you reading this, who are aware of the presence of the unseen. Aware that existence continues in darkness and that it is possible for that existence to expand beyond our initial perception. Maybe, like me, you feel a pressure in your head and hear a light, squeaking ring just barely audible to you, whispering that the world has changed around you. Others I have met and spoken to say that their first sign of these dangers is a smell of ozone, as if a massive electrical charge had been displaced nearby, rending the air.

I would speculate that we all feel these things from time to time in some form or another, but that it does not register on our conscious level. For those of us that have this sense, that unease may be keeping us intact and connected to the world we know. 

Ask yourself how it is possible in such a modern age of technology and advancement to simply disappear when we interact with so many people on a daily basis. Every day, more people just seem to cease to be. Sure, some... Hell, I'll be generous- MOST of the missing are eventually found either dead, alive, or however they may be found. We'll give it a nice big optimistic percentage of 80%. These pretenses seem solid, even hopeful. Four of five isn't bad at all, right?

What about the other one in five who blinks out of existence, never to return? Every town has that ""One in five"" disappearance that is just... gone- simply gone. It's as if the mist just swallowed them right up, isn't it?

This is just so. That is exactly what is happening. All these obscuring veils appear naturally throughout the world, with no exception. Every continent, nation, town, village... And they are created under predictable and natural conditions. Certainly there is no harm in the morning mists, but have you ever seen fog when the air was too dry and cool to hold it aloft and reason dictates it should simply not be? 

Within these otherworldly variations of nature, the world around you may slip away, and everything outside your vision ceases to be. Sound and light fall away, and you stand utterly isolated in your waning bubble of perception. You may have felt this, as I have. I would prefer to think we all have, but may have suppressed our  fearful senses.

These veils are like the curtains of a stage; heavy and thick and not meant to be crossed by us, the audience. Behind them lies the workings of our world and what may lie further beyond them still- into the epitome of our concept of the unknown or unknowable.

Allycat662,7,,8,1r67oh,,0,"Have you ever ran into *those* type of people that just fucking grate you the wrong way; the arrogant ones who get away with tons of shit and know they can get away with it?  Not the instances where you rise above it and claim your stake... but the more helpless cases.

You just want karma to intervene and give that little prick what's coming to them.

Energy work is something that I've been doing for over half my life, and there are ways to speed karma up on certain individuals who you feel have done grievous injustices to yourself and others.  There are definitely other ways to handle things of course, but I'd rather not have to kill people.  There are important lessons to be learned of karma and the desire to do harm to others.  There's a creed out there stating that whatever energy you put out into the world, you will get the same energy back threefold.


The first time I used energy against a person was when I was 14.  I did a stupid harmless love spell to get a crush of mine on a date.  He did agree on the date, but of course he got back with his ex.  Total energy backfire.

The second time I used energy against a person was a year later as a sophomore.  There was a really cute upperclassman I talked to all the time.  He told me that his long term relationship was crumbling and he just didn't feel it anymore.

His girl at the time was a likeable person, but she had an air of snottery about her I found irritating.  One day she walked by me while I was at my locker, and I threw my energy at her aggressively.  I didn't wish anything specifically, but the following Monday she walked into school with a broken leg in full cast.  Holy fucking shit.

Now, this may be just me, but I felt horrible about it.  And I got hurt too in return that same day in gym class.  I didn't break anything but it was an embarrassing situation since the cute upperclassman happened to share that class.

At this point I stopped using my energy against people.  I can do without the concequences. Until recently of course.  

I happened to stumble across a jerk-ass individual who was offensive in so many ways, it made my blood boil.  I don't use my energy against people anymore, so I did the next best thing:  I invoked the power of karma on their ass.

I collected the energy around me and made a silent plea to karma to give this asshole the karma coming to them.  I made the same plea another 12 times or so for good measure.  And karma answered in the form of physical pain against the offender.

Fml, what a frightening gift to have.  At first I gave in to karma and did nothing, but eventually I made another plea to karma that this person has had their karmic obligation fulfilled and to cease all further efforts (with a polite thank you).

The pain did subside, but gradual and slowly.

Now, I'm not going to say that this will work for all of you, and I'm sure it won't have much affect on situations much bigger than yourself, but I know that there's got to be some redditors out there that have done similar things.",Karma can be purposful. Can you use it?,8,nosleep
chocate,2,,5,1r5o4c,,1,"Cold nights, always cold.It gets really hot and you can actually feel the sun burn your skin but always always cold during the night. I was 10-11 years old at the time. I never met my father and my Mother left me and my brother with my Grandparents so she could work and give us a better future. Cold always cold. Constantly reminding myself that i was alone felt really cold. I had began to do bad in school, my grades were not the best. My mother had worked so hard for us, and all i could ever think was about how lonely i felt. I had my brother at my side but it always fell lonely. My heart had become a cold hard rock, always wanting to be loved but unable to.  10 years had already pass and i still remember how it felt, cold and yet so comforting. It felt like it understood me, and yet it felt so cold. 

I had always being a rebellious kid, always speaking my mind out. Never accepting what others thought is the right thing. I had developed my own acceptance of reality, i had to grow up fast and i was surprised at how childish the decisions of other kids were. i laugh at them, i saw them as lowly living creature. But those were my supposed friends. Always lonely no matter where i went, i was always fell left out. That feeling trigger my hated, and made me realized how superior i was to them. My heart was cold and i didn't care anymore. i just want to grow up fast and become something worthy of someone's live. 

i had done something real bad that night. Me and my brother were locked up in my old house. It was a flat with 3 rooms, it was old and falling to the ground, there were cracks all around. the windows were holding up somehow. My ant was really angry at me and my brother, she had always threaten us, saying that she would lock as up in that place. The place was were i was born, it was the place where i had grown up, it was the place where i saw my mother cry every day. Since the new house was built there was no need for me to go to the old house. There was nothing there after all. All empty and always so cold.  This night was no different everything was so dark, the only light you could see was the moon light. i could feel a chill going down my spine, i could feel my heart feeling been comforted, i felt like i belonged. Since we moved to the new house i couple of years ago, that place always scared me. Every time i went there i always left running,i always felt like something was always looking at me from behind, calling me, wanting me to stay there. There was always this malevolent presence, it didn't feel right. 

This night somehow was different, there was no presence, i couldn't feel anything. It was just cold. My brother was everything i had, a year younger independent as me, always looking strong as if nothing could ever hurt him. GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!! i heard him scream, his screams hold so much fear and so much loneliness, it sent chills down my spine. Every time he screamed i felt like if someone was patting on my back, rubbing his hand on my back. Cold, cold as my heart. I couldn't bear to see my brother so vulnerable, GET US OUT OF HERE!!!!! i could hear my self screaming. So much anger, it felt so good to scream my lungs out. It felt so good to finally scream my lungs out with no restrain. we scream for hours with no stop. 

I had some matches in my pocket, we lit up a fire with it which didn't last long. We had a metal bucket and some old would that had stay there. The fire didn't last long, as if there was not enough oxygen around. Even the burning fire felt so cold. we kept scream, asking to get us out of there. We been locked up for hours, it was already past midnight. You could see the moon and the starts, thousands of them. yet it was so dark and as always so cold. 

We screamed so much we felt as if our energy was being sucked in my something.  I felt week and light headed.  It suddenly got colder and colder, it was past midnight after all, it only gets colder. Suddenly we hear something scratching the door, as if it wanted to get in, and couldn't. It fell desperate, my aunt had the key and only her could open the door. There was no other way of opening it. There was no key sound, nothing everything fell as if space had been altered somehow. No key sound and the door just opened. No words, nothing, no one said anything. Me and my bother was left the room as if nothing had happened, as if it was something we been used to seeing. 

We were walking side by side and he stayed behind. I cold had touched my shoulder, i touched its had and i felt a cold metal around his finger. I never got to hear his voice, but i new that he told us to just go and he will come later after he closes the door. 
The night was cold and my heart didn't feel cold anymore, i just fell so much sadness, i no longer felt lonely, although i always kept wishing to have someone who would love me for who i am. 
We walked down to the new house, it was two story house, the biggest house in the whole town. It had big windows. As we saw walked down, we looked at the window a shadow rush upstairs, the night was quiet and we never heard doors being opened or close. I didn't fell scared, it was as if i knew who it was, and i knew nothing wrong or bad would happen to be or my little brother. 

Me and my brother were the only guys living in that house, and my aunt was staying there that night, it was her turn to sleep over. her sister and her used to take turns everyday to take care of me and my bother. There were no men living there. and there never was. I never gave it much thought. All the entrance doors in the house were locked, he had to climb our way up to the second floor to get in the house. When we went into the room where my aunt was, she was sound sleep and didn't wake up till the next day. 

After 5 years i finally met my mom, and finally met my dad. I told them what had happened that night. I told them about the ring, i told them about him.  At first they told me that it was probably my aunt trying to teach us a lesson, but she wasn't that tall, no one can be that cold, and no one in my family wore a ring.  later on i asked my mom again, and she finally told me that, i while ago my one of my uncles used to sleep there, when he was drunk. He was tall man, was married and never had any kids of his own. One day, i still remember hearing that they had found him death in his room. He had hanged him self living everyone of his family wondering why he had done it. No one knows till now. Without knowing me and my brother had called him, had woken him up from his sleep, and by taking our energy was able to take his human form and free us from that room. He said that he would come back, i had never stopped waiting. ",Cold Shadow,6,nosleep

So, a little over a year ago, I posted a couple of different things that happened to me back in 2005. There were a couple of things that happened between here and there, that I never got around to posting too. Anyway, here I am. Over a year later in the hopes that someone can help me, because something similar has recently happened.

So, while the other stories took place in NC, this all happened in MD. It happened about a week or two before Halloween. And all of this was very close together, and it all happened at my girlfriends house in Baltimore, Arbutus area for the locals. Her mom and younger brother have been living with her for almost a year now, until her mom can get back on her feet due to some unrelated, personal issues. I'm only bringing this particular thing up, in case someone may find it relevant. Her brother is 14. Mom, she's over 50, if not right at 50. Now...
After dinner one night, we were all sitting around the table talking. I excused myself to go shower. I have to get up at 4:30 in the morning, and generally just shower the night before work so I'm not in a groggy rush. So, I'm in the shower and they're, doing whatever it is they do as far as I know. I remember, and never will forget probably, the feeling of something tap me on the shoulder. It didn't necessarily feel like a finger. I pushed it out of my head almost immediately thinking I had brushed the wall or a towel or something. And that was it. That was all that happened in there. I got out, dried off and put on some clothes and left the bathroom. It was quiet in the house. No chatter, no tv and no video games. I just assumed everyone went to bed and headed upstairs to the attic bedroom my girlfriend sleeps in. It was dark, minus the flickery light that turned out to be a bunch of candles in the middle of the floor. My girlfriend, and her mother, playing with a Ouija board. They asked if I wanted to play, and I simply refused. Part of me wanted to leave because those things make me uncomfortable as it is. But I just layed down on the bed and tried to sleep. Mostly watching them. Mostly feeling uncomfortable whenever one of them giggled about it, or laughed and said it was stupid, which bothered me quite a bit. They were done when, after the second or third try, mom turned the disc, or whatever it's called, upside down and said she was done. They put it away and that was that. It dawned on me later that whatever I felt in the shower, would have happened about the time they started with their ouija seances...

So, a few nights later, I'm back at her house. I haven't heard of anything and honestly put the whole thing out of my head. That night, I woke up, at almost the exact same time she did. I looked at her, while she looked forward to the head of the bed, and immediately screamed. And not like a jumpy, something at the movies jumped out at me scream. Pure terror. I pulled her close and cradled her, and didn't see or notice anything. I turned on the light. Nothing was there. What she described to me was so horrifyingly familiar. She said, at the head of the bed, not 3 feet away, stood a figure. Not actually standing though. More like, bending over and reaching out for her. She told me two days later what actually woke her up was she heard something talking in the room, that said in a whisper ""what should we do with her?"" That's when she looked up and everything happen. I did make a mental note that it was after 3 o'clock. The only reason I noted it is because after calming her down, realizing I had less than an hour until I had to go to work. She got up and left when I left. The reason I say this one in particular is horrifyingly familiar, and wanted me to come to you with this in the hopes someone may be able to help me figure something out, is if you'll read the story at the top ""2005"", it's almost the same thing.

Now, I'm an atheist. I haven't prayed in years. And my girlfriend knows this. I'm not against it. I'll pray along to be respectful if the family is praying at dinner, or at a funeral. But one night, she woke me up shaking. Telling me that the room didn't feel right. And she was scared. She asked me to pray with her. Like, she wanted me to say a prayer for protection. I didn't know how to react, but this was extremely out of the ordinary for her. So I went with it. And after a minute of reaching into the back of my head for things to say, she started breathing slower. Calmer. She let me finish, then thanked me and said ""I think it worked"". She laid down and eventually, we both fell asleep.

The only things other than little squeaks and creaks, which could honestly just be the house being a house and making house noises, was when she was downstairs trying to sleep I guess. She didn't sleep in her room for a while unless I was there, and as I just recently moved to night shift, that's been a lot. Anyway, she said she heard her brother upstairs leaning in the chair, which he does while he plays on his laptop. So she sends him a text. A simple ""stop leaning"". Not a minute later, the text comes back and says ""I'm in bed"".
That's all I know or have heard for right now. I've spent fewer nights there since all that happened. Her mom burned sage in the room, or whatever the cleansing plant is (sage right?). Said some prayers. And I'm hoping that's it.",So this recently started happening again,1,nosleep

Hell back then I didn't even want to. I preferred to be solitary.  Back then was tough because I felt empty inside. Nothing I did seemed to fulfill me. I was my own abyss. 

This kid started to pick on me one day. Don't even know why, he just did. I never took the time to learn his name. He walked passed me in the courtyard during lunch and casually referred to me as a faggot to his friends. They snickered and kept walking.  I couldn't tell you why that made me so angry. Perhaps I...how would you say it...snapped. A small voice told me in the back of my head to extinguish him. It was minuscule at first, like a small piece of gravel in my shoe.

The next day it got louder.

And louder.

And louder.

The voice didn't bother me that much. I was intrigued by it. I wondered what would happen if I carried out its request. I acquired one of my mother's kitchen knives. A small one, as I didn't want to overdue it, and sharpened it a little. I then put on a black hoodie and began the hunt.

When I found my target, he was enjoying a smoke against a wall next to the school.  He was alone. I made careful strides towards him, listening to the voice inside my head grow louder with anticipation. I firmly gripped the knife handle, and as my target was walking to his car, plunged it into his side. I felt the blade slowly drive into the kid's soft flesh and his blood came oozing out onto my knuckles. He wheezed and gasped for air as blood filled his mouth. I stabbed him again, and he fell to the ground watching me watch him die. It took a couple of minutes but he finally stopped moving. I will admit that the rush of euphoria I received after the kill still makes the hair on my head stand up. For the first time, I had actually felt something. My legs quaked as I walked back home and cleaned of my mom's knife.  I grinned stupidly as I put it back on the rack. Ah, what a rush.

But then the feeling was gone,and I was back to my familiar emptiness.  There was only one solution to that. The voice agreed.

I'm not saying I believed it, but I didn't not believe in him either. I think I liked the idea of Santa Clause more than the fact that some guy came into my house in the middle of the night.  I grew up in a pretty cool family. They wanted my brother and I to stay 'innocent' as long as they could so they always told us they believed in all that stuff as well. Anyway, every Christmas Eve, we went outside and looked up into the sky to see if we could see Santa. We usually saw nothing, but this one Christmas was different. We had been outside for about ten minutes, seeing nothing but stars. We were getting ready to go inside when I noticed something. It seemed like nothing at first, but then I noticed it was moving. It looked like an illuminated line flying in a zig zag pattern through the night sky. At the time, I figured it was proof that Santa was real. But now that I'm older, I'm starting to wonder what the actual fuck that was. Do shooting stars move in a zig zag pattern? I'll never know.

I saw a man in a hood, I couldn't see his face but it looked liked he was focused on me. I went home and I saw my dog Oscar. He crawled up to me as usual but then I close my eyes and I see him with no fur, no skin and no visible pupils. He barked at me in such a monstrous way I screamed in pure panic and when I opened my eyes again he was normal again and he was confused by my scream.

I decided to go to sleep. I dreamed I was in a desert. The man in the hood was faraway from me but he was coming closer. As he was walking towards me I saw images that horrified me. I saw my family sitting on a bench smiling, but then the hooded man came from behind them and shot them all in the head.

I woke up. I was sweating and then I remembered the doctor said the pills would cause hallucinations so I tried not to think of it. I heard my High school reunion was tomorrow so I got ready.

I screamed: ""NO!"" Everything was normal again and they all stared at me. I left the school and I drove back home. I got a pistol from my bedroom in case the hooded man came back.

You might remember my journal entries from last month. Last month, I can't believe it's been that long. Days and weeks run now in an endless loop. Where I am now time doesn't matter. It's a nuisance, it's a hinderance. 

A lot has happened. I just wanted to let those who cared, who reached out to me, know that I am alive. Very much so. And I have met some friends. Real human beings. There is so much I want to tell you. So much I want to explain. But I can't. Not now. 

Just know that the monster under your bed is real. That shadow in the closet exists. And those voices, the voices you hear in the dead of the night are not your imagination. All your life you have been told horror stories. And now you seek them out, on this subreddit. To be entertained, to be thrilled. But these stories exist for a reason. Every story has a truth. A small bit of reality wrapped around trigger words and exaggeration. 

That truth is what lurks in the shadows of your house, just at the corner of your eye. The truth is what is waiting for you when you close your eyes to sleep, hoping for a peaceful night's rest. But nothing is peaceful in the dark. Where the light is eclipsed by the slithering, rotting presence that knows you oh so well. One day you'll know. You will wake up and know. All those stories. All those scary tales. All those fears.

Are real. 

It doesn't take much to become a monster. All you need is the dark to find it's way in. ",I am the monster,5,nosleep

This is for ME, I don’t do it for them. But they can’t understand my need. He can’t either. I must make me. Make him understand. How did he get here? I wish I came back. I want him back. WHY WON’T I COME BACK WHY IS HE HERE ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SOR-*

Past this the note is unreadable, spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people. Not that I’d really want to read much more anyways. I already know what happens. Well, not really “know”, but I can feel it. Who wrote it? I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson, if he’s even my uncle. What is this? No clue. A note, obviously, but beyond that speculation reigns. Where did I find this? My new house, in a drawer. Nothing is inherently terrifying about that – Oh, except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there. I just missed it before, I keep telling myself. I half believe it. A few pills later and I’m not worrying about it anymore.

Before this, I didn’t even know I had an Uncle Drewson, let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely, but now enacted, demise. With a heavily estranged family, growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility, one loses track of aunts and uncles. It was in a familiar neighborhood, a spacious three bedroom, so I was in no way eager to turn it down. As a poor, regularly unemployed person I’d been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldn’t afford anywhere else. I thought, it’ll all be worth it one day, the day I make it in the world. I can pay all these people back tenfold. “The day I make it”, yeah right. A consistent – and more pressingly, free – living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes. So I was moved in within a couple weeks. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life, I was content.

You know when you think back to something embarrassing, stupid, or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger, brasher days? Once you recall it, it starts eating away, regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts, till you would give the world to go back and change it, or at least erase the memory. Imagine that, only you can’t remember what it was you’ve done. It’s simply gone from you. The more you try, the less you realize. The less you realize, the more you regret. The more you regret, the more you try. That’s what’s happening to me, ever since I moved here. But it even goes past that. It’s the sudden feeling you’re being watched from barely out of sight. And at the same time, a crushing loneliness in that feeling. I pop a few more pills. Of course, I’m not being watched. There’s no one else here. If you think you’re being rather clever, figuring this out, oh-no-someone’s-been-in-the-house-with-you-all-along, I was most certainly the only one here. Anyway, this was about the time I found the note. If it was this Drewson, what is he talking about? Who does he want back? What is his need? Do I even want to know the answer to any of these? Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do, personal preference notwithstanding. Putting it all to the back of my mind, I chop up steak for dinner. I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef, particularly where matters of slicing and/or dicing are concerned. I once worked a sushi bar, as a side job to pay the bills, and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe, like you see in commercials. Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customer’s eyeball. Maybe I’m not quite as proficient as I thought… I grab the bottle of pills and take a few. I don’t really like thinking about that time in my life.

I’m digging through my drawer later, that same drawer, when I stumble upon another discovery. Instead of a clue, it only deepens my mystery. A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board. I carefully remove it, and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find, my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses. I think, this will perhaps answer some questions about the note, and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusion’s implications. As per your previous assumptions, I couldn’t be farther from the truth. I secure the stick in its dock. View files. Two folders: “Reminders” and “Media”. Reminders is empty, media contains one subfolder: “Vids”. I open the folder. Two more: “memories” and “triggers”. Memories is empty. I open triggers. I’m confronted with one video file: shotinthedark.wmv. It’s 0:40 long. I press play.

Before I continue, if you’ll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this. I’m a massive horror movie fan, and I like them brutal. The more blood and guts, the better. I like truly graphic, heart wrenching stuff, and I very rarely squirm at it. Three seconds into shotinthedark.wmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out. The scene I’m immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs. There is a single light source on the chair, but I can faintly make out a figure in the background. Then, without a word, the man’s brains are ejected out his face, accompanied with a thunderous bang. Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground. Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt, accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life, likely flooded by fear, but life. I don’t have too much time to process anymore; I’m preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket. I think, it must be fake, but I know it’s not. I’ve got to tell someone about this, I think, the police, someone. Yeah, I’ll talk to the cops. Then, over my subsiding retching, I hear a familiar voice utter “Are you sorry now?” in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler. Something in that voice is chilling. Something… I return my gaze to the computer screen, where the barely visible figure now stands in full view, smiling.

I recognize the smile too.

It’s me, smiling back at myself, gripping a smoking sawed off.

The computer screen goes black. My head spins. I lie down.

youngsterjose42,1,,4,1rge20,,2,"He woke up in the morning like every other day. Yet this day was different; Jordan was going back to school after being expelled last year. He was caught with drugs and his school wanted nothing to do with it. He moved, now resides in york, Pennsylvania and now goes to William Penn High. He moved to a house which was quite old and just had some renovations a while back. The rent was quite cheap so his mother said ""why not?"". I was one of Jordan's first friends, since moving to york he told me things about that house really strange things. He soon moved away a little after I moved away so I have no idea where he is now. If any of you happen to live in york I'm talking about the old burned down house on market street across the street from the kindergarten/daycare. This story takes place about 2 years before the house burned down. 

A month since school started and about two weeks since I started talking to Jordan he invited me over to his house. Jordan said ""cmon dude come and stay the night my moms gone and im pretty sure wont give a shit"". So I thought why not I haven't spent the night at a friends house in a while ""yea sure ill spend the night man"". We went around town skated for a while, went to McDonald's with a few other friends then it came around 10 or maybe 11 everyone was ready to go home and i was ready to just go to a place and chill, play video games, and maybe eat some more. We got to his place, sat down in the living room, and lit up a blunt. Playing grand auto 3, high off our asses, we ordered some pizza. We ate and everything was fine till I felt like heading over to the bathroom. As soon as I opened the door I notice under the sink there was like a small cabinet and the doors slammed shut. I was high so I didn't really questioned it much. I used the bathroom and then as I exit I suddenly hear a giggle coming from under the sink. A child's giggle, as if there was a kid under the sink playing hide'n'seek or something. Again I did not question it because I was high and didn't really wanna bother finding out what made the noise. Jordan passed out on the couch, I went to his room and tried to sleep on his bed. I remember waking up around four in the morning hearing footsteps and a child giggling I'm pretty sure it was a little boy. I couldn't really tell his age but he was young; I would guess around six or seven. He was running around the house and he stopped at the door I did not see him, I only ever got to see his outline. He said "" I'm really happy I got more friends to play with now"". Suddenly after that he vanished faster than I could blink. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I had goosebumps for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually I  calmed myself down by eating pizza and watching TV.",Hide 'N' seek,6,nosleep
InsaneFang,2,,2,1rdykh,,0,"It was a very dark night, I opened my eyes in the dark, and I watched the shadows stretch over my room. The trees moved in the night air, and made the shadows in my room move, and form together, and look like monsters. I watched the shadows, which actually do not help to watch, for they only offer uneasiness to the human soul, and you find no comfort. If I hadn't watched those shadows I wouldn't have noticed the slight movement that didn't go exactly with the shadows. It was dark, and I felt I was probably seeing something. But I thought I saw a dark shape in those shadows. It moved like the shadows, but it moved slower, and I thought I heard the soft scrape of a boot. I watched the shadows ever moving. I felt fear grip my heart. I felt there was something there, just watching me silently in those darkest shadows. I wanted to hop out of the bed, and rush out the door, but I feared that if my feet touched the floor, then that thing, or something else would surely get me. I heard a sound from behind me, and being in the frightened state I was in, I about fell out of the bed. Clinging to the side of the bed, tangled in the blankets and sheets, I felt like I was about to die. I looked up for the source of the sound and it was just a tree branch scratching the window. I felt relieved at this, and I kind of relaxed, forgetting about the thing in the shadows. I pulled myself back into my bed, turned and saw a darkened shape at the end of my bed. I felt the fear shoot through me again. I felt no thoughts, nothing, only the cold dark fear. I watched as the shape moved ever closer to my bed. I felt paralyzed, as if I couldn't move, speak, or let alone do anything. The shape moved ever closer. I felt a sound coming from the back of my throat, but it never escaped my lips. My mouth did not open, nor did the sound fully come out. The shape soon climbed slowly onto the bed, and moved closer to the lumps under the blankets, my legs. I felt myself start to tremble, but I still felt like I was super glued to my bed. I wanted to close my eyes, maybe it was a dream. It kept climbing up my bed, and I felt something off of it lightly slid against my leg. I felt myself tremble and shake even more. Soon the face was just inches from mine. I felt its hot breath on me, and the smell that emitted from its mouth wasn't that great either. I wanted to turn away, maybe get some fresh air, but I felt still frozen. It took one of its hands and pointed a finger at me. Though I could not see very well, it looked like instead of nails, it had sharp claws. It took the claw and lightly probed my face. The pain of the claw protruding my skin was unimaginable. It didn't feel like a cut from a knife or such. It felt like someone was burning my face. It took the claw and ran it down my whole face, and the fiery feeling intensified. Then I woke up, trembling, and drenched in cold sweat. I was thankful that it was a dream. But something about that dream made me still sit there terrified for my life. I looked out the window, at the cold moon shining its equally cold glow into my room, making shadows. Those shadows made me dwell more on my dream, and I closed my eyes, but all I could see in my mind was the dark shape crawling up my bed...and then the unimaginable agony that came from that claw cutting a gash into my face. I suddenly had the need to feel my face. I reached up slowly, my hand slightly trembling, fearing that it wasn't a dream. My hand finally connected with my face, and from instincts, I flinched, but there was nothing there, but cold sweat stained smooth skin. I shuddered a sigh of relief. I knew there was no getting back to sleep, so I decided I might as well go downstairs, and at least drink some tea or coffee, maybe even milk. Maybe it'd calm me down. I slid out of the bed, and headed slowly down the stairs. The silence was a little unnerving as I walked down the creaky steps. The dream still haunted my mind. I tried to shake the feeling that it gave me away, but it just wouldn't fade from mind. I finally reached the kitchen, and turned on the light. I opened up the refrigerator, and pulled out the jug of milk. I poured some into a glass, and slid it into the microwave, and heated it up. Once done, I pulled the warm glass out, and I headed into the living room, and turned on the TV to try to forget the dream. The TV's light washed over the room, and I watched as people spoke about things not at all important in this world. I took a drink of my milk, and watched the people on the screen. I soon felt myself falling asleep. I woke up, the TV was off. I didn't remember turning it off. It was still dark out, I looked at the clock, it read 1:46 AM. I swore it had to be later than that. I pulled myself from my bed, and I headed up the stairs to my room once more. I laid there in my bed for what seemed like hours. I rose up and looked at the clock, it said 1:46 AM. I blinked, was the clock broken? I walked over, and unplugged it, but it did not turn off. It remained shining lightly in the dark, reading 1:46 AM. I backed into my bed, and fell on top of it. I heard something from the window. I looked over and saw a face. The features were inhuman, I felt the fear paralyze me. I couldn't look past the face staring at me. Where its eyes should be, were empty looming dark sockets, the nose, a pig snout, and the teeth like a saber tooth tiger, and it had black curly messy hair on its head. It reached a hand up to open the window, and I saw the unmistakable clawed fingers. My nightmare had come to life. I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound emerged. The window opened slowly, and the creature quietly hit the floor. It moved slowly towards me. I heard its heavy breathing as it drew nearer, and nearer still. I closed my eyes, hoping it'd go away, but fate would not help me there. I felt a weight on my bed, and my eyes shot open. I looked into those looming sockets, and then my mouth opened and I screamed. The scream was not heard though. It was as if the world was dead. The creature took its claw up, and slowly sliced my skin, carefully, and only in certain places, as if it was a planned process...for some reason. It finally crawled off me, and left the room, and closed the window softly. I laid there in the bed bleeding slowly, the pain ebbing out of my body, feeling like hot hell fire. That's when I noticed my clock was off now. I laid there, relieved that it was gone...but those eyes...those dark looming eyes, would burn my mind forever.",Dark Looming Eyes,2,nosleep

I was working as a data entry clerk at the local newspaper.  My hours were 9-6, but I would stay after 6 in order to complete my duties.  I would also come in one Saturday a month to complete my month end duties.  Often I was left by myself in my department.  Nothing strange, but I would always feel like I was being watched.  Could never shake that feeling.  I never felt that i was in danger, and if I focused on the feeling long enough I would freak out a bit.

I finally came clean to some co-workers about that feeling.  Of course they mocked me, and asked the types of drugs I was using.  Nothing major, I knew they were having fun and just continued my duties.  Later that same day, my co-worker Toon who was mocking me the most came to my desk.  Mind you we had open cubicles, two desks on one side, 4 desks in the middle, and three desks on the other side.  I was part of the 4 desk area.  She asked me to describe what was watching me.  I explained to her it was a feeling and I never saw anything. 

6 o'clock came around and everybody was gone.  I was waiting for my 700+ page end of week report to finish printing so I could drop them off on the desks of all the department heads.  I was waiting at the 2 desk cubicle where the department printer was located.  This was G's desk.  She had a whole bunch of pictures on her wall and I was just looking at each picture.  Again, that feeling of being watched came over me, but stronger than before.  I turned to my head and saw it....rather her.  5 feet away from me, there was a head floating in the air.  She was some sort of gray color.  I was able to take in her features.  Medium straight hair, round face, the hair kind of hugged her face.  She popped, like a bubble pops in the air.  I was so anxious to get out of there so I could go home and get ready for my date with my girlfriend.  I grabbed the report, distributed them, and I was out.  On the 25-30 minute drive home, I was reflecting on the day and playing it over in my head.  Half way home I realized I came face to face with a ghost.

Basically, this is a very scary apartment. Shortly after I saw the girl, things got quiet. I stopped watching TV alone in the house and started going to church more. When my mom, who didn't have a job, would leave the house, I would often tag along or go in my room where my sister and I both slept. she was 5 so she doesn't have any recollection of anything.

One day, it was a rainy day and my sister's friend had a birthday party. I was invited for some reason. It was a rainy, gloomy day but the festivals were making everyone happy so I guess I was happy as well. The party was very expensive as they were sorta rich and there were tons of events and foods and things to do. But enough of that story.
After we left the party, my parents decided to go to church. Naturally, as a energetic 9 year old, I was reluctant to leave so I told my parents to drop me off at home with my sister. The house was dark and it was raining so I was a little scared. but, once my mother had tucked me into bed, I fell asleep and I thought that was the end of that.
I believe I slept until night time because I heard the front door closing. I thought it was my parents so I yelled to mom, telling her I was hungry. But there was no reply. Instantly, I was awake and my pulse was pounding. I was suddenly paralysed (with fear? I don't know) and I could only watch as I heard footsteps come up the stairs. My sister, I could hear her breathing underneath me (we had a bunkbed) but she didn't seem hear a thing.
             
Then a creak, and moan as my bedroom door opened. I watched as a shadow grew between my feet and hovered over me. I believe I passed out with fear or something cause the next thing I knew, I was waking up and it was later at night and my parents really came home.

A couple days later, my sister came home with a drawing. i asked her what it was as I shivered in fear. She told me that she had seen the thing I saw, except it spoke to her while I was sleeping that day. It told her that it was related to her, that it knew mom. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I never told mom, who was still having nightmares about her miscarriage. But could it be the sister I never had?

The happenings that have lead up to Tuesday night. I don't remember everything that happened to leading up to it. I tried to go to sleep early because I moved out of my house last month and I had been getting terrible sleep because I am forced to sleep on an air mattress. I am also staying at a friends house till I am able to move into my next house. I went to sleep around seven at night and them woke up at eleven that same night. I couldn't get back to sleep no matter how much I tried so I decided to start watching tv. After a while I got really thirsty so I went down stairs to get a drink of water. After I finished the water my stomach started to feel up so I went into the bathroom. I finished up in there and as I was leaving I started to get a feeling like a was being watched. I can even remember having the same feeling in the bathroom but I ignored it and just tooled around on my phone. Nevertheless I hurried up stairs and it felt as though I was being followed. I decided to ignore it and just lay down with my eyes closed and calm down. I did this for the next roughly thirty minutes and drifted off to sleep. With in minutes of me sleeping I again had the feeling of being pinned down and could not move. It had been months since the last time this happened but it almost felt as though it was going to happen. I cannot better explain the part other than I just new it was going to was coming. So after that I was a little freaked out but it had happened so many times in my past that I would get more annoyed than anything else. I then had a hard time falling asleep again. It took me hours to fall back asleep but nothing happened after I woke up I just would stay there in the bed annoyed that I could not fall back asleep. I am not sure if this is being triggered by the stress of me moving or what is happening. Alls I know is that I want it to stop.

 I frown. ""Your grandmas been dead for years."" I say, chilled. 

I wake up again with my husband hitting the bed. ""I just got in bed."" He said. That was odd. Why would he say that? I heard the footsteps again. I gasp, then scream and push away.

 But I can't scream. Not properly. It will barely come out. I hit my head and I wake up, with another gasp. My husband gives me a weird look.

 ""What's wrong?"" He asked. I told him about the dream and he reassured me. He went back to sleep and as I started to, I heard them again. Those damn footsteps! But, this isn't a dream, right?

I was home alone as I always am after my school day but today I saw and heard more things than usual but I thought nothing of it. I climbed the stairs and entered the bathroom and after certain events happened that I am not going to describe because I am not gross, I got up then washed my hands and went to the door which is when I heard a BANG! right on the door so I did what all manly people do..... locked the door and hid in the bathtub. Soon I began hearing foot steps but not just any footsteps but boots like combat boots on a hard wood floor. After about 5 minutes of marching I heard whistling of a man and the faint singing of a woman. This went on for about half an hour. After I got the courage to open the door I looked in the hallway and SAW............ no one...there wasn't anybody there I checked over the house twice and nothing!

We were watching Toy Story 3 in my downstairs, and we have 2 pillars downstairs to support our house and the framing on a the one behind the couch is loose, so sometimes it snags on clothes and makes a loud noise when it hits the pillar. So, we were close to the end of the movie, and we heard the loose framing hit it like someone pulled it away from the pillar. We all automatically stopped and looked at each other for about a minute, then we got up and ran to my room. We had to go past the pillar to get to my room so it snagged on my blanket and made the snapping noise again, which made everyone go faster. The rest of the night, we all kept hearing footsteps walking around like they were looking for something. It hasn't happened again since that night.",Just a normal night,3,nosleep
Hors2018,2,,14,1rbmky,,0,"John held me close as I cried. Again, it had happened again. I broke and my family had ridiculed me for it telling me to go hide in a cave and die. I was weak, that was what was hurting the most. I failed.

""It's okay,"" John whispered in my hair and I continued to sob, my entire body violently shaking with the force of them.

""No it's not,"" I whispered, ""I can't be like this anymore, I don't ever want to do this again!"" John pulled back and searched my face. His black eyes probing. He slowly nodded.

""I want to show you something,"" He said. I looked up at him quizzically, my face showing my confusion. I trusted him though so I slowly stood up from the log I was perched on. He took my hand and led me to the picnic table that was in our woods, my family rarely ever used it for anything, it just sat there for throwing sticks on. But now there was definitely something on it.

""John?"" I whispered. He glanced back at me.

""Trust me, this will make it easier for you to control your emotions,"" I nodded and stepped up closer behind him. Navanod was standing over by it and glanced up as we got close. I peered around John and saw what was there. A man, tied down, I glanced at Navanod who silently stared back before I looked again at the man.

He was bleeding already, a small trickle that formed tiny puddles beneath him. A small smile crept onto my features and Navanod turned his attention to John, ""She's ready,"" Was all he said. John nodded and pulled the knife he always had in his belt out.

Going over to the man he barely pierced the skin before glancing at me. I had moved in closer, fascinated by what was happening, the man on the table fought against the straps screaming. I glanced at the house to see if anyone heard before looking back at John. He stopped making small cuts and finally pushed the knife deep into the man's skin. The man screamed and I was suddenly all the way at the table, perched on the edge, staring wide eyed at the thick stream of blood spurting out and pooling beneath the man and the table. The thick red liquid sinking into the leafy ground.

""Can I?"" I whispered. John looked over at Navanod before flipping the knife in his hand and giving it to me. I looked at it then at the man, ""How do I skin him?"" I barely saw the smirk on John's face because I was so focused on the blood, it was shooting a satisfying feeling through me that I had never felt before.

John came up behind me and held his hand over mine, ""Like this,"" His hand guided mine.

My head jerked up when I was finishing to someone screaming my name. A piece of me crumbled as I slowly gave the knife back to John, ""We can do another tomorrow,"" He said. I perked up at that. I was covered in the man's blood and I smiled at that. John stood and took me inside.

""Where have you been?"" My mom demanded.

""Just out in the woods,"" I whispered.

""Stop that mumbling,"" My mom ordered, John rolled his eyes next to me and I suppressed a smile, ""You know how much I hate you playing out there alone!"" I glanced over at John whose grin had now grown.

""Tomorrow,"" He whispered before disappearing into my room laughing.





Edit: So, I probably should say that John and Navanod were 2 of the 8 demons following me around when I was younger. No one but me could see them which led to some interesting situations if they decided to remain in the room when something was going on.

samisboris20,0,,3,1r97n2,,0,"When I was a little kid I was exposed to the world of sheer adrenaline. I loved roller coasters, theme parks, and loud action movies. I was 8 years young when I first started to see these mysterious ""black figures."" Specifically one dark, autumn night I had miraculously awoken from my small 8 year old body to find a beautiful silent room. After looking around for 10 seconds something had walked into the door frame of my room. I remember it perfectly to this day. It stood 6 feet tall and looked like an average sized human, except was not covered in skin. This figure was pitch black, the darkest color black I had ever seen. It was wearing a blissful white robe. The robe immediately stood out to me because its polar opposite color compared to the figures skin. This picture still haunts me to this day. There is never a moment where I cant stop thinking about this. After I had realized that this thing was stuck staring at me in my door frame, we both made extreme, extensive eye contact. Even though I could not physically see his eyes, as more time went by I could feel a weird feeling growing inside of my body. After I could not bare the feeling anymore, I asked it ""what are you doing here,"" ""what do you want from me."" I got no response from this being but a slight head turn. This scared me even more. When I got no responce back to any of my questions, we made this scary eye contact once more. The second eye contact was much longer than the first one, but after a while it simply just walked out of my door frame. That was the first and last time I had ever seen this thing. I told my mom the next day, and she told me it was something that ""god"" sent down to earth, but I have always doubted it, especially now... 9 years later. When I went to boarding school for my freshman year, I went to a supposed haunted boarding school located up in santa barbra. I've heard the ghost story thousands of times, and decided to go ghost hunting around the campus, but was unsuccessful. Later on that week, my things started to disappear and I would awake with scrathes and bruises on my arms and upper body. In the middle of the night when I would get water in the hallways, I would feel the same eerie feeling I did when I was 8 and would also see dark figures from the corner of my eye. The same darkness the being had when I was 8. The next week these same experiences started to happen in my personal dorm room, except this time it felt more malicious. The first time I saw something, a scary looking black figure, was when it walked towards my room mates side. I thought I was just dreaming, but the next night my closet door slid open and I saw the most terrifying thing ever. A gargantuan black horned figure slammed open my closet door and rushed strait towards me with its arms pointed strait at me. Before it was about to grab me it disappeared and the lights came right on, thanks to my room mate. AFter this happened I returned back home to LA. Luckily everything had calmed down. How ever now I am 17, I still see these black figures in the corners of my eyes. I need to know what is this?! IS it an evil spirit, are they angels, are the lost ghosts? I've been doing research and said possibly it could be shadow people? I just need to know what your opinion, so I know I am not slowly maddening. PLEASE IS THERE ANY ONE OUT THERE THAT CAN HELP.

I am grateful that I am born alive as a man but why does they have to be my parents?

They said that, before you enter the physical world, you are a mere soul waiting turns to bond with little human figure inside a pregnant woman once God granted your passage. That's when the heart starts to beat and so does your responsibility in life, shaping the right future. Well, I don't mind that.
The only thing ticks me that, why can't I choose who my parents are? Why wasn't there a catalog of possible parents set before me right at the moment when I am going to bond with the physical world? Why? Why do I have to end up with them?

All I get was a social party mother who always half state of awareness back late at night and when in morning I rarely get to have breakfast from her. The only food on the table was microwaveable TV dinner or a call for delivery from any nearby restaurant. Chinese? I always have that for brunch. During holidays, we celebrate at my Aunt house or dine at any restaurant available. I barely even remember when was the last time my mom using the stove. Such a lovely mother.

And yet my so-called father tend to ignore me always. The only time we are together alone was when my 9th grade PTA meeting. That was when mom had her ladies night off, so she called. My father and I are rarely together because he always disappoints with my grade, his eyes blinds with my greatest-proud big brother in big business world who always provide him this material world of joy and such. I bet he is too overjoy to even remember that I exist. My big brother always said that I may think too much. Maybe I did.

In any case, why did I not act now? Why do I imagine I sit down properly on the road watching fire burn glazing right in front of me? My mind is shrouded with thought on my mother and father good points. We are on our way celebrate Thanksgiving at Aunt Maria's house.

what i realized the gold and the creature with the eyes of blue are both like guard dogs and their masters are in control of them blue acted out of instinct. it has no final destination like visions where i see realities different from our own(theroy from first post in series). 

 changes since last post -moving didn't help much just bought me more time. i also purchased some throwing knives since my last update not due to the creatures just because i was losing my sense of home and slight sense of security from moving from the house i grew up in.

warning: i may ramble a bit with exlpaimations due to me having high funtioning autism and it causes me to have longer explainations than most people. i also have slightly bad social skills  due to it. also sorry about spelling and grammar i am on a mobile phone and it is half an hour until midnight for me i wasn't feeling well today so i am a bit tired and half of this was typed 4 days ago i just fell asleep before typing certain parts out that only i would have understood and i fixed and  made readable sense of itso you are lucky for now that i formatted what i did i will do a spelling and grammar edit tomorrow.

The thing that marked the change was the blue creature appeared just after i shut my eye lids and they felt stuck shut. I didn't bother trting to open them i knew it was no use and that the blue one was safe but not the gold one. So i kept trying to switch into a dream but none would take the creature started to make a half choking half growling sound over and over like it was choking on a word before it choked out the word protect then left.

i normally can start my dreams off then fall asleep into them but i haven't been able to gaurd my mind. i can normally just pick a theme eg. horror story abandon building and spy  every so often i will get an odd dream that my mind can't draw on my most recent dream because the normal ones seem to make a storyline like last spring a t-rex and i were talking and it was wearing a monacle and top hat while drinking champane in a ruined section of a city  and then from down the road walnuts got fired at me i ran forward and cracked them with my bare hands until they stopped. this time though it was they hacked in to a dream i had recently.

the recent dream i had fallen asleep while emotions i had were swirling so it randomized and it was that people on my list of people i trust that was pulled from my memories.
I would be getting ready for a formal dance at the school i went to before my dad moved yet in the dream i had moved to the  town the high school i went to is in. i could see the school in the dream from the house i was in and it was a bright neon green house with a picket fence and elegant hand carved wooden gate there are no houses like that near the school though and a cop knocks on the door of the house and my mom answers it and the cop asks for me and mom says i am getting ready to go to a school dance. the cop explains why he is there is to get me to come with him to talk out a hostage situation because the person with the hostage asked to see me. 
So i slip a throwing knife of the new set mentioned above into each pant leg pocket. then say that he can enter my room. i then ask if i can bring either a throwing knife or a wooden stake for defence should i be used as hostage depends what person from my trust list it is being held hostage already in the dream.

(I have trust lists because my lack of social skills makes it hard to make friends so i classify them as aquaintences with varying levels of my trust whether i am friends with  them or not is there call but in the dream after the dream completes it restarts and gets the next person on the lists.)

I get the ok from the cop who says hopefully it won't get to that. fast foreward dream the person with the hostage has the most defendable place in the school and the only possibilities for escape is the window behind  him or at least the body shape looks male. i will refer to him as chompers due to him having pure gold and silver teeth alternating so it goes silver-gold-silver-gold-etc. i first percieved chompers as a being to represent stress then i would be called to go stand near by, chompers holds a glock 26 pistol a common pistol in military games eg socom in each hand (right hand against hostage's head and the left one points at me) then i offer a hostage swap and hand the other hostage the defence weapon i had up my sleeve. then i stand so my back faces chompers while he demands certain politcians be eliminated and vast sums of money as if i was a powerful bargining chip the cops can't complete his ransom with the assination call. so he threatens me saying any last wishes i say i wish to hear a song from my phone and ask if i am allowed to reach in my pocket to get it. chompers says yeah so i grab a throwing knife and stab back wards near intestines with the left throwing knife and jab his thigh at the same time as i dropped and ducked the cops took thier chance to shoot him.
Each time he would normally fall and i would see the bloody muscles of his face when his head hit the floor the only difference now is his eyes have been like snake eyes bright red with gold pupils instead of just turning to empty sockets.

Could it be stress but what if it is two entities battling in my mind one being instinct and one being stress because the walks i would take around the block were to eliminate or at least vent off stress and the slight paranoia during the encounters let them cross into reality and be anchors for their masters if so could it be only my own brain is the only one with a frequency and pattern they can survive",weird walk around the block and weird dream weird cat thing common factor in both (update 2),2,nosleep

Now on her phone you have to create an alarm, then  save it, then turn it on. When she went to the alarms app, there was no alarm created for 3:07. Cousin #1 did not sleep the rest of the night.

I research biological warfare. December 20th: I have thought of an idea to make a strain of influenza that instead of killing the body it will actually improve it to make a stronger German fleet.


December 21st: I have heard of a substance that can make the body stronger and more in rage but it is all the way in South America I will have to call a superior officer to request for it. December 22nd: I am so eager to start maybe the Fuhrer will recognize my genius and I will be known across Germany. January 6th: I have now just got the substance but strangely the officer who delivered it to my quarters told me when he got it a man from the village begged him not to use it that it was horrible. January 9th: I have finish mixing the strains all I need now is a test subject. January 10th: A officer presented me with a American spy who was held captive in a concentration camp. He handed me him and helped me sedate him. Before he walked out the door he told me: ""Make mighty Germany proud.""




 January 11th: I have strapped the subject on a operating table, I have filled a syringe with the substance and injected it in his right arm. January 12th: The subject is not moving as if he is deceased. Maybe he is in a coma but when I touch him he makes no reflexes or reactions.
January 13th: I woke up in the middle of the night in horror as I heard a great scream. It was the subject struggling to get off the table. A officer came to my quarters hearing the noise. I told him what had happened. I tried to sedate the subject with a sedative drug and injecting it into his arm but it didn't work. The officer hit the subject on the head with a baton and even that did not work so we moved him into the closet and locked it. I bribed him not to tell anyone. January 14th: I saw through the window of the door the subjects eyes were getting darker and his skin paler. January 15th: The subject keeps making these horrifying screams that is eating away at me. January 16th: I heard the strap of the table finally snap and I quickly covered the door with a shelf.



January 17th: I have had it, I grabbed a revolver to kill the subject, I opened the door and when I did he lashed out at me and scratched me on the arm. I dropped the gun and the subject got on top of me. I noticed one of my surgical tools and I stabbed him in the eye killing him. I didn't think of getting medical help after all it was just a scratch.

chanvargas,5,,7,1ra33y,,0,"we've been experiencing weird stuffs from this house ever since it was built and renovated. we heard voices, footsteps, some noise upstairs when we were all downstairs and vice versa. these creepy things always happen at 3:00 am onwards (not till 4am). yeah, i'm still trying to convince myself that all were just coincidences that they occur at 3 in the morning.. lucid dreams, nightmares and other stuff will wake you up at that time. and i was thinking that there would be any scientific explanations about those. anyway, the creepiest experience i had was just this year. i can't recall what day or month it happened. but this is how happened. 

it was a long day at work, i came home at 2am in the morning since i was in a late mid shift of a 24/7 starbucks branch here in our country.. i ate dinner alone (i got used to 3am weird shits so its not a surprise for me if something creepy happen again.) then gone upstairs to check on my emails, and read some blogs on some site. it took me a while and later that night i felt sleepy so i got ready for bed. as i enter my room, i went directly to the closet to change clothes. surprisingly i saw my 4 year old sister standing there. she even tried to hide at the dark corner of the closet, staring at me. i asked her, ""hey, why are you still awake? is there something wrong?"" 
she didn't answer.|
i backed off and felt confused. there were no creepy feelings that moment actually.. the time i came back to her, she said ""i'm going too sleep.""

she then walked to my parents room, after she left the room, i decided to follow her, i found her hiding again on an old TV rack that has been there since. i looked at her and she was staring at me with her face not showing any emotion, she told me the same thing again ""i'm going to sleep.""

she entered the room and closed the door. i went back to my room and lied on my bed. i'm still on the state of asking questions of WHAT THE FUCK WAS SHE DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ON THE CORNER OF MY CLOSET. then it came to my senses, the first time i had this lucid dream or nightmare (whatever you call that.) was at the same room where i was lying that time. the dream was an upside down star painted on the wall with a sentence written at the center of the star ""see the center of the face"" i stared at it in my dream then old faces of some people including those that i think i've seen in some history book and some old dollar bill. as the faces change, i suddenly woke up and realized that my body was numb. only my vision was active that time, and i have this feeling that someone is staring at me. it was a strong force. a strong force that gave me such fear. and that force came from the window that is where the closet was put to cover it. the same corner where i found my sister standing..

(back to my sisters incident) 
i thought it was over.. i was lying in bed at that very time when i felt someone staring at me from behind (i'm having goosebumps just by typing this story right now) it was her. again. she then ran back to my parents room after noticing that i saw her. that was the time that i felt fear. i can feel evil existence. but! i was too sleepy that time so i didn't spend much time thinking about it or being curious about it..

the morning came and i told my mom about the incident. she was shocked.. she told me that my sister didn't leave her side all night long. nah.. maybe she was just in a deep sleep so she didn't notice.",little sister incident.,4,nosleep
Mindlesssavage,4,,8,1rhawv,,0,"I have a Where's Wally book. Well, had. Why? I'll tell you.
So I was just searching for Wally at night like I usually do, and I heard a noise.
It was sort of a scratching noise, scratching with a walking cane maybe.
I went to investigate. I went out of my room and...
Nothing.
Maybe it was just me. I went back to my bedroom door. I saw something written on really drippy red paint.
It said ""Find me if you can"". I thought it was just my little brother Mike painting on the walls again. ""Where was Mike anyway?"", I thought. Then I remembered he was outside playing with our pet dog Molly. ( Don't ask me why he was playing in the dark, because I have no idea).
I went inside my room. That's when I saw it. The book was lying on the ground open. I picked it up. This is what the title said:
""yllaW s'erehW"" Now THIS was weird. I also saw the same Wally picture except his eyes were gone and blood was dripping from them.
It was possessed, I thought. I ran outside to bury it, and I stepped on something. It sounded like it was glass because I heard it shatter.
I looked down.
A pair of broken, black rimmed glasses. I ignored it and ran even faster than before.
I ran to my dog Molly's kennel. I always feel safe when she's with me.
She was whining in the corner. That was typical, though. But wasn't she playing with Mike? I shouted out, ""Mike! Mike! Can you hear me?""
No replies.
I ran to the middle of the yard to bury the book.
I stepped in another thing. It was squishy, and slimy.
I looked down.
Blood. Blood and guts.
And Mike.
Lying on the ground.
Stomach open.
With a walking cane through his heart.
I wanted to cry, but then I saw a little Post-It note on the cane.
A poem.
This is what it said:
""I can run, and I can hide.
Tear you apart from the inside.
Waiting in the darkness, with my cane.
Used to be for children, now insane.
Red and white, in the grey fog.
Running around with my little pet dog.
With my girlfriend Wenda, with her camera,
And an old man with a white beard.
The prisoner who escaped from jail, murdering people with no fail.
That's my gang, with no doubt.
When you're in with me, there's no way out.""
This was way too bad to just BURY. We had to set it on FIRE. Or RIP IT APART. Just destroy it in whatever way I could.
So now in my backyard, a grave for Mike, some burnt and ripped pages, shattered glasses, and a walking cane.
And to this day, I never read another Where's Wally book again.
And every night, I still hear the sound of a scratching walking cane against my bedroom door.
THE END.

i live in a rural town in the northern virginia area. As the winter comes near, the days grow shorter, the sun sets faster. One day, as i was walking home from work through a deep forest since i live in a small apartment complex, i felt little taps on my bag. But as i turned around there appeared to be nothing there, but me. I approached my complex, and climbed the stairs. The complex is compiled of many residents, and i live on the 6th floor. i swung my backpack off my shoulder and dug for my keys. I heard a scutter behind me and my heart dropped. I turned around but nothing there. I fumbled with my keys until i entered my old, cigarette fume filled home. My puppy delia ran up to my feet as i set down my bag. I noticed something odd about my apartment. There was an odd rustic smell, but i guessed it was from the open window. Did i leave the window open? I went to my room, changed, and layed on the couch, with the buzzing sound of the tv helping me doze off. I fell asleep on the couch with delia licking my limp hand. An hour passed, and i felt another lick on my palm. i smiled in my sleep and dozed off once more. Then a minute later, i felt another lick. maybe delia was hungry. I opened my eyes and delia wasnt there. Delia? i went to the kitchen to see if she ran to her bowl. but no sign of her. and then there it was. drip drip drip drip drip. what was that sound? i followed the dripping to the slightly ajar bathroom.

horriddaydream,90,,175,1r338n,,669,"My mother left when I was four.
Normally, that wouldn't mean anything, but I suspected for a long time that the porcelain dolls were coming from her, like some pitiful little attempt to show me that she loved me. 

My father; he worked overtime to keep things going in the household even if it was just the two of us. His hands were always worn from working the machines at the shop and he slaved even more when he got home and had to make supper for himself and I, and go through my nightly routines before I hit the sack. I sometimes woke up in the middle of the night and he was still awake, cleaning a room in the house, and I thought to myself, ""This man is dedicated. Has to be awake in only a few hours…and here he is."" I love my father, and I always have.

One of his most trusted friends from high school, Alexander, was my babysitter from the time my mother left, to the time I was about seven years old. We trusted Alexander. He worked night shift and so he was able to work babysitting in around his hours, and he would have done anything to help out my father to make that work. My father paid him even though he asked for nothing; he said he was just 'doing his good deed', ""and I like it anyway!"" My dad used to come home from work and Alexander would pick up his bags full of toys that we played with; he always brought the best toys and trinkets with him. His daughter had passed away when she was ten years old, and I think it brought him great joy to now share her old toys with another little girl. He would say to my dad, ""She was great for me. She ate well, and she took her usual long nap. I'll be back tomorrow!"" And he always came back. 

Well, eventually times changed and my dad's work schedule changed with them. We didn't see Alexander anymore because we didn't NEED Alexander anymore. My father thought that they lost touch permanently and when I asked about him he told me truthfully that Alexander was a very busy man. And he understood that, and I did too. 

For my eighth birthday, the first porcelain doll arrived. It had beautiful, blonde curly hair and a painted on face. She was wearing what looked to be an expensive, velvet dress with an attached tutu. She came inside a stuffed envelope with nothing else on the package to identify who had sent her. Just my name, that was all. The first thing that my father did was call my grandmother, who said, ""No, I didn't drive by and place a present on the porch. I'm not her coward mother; I would have given it right to her."" That gave my father the second idea: my mother. Only thing was, we had no way of getting in touch with her and finding out for she had literally taken off and abandoned us both. And over the next few weeks, nobody came forth and said they had gotten me the doll, so we assumed this is who had sent it.

They showed up every year since then. Each unique in their own ways, each more beautiful than the last. I thought it was a little odd, yes. Especially because my mother made no outreach to me so if she was sending me gifts but not bothering to even so much call me and check up, then that was just plain rude of her and her gifts meant literally nothing. But I continued to set them up on my shelf in my bedroom and they looked nice there, I suppose.

The year I turned nineteen, I was moved into college and was taking courses on my birthday. My father called me from home and asked me when I was coming back home for a break, and I told him that I had time this weekend, but I only said this because I sensed some urgency in his voice. I could make it work. He told me not to worry about anything but that he would really like to see me. Then he stressed that I always lock my doors and always have somebody walking with me if I was out past dark, which I already knew.

I returned home that weekend and my father said there had been an accident.
My porcelain birthday doll had arrived, my nineteenth year doll. When my father brought it inside the house, it had smashed into a hundred separate pieces.
Inside, there was a diary entry on a piece of paper.
We spent the entire day smashing open every porcelain doll, and the entire night speaking with the police.
Alexander had written diary entries for every time he had drugged and molested me, each more explicit, admitting that he had done the same to his daughter up until the time of her horrible death. My father and I hadn't a dry eye in our house that entire night, and I continued to have problems throughout my college career knowing that Alexander was somewhere out there, probably assuming a new identity and doing the same thing to other girls.

Now I know why he had always commented on me taking such 'usual long naps.'

honeymoonatthefalls,61,,144,1r0fus,,616,"The falls have a pull, according to the locals.  Something dark and unearthly like a siren’s song, sweet and somehow terrible.  It draws people “of a certain intent”.  That’s the polite way to say a lot of people end up crushed on the rocks below, their limbs torn apart by the unending rush of water, the brains that made them who they were nothing more than bits of foam and meat floating to the surface.  20-40 a year, in fact, depending on who you ask.

We were happy.  Weren’t we?  I thought we were.  I thought maybe we were different from everyone else, that we’d actually make it.  We wouldn’t end up in that 50% statistic.  We’d grow old together, laughing at the same stupid jokes, knowing what was going to come out of the other’s mouth before they even had a chance to say it.

Was it the pressure of the wedding?  The fact that I’m still “between jobs”?  Young 20-somethings in one of America’s bleakest economies, doing what we could to get by.  Scrambling for every scrap as the magazine covers reminded us how worthless our generation is, the snide remarks about our smartphones and Facebook and selfies.  Maybe getting married wasn’t a good idea.

But we were in love!  We were in love and we knew deep down in that secret place in our stomachs that she was the one for me and I for her.

So then why did it happen?

No.  I’m not supposed to ask that anymore.  I’m supposed to accept that she’s gone.  I’m supposed to accept the fact that she’s her own statistic now, one of 20-40 people a year.  Another tumble of bones on the body count that’s reached over 5000 since the falls became an attraction both for tourists and people with death on their mind.

But it’s hard to accept when I can still see her face so clearly, that sweet heart-shaped face with the little crescent-moon scar on her left nostril, the way her big blue eyes lit up when she showed me the fantastic deal she scored on Groupon, a Niagara Falls getaway for our honeymoon.

If only I could go back.  Tell her that the price was nice but I’d rather go to a beach, or Ireland, it doesn’t matter, anywhere but those cursed falls.

It’s impossible to describe how it feels to stand at the crest of Niagara, the mist peppering your face like cold little kisses, drinking in the smells and the sound and the remarkable way the water rushes down, down, ever down.  Your existence seems like a cosmic joke in comparison to this almost hauntingly beautiful feat of nature.  For a moment, it is.

The locals say you can tell who has a death wish by how close they’ll get to the edge.  Those who shy away, who shake their heads and insist nervously that they can see just fine from where they are, thank you very much, those are the ones who can’t trust themselves to get too close.  If they get too close to the edge, some little part of them knows they’ll jump.

She didn’t shy away.  She went right up to the railing.  She was smiling.

That’s the worst part.  She was smiling.

It was early in the morning, one of those damp gray dawns only possible in the new spring of upstate New York.  We had the sight to ourselves.  It was a little spooky, being out there alone, the kind of spooky you get from being in an empty shopping mall after hours, all those metal gates pulled down and the lights turned off.

She was standing there, a little too high on the guardrail, leaning just a little too far over, smiling as the mist touched her lips and made her hair curl in damp little tendrils on her cheeks.  She was beautiful.

I’ll never know why I pushed her.

That’s something I have to accept.

Jaunt-701,54,,147,1rff5i,,537,"I wrapped my dollie in her prettiest red dress, looked into her cracked eyes and whispered I love you.

I held her tight. I love you. I love you. But I started to cry, because dollies don't love back. No, my dollie wouldn't do, not anymore. I wanted something of my own to care for. Something soft I could nuzzle up to at night when I was lonely. Something that needed me. I wanted a real baby.

I asked mama how to make a baby. She slapped me across the face and made me drink dish soap to wash the devil's talk from my mouth. The red mark still burned on my cheek when I got to school, but no one noticed. They never noticed me except when I fell and spilled my lunch, or when Jenny and the other girls made fun of the holes in my dresses. They only noticed me to laugh at me.

That night after I said my prayers, I looked at the stars through my window and spotted one I had never seen before. Big, bright and ruby red, it seemed to get bigger the more I stared at it. It was beautiful, so I sent it a wish. Bring me a baby, I said, bring me something to love.

The star grew bigger and bigger until ruby red filled the room and turned the air thick and rusty. Something was there with me. Black and formless like a storm cloud, it floated above me. You want a child, it said, speaking into my head instead of my ears. I will give you a child, but you must promise to love and care for him no matter what.

I promise.

Wisps of black wrapped around my wrists and pinned them to the ground as sure as steel rivets. My nightdress was lifted and my legs pulled apart. Gritty black tendrils, rough as sandpaper, opened me and slithered inside. They scraped my insides, slowly at first, then faster and faster. It felt like I was being shredded to pulp from the inside out. I tilted my head back to scream, but black filled my mouth and nothing came out. Shhh, it said, to love your child you must suffer for him first. A final push in, and shards of splintered glass exploded inside me.

The thing loosed its grip, and I reached down to feel sticky red goo oozing out of me onto the floor. I was shaking and cold, and the room was falling away. Will I die? I asked.

No. You must care for him. It is your promise.

I woke the next morning without a scratch. Was it a dream? I touched my belly. No, he is there. I can feel him. Tiny and vulnerable and perfect. I would keep my promise.

He grew every day. Soon my belly was round and full underneath my dresses. Everyone noticed me now, especially Jenny and the other girls. Slut, they said. Whore. Trash. One day Jenny fell in front of a school bus as it was pulling away. You could hear the tire pop her skull open from across the parking lot. When the police dragged the driver away he stammered that he had seen something push her, something small and black like a living shadow.

Mama cried. She held me in a scalding tub and scrubbed my body until my skin cracked and bled. Not clean, not clean, she said. She pulled me out of school and swore that I would never leave the house until it was over and done, because what would the neighbors think. I didn't mind. As long as my little boy was safe inside me, I didn't care where I went.

I dreamed of him. He told me his name, but it was a sound I couldn't pronounce, a sound like a cloud of flies buzzing through the air. I couldn't say it, but I could hear it in my head, and that was enough. He told me that he would accomplish great things, but he needed my love to make him strong first. In my dreams I held him tight, looked into his dark eyes and whispered I will love and protect you always.

Mama dreamed of him too, I think. She would lay in bed with sweat soaking into the sheets whispering Please, Please help us God. She ate less and less until she was sunken and pale like a skeleton.

I was drawing pictures one night when it happened. I reached up for a red crayon and *pop*, yellow liquid gushing out of me. He's ready, he's finally ready. I called out to mama and told her it was time. She phoned the doctor, begging him to be discreet to hide it from the neighbors. He arrived and offered to inject me with something to relieve the pain. I refused. To love my baby I must suffer for him first.

Pushing, screaming, breathing, pushing again. Hours and hours. I was weak. I was tired. But the thought of him kept me going. After so long, we would finally meet. I would hold him in my arms for real and give him the love I kept in my heart just for him. I pushed again, with the last drops of strength I had left. I emptied out and collapsed down onto the bed, sighing with relief.

I am sorry, dear, but the baby didn't make it.

No. No you're wrong. I kept him safe this whole time. I protected him and loved him and spoke to him in my dreams, I was going to care for him and make him strong, he can't be, he can't be, he can't.

I am so sorry. Here child, you can say goodbye.

I held him in my arms. He was limp and motionless, his skin a pale gray, his eyes shut tightly. He looked so peaceful. I had never seen anything so beautiful in all my life. I clutched him to my chest and cried, tears dripping onto his head. Goodbye, my love, goodbye. But no, wait. He can't be gone. I can hear him. I can hear the flies in my mind.

His eyes snapped open and his head twisted around to look at mama and the doctor. Mama fell to the floor and screamed. Her legs scrambled to press her into a corner of the room, and her eyes bulged as she shrieked and pleaded to God. The doctor stood frozen for a moment before walking into the bathroom and quietly shutting the door.

My baby's head turned back to me, and I looked into his eyes for the first time. Two huge pools of midnight black that seemed to suck the light out of the room itself. I looked into those cold, dark eyes, and I smiled. My son. My beautiful son. I am so happy to see you.

I stood up while mama's jagged screams scratched my eardrums, and I carried my son to the bathroom. I opened the door, stepped over the spreading pool of red underneath the doctor, and turned on the tap. I bathed my son in the icy cold water as he stared up at me. He was perfect. He was everything I had hoped for. And he was mine.

-------

I saw things in my dream that night. I saw great buildings and monuments ground to dust. I saw waves of fire washing clean the cities of man. I saw clouds of flies so thick they blacked out the sun. I saw red. Mists of red, rivers of red, chunks of oozing red heaped high in the moonlight. And in the middle of it all, I saw my son, my baby boy. Mama's so proud of you sweetheart.

*No time for formalities, though. I need you to do something. Remember that old house we used to hide out in down by the farm? I need you to go there. When you approach the house, try not to make any sound. Go up to the loft and you will find a trunk. In it you will find a small vial, a razor blade, and a folded piece of paper. Take the razor and prick your finger. Touch your forehead and make a dot of blood. DO NOT touch the vial before you do so.*

*Open the vial and drink it. When you do so your vision will go blurry, but you have to stay calm. Pick up the paper in the trunk and read the first paragraph. It's in German, but I know you won't have trouble with  pronouncing it. At this point, you MUST stay calm. You will start to feel closed in and you will start hearing voices. DO NOT listen to what they have to say. Tear the paper into the smallest pieces you can and scatter them on the floor.*

*When that's done, go downstairs to the ""kitchen"". You will find a gas can and a lighter. Set fire to the house. No matter what the voices say, you HAVE to set fire to the house. After it starts going, the voices will go away. Then you need to get away from that house as fast as you can.*

I'm only sharing my story on here  so that someone out there can know about it. Whether or not you choose to believe it is up to you.

I was a normal child, but normal is relative so who am I to make that call. What I should say is that I grew up how you would expect a kid to grow up. My parents treated me properly, I did great in school, and I had many friends. It wasn't until high school that I started feeling the need to kill. 

It was all so spontaneous. I was just sitting in class one day staring at one of the students when the image of him dying popped into my head. I zoned out and focused on the image, his body lying in a pool of blood leaking from his head. His arms were snapped behind his back  and his feet were missing the big toes. A few weeks later that daydream became a reality... and I got away with it.

Everyone in the school was whispering rumors to one another as I walked to classes. Some were saying that he joined the army, others were convinced that he just moved like so many other kids did before him. I was the only one who knew the truth and I had to hide my devilish grin from the rest of the school. That was my only murder in high school but it ignited the flame.

When I reached adult hood I landed a successful job and had plenty of money to obtain the tools I had always dreamed of using on my victims. That's when I began to develop a signature style. I would always sever the big toes but I no longer snapped the arms behind the back. Honestly, the sound of the bones breaking didn't sit well with me. Every day I would watch the news expecting to see that one of the victims had been found, but they never were. 

Years went by and I targeted another twelve victims. They were no one in particular. Women, teenagers, it really didn't matter to me. A dead body is a dead body in my eyes, I don't care who it belongs to. Very few of them would put up a fight and that was fine with me. I wasn't trying to drag out the last moments of their lives, I just wanted them to die. I wanted to savor the warmth of their blood on my hands as I slit their throat.  

About a week after I killed my final victim, I met a girl that I ended up falling in love with. She doesn't realize how close she was to becoming just another undiscovered body. She wasn't able to have kids which was fine with me, I never really saw myself as a father. Neither of us believe in god so we saw no point in getting married, I was okay with this as well. I felt like my life was finally going to be normal again. 

After we had been together for a few years I decided to tell her about my past. I made a special dinner for her to lighten the mood. However, when I told her she just laughed and thought I was being ridiculous. It turned into her treating it like some type of role playing fantasy I had and she ignored me as I told her it was the truth. I didn't know how to prove it to her... so I killed someone in front of her. 

One night I brought her with me on what she thought was a date. When we got to the spot I opened the trunk so she could see my victim. She still thought it was a joke and asked me how I got my friend to agree to this. I think she finally understood that it was no joke as I sliced the mans throat. Her face turned pale and she reached into her purse to get her phone. I was prepared for this though and I knocked her unconscious. After I finished with  my signature killing pattern I drove back to the house. My secret was not safe with her but I loved her too much to kill her.

Right now she's kept in my basement. I don't treat her like a prisoner mind you, she has everything she could ever want. I'm hoping in time I can start leaving her untied at night so she'll quit trying to escape. I know one day she'll accept who I am. Maybe one day she'll help me fulfill my new fantasy of killing together. Or perhaps you guys won't believe me either and you'll brush this off as just another made up story. But that's the funny thing about being a killer...",The funny thing about being a killer is that no one believes you if you tell them the truth.,543,nosleep
AmbiguousGopher,31,,83,1r5xlc,,359,"For most of my life, I've been drawn to a certain room of my house. A bedroom at the far end of my basement, which used to be a guest bedroom. I can't really explain why, but I just always wanted to sleep there. Until the age of 8, my older brother and I shared a room right across the hall from the bedroom of my parents. When he was 13, however, he moved into that bedroom, and over the years, the room become even more interesting. The room is now filled with posters of The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, an authentic Spanish sword he bought hangs above his desk, and loads of other bits and pieces which captured my imagination when I was younger. To top it all off, there was an air vent connecting his room and mine. Almost directly below my room, I could hear him some nights talking to his friends on the phone while playing video games late into the night. I envied his freedom. If I had tried that, my parents right across the hall would hear me and I'd be grounded.

When I was 13 myself, my brother and sister (twins) left for college. Now the only child at home, I called my brother up one weekend and asked, 
""Can I have your room?""
My brother paused for a long time before responding
""No.""
He gave no explanation, but I didn't really care. I could understand that when he came to visit, He'd want his own room to sleep in. For 4 more years, i didn't ask to have the room again, but when i was 17, my brother bought a house. To me, it seemed like he was pretty much beyond the point of having any reason to care about his old room, so one day when he called to check up on things, I asked again.
This time he responded more quickly. His voice sounded casual, but at the same time, It kinda freaked me out. He said,
""Nah, let mom make it a guest room again. Besides, your room is super classy! My room isn't that great.""
And so, yet again, I let it go. I stayed in my room and didn't really think anything of it... that is, until last week. 

This summer, I started having severe anxiety attacks coupled with spells of incapacitating depression, especially at night. I've been on different medicines to help, and have been going to therapy to help work on relaxation techniques. Last week, my therapist noted that sometimes the brain can form associations with certain rooms or areas. She suggested that my brain, due to the recurring spells in my room, may have formed a negative association with it. She told me that switching rooms may help me relax when I start having an attack.

That night, I did it. I switched to my brother's room, and it was amazing. Since my basement always stays around below room temperature, the sheets and pillow stayed cool, which was just to my liking. I slept better than I'd slept in weeks, and thought that perhaps this room was going to turn things around. But the second night didn't go as well. I woke from a nightmare, and felt as if there was someone watching me. I shook the feeling and went back to sleep. This kind of thing happened for a few more nights; each time, I awoke more worried than the last. 

Then came the big one. I fell asleep as usual, and I began to dream: another nightmare, but this time it was more vivid. In the dream, I saw looking at my brother, when he was only 13 or 14 years old. He was sitting on his bed, talking to something. I couldn't see it, but he was looking at an angle which suggested something much larger than himself. Tears were flowing steadily from his eyes, and he was pleading, BEGGING the thing to go away, to leave him alone. The power in the room went out; I heard a horrible screeching, like a pig being tortured. The lights turned back on and my brother lay there, unconscious. A large black bruise had appeared on his ribs. The clock in his room recovered from the power outage, blinking the numbers ""00:00"". My brother then jerked upright and walked over to the only poster in his room at the time, his Hendrix poster. He took a pen form his desk and put a tally mark on the wall behind it.

I jerked up in my brother's bed. I turned on the lamp and looked around the room. I noticed every poster. Sweat started pouring from my forehead, burning my eyes. I looked at the clock. The numbers blinked ""00:00"".

TheeMikeG,21,,73,1r4fsf,,333,"Dear Mike,

They’re letting me write a letter so I figured I’d get my story out there.

It was a routine night drop, nothing different from what we’ve done countless times before. The steady hum of the C-130 as it tore through the clouds was the only thing keeping me calm. Yeah, I’ve done this a lot, but you can never get rid of the nerves before a mission. We had an idea of what awaited us down there, but we couldn’t be a hundred percent sure. People are unpredictable, and that’s scary. The plan from higher was to have our five man team infiltrate by night drop a small village I can’t pronounce to search for and capture or kill a HVT whose name I also can’t pronounce. The gunship would rise up and provide overwatch until we were extracted. Airborne all the way, hooah. 

The LT joined us again, which he decided to do from time to time. Nice enough guy, I respected him. Was supposed to be having a baby girl soon, he would always talk about it during PT. Good for him, I could never hold down a relationship for very long. I figured it was just because I’ve seen too much shit to be normal and cuddle or whatever the fuck it is that couples do. The rest of the squad was the usual guys. Mitch, Craft, and Burroughs. All experts in their craft. We were a solid group and I’d take a bullet or hell, even two, for any of them. 

“Thirty seconds!” shouted the LT from the bench, a few spots to my right, closest to the door. The jumpmaster heaved the door upward and the familiar sound of air whooshing past the plane made my heart jump. There was always a kick. “Hook up!” he shouted. We all stood up in unison and clipped our static lines to the wire that ran through the plane above our heads. I tugged on my static line to make sure it was attached. There were no reserves for this one. The jumpmaster held up his hand. Five seconds. The red light turned green and the LT positioned himself by the door. The jumpmaster smacked his rear and the LT jumped out and was whisked away. My stomach turned in knots. Over a hundred jumps and I still hated this shit. I was last to go out. I tucked my head, took a hop out of the plane and suddenly there was the rush and I felt myself getting tossed. I heard my chute above and I breathed a sigh of relief. 
Looking up to check my canopy I saw a fully inflated chute and I thanked the Lord once again. I looked down for the rest of the squad and saw their chutes inflated too. Past them, I expected to see the ground, but there was only a thick smoke, or at least that’s what it looked like. A storm cloud? Why didn’t the jumpmaster hold off the jump until the bad weather passed? 

“Staus check” I heard the LT ask through the radio. 

As I watched the other’s canopies disappear into the black cloud I began to worry. I heard the squad all check in though so I felt a little better.  I held my hand up to my ear to activate our comms. 

“Sir, what’s the situation down there?”
	
“Zero visibility guys. Pretty foggy. Can’t see my own canopy,” he said.

Then I entered the black cloud and couldn’t see a damn thing. I heard something nearby. Flapping? My radio clicks before Mitch starts talking. “I heard something. Flock of birds?”
	
“We’re too high,” replied the LT. “Eyes and ears open.” I tried to look around but there was no point. I couldn’t even see my canopy. What if I was falling to my death right then? Heavy flapping got my focus. It sounded large, whatever it was. 
	
“Sir, something is up here with us,” I say.
	
“Simmons, stay calm, what’s gotten into –”
	
“Fuck!” Craft interrupts through the mic. Then I hear a long, painful scream far below me. 
	
“Jesus Christ!” yelled the LT, “Craft! You there?!”
	
Silence. Not even static. 
	
“Guys, stay calm. Get ready to hit any minute. I can’t see the ground in this shit but we’ll sort this out on the DZ.”
	
I checked my watch. It takes maybe two minutes to hit jumping from a mile up. It’s been six minutes and I know this wasn’t a HALO jump. Was I caught in a thermal? I pulled on my risers and felt myself drifting through the air. When I released, I didn’t notice any change in descent speed. The LT must have noticed the same thing because I could hear him cursing through the radio. There’s a loud screech; unlike anything I’ve ever heard. After it ended a few seconds later the LT had to shout over the commotion we were all making on the radio. We were scared. 
	
“Guys! I don’t know what the fuck is going on but stay calm! Weapons on amber.”
	
My combat gear was in a large sack between my legs, but my USP was on my belt. I took it out and held it ready. I didn’t know for what, but I was ready to go. How had we still not hit the ground yet? Then I got an idea. My combat load. We are supposed to release it before landing, and it slides down a twenty foot rope so we don’t break our legs when we land. I thought if I could cut it free, maybe I could hear it hit the ground. I asked for permission from the LT who quickly approved. He must have been as freaked out as me to allow me to abandon my combat gear. I pressed the handle on my hip and the gear slid down the rope and out of sight into the darkness. I took out my knife and sawed at the line until it snapped. I waited and waited but couldn’t hear a thing. 
	
I heard the flapping again, and someone fired their weapon, two, three times. Then silence. “Jesus Christ,” whispered the LT. “Status check.”
	
“Burroughs.”
	
“Simmons.”
	
Nothing.
	
“Sir, what the fuck is going on?!” I knew he wouldn’t have an answer, but I was desperate. 
	
“I have no idea.”
	
We drifted through the air for ten more minutes. Then I touched down. I didn’t hit hard, it was like I was just set down. Didn’t even have to fall over. I still couldn’t see a damn thing though. I heard quick steps and then Burroughs burst into view and tackled me to the ground. He was frantic. He begged me through tears to follow him. We wandered around until we came to the LT. He didn’t have a right half of his body. He was barely alive, sputtering through bloody lips for us to run. 
	
“My baby, my baby, my baby,” he whispered over and over until he didn’t say anything anymore. The cloud cleared from the area behind him and there was this thing. All I saw before I turned and ran was large leathery wings. I heard the screeching and the flapping of those awful wings again. Burroughs screamed as he was ripped backwards from beside me. Somehow I burst out of the cloud and I saw headlights. I nearly got hit by the jeep but dove out of the way just in time. Out got two guards who spoke a language I didn’t understand. Burroughs was the translator. They prodded me with machine guns and kicked and beat me until I was barely conscious. How did they not see the thing behind me? They dragged me into the back of their vehicle and drove me to their camp. 

I’ve been their POW for nearly a month now. If you get this letter, please get my story out there. I’m not crazy, I promise. I can’t explain what happened any better than that. We’re not alone. Something terrible is going on over here. Time to go; they’re beckoning me to come outside. It’s awfully dark out there. Is a storm coming in?

courtneymadison,33,,83,1r2j24,,253,"I'm just a normal 18 year old that lives at home and goes to class. I've never really had any unexplainable experiences but I had one today. I woke up and started getting ready for class, I thought I saw my mom in her room so I started having a conversation with her while I was getting dressed. She was responding as per usual so I thought nothing of it. (Quick sidenote: Nothing felt wrong with the way she was responding. Whatever this was it sounded just like my mom.) After a while she stopped replying to me. Being curious I decided to go see why. I went to her room and it was empty, looked in the kitchen and it was empty, She would of had to have walked past me to leave the house so I knew she hadn't left. I decided to call her to figure out where she'd gone and when I looked I had a text from her that was received at 5:27 a.m. saying ""Got called in to open. Be home at 11 so you can take the car."". I called her to see if she was messing with me but she was actually at work. I don't know who I've been talking to all morning and I'm really freaked out. Can anyone help me? 


EDIT: I asked my little sister if when she had had anything strange happen when she was getting ready for school and she looked at me like I'd lost it. For all the people that asked about the conversation, the previous night my mom had found a ouija board (unused and still in the packaging) in my closet and she had thrown it away, ""She"" was talking about how ouija boards are dangerous and I shouldn't mess with them. She was very persistent that I don't get involved with things like that but she's always saying stuff like that so it wasn't a very out of the ordinary topic for us. The conversation was about an hour long and I was fully awake when it took place. We checked the house and nothing was missing or out of place. We live in an apartment and all the windows were locked and the screens were intact, so someone couldn't have gotten in or out through them. My mom is really into the weird/paranormal stuff so I told her everything and she has no idea what it could be. Also I feel I should mention we've lived here for 15 years and nothing like this has happened before.

JunkPrince,53,,89,1ragny,,255,"Hey all, long time reader of /r/nosleep, and I finally have a reason to post!

I work in a recycling center. I am the guy that weighs the truck when it comes in with scrap metal, watches it unload, and then weighs the truck when it comes out. That difference in weight is used to calculate the value of the scrap and how much the customer receives for his load. it’s a well known place in my town, city actually. There’s a pretty steady business and it’s good work. I started out in the yard sorting and a few years ago moved into the office. I still have to wear a hard hat and safety vest, but only when I have to watch a truck unload in an area that the cameras don’t cover. 

A few days ago, we started getting loads from a demolition job about a hundred miles from town. It was an old Air Force base that didn’t survive the latest round of budget cuts. The base was being scrapped to make a nature preserve. The plan is called Nukes to nature. The contractors brought in mostly structural iron, copper wiring and office equipment. I was watching a contractor ( who was mostly likely drunk) tip his truck when a old metal desk caught my eye. It landed right side up twenty feet from me. Because I was bored I walked over and opened the drawers.

 One of the drawers a metal lock box. I took it back to my desk and set about picking the lock. Working in a scrap yard we sometimes come across old strongboxes or small office safes. My boss has a deal that if you can open it, then whoever finds it splits the contents 50/50 with the scrapyard. You can see why I’ve gotten pretty good at picking locks!

The box opened after a few minutes of concerted effort. Inside was just an old piece of computer equipment, an inch high by 4 inches long. The closest thing I could compare the size to was to the box that your bank send you your checks in. It had a small bar code on the top part, and handwritten in permanent marker was the words “ MJ-12, Containment “ An orange sticker proclaimed “ Erase and Destroy, ref FM 3-36 USA TRADOC”

I showed what I am now calling the hard drive to my boss, who was VERY unimpressed and gave me the number for a IT guy who might want to buy it. I am going to see if he wants to buy it, but I’m going to ask him if he can see what files are on the drive. Secret plans to bomb the Soviets? Blueprints for a new jet fighter? Who knows? It’s a mystery worthy of /r/nosleep!!!

I’ll post when I hear back from the IT guy

PeckerPoker,43,,85,1r58lt,,238,"Ok, so this isn't a long story filled with twists and turns, but it just happened about 15 minutes ago, and I'm a little uneasy now.

For reference, my husband, son, and I moved into an apartment in the top-half of a century-home a couple months ago. The doors all have old knobs and the doors don't always close easily - you really have to pull sometimes.

Anyway, I just put my son (almost two years old) down for his nap. I told him night-night as I closed the door. As I always do, I pulled the door shut firmly and made sure I heard it click. I swear I heard it click.

I walked away and into the bathroom to go pee. As I sat down on the toilet, I heard my son start crying, which isn't that unusual, but normally he doesn't do more than fuss for a minute before falling asleep. I even kept him up a little longer than usual to make sure he fell asleep. He seemed pretty ready to go down... thumb in mouth under his blanky, he rolled over onto his side and put his blanket over his head like he does when he's really tired.

I finish peeing and walk out of the bathroom and his door is wide open. I see him standing in his crib crying. I go in, feeling uneasy, and lay him back down and cover him back up. He lays there and just keeps crying as I check his closet... like there would be someone hiding in there or something. Kind of dumb, I know, but I couldn't just shut him back in his room alone without checking.

Even if I was wrong and the door didn't click shut (which is possible), it shouldn't have been wide open. When I haven't completely shut it in the past, it will open up about 5 or 6 inches. It's never opened up all the way like that.

I checked the rest of the rooms and closets, feeling nervous, but kind of stupid. Of course, there wasn't anything unusual anywhere. Still, I'm kind of on edge. I wish my husband was home.",Nap Time,323,nosleep

Thats some crazy stuff, am I right?

Let me know what you think.

tellmewhatiswrong,52,,59,1reivz,,213,"Arghhh. I have no idea what to make of this situation I find myself in.

I started off 2013 as being in the most amazing relationship I've ever had. I married the girl of my dreams last year, after being together for 5 years prior to that. She is the most beautiful, intelligent, interesting person I have ever met, and I knew that as soon as we met each other. Immediately, the chemistry between us was electric.

Don't get me wrong, we are extremely different in a lot of ways, but up until this point, that has only helped to make our relationship stronger. I'm an atheist, a kind of scientific nerd I guess. She, on the other hand, was more....new age? I guess you could say. Not particularly religious, but interested in the paranormal, philosophy, anything that can't really be explained. It would not surprise me to see her out hunting for UFO's, however for the most part, this side of her was really just limited to reading about such events and watching the odd documentary.

Having said that, she is so sensible and smart. She's a very curious person, that's what I put her hobbies down to, really. It's never been more than a passing interest of hers. She works as a personal assistant to the CEO of a law firm in the city. Everyone says she should study law because her talents are wasted as a secretary. But she seems content enough at the moment....well she did.

The reason I find myself in this mess is because she has changed her mind about something we used to agree on - kids. When we first got together, we both agreed that we did not want to have children. We based our entire relationship on that premise. We were content with travelling the world, expensive wines, and sex on the kitchen bench. All that would change if kids came into the picture. I have never wanted children, and don't feel like I ever will.

She used to feel the same. Until her sister had a baby. She started to get a little clucky, she said. She started to see us with a baby of our own. At first I thought it was just a passing comment, but the longer time went on, the more I realised she was serious. That's when the fights started. Fight after fight, every week. Her crying and yelling and begging me to change. To compromise. Me, dumbfounded and annoyed that one of the foundations of marriage is suddenly being challenged. Things have been said in the heat of the moment, and both of us have been deeply hurt by the other. She makes me feel like I can't give her what she needs, that I'm denying her her happiness. I make her feel like she's not important, she says. That I'm being selfish.

Maybe I am? I don't know.

So we found ourselves in a stale mate. She posted something on Reddit asking for advice and most of the suggestions directed us to attend couples counselling.

I was reluctant to say the least. But I was willing to give it a shot.

Sandra, our therapist, was actually not what I expected. She seemed rational and quite straightforward, not the Einstein-esque shrink that I had imagined. She advised that we really we had two options : either she could stay with me, and be without a child. Or she could leave me for someone who would give her a baby. We seem to be stuck in secret option number 3: staying in the circumstances we find ourselves in.

Disregarding all the fighting, she was still her normal self, and we have been managing to keep it together, and still spend some quality time together. We have still been going out with friends, and going for walks with our dog, and I know we still love each other.

I stopped going to couples counselling. I sort of felt like she couldn't give us a real answer, she was only there to listen. My wife kept attending on her own though, I think she takes some kind of comfort in it.

She came home last week and told me that she's going to be attending a ""Self help"" seminar, and would I like to go. I said definitely not. I couldn't think of anything worse than to be honest! Even the counselling sessions were too much for me. She asked if I minded if she went. She said it was with some famous psychoanalyst, and that her therapist would be in attendance, on the ""Assistance Team"". I said whatever she felt would help. She said she feels it will help her clear her head on the baby issue. I'm all for anything that could help us get back on track, so I told her to go for it.

The seminar seemed pretty intensive. It was 14 hours a day, Friday, Saturday and Sunday of last week. It was also very expensive, but I bit my tongue. 

She got home last night and just seemed exhausted. I haven't gotten many details out of her, as every night when she arrived home she went straight to sleep and we barely had time to speak. Today we both had the day off, which was recommended by the people who organised the seminar.

Today we woke up, and she was....intense. I woke up with her clinging to me for dear life. She was stroking my face and staring into my face. It was quite nice actually. Nice to have some affection. We cuddled in bed for a long while. She seemed.....ok. Her eyes definitely looked brighter, but she didn't say much, just was very intensely affectionate. 

She got up to have a shower, and I went out to have some breakfast. After about half an hour I knocked on the bathroom door, telling her to leave some hot water. She must have had it on so hot, steam was pouring out of the door into our hallway, and the walls were dripping with condensation. I knocked a few more times, and yelled out to her, but got no response.

I opened the door, and waited for the hazy steam to clear, to see her standing there, fully clothed and staring in the mirror. The shower was on full ball, and extremely hot, and I reached over the turned the tap off. She didn't take her eyes off her own reflection. She was very vague when I questioned her, and sweating profusely. I managed to get her dressed (out her pyjamas) and she's in the other room now watching TV.

I assume this weird behaviour is something to do with the seminar? I don't really understand all this new age crap, has anyone else ever been to one of these seminars? Or know someone that has? I've tried googling more information but can't see anything about this specific group. 

Any advice would be appreciated, I'm a bit weirded out right now to be honest.

","Need some advice. My wife seems to be in some weird trance/zombie like state? Not sure what to do, or if I'm over-reacting...",272,nosleep
PlotThickener,13,,44,1r0aj7,,202,"This is a story I've never discussed with anyone aside from those people involved. But I figured it belonged here. For the longest time I chalked it all up to pranks, my imagination, whatever...but hopefully you'll all be able to make more sense of it.

I was driving in a rural part of Wisconsin (which, if you live there, you know is much of the state). Lots of flat farms, country highways named for letters, empty back roads, etc. It was 10 p.m. or later--I don't really remember when, but it had been dark for some time and it was the middle of summer, so it must have been late. 

It was the time of night cars stop moving on the rural roads so it's just you and your headlights and the world around you starts getting really creepy. Plus you're always watching out for deer on these roads, which can just pop out at any moment, so you're kind of on ""yellow alert.""

I'm driving north on a long section of road. There's a big flat farm on my left, mostly empty-looking, probably planted with soybeans which don't grow high. I'm concentrating on the edges of where my headlights meet the darkness to watch for deer, and I think I see one walking out of the farm toward the road.

I tap the brakes, not sure of what I see, but soon I realize it's not a deer. It's upright, something walking on two feet, and it's HUGE. And it's all black. It's still moving, but it's not moving with any kind of walking movement; it's just sort of gliding across my vision.

At this point I've stopped the car completely--in the middle of the road, just watching. One instinct was to hit the gas and drive past, because I could have easily passed it, but I'm not sure if it was about to jump out. I'm not really afraid yet, I'm just frozen; you know those moments where you can't figure out what something is so there are no real emotions? That was me.

Then it comes into clearer view in the headlights. Well, that's not very accurate to say, because it didn't seem to reflect any light. It was like the light moved through it, if that makes sense. But I could see the outline of the figure against everything else that was lit--the road, the trees, etc.

The figure looked like Death. I mean EVERYTHING you imagine when you read the stories--the scythe, the big black hood. It was exactly what you think when you think Grim Reaper, only unnaturally tall and thin. It was so tall and thin it looked a lot like this guy's halloween costume when he wears it after about five minutes or so: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8PoCkNKDGk Especially how tall it was. I mean, ten feet minimum. I think most people think of the Grim Reaper as being as large as a big person, but it wasn't really like that.

But that was my first thought. A halloween costume. It was still summer, though, so not Halloween. But, I rationalize, maybe it's just a prank. But then I pay attention to how it moves to the middle of the road.

It just GLIDES. I see no feet, no hint that this thing is doing anything but flying off the ground, but you can't see feet or anything because the robe hits the ground.

Then, in the middle of the road, maybe ten feet in front of me, it stops.

The hooded face turns--toward me.

It's so slow and smooth, and just plain UNNATURAL, that I completely freeze in the car. My hands are locked on the wheel. The face is turning to me, slowly, perfectly smoothly, and I'm scared out of my mind. Even if this is some prank, this thing clearly means business. Maybe it's some psychopath scaring people, and not just an innocent prank.

It sees me. I don't see eyes, no glowing eyes or anything, just black, but somehow I KNOW that it's looking at me, making eye contact. I got goosebumps even on my scalp; I remember my hair feeling like it stood straight up. I feel like I was literally looking death in the face. My stomach sank like someone just told me a loved one had died. I mean, you do not want to feel this feeling. Ever. The thing stood perfectly still, too, as if considering me or weighing me. I felt really judged, if that makes sense. Like I was being considered.

Then he glides off so fast I don't even see where he goes. The roads are clear again, and then I heard the engine running as if all of the world's sound had suddenly been un-muted.

I drive back home, still frozen, still rationalizing what I saw. A prank, I figure. It had to be a prank, some overzealous Halloween lover setting up rumors of the Grim Reaper walking around the farms. I tell my parents about it, and they're sure it's a prank. So sure that I eventually rationalize it away, and the memory is filed away as creepy, but nothing supernatural.

At about the same time, I heard that a farmer who owned that soybean field had died that night. But it took me a long time before I put two and two together, when I realized that I saw something that looked like THE FREAKING GRIM REAPER on the same night that farmer died. I remember when I first had the thought, and my stomach sank.

It was like the rationalization I had used to remember the story of the Grim Reaper was suddenly stripped away, and I had to confront the fact that I saw something very, very scary.

But what else can I do but live my life?

I went back to college--every time I came back home at night I took an alternate road just because I got the creeps so bad. Had a good semester, mostly A's, had some good times with friends. I drive back mostly during day or evening time so I don't have to revisit those unpleasant memories.

Then my parents tell me that there are more ""Grim Reaper"" stories going around lately, all pretty similar to mine. When you live in a  small town it seems like there are a lot of funerals for old people that you know or at least heard of going on all the time. At one funeral, an old lady's granddaughter cried because she saw she said a big black figure over the casket. My parents heard that story and thought of mine, but they still just treated it as a joke.

I would stay up a lot later than the people in my house (parents + younger brother, plus an uncle aunt and cousin who were spending Christmas with us), and slept in a room upstairs on this little side road in a rural subdivision. No streetlights out there; just the lights that other people kept on their garages all night.

One night I went up to my room at about 2 a.m., and of course the whole house is quiet, and I go to my room and turn out the lights so I can go to bed. I usually throw a glance out the window and you can see most of the side street because the neighbors kept their garage light on all night.

This time the whole scene looks a little different. There's a big shadow looming in the front yard, and it's blocking a lot of light. Then I look closer and I realize it's not a shadow--it's something black that's cutting THROUGH the light.

Then I feel my heart practically stop as I realize…it's back. The Grim Reaper figure.

It was just like before. It cast no shadow. The scythe was there, and the tall hooded cloak, with no face.

The breath went out of me when I realized that, unlike before, this reaper was not looking to the side when I discovered it. It was looking right at our house.

II stood there, frozen again, my finger still on the switch from just having hit the light. It was a windy winter night, and you could see some snow move, but the creature's robe didn't move at all. The same way its movements before had been unnatural, now it loomed like a statue. No flailing around in the wind. Just standing tall, scythe up high, staring at our house.

I looked away, then looked back again. Still there. Looming. I didn't get the sense that it was looking at me, but I still couldn't stop staring.

Then I looked away, and looked back again. This time I KNEW it was staring. Again, it was hard to see--there was really nothing that I could tell that suggested it was looking at me. No evil glowing eyes or anything. I just felt it. Felt the same feelings as before--a rotten pit in my stomach, the feeling of being measured and weighed and considered.

I heard a squeak, and realized it was me. My breath was being squeezed out of me, simply from the fear. Keep in mind I had no idea what this thing would do next. What, fly up to my window? Suddenly disappear? Rip off its hood and reveal a laughing skull?

After a moment, its gaze departed from me, again. I felt good enough to go to my brother's room and wake him up to show him something in the window. It took him forever to get out of bed, but it may have only been a few minutes. By the time he woke up, rubbed his eyes, and listened to the panic in my voice, a few minutes had at least past. I showed him the window but, of course, the figure was gone.

But still, that was it, I knew. The night I saw death.

That was the night my uncle died.

chimera_phantasm,44,,52,1rbg7n,,185,"My name is Ramiel, and I want you to read this right before you go to sleep. Trust me, it’s better this way.

 If it’s the middle of the day for you or perhaps you’re not quite tired yet, bookmark this and read it when your eyes are starting to itch with tiredness, but you’re not nodding off yet. I don’t want you to forget what you’re about to read. 

I’m on the tall, skinny side of my arabic family, I guess I take after my mom in that respect. Though i’m pretty sure she didn’t have this much facial hair. She named me after an angel that is responsible for “divine visions”. I wonder if she knew how right on the money she was.  	

Why does my name and physical features matter? I suppose it doesn’t, but if I’m going to share something this personal with strangers for help or some kind of catharsis, i’d rather you had a good idea of who I am and not just a blank slate.  	

I don’t want you to forget me when this is over. 
	

Before we begin, here’s an interesting fact to wrap your head around: Your brain produces extremely high amounts of a psychedelic compound called DMT (Dimethyltryptamine) two times in your life; Once when you are born to help cope with the pressure it puts on your fragile, infant body during the painful process of birth and once again when you are seconds from dying to ease the burden it puts on your body and mind as they both shut down for the very last time. This is often why people claim to see their loved ones who have long passed on by their side, bright lights from the sky or feelings of elation. 

This process is so strong that it has the capabilities to erase everything in your mind, like a mass wipe of your hard drive. Now you might think that isn’t too important if you’re just starting out your life or simultaneously moments away from it coming to an end, but I ask you to entertain the notion that you possess a soul or an inner essence of sorts; what if that soul, that consciousness, that essence of you simply continued on without the knowledge of a past existence? What if at the moment of death, you saw something so undeniably horrifying and inconceivable, something you’d only seen in fleeting dreams and nightmares throughout your life, that your brain compensates in the only way it knows how, by erasing any prior memory of it before allowing what makes you “you” continue onto the next stage of whatever is out there. Your brains last failsafe, a defence mechanism to ensure you won’t carry the burden with you. But like any kind of defence mechanism, there’s always a bypass...and there’s always a black box.  
	
DMT is a chemical produced by your pineal gland and it is responsible for us dreaming every single night. Not the reason, however. We have no idea why we dream, we just do. As soon we enter REM sleep, our dreams become their most memorable and malleable. It is at this point we have dreams which take proper form, that we feel most real and perceive to be the most accessible, though we seldom ever remember the dream itself. Because like a drug trip, our brain is determined to protect us from that experience...but what if that wasn’t the only reason?

Consider this; The older we get, we sleep considerably less hours. As babies, we sleep for up to 14 hours and by the time we hit 18 years old, it’s half of that amount. What if this is a defence mechanism our brain develops so that we don’t spend too long in “that realm”? No, i’m not talking about “the further” from Insidious or some kind of Nightmare on Elm Street knockoff, before your already horror obsessed minds make some kind of parable to an existing franchise for comfort or relatable aspects. You’re still very much within your own mind, but there’s something else there with you.  

Now I ask you to suspend all beliefs or non-beliefs and read on to hear my story and why I no longer sleep and why, despite being an Atheist, I pray to something, to anything, (hell even Hypnos would be a welcome evil right now) that should my mind succumb to sleep and my body fail me, that I don’t dream. 

I’m a counsellor at my local university, I took on the job in September of last year as a ditch effort to bump up my resume and to reduce rent through living on the campus. It was your usual run of the mill kind of work, talk to terrified 1st years who’d never lived away from home before and were simply not used to their newfound freedom, dealing with homesickness, new friendships, one night stands etc. The 2nd years were dealing with social troubles within their houses/apartments, deadlines mounting and the occasional unplanned pregnancy. The final year students were typically near breakdown over their dissertations and end of year exams, so you’d offer them all the appropriate advice, your own experiences at the university as an example and then ultimately hope it all sinks in. If not, well there’s always next week and beyond that, a private therapist. 

But, like all forms of employment that deal with face to face interactions, there’s always one encounter you never forget. For me, that was Milo Moraga, a 2nd year student studying Psychology &amp; Philosophy. The first time he came into my office, he struck me as a little bit gaunt, his striped long-sleeve top hanging off him like it’d stretched in the wash. Strung out, but shy. That would have been my first impression. I think he sensed my preconceived notions, avoiding making eye contact with me as he shuffled inside. He was apprehensive, sleep deprived, his hair greasy under a black beanie and his eyes laden with heavy dark bags underneath like someone had put on eyeliner while he slept. He sat down, glancing around at the windows and leant forward, cracking his knuckles and rubbing his hands over one another hastily.

*“Hello Milo, how can I help you? I understand you asked for this appointment because of...anxiety? Do you want to tell me about that?”*

 I looked through the brief set of notes the receptionist gave me and tried to study as best I could while he spoke. Nothing that would ultimately help me ascertain the problem, it just gave him time to compose himself. 

He didn’t respond, just kept shuffling in his chair, I guess he wasn’t 100% sure he should come here.  	

*“Your lecturer sent you here, didn’t they?”* I said bluntly, feeling a slight headache come on as I felt an awkward 30 minute session rearing it’s ugly, monotonous head. 

He nodded, but I noticed something in that moment that made me think there was more to it. His expression was almost like he was pleading for his life as he quickly nodded.  	

I leaned forward, placing my hands under my chin and up to my lips as I observed him, I had to be very careful with how I handled this. If he was suicidal, one wrong statement could leave him with a noose round his neck.  	

*“Milo, what happened in the classroom to get you here? Can you tell me that much?”*

He mimicked me, leaning forward as well, though his posture was the furthest parallel from my own, it looked like his spirit was broken. 

*“The lecturer...Ms Armstrong...she was talking about solipsism and I just got...lost within it. Do you know what solipsism is?”*

I did, but I shook my head. I didn’t want to interrupt him when he was being so open. 

*“It’s a philosophical belief that everything an individual perceives is only in his own mind, it is a construct of his own psyche. There is no other human beings, no other individual thoughts, just his or her own...I guess I found the idea kinda comforting and I broke down.”*

 I raised an eyebrow, that’s certainly not a usual response. 

*“Comforting, Milo? You mean to say you enjoy being alone &amp; isolated?”*  

*“No, the opposite actually, I have a lovely group of friends, a loving family and a fiancé, but it was comforting for another reason...if It’s just me, then what hurts me is just me, I know what i’m capable of and it makes any kinds of threats a moot point. It means that..that...”*

 He put his hands up to his mouth and began crying silently, the picture of this situation was getting uglier and murkier the more he explained. 

*“It means that I might not die after all.”*

 I rolled up my sleeves, my flannel shirt was already beginning to chafe me. First signs of stress, I suppose. I looked down at my charm bracelet my wife brought me and took in a deep breath. I knew this was going to be rough. 

*“It’s...it’s my dreams, doc. There’s something in my dreams. I can’t sleep anymore. Each time I do, it’s like I can sense i’m going into that place again, journeying deeper into the void with every evening. I’ve tried taking coffee, shit loads of red bull and any cheap ass energy drinks I can get my hands on...I even took those pills truckers take so they can stay wired for 18 hours, but...well you know the problem, right doc?”* He looked down and started rubbing his hands together again, his knee bouncing as he struggled to keep it under control. 

Withdrawal symptoms combined with sleep deprivation, this kid was getting more tweaked by the minute. 	

*“The problem being that we all have to sleep eventually, no matter how long we put it off.”* I exhaled. *“Milo, I want you to start at the beginning, I know you’re anxious to get some kind of help, but if I don’t know the route of the problem, I can’t give you the correct advice, okay? Now I want you take in 3 deep breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. Can you do that for me? And you don’t need to call me ‘doc’, i’m just a volunteer counsellor. You can call me ‘Rami’ if you like?”* 

He nodded and did as instructed, his demeanour improving slightly with each successive inhale, though this was hardly a permanent solution to his paranoia. I didn’t want to ask at this point how long he’d been awake for, but I could tell it’d been more than a handful of days. Once an individual goes past the 3 day mark, they will begin to lose their grip on sanity and brain cells will start to die. I was silently hoping I could find out the problem to this sooner rather than later.  	

*“Alright”* I picked up my laptop to take notes. *“Go ahead, tell me what started this all off.”*

What follows is the unedited conversation, this is verbatim what was said between the two of us. If I can find the audio recording later, I will attach it to the post.  	

*“Do you know much about lucid dreaming, Rami?”* 

 *“I know a little, just that it’s something practiced and allows for complete control of the dream by the dreamer.”* 

He nods before continuing. 

*“There’s a learning curve to it, you need to lie in bed and shut out all outside sounds and impulses. The typical things really, the sensation to scratch your arm, to roll over, to block out the voices.”* 

He stopped and stared at me with fear. *“I didn’t mean to tell you that...”*  	

*“It’s alright, we’ll get to it later, let’s just focus on the why and not the how for the moment. What made you decide to lucid dream in the first place?”* 

 He shifted in his chair and suddenly looked very timid. 

*“I kept seeing him in my dreams, at first he’d just be a random appearance and then he’d start to try and approach me, friendly smile and hand outstretched like he was greeting an old friend. Never threatening or hostile, just attempting to make contact with me. Though he’d never get to. Every single time, i’d be distracted by something at the last second or my dream would veer off in another direction.”*

He shifted in his seat and closed his eyes before continuing. 	

*“I remember in the first few dreams we had, he’d just be lingering in the background. If I was walking through a street, he’d just be standing with the crowd my brain created and not really reacting to anything but me. I’d see him watch me, but then my dream would shift and I guess i’d just ignore it and carry on...after a few weeks, I began getting better at controlling my dreams. I’d start to mess around with the world I was inhabiting, like Inception I guess but more...personal. I’d turn myself into a member of X-Men or i’d go on a date with my perfect woman, y’know...things that you can only dream of, literally...well that’s when he started to become more apparent. I’d usually wake up before he actually got too close, but I’d always remember the look on his face before I did.”* His eyes widened. *“He always looked so angry...”*

*“Former abuse victim?”* I thought, adding it to the list of potential issues and solutions. I didn’t want to stop him while he was on a roll. I nodded to show my attentiveness and he continued. 	

*“I still remember the first time he managed to speak to me. I was in a park i’d visited as a child with my mother. It was a small piece of heaven in London back then, a mental safe haven when things got too stressful I guess. But this was nothing like I remembered it, the trees weren’t trees, they were corpses stacked on top of one another, some overlapping and...meshing with one another in unspeakable positions to form branches. I could feel the atmosphere almost turn to pure disgust as they noticed me, unable to move or even speak to me. But their eyes, their eyes said everything. Because at first they fixated on me with hatred, then quickly away in sheer terror. They’d seen something far more terrifying than the fate they were already suffering...so...I...”* 

His eyes welled up with tears, unblinking as they streamed down his face.  	*“I looked, Rami. I looked and saw him standing some 40 feet away down the path, his head bowed. He wasn’t moving and yet he was. His body was almost...rippling. The closest way I can describe it is the way a signal on a TV channel in the old days used to bend and flicker when the signal was weak. Every time I blinked, he came closer. I tried for the longest time to not blink, really...I did. But the brain betrays your conscious impulses. The more you try to put off a basic function, the more your brain wills you to do it. When he was 10 feet away, he simply vanished. By the time I had registered that he was gone, I heard a whisper in my ear...he was standing right behind me, I could feel his breath on my neck. Rami...it didn’t feel human.”*	

There was an awkward silence, he took in some deep breaths and shuddered. Obviously reliving the memory wasn’t going to be something pleasant for him but...the way he reacted, it was like he truly had experienced this. I stared at him, nodding and silently encouraging him to continue. When he didn’t, I leaned forward and quietly asked him what i’m sure he was waiting me to ask; 	

*“What did he say to you, Milo?”*

Milo shook his head. *“I’m sorry, I don’t remember. That was when the dream ended. I didn’t see him again in my dreams for a while.”*

We talked for a little while longer, mainly about his anxieties in crowds and eye contact, then our time came to an end and we scheduled an appointment for the following week. 

This would be our last session together.  	It was a Monday morning and i’d just come back from a friends wedding, my wife and I had been drinking so by the time I got to the office I was nursing a hangover, my flannel shirt covering the bruises i’d sustained falling over and my best pair of jeans smeared in alcohol. It was a day my mind was not in the work, I suppose. I just wanted to get home and go to sleep.   

 Milo came in earlier than planned, he looked desperate. He was pulling at his hair, biting his fingernails and pacing constantly. It didn’t look like he’d seen any sleep at all. I sent a text to my colleague asking for security to come over as soon as possible. He was going to need to be sectioned for his own safety. How on earth he’d managed to go this long without his friends or fiancee doing something is beyond me.  

*“I remember what he said, Rami. I remember it clearly now.”* He said between pants and more nail biting. 	

*“Okay, Milo. Well why don’t you take a seat and we’ll talk it out?”*

 He ignored that, but stopped pacing and stared intently at me.  	

*“I’ll be right here, always.”* He put his arms around himself, a self defence mechanism when a persons personal space has been violated. 

*“That was what he said. I heard it again and again every time I closed my eyes.”* 	

He started bashing at his temples. *“IT WON’T. FUCKING. STOP.”*  

All I could do at this point was try to keep him talking and calm until security got here. 

 *“Did this make you afraid to dream, Milo?”* 

 He started laughing, his face showing the complete opposite of his vocal expression. Pure incredulity and fear on his face against the guttural sound of his manic laughter.  	*“You don’t get it, do you? He didn’t mean just when I dream. He meant always. Now I know...now I know for sure.”* 	

He took a deep breath in and his demeanour shifted, he suddenly looked like a man almost at peace. Not content but willing to let go.  	

*“Thanks for listening Doc, sharing this with someone was important to me...and to him. He’s going to have his work cut out for him i’m sure.”*

 And just like that, he got up and left. I followed him out, naturally concerned for him. I watched him leave the building and cross the road.  

Then he did something I won’t ever forget. 

 He turned to me, smiling and outstretched his hand, crying openly as a vehicle struck him. I didn’t even see it coming, I was so captivated by his expression.  	

I couldn’t even bring myself to go over to his body, I gave my statement and went straight home. All I could do was look in the mirror, wondering what it was that was bothering me so much about how I looked and why Milo outstretching his hand was so disturbing to me. When I looked at myself, I didn’t see a 6’0 150lb brown coloured hipster. I saw someone troubled, someone who didn’t look like they’d slept much lately, someone like Milo...

I got a phone call from the hospital later on that evening, Milo was in a coma and on life support. He was non-responsive and likely brain dead. His family were choosing to keep his life support on in lieu of their religious and moral views. I think deep down, they just didn’t want to let him go. I’d been asked to go into his apartment with a member of his family to see if there was anything to indicate why he would willingly stand in front of oncoming traffic.

I won’t bore you with the traveling details, but his apartment was surprising. I was half expecting a filthy, run down place filled with half eaten food and human waste given his obsessive and unstable state. Guess I just watched too many detective/horror movies growing up. 

His place was immaculate, everything was extremely clean and organised, he’d already packed up a lot of his material possessions into boxes with names on the front, this was already beginning to look like premeditation. 

He had a desk beside his bed, this was the only place in his room that showed any signs of his lack of sanity rubbing off on his living conditions. Books on demonology, the science of sleeping, DMT, some sleeping pills and a journal. 

His brother went through the boxes while I took a look at the journal (i’ll include photos later if I get permission from the family, names have been changed and anything too personal will of course be blurred out). It initially contained legible, competent insights into his nightly journeys as he began to lucid dream. But as this other entity began to make himself more known and aware, the content shifts and the writing becomes hastily scrawled, certain words appear larger than others, he questions himself on numerous occasions and draws the mans face more frequently as the journal comes to it’s end.  	

The final entry is barely legible, but it details a conversation he had with the man in his dream and that a reminder that he would be with him always.  After this, there is just a single word on the hardback of the journal, rewritten over and over, almost like it’s been carved in. 	

**“DREAM.”**

Which brings us to the final part of this story; the present. I’m sure you’d all love to discover i’m actually cursed or that this story will follow some typical archetype of horror shorts and i’m moments away from death, passing on a final message. But as i’m sure you’re all coming to realise, that is not the case.  	

I just woke up from a lucid dream, i’ve never had one before nor do I know how I had one, but it was definitely a lucid dream. I was able to control my reality, my own physical form and everything around me. It was here I saw Milo. He approached me slowly and before I could even say anything, he asked me a favour;  	

*“Pull the plug, let me die.”*

I was so taken aback that my rational thought process dissipated and for a moment, I wondered...was this perhaps a shared dream? 	

*“I can’t take the torture anymore, Rami. Please tell my family I love them, but I need to be let go.”*

*“It’s okay, you don’t need to suffer anymore in the real world, i’ll do what I can to convince them.”* I croaked, placing a hand on his shoulder. 

Milo’s smile faded.  	

*“I’m not talking about the torture there, Rami. I’m talking about the torture here...without being able to wake up, he has complete control. I’m his new puppet and he wants to play forever. He has no physical form, this is where he resides. This is where he plays.”*  He looked over my shoulder and back at me, with a sad smile on his face.   	*“Now, he’s chosen you as his new playmate. He knows you’re going to take my place. Look at my journal again, look at the drawings, you’ll need to remember.”*

He turned to walk away, leaving me feeling completely helpless in my own lucid dream.  	

*“Oh and Rami...don’t turn around.”*

I didn’t, but my entire being was willing me to. It’s that same feeling of anxiety you get when you’re home alone at night and you have the feeling something is watching you. A crushing, horrifying feeling. I woke up in a cold sweat and did as he said, I looked over the journal and in addition to scanning the drawings, I found a theory Milo had documented in between the pages of his journal; 	

*“An idea is manifested through suggestive stories and cultural signifiers, we can plant ourselves, a character or a concept into our subconscious and our dreams with enough hints both subversive and subliminal. An idea, be it malicious or noble, can grow and manifest in one mind before being shared to the masses through any kind of information supplement.”*  

The second section detailed a supporting theory;  	

*“Within every story told, fictitious or semi-biographical, exists a universe that we have created that is as real as our own. For how can we truly know if our reality is more valid than the one we have created? How can we truly know we have not just been added into a story of our own by a neutral writer we know as “god”? This reality is as malleable and relevant as the one within which we dream. Our dream world or “coma world” it can be argued, are the realities and our concept of reality is but a dream in itself that our brain creates to escape the chaos, uncertainty and pain of our dreams.”*

You’re probably painting a very good picture of what is happening right now.

I’ve attached an image of the man in this story and i’m sure you’re all familiar with him.  If you are, you’ll understand why i’ve done this.  Why i've made you aware.	There is no Ramiel, that name is a subliminal plant in itself, it means “Dreamer” in Arabic. I described him perfectly for you as a defence mechanism against what is going to happen in the coming weeks, months and years. I gave you plenty of physical aspects for your brain to put together, you only know a basic layer of who he is so that your brain can put in the key elements which will make you trust him. 

You know, it's funny, but I found out what Milo meant by ""Dream"", it's an acronym. 

""**D**ream **R**ami **E**vil **A**lways **M**anifests.""

That's where I got the idea for Rami.

He exists now to help fight off *“him”*.  Because now you’ve read this, read my experience and Milo’s, you're aware on a subconscious level...and he needs new playmates.

 This is no warning, that implies you can do something to change it. You can’t, your dreams are his playground, not yours.  	

You can shrug this off as another horror short if you like, if that makes you feel better and sleep easier. But he doesn’t just strike the night you fall asleep, he strikes when you allow your dreams to become more open and easier to mould. He only enters when the reality is in flux.  But with Ramiel in your head now too, you have a guide, a protector, to help you.  I didn’t. 

At least Milo is at peace, hopefully I will be soon too. I've been putting off sleep for days, I can't keep doing it much longer.  

 I’m beginning to feel drowsy, I took a large amount of sleeping pills before writing this last section, I can’t put off sleeping forever. I don’t know whether i’m going to wake up or not, but at least you’ve all been warned about him. Feel free to reverse google image search the hosted image, learn about him and if you do feel a sense of familiarity, please be careful.

Dream of Ramiel, you will be safe. 

I wish you all the best, you might not know my name or my face, but do not forget my story.  I will do my best to answer any of your questions in the comments later. 

Do not forget about him. 

Because believe me, he won’t forget about you when you fall asleep.

The worst thing about all this? I'm not sure ""he"" stays in the dream world anymore. When Milo looked at me, I think I mistook his expression and his gesture. At the time, I thought he was crying and happy, stretching his hand out to shake my hand.

 Now, I think he was terrified to see his worst fears manifested in the real world and he was stretching his hand out to stop ""him"" getting to me in the real world. 

Why say this now? Well, i've been getting steadily drowsier, and I've felt something breathing down my neck for the last 20 minutes. 

Who knows, maybe it's just my paranoia... 

Sweet dreams.

afewsmallrepairs,11,,49,1rff0q,,185,"There's always some chipper real estate agent waiting at the door with her flyers and her too-big smile and her nails painted to match her pants-suit.  They're nosy, and smothering, but today I see that this one is busy with a bright young couple, pointing out how much eastern light the kitchen gets with one perfectly-lacquered finger, the same goddamn shade of melon-red as her smart little blazer.  I still take a flyer from the cheery wicker basket in the front hallway, out of politeness more than anything.

The house smells like cookies.  It's an old realtor trick; make someone think that they could be happy in this strange new place, picture yourself cozied up on the couch with a plate of fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies and a mug of hot cocoa and suddenly the price doesn't seem quite so steep.  People want to feel like they're home.

It's a candle, I think.  Smells sour-sweet and artificial.

I realize suddenly I've been standing alone in the foyer for a few minutes, staring aimlessly into the house.  Where to begin?  The living room, I guess.

There's a big ugly faux-leather couch along one wall.  The cheap kind you find at Big Lots.  It doesn't serve much except to fill up the space.  It's flanked by two particle board end tables, little doilies on top of these.  Miss Melon-Red Blazer doesn't have much of a sense of style if this is her handiwork.  The room looks like a scene straight out of a 1980s Sears catalog.  I can feel one of my headaches coming on like the low rumbling of summer thunder on the horizon.

There are little dimples on the walls, paint covering old nail holes left behind from family photos that once hung there.  Scenes of summer vacations, children playing, smiling happy faces.  You only put up pictures if the people in them are smiling, right?

Well, the realtor hasn't put up any pictures.  The room feels empty, skeletal without them.

I move into the bathroom.  Nothing special here, more mementos from Walmart in the form of a seashell-shaped soap dish and a tacky plastic shower curtain, but I've found the cookie-scented candle so I blow it out with deep sense of satisfaction.

There are two bedrooms.  One at each end of the hall.  I choose the one to my right, feeling faintly like Alice in Wonderland as the real estate agent babbles away in the sunny kitchen's eastern light.

It's a small bedroom.  The baseboards look brand new even though the house is several decades old; whoever replaced them was an amateur.  This looks like a shitty piecemeal job done by someone without nearly enough time or care.  It's a shame, is what it is.  This would all have to be redone.

They've set up this room as a home office but it should be the children's bedroom.  Where the thrift-store desk and bookshelf sit I can picture two tiny pink beds with matching flowery comforters, sweet shiny stickers placed haphazardly across each headboard as little girls sometimes do.

The headache is no longer approaching, it's *here,* spidery sensations of dull pain spreading across my brain.  I tap my knuckles against the space between my eyes but it holds fast.

Focus.  I brace myself against the doorframe and there it is, the telltale trace of someone's childhood, tiny little tic-marks carved in the wood to indicate height and its progression through time.  I run my fingertips along these marks, still so visible through the fresh coat of paint.  It even looks like someone tried to sand them off -- who would *do* something like that?  Who would try to erase the remnants of someone's *life?*

If I don't leave I might faint, all the blood is in my head with the headache so I do leave, I move down the hall to the other room.

This one is the master bedroom.  Looks like they couldn't afford a bed to properly stage the scene, so this one feels even emptier than the den.  The walls have been repainted, a cheerful robin's-egg blue, but it's wrong.  It's all wrong.

They did a fantastic job covering any sign of the fire but this color, I *hate* this color, it clashes with my bedspread and I would've never slept here beneath this hideous shade of blue -- though there were many nights I suppose I didn't sleep, I lay awake for hours trying to comprehend what had gone wrong, where he was and why he thought he could fool me.

I drop to a knee to touch the outlet in the wall.  It's new, of course, they would've had to replace it.  Faulty wiring that causes fires, well, that just wouldn't do.  When the bank takes a house it can't sell one with such a serious problem.  Sometimes things need to be replaced, resold.  A “fixer-upper”, that’s what they’d call it.

The headache is in full force now yet a small smile tugs at the corner of my mouth when I remember everything he'd promised to do to this damned house, all the little projects he swore up and down he'd finish someday to make this place perfect for me, things that went forgotten when he decided his energy would be better spent fucking any secretary at the office that looked his way.

It wasn't hard.  I went to the library two counties over and did research on arson.  I was careful, used the private browser on Google Chrome and still cleared the history, wore a wig.  I'd seen enough about Casey Anthony to know how careful you have to be, even if she *did* get off -- but no one will ever truly believe she was innocent, she'll be a pariah forever and that's simply not how I planned to live the rest of my life.

I'm really sorry about the children.  My daughters.  I truly am.  I didn't know they'd be in our bed that night.  They were supposed to be at a friend's house but they came home early, someone had pulled someone else's hair and that set everything off like a line of terrible fateful dominoes and the headaches were getting worse and it was probably all for the best anyway.  I didn't do anything that couldn't be fixed with a few small repairs, both to the house and my life.

It makes me so *angry.*  He was still acting like father of the year when every night for months he slipped under the sheets beside me, reeking of some other woman's sex?  He couldn't even bother to take a shower and rinse the stink off his dick but he was still being a model dad, letting our daughters snuggle next to him when the boogeyman came in the dark and mommy wasn't there because she was away at her own mommy's, the perfect alibi for when the police came to tell her I'm sorry ma'am, there's been an accident, could you please come with us?

I'm still crouched next to the outlet when I hear Miss Melon-Red Blazer behind me, inquiring politely if there's anything she can help me with.  The bright young couple has gone and it smells like she's relit the candle in the bathroom.

I straighten, tucking a strand of the long blonde wig behind my ear and smiling in the way that makes members of the service industry smile back at me.

I explain I'm just looking.  The price on the house is so *low,* though, what could possibly cause such a dramatic drop in this recovering economy?

The real estate agent's smile falters and she hesitates.  I know she's bound by law to tell me, to explain what happened here and why the pricetag on a little creampuff in a nice neighborhood is next to nothing.

I know the old saying about returning to the scene of the crime, how dangerous it is and how not careful I'm being right now, but something in me can't resist because I can still see the little matching beds, the stickers across the headboards and the tic-marks on the doorframe and something inside me *needs* to hear her say it, to quantify each and every step I took to get here.

""Well,"" she says slowly, ""about a year ago, there was a fire...""

I nod and smile and as she tells me my story in her own words and somewhere in the back of my skull the headache lets go, the pain in my brain dissipating at last, leaving behind just me and the real estate agent in my old bedroom, standing in the same place where about a year ago my plan went into motion and I set my husband and children aflame.

lynzo,20,,67,1r79t5,,179,"Through years of failed attempts to have my own kids, I yearned for children of my own, well, used to. 

I would travel for hours just to baby-sit my nephews while Helen (my sister) goes for their fortnightly romantic dinners to ""keep the flames of passion going"", in her words.

Playgrounds and parks were my favourite hunts. Toddlers old enough to walk would sometimes totter their way to the bench I'm sitting on just to smile at me. Young children would come up to me and play 'pretend' with me. It's quite a strange phenomenon, but without my trying to, children takes a liking to me. Of course, I'd gotten strange looks from parents, as though I dangled a carrot in front of their children's noses to lure them to me. There were carrots, but just not fr.

I met my BF, Luke, (now husband) some years ago. In the beginning stages of courtship, he would just look at me and smile, and I just thought he was just smitten with me. He's gotten me smitten quickly enough too, with his honeyed tongue. He always seem to know the right things to say. He'd still continue to look at me, and then just smile.

It was only some months into our relationship that I found out he could see spirits. His childhood was shaky when he first realised no one else saw the paler beings. He had since gotten used to them as they would either wander aimlessly or just stay rooted to a spot. Apart from seemingly looking at him, they don't try to communicate with him.

One day, a few months after finding out about his ability, he told me he has something to tell me. For one, he isn't the secretive or romantic type so I guessed it wasn't to propose. He held my hands and looked at me straight in the eye, and said, ""Umm... How should I put this..."" After a few false starts, impatient me started losing my cool and he finally got it out, in the crudest way he could put it (I know I deserved it), 


""You have three little ones following you since the day I met you and that's the reason why I looked your way and smiled at you. I've been wondering, but why are they following you?""


He went on, with a matter-of-factly tone, to explain that the children at the playground were not approaching me, but the little ones following and sometimes playing around me, and that the little ones aren't like the usual spirits he have seen but are much smaller (thus the name ""little ones""). Whenever he just looked and then smiled at me, the little ones were playing with each other and dancing around me. He had never seen other beings interact with one another before. Despite it being a hot day, the chills and the cold in my chest made the weather more bearable.

Before this, I had a failed relationship with a man who loves children as much as I did, but just upped and left, the day after I was discharged from the hospital for my third miscarriage.

horriddaydream,16,,65,1r68c5,,177,"My father always taught me to be kind to everyone.

There was this garbage dump close to my home; I can't say anybody got a thrill out of living closely to the wretched thing, for it stunk all to Hell and the trucks constantly entering and exiting could be an extreme annoyance. I walked on the outskirts of town frequently past midnight, which you may say is stupid, especially if you saw my build and how small of a person I am, and just how difficult it would be for me to protect myself from anyone. 

A few times as I passed by the always-opened gates of the dump, I also passed the man who would enter their limits every single night.

As shady as he was, he had a lot to say.

His name was Terrance and he had been staying in the dump at night ever since it had opened back in 1980. He had long, straggly hair and he claimed that ""this area was just too dry; the job shortage was unbelievable."" He would probably never have his own house. I felt the upmost of pity for him and sometimes I even welcomed him to walk with me. Everybody always seemed to know Terrance. He was like the friendly neighborhood hobo. They would nod to him, wave, give him a few dollars, thank me for being so kind to him even though I would shrug it off and whisper that he was simply good company. 

I asked him where he went during the day and he just said ""everywhere."" He had a huge, black satchel that he slung over his back that probably contained normal homeless materials like paper towels, maybe a few little scraps of food. It always smelled but he smelled in general, though I was too nice to say anything. He claimed that there was a hollowed-out truck near the far side of the garbage dump and he would stay there at night because it was warm, and it was shelter. 

It made me want to cry; just the situation that this poor man was in.

I lived with only my father and so on occasion I would invite Terrance home to have a warm meal, and my father was more than happy about this. He was a kind man as I was a kind young adult, and he completely understood that my heart was in the right place. Terrance knew everything about our family in only a short amount of time and he never once took advantage of us. He was just a man who had no direction after losing his way.

Terrance disappeared for a couple of days. I peered in through the gates of the garbage dump, thinking twice about entering. 

I walked to the back and noticed that there was nobody inside the shell of the truck that he had described to me a many of times. But as I peeked inside the windows, I saw many black satchels just like the one that Terrance was always carrying. Most of them were empty, but others were still shut tightly and looked full. 
I reported the scene.

The cops had found small children of all shapes, sizes, ages, and genders inside the bags. He had been living off of them for years. 

There was a lack of missing children in the area, though some were found to be local. Nobody knew where they had all come from.

He had been inside our house. He had been inside my head.

Now he was nowhere to be found.

horriddaydream,15,,57,1razjr,,151,"A new job with a bad boss with very little pay with customers that I didn't really like. 

That was the make-up of my new job at the bookstore.

We were called ""The Book Chefs"", a little shop on the corner of 6th &amp; Weston Street, whose name I didn't quite understand aside from the fact that, as employees, we were permitted to prance around in these aprons that wore the name of the store, and help customers find the books that they were seeking.

One day as I was stocking the shelves I felt a tug at the back of my apron and I smiled as I whipped around, figuring it was probably one of the other employees attempting to get my attention so they could tell me a funny workplace joke.

There stood a man in front of me, short, hunched, with thick glasses and a balding head - and he appeared to be mentally challenged. ""Hi, Pretty.""

""Uh…"" I caught myself, wondering if I should say hello and ask him what he needed, or respond to his compliment. ""Are you looking for anything in particular, sir?""

""You're pretty,"" he snorted again and then he walked out of the aisle, never taking his eyes off of me. It took a few seconds for me to process the fact that he had walked out of the aisle completely backwards. I watched him walk from aisle to aisle and he watched me, too. A half an hour later and he still hadn't left.

I did what any normal person would do; I told my boss at the back of the store.

The conversation was short and sweet. My boss picked up on the fact that the man was a bit slower, and she reasonably questioned him, ""Are you with somebody, sir?"" He said, ""No, I am by myself"" and she said, ""Are you looking for anything?"" ""No."" ""I'm sorry but you can't stay here all day. If you don't need anything, would you mind leaving?"" 

He crept out of the store, backwards again, and he gave me a wave as he disappeared around the corner. I felt barf in my throat.

That night as I got off of work, my eyes darted all over the back parking lot as I went to fetch my bicycle from the rack. My boss was arranging things inside the building but there were no windows along the back and so suddenly I felt eerily alone. It didn't take long for me to notice that somebody had cut the wires where my bike was located, and it was missing. I groaned and felt the urge to cry. That was a brand new bike and now I had no way home. I immediately panicked and decided that I would have to ask my boss for a ride. She was in the backroom, so I strode over to the door and began to rap on it slowly.

""Janet?"" I asked, hoping she would hear me from inside. Then, louder again. ""Janet!!""

The sound of my bike spokes being kicked could be heard from the woods behind the bookstore. My head jerked around and there stood the man from earlier. 

My heart sank in my stomach.

""Don't come near me.""

He took a few zig-zaggy steps in my direction, holding a small bag out in front of him as he worked his way across from the parking lot. It took him quite a few seconds to get to me from where he had been located and I froze in place as he came within feet of me. 

""I want to show you something,"" he said in his slow, soft voice.

""Please go away.""

He placed his hand inside his brown, leather bag and pulled out a book. Then he pulled out another. He stacked them on the ground next to himself and he nodded toward them. ""I like books.""

I played friendly, afraid he would hurt me if I didn't. ""What series is that?""

""Skin,"" he replied.

He grabbed one of the books off of the pile, and he neared me until he was within such a close distance that I could feel his breath on the front of my face. Then, he shoved the book into my hands.

It was still warm.

It was bound with human skin, stitched with real stitches, still bloody and damp.

My terrorizing screams had scared him away. I'm not sure that they ever found him. 

He had left one of the books in the parking lot in his quick getaway. There were no words written on the pages, but the police suspected that he had been using them as journals.

Odyssey_The_Crip,45,,47,1r4dm5,,150,"Fuck me.
I was told to come here by a friend of mine, having never heard of nosleep. personally I'm not really on board with the idea of having a community of people read my story for personal pleasure, but hey, what ever. 
I guess a little bit of back story is needed here. I live on the nice end of Vancouver city, with my grandmother. I'm in secondary school, and that school is in my general posh-ish neighborhood.  

2 days ago I was Getting home from a long-ass boring day at school, I decided to Fuck around on DayZ until either I died, or fell asleep at the keyboard. At around 11:30 my Dog, Buddy, Decided to be the most annoying little shit possible. So i turned my computer off, and put the little fucker's leash on. At this time of night, the whole block was lights out. I Could barely see 15 feet.
10 minutes of walking later I began to feel a bit paranoid, street light's were flickering, fog was getting thicker. Buddy, on the other hand, was  trotting along rubbing his little schnauzer face in the frosted grass. 
Then, he stopped. Dead in his tracks, then buried his head in my calves. I urged him to keep moving, and after much encouragement he reluctantly followed.
I rounded a corner, going back toward my place, when i spotted a figure in the fog, a big one. Thinking nothing of the fact, just someone else enjoying the fucking weather or something. 
As we got closer buddy started barking, crazily. I urged him to shut up, lest he wake the neighbors. 
Then I got a good look at the figure. It was a man, 6'7 about, pale, He had a brown tweed waist coat, a brown tweed fedora and some brown baggy suit pants. 

As we neared him Buddy grew more and more frantic.
That's when I noticed his smile. The scariest fucking smile you will ever see. He looked like he won the lottery, got laid and inherited a mansion within a period of 2 minutes. It stretched from ear to ear, a yellowed, fake smile.
God, i wish i could have unseen it.
I was within about 3 feet of him, then the smell hit me, It was a mix between pure decay, shit, aged cheese. 

Then, he stopped right in front of me. and said in the most strange voice, like an elderly man trying to be smooth.

""You have a cute dog there, boy.""

""Uh, yeah, thanks.""
I guess something in my voice must have pleased him. or something, cause he chuckled a sick, smokers laugh. I began to move away from him breaking eye contact. Looking back on it, I should have just fucking ran.

He grabbed my arm

""Do you want to see my dog?""
I looked down, and i realized he had a leash too. He yanked on it, and trailing blood, Came the corpse of a maggot riddled dog.
I threw up in my mouth, This thing that was once a dog was missing patches of white fur, it's skin was turning green, bits of skin were missing, it's ear was ripped and an eye was gone. I couldn't even tell what the dog's fucking breed was.

Through his smiling teeth he said.

""Pet the dog""

My dog was oddly quite this whole time,i missed his barking.
I tried to get away, he tightened his grip on my arm then he dug his finger nails into me.

""Pet the dog""

""Please, No"" was all that came out of my mouth.
His smile drained instantly. Into an angry twisted frown, teeth still showing. 

""PET THE FUCKING DOG"" He screamed. yellow spittle flying from his mouth. my arm was turning red from the irritation his brown fingernails were causing me.
I had no choice but to pet the dog. I reached down slowly and ran my free hand along its back. The fur and skin began to peel back as maggots crawled along my palm. My hand was covered in a clear, slimy film. 
He let go of my arm, then shoved me. I landed flat on my ass on the pavement, Then i took off running. My dog was sprinting along with me. Then i heard him laugh, then scream.

""NOW I WANT TO PET YOUR DOG.""

My blood went cold.

I heard pounding on the pavement behind me, and a dragging. 
He was coming after me, pulling his dog along with him. Running 2 straight blocks, i ran down my alleyway, my house was at the end of the block. I flew down the alley, still hearing his laughter and slamming footsteps behind me. I got to my house, ran up the stairs and fumbled for my house keys. As His laughter grew in volume to an unbearable height, i got the door open shoved my dog in then slammed it, and locked it. not even a full second after I locked the door, there was a slam on it. 

He had ran into the door. 

This slamming continued for 20 minutes and then, silence. I waited 5 minutes then called the cops. in less than 10 minutes, they were here. I told them exactly that what happened, they told me they'd book the guy. Until then they told me not to leave the house.

not 5 minutes after they left, i was asleep on the couch with my dog.
I was awoken to the sound of a door bell ringing. I practically jumped off the couch, ran into the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife, and went to the door. thinking to myself, 

""I'm gonna kill this bastard.""

I Flung open the door knife in stabbing motion.
No one was there, Nobody.
Then I looked down, And threw up. 
The fucking dog corpse was sitting there, in a pool of blood.
Nailed into the dog's head was a note

""I don't like it when they run.""

Right now I'm sitting in my house, With no one but my grandmother, who is too sickly to get out of bed. My parents and my little brother are out of town at a dude ranch in the interior of the province. 
Fuck dammit.

EDIT: I'm sorry if there's any spelling mistakes, grammar errors, or punctuation issues. I'm shaking right now

UPDATE: He was standing outside my window today. just standing there, unblinking. i was frozen, and a minute after still eye contact, his head started violently shaking. Like only that part was having a seizure. I ran to grab my camera and he was gone. That spasm his head was having, paired with the smile. was utterly terrifying.

acidmutt,40,,38,1r1qip,,136,"I have a problem and a fear, I fear I am not from here or am even human. 


Ill start with the basics and excuse me for spelling mishaps for I am writing this out via mobile device. I am supposedly a eighteen year old female. Currently living in Canada, although I hail from Debrecen, Hungary. I moved to Canada when I was ten years old. For as long as I can remember I have questioned what I am. Certain signs have always been there. I feel things I'm sure others do but most don't, I see things and I talk to things. 


First weird occurrence, I do not remember life in Hungary at all. I only remember from the age of ten and up. It feels like I've only been alive for eight years. Second I don't know where my parents are. I lived with a woman named Tina and a man named Marco since I moved to Canada up until I moved out a couple months ago. They tell me they adopted me, and that my Hungarian parents went missing and were never found. 


I feel cold all the fucking time. My feet and hands always feel like ice blocks, to the point where my boyfriend can't take the chills he gets when I put my hands around him at night. In the summer even on the hottest days I am always wearing a sweater and avoiding the shade. I love the sunshine. In the winter months it is ten times worse. I can feel my bones aching from being so cold. 


I can't swim, I float but I can't swim or ride a bike. People are either left handed or right handed, I am niether. I can't write worth shit with either of my hands. I try to only eat food I don't have to use silverware for. 


A polar bear follows me. I see him everywhere I go, tried to touch him once but he disintegrated into the air. I see dark figures that roam the streets at night, I see people in my mirrors that aren't there when I look behind me. I've gotten so used to seeing things I'm not even scared anymore. A few have spoken to me, they mainly ask for help. I helped one once but he burned me. 


I feel pain, and I bleed though. I pass out when I hold my breath, I have emotions. I look normal I think. Sorry for the male readers, I don't bleed once a month like I'm supposed to. I don't even have the organs I am supposed to, to reproduce. I have baffled x-ray techs and doctors everywhere. 


My dog not only hears me but he understands what I am saying. He can do all his tricks without hand motions, just my voice. No big? When my boyfriend tries to get him to do a trick just by speaking to him he doesn't know what to do until my boyfriend gestures along with the words. Tina and Marco tell me Oz (my dog) has been with me since and during Hungary. 


I've gone a week without food before I started feeling light headed all the time and gained hunger pains. I didn't lose any weight, I never do. And I never gain any. My teeth were so sharp they used to cut into my cheeks and cause discomfort, but last year the dentist filed them down for me. Baffled. 


I don't think I can see as well as a cat can in the dark but deffintly better then most other people. I've never had friends, people have always avoided me or left me out of activities. 


Tina is a ethologist and Marco is a paleontologist as their professions, why can't I remember.

Sleepwalking_t,34,,55,1r7w1t,,131,"I have been having sleeping problems for about 6 months now. I have troubles falling asleep and staying asleep. I also have issues with sleep walking, serious sleep walking issues. I live in a dorm, on the first floor, and right outside my dorm across the street is the smoke pit for my area. I once woke up sitting at the smoke pit in my pajamas sitting on the picnic table with my elbows on my knees, face in hands.

 
Please, hear me out, I know this doesn't seem supernatural, but I'm terrified and I don't know who to tell. I am going to continue with my sleep walking issues. 
I will not get into specifics on where I was but let's just say I was not in an area you would want to walk around alone at night. It was a community sleeping area, massive tent and I woke up sore, bruised, and covered in dirt. I figured I must have slept walked outside and fallen down. I have woken up standing in the middle of my dorm room, woken up sitting up right on my couch when I had fallen asleep in my bed. 


A few months ago I could not sleep for 2 days straight; no sleeping aids or cold medicine would work. Frustrated, I finally made a doctors appointment for my sleeping problems. I left out my sleep walking because I could loose my job if they knew I slept walked, and was prescribed Ambein. 
The first night on Ambein I still had troubles getting to sleep but they finally kicked in after an hour or so laying in bed. I woke up refreshed but a bit groggy, and got dressed for work. 


The next night on Ambein the pills kicked in quickly and I had , what I thought , to be a deep dreamless sleep. When I got into work my co worker laughingly asked me what the hell I called him for last night. 


"" What are you talking about?"" 


"" You called me last night, crying hysterically."" 


""What?!""


"" Yeah... I was about to get dressed and come over to check on you. You said , ' It's here Myke, it's here!'. Then you started snoring sooo... yeah figured you were just dreaming...""


Completely bewildered I apologized. I checked my call history and sure as shit, I had called him at 0447. 


Strange. I just played it off as a side effect of the Ambein. 
A few weeks went by and nothing else strange happened. I continued to take the Ambein. 


Sometime during the work day I went to show another co worker a funny picture I had saved on my phone when I noticed I had a lot of black photos on my camera roll. I selected the first one and it was my  dark room lit up from the flash. The next one of a different part of my room again lit up by the flash. This went on for 12 different photos: different parts of my room, dark, lit up from the flash. I downloaded an app so I could see the time stamp from the photos. I was definitely asleep; great, sleep me was taking pictures in my sleep.

 
I have started waking up with bruises, cuts, and feeling sore for no particular reason. 


I was staying the night at my guy's house and he told me the next morning  I sat up out of bed and asked him: 


""Do you see it?"" 


""See what?""

 
Silence from me, then I laid back down.

 
He jokingly told me that was the last night he would sleep with me. We laughed but I felt terrible creeping the hell out of the poor guy. 


It's escalating, Ive started seeing things when I'm awake. I see a black form walking into my bathroom while I'm getting ready in the morning. I ignore it, there is no way in hell I'm going to investigate that. Things disappear from my room then show up in the same spot days later. 


I don't know what to do. Please, if you have any advice I'm willing to try anything.

Magnum6,33,,77,1r5par,,129,"Born in the mid 90s, i grew up active, and was outdoors alot. However, as the technological age began, I found myself inside more and more. As I grew, i spent more and more time watching T.V., playing videogames on my Super Nintendo. And when the Sony Playstation came out, my parents couldnt pry me from the screen. As a consequence, my eyesight suffered. Slowly at first, but as i got older, it became an issue. It was never so bad that I couldn't see without glasses, but it was bad enough that i needed them to drive when i turned 17. However, as senior in high school i quickly lost my glasses and proceeded to drive anyways. No wrecks, no tickets. I thought that maybe my eyesight had improved over the few months that i had actually worn my glasses. Oh how I wish I had been right. Halfway between being 19 and 20, i picked up a job as a delivery driver. Easy at first. Until i had to start driving at night. The night I almost ran off the road because I couldn't see through the oncoming cars headlights, was the night I knew I had to get a new pair of glasses. The next day I made an appointment, and 7 - 10 business days later i had my new glasses. Nothing special. Just a simple blue metal frame with slightly skinnier than average lenses. I Wore them all day. And whenever someone asked how it felt to have new glasses, i smiled and would comically sing ""It's a whole new world"", you know, that cute little song from The Little Mermaid. Oh how right i was. As I prepared for bed that night, getting changed, taking a shower. It all seemed normal. Until I wore my glasses into my darkened bedroom. No light was on in my room. And i had foolishly turned off the hallway light before entering my bedroom. Now in total darkness, I realized just what real fear was. You see, with my slightly blurred vision of not wearing glasses, any shadow could be brushed off, simply because i couldn't focus and see what was just beyond the outer veil of darkness that covered them. But now, with those infernal glasses. I could see them clear as day. The creatures from monster stories. My own personal Boogiemen. All sitting around my room watching, waiting, inviting me to lay down and fall asleep right in their midst. Right in my own bed. I stood stunned. Terrified. Not Knowing what to do. When suddenly, one of them spoke. The most terrifying voice I had ever heard. ""Why not run away again child? It amuses us to watch you at night, oblivious to our very existence. Unaware that you lay right where we want you. Each and every night."" I stared blankly, and felt confused. Again? How could i have seen these creatures before and not remember it. Surely I would have some memory. But none came. As if to answer my question, it spoke again. ""Perhaps these will jog your memory."" It brought up its gnarled hand and un-clenched its fist, palm up, to reveal my original pair of glasses. A pair now almost three years old. That's when it hit me. I hadn't lost my glasses. But thrown them away. Into a river. Nearly twenty miles from where i lived. Now more afraid than anything, I did the only thing I could, I laid down in my bed. Removed my glasses, and watched as those terrible Boogiemen, again returned into those empty, featureless shadows, that surround each and every one of us every night as we lay down to sleep.",Glasses,206,nosleep
Dusteratops,14,,29,1r8rf4,,125,"It was a long day of work, and my face was covered in oil and grease of all sorts. I suppose I looked like a coal miner or a hobo as I walked down the road. It was evening, so the crowd wasn't too large. There were groups of ladies, making their way home and spouting the latest gossip. There were solitary people making their way with their head down and their ears plugged in. There was a peculiar man walking adjacent to me with the strangest clothes and a mullet. He wore a robe with a sweater tied around his waste. Then there was Rachel, ahead in the distance. She was my ex-girlfriend who didn't know how to cope with seeing me, so it always turned out extremely awkward. I immediately turned around and talked to the first man I could start a conversation with, who just happened to be the man in the robe. 

""Hey.""

""Hey..""

""Whats up."" 

""Just walking around. So you like to read?"" He spoke in the thickest accent, and I couldn't figure out exactly what is was.

I was carrying a book, and I do like to read. ""I suppose so, I want to be a writer."" I replied, and then we jumped into the thickest conversation about all of our favorite books and the way the world works. He was able to question all of my ideas, and had a detailed answer for each and every one of my questions. Its safe to say I learned a lot from him. 

When Rachel walked by, she simply waved and smiled. I nodded back, but I couldn't help but notice that she felt like something was funny. It must have been the dirtiness of my face though this weird secret humor just continued to resonate off the face of every passerby. It was unsettling.

Mid conversation he asked me what my name was, without even breaking from the previous sentence. I told him my name and reached out my hand to shake. He left me hanging and slammed his palm into his chest and proudly proclaimed ""I am Moko."" 

Then we jumped right back into our conversation, which went on for quite some time. The sky became dark, and we were the only people in the road. I asked him where he was from and he never told me. 

A large chunk of our conversation was about sanity, and the works of the insane. He seemed to know everything about them, and it was unsettling the way his knowing black eyes drilled into my soul. Yet I learned and thought and learned some more. 

He pulled out a napkin and refused the pen that I offered him. He wrote down my number after searching for his marker for about a minute. He promised to give me a call when he got home, for he did not have a cellular. Then we went our separate ways. Oddly though, he went back the way he came. 

There were two girls laughing when we split apart, and I figured it was because of the thick accent my new friend had when he yelled his farewell. 

""He has a funny accent, doesn't he?"" I asked the two girls.

They responded by looking at each other and laughing to some secret joke, then one of them said, ""Who does?""

""You know, that man with the mullet I was just talking to.."" they gave each other another look, but it was without humor. The skin on my neck began to stand on end. They walked away.

I know he has a loud voice. I know they heard and saw him leave. I know I am not crazy. I know- My phone rang. I answered.

She snuck into a decrepit old house where she had arranged the meeting. She walked into a pitch black room where someone placed a bag over her head. He said something about not wanting to know each other's identities.

She wondered why someone would want to do this, and finally worked up the courage to ask. 

""I don't know... It soothes me. Knowing that I'm saving a child from facing this shit sack of a world. No one should have to suffer this hell hole.""

She didn't really know what to say so she just stayed silent.

At times I would wake up, groggy and sensitive to the sound so I would stop the music and go back to sleep. Two nights ago however, what I woke up to was not music.

___________________________________________________________________________________

Sunday night, maybe 2am.

I had just shut down my computer after my nightly gaming session.  I was laying in bed, browsing reddit on my phone, and debating whether or not I was hungry enough to eat another can of spaghettio's, or if it would even be worth the trouble of walking downstairs and waiting for it to heat up. I'm not sure what made me notice it, what actually snapped my senses to the realization...but it was suddenly too **quiet**.

Granted it was 2am, so its not like I was expecting any sort of noise in particular.  My roommate had fallen asleep hours ago, but it was just so *still*.  I'm not sure if any of you know what I'm talking about, but it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  I felt like I was in a vacuum; it was utterly oppressive. 

I'm not sure how long I sat there, waiting for something, before the glow.  A deep blood red light had flooded the hall and oozed under my door, and it was slowly pulsing.  I wanted to call out, to tell my roommate to fuck off, but I knew it wasn't him. I just knew. I don't think I could've formed words if I tried.  The vacuum sensation I had felt was gone, and now, sitting in my tiny bedroom I felt like I was under a microscope. That terrible “like you're being watched” sensation I read about so much hit me like a brick.  I can't explain how exactly I felt, a mix of horror, dread, and confusion.  I wanted to bolt, but I wouldn't have been able to force myself to open that door if I tried.

I managed to shuffle off my bed, and to the floor.  I opened up my nightstand, reaching for my revolver. I needed to feel that cold steel, and the heft of it in my hand. As soon as I picked it up, I was at a loss because for the first time, it just felt like a toy in my hand. I looked back to the door to that glow, and felt completely powerless.  There was a shadow now, someone was standing outside my bedroom door, and I felt like I might as well have been holding a nerf gun.  

When the long scratch started, I felt nauseous.  Like I was 17 again, smoking weed in my room when I thought I had the house to myself and my mom knocked on the door asking why the fuck it smelled like burning leaves in the hall. That sudden weight in my stomach, the sudden dryness in my mouth.

It was like a nail being dragged down the door, from the top of the doorway to the bottom.  I followed the sound with my eyes, and when it stopped, I heard a voice.  “Hear” might not be the right word, because it came from inside my head.

*Michael. Please put down the weapon.  We do not want to harm you, and I do not plan on doing so. Your weapon would be useless anyways, but I respect your autonomy. May I enter?*

This had to be a dream; a nightmare. If every waking moment since I...heard that voice hasn't been an eternity in a waking hell, I might be able to convince myself that it was.

*I wish to speak with you, Michael. We have much to discuss. May I enter?*

There was no fucking way this was happening.  I'm...lucky I didn't need to, because I couldn't have spoken if I tried.  Whatever it was must have known there was no way I would have let it in, because it answered me anyways.

*No matter, you will see us in due time.  We would like to invite you on a journey, Michael.  You will come with us, and see everything you have always wished to. We've known you for a long time, you would say “years”.  You have a week to decide, we will not force you. You will require no luggage, no currency. You will want for nothing.  You will not see your family or friends again, but in time you will cease to worry about them.*  

 *We respect your decisions. I do think however, you only have one real choice.  I will see you soon.*

Then it was all just over...I might have sat there for hours. At some point, I got up and sat on my bed.  When I finally mustered the courage to look out the window, it was already dawn. When I heard my roommate get up and go to work, and finally figured it was safe to open my door.

I am a shell.  I don't know what to do you guys.  I haven't slept. I forced myself to eat something yesterday, but everything tastes of cardboard.  I booted up my computer, but now my *life* just feels like a game I'm sick of. 

I forced myself to talk to my parents the other day, and smile at work, but any interaction I have feels forced and artificial...like I'm just going through the motions. There was no way I could mention what happened Sunday night to anyone. 

He was right...I have only have one choice.  If I don't go with him...with *them*, I'll be trapped in this empty hell. My life feels like a hamster in a cage.

Who the fuck knows what will happen if I **do** go with them...?

kimmiekissies,13,,30,1rgt5c,,119,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before????????? Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out, and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her. I'm kind freaked out now, I'll admit it. [Here it is](http://soundcloud.com/user165636719/a0ynmqy5tete/s-jECMW)",UPDATE!!! Need some advice.

ephique,32,,31,1r5tqd,,93,"Me and my brother were spending some quality time playing old video games from our childhood, just chilling on the couch in my upstairs bedroom when the electricity in the entire house went out. It was just us two home at this point, and it was pitch black outside. In desperation of finding our way through the house we used our phones to take flash-shots, giving us a small update of where in the big upstairs level of the house we were; trying to make our way to the staircase leading down.

We finally did, and from there it wasn't ridiculously hard to manage ourselves to find some candles and what not. We did what we could to drain out the time while waiting out the electricity-problem. Eating sausage rolls, gossiping and having conversations about what games to play once the electricity was back.

It did come back after a couple of hours. We already found ourselves in the kitchen, positioned in the lower level of the house so we brought some snacks and drinks before we inevitably decided to continue our journeys into Donkey Kong: Country, Super Mario World and Castlevania 4 on the Super Nintendo.

Upon starting our Super Nintendo my brother asked me where the remote for the tv was, since we both were too lazy to actually use the power button on the tv. Although the remote was nowhere to be found. While looking for the remote, which we both swore has never been anywhere else than on the coffee-table next to the couch, the electricity ran out again.

My brother expressed as he sighed: ""Oh come on, are you kidding me?"" Being slightly more prepared the second time, we picked up our phones and started taking flash-shots again. After a couple of shots the memory on my phone ran out. I never thought we had taken that many pictures. Either way I entered my image library on my phone to delete the old photos from the first time the electricity went out. I took a good look at the first picture I opened, it was my brother walking ahead of me, just before we reached the stairs.

slightly2spooked,45,,21,1re11f,,90,"NoSleep, I need your help. 

Where do I begin? I started working volunteer shifts at my local community centre about 6 months ago. I love my job, I get on well with all my co-workers, but something's been bothering me recently. More than bothering me, actually. 

There's been an attack on a child. 

Well - I can't call it an attack, exactly. Everyone's calling it an accident, but I can't believe that. 

Let me start over. This whole thing began when the centre began to hold saturday clubs - an hour or two, every weekend, when kids are given pretty much free reign over the place. We put on activities - cake baking, crafts, that kind of thing - and just generally keep an eye on the place.

We're also there to keep the kids out of the basement. I'd like to say before I start that I've never heard of anything being up with the basement before. I'm not a particularly superstitious person (or at least, I wasn't before all of this happened) and I don't scare easy. 

Basically, the kids have to stay out of the basement because there's a lot of junk down there that could topple over onto one of them, or otherwise get them in trouble. Just to reiterate, this is the only reason I was ever given for keeping them out of the basement.

But kids aren't satisfied by a simple 'it's dangerous down there'. They wanted to know *why*. 

Well, I spun them this cock and bull story about how I'd seen a monster down there once. The other volunteer that day, Julie, joined in on the fun immediately, and soon we had them all believing that there was something dark and horrible in the basement that would snatch them up and eat them if they ever went down there. We're talking about 5-10 year olds here, so the stories weren't particularly gory or scary - but they believed us pretty much right off the bat. 

Maybe that's why things went so weird. I'm sure those of you who've been around children know that they see the world in a different way to the rest of us - what seems to us like childish fantasy might as well be real life to them. 

Anyway. I told them that story three or four weeks before the incident. Every Saturday we'd have these kids in, and every Saturday the veteran members of the group would take on the duty of informing the new members of what horrific fate awaited them should they wander into the basement. With each telling, they'd add details. Some of them were actually very grim - they came up with one about a 'Victorian boy'  (bearing in mind that the community centre was only built in 1954) that had been eaten by the monster and still roamed the halls, crying out to go home. The details got more and more gory - they came up with the idea that the monster would 'mark' its victims with three slashes of its horrendous glistening claws - this was the same week we were showing the Zorro movies on the old projector. 

In short, it was beginning to seem as though 'Saturday Club' had turned into 'NoSleep Junior'. We had complaints from parents about their children being too scared to come in, and so my boss decided it was time to put a stop to the monster talk. We tried everything we could to get the kids to stop talking about it - we played non-monstery games with them, we made apple pie, we even passed the caretaker off as a 'professional monster hunter'. That kept them quiet for a while, and we began to hope that they'd lost interest altogether. 

In the meantime though, I began to feel more and more uneasy locking up the centre at night. I had no reason to be afraid - Julie or one of my other co-workers was usually waiting at the front desk for me in case there *was* trouble, and the Zumba fitness group usually hung around outside until we locked up anyway. In short, nobody could get in without one of us noticing. 

I mention that because the night before the attack I could have sworn I heard someone  - a small someone - crying, all through my lockup. It always seemed like the voice was coming from the next corner, but when I looked, there was nobody there. I even got Julie out to have a look - she said she couldn't hear anything, but I could tell she was concerned. Maybe she just wanted to get home early. I don't know. I told the police I hadn't seen anyone for definite, anyway. 

I wasn't working the next day, but that's when the attack happened. I don't know much about the details - the police told me that Julie heard crying and screaming from the basement, and went down to find two of our regulars, Tommy and Rosie, spattered with blood and crying. When she rounded the corner, she discovered a third child - I wasn't told his name, he was new - lying unconscious beneath a shelf. She confided to me later that while she'd told police the shelf must have toppled onto him, it looked more like he'd been hiding beneath it. 

What sent me to you guys, though, is the other thing Julie told me. Her first instinct, being a mother herself, was to pull the child out from under the shelf and make sure he was okay. He didn't have any of the injuries she'd expect in this kind of accident - no broken bones, not even a bruise. Instead, he had three bloody lines carved into his chest. Three large, horrible claw marks. 

When the police asked the other two children what they'd witnessed, they'd only say 'The monster got him'. The Centre is closed until further notice - I think they think there's some sort of psychopath living there. That's the logical explanation, but somehow I can't help questioning it. When I pass by the closed Centre, I swear I can hear a child crying inside - crying to go home. 

The boy is okay, by the way - apparently he's recovering at home, but he won't name his attacker. He'll only say that 'some*thing* got him'. I take a little comfort knowing that he's alright, but how long will it be before something else happens? Something worse? 

I'm afraid, NoSleep - what have I done?

DakotaKim,23,,40,1raxlb,,85,"Before you skip past this: No, this is not a coincidental Doctor Who related post. 

I don't know if I'm the only going through this. I can't stay here long. The quickest way to explain what's happening to me is with a recap of my day(s)? I woke up in my bed as usual, but the second I blinked, I was in the local train station two weeks ago. My clothing changed accordingly. I looked around and people were giving me puzzled looks. I looked in the passing train's glass and saw that I was bleeding from my mouth and eyes. 

I blinked.

I was in my childhood home, watching my childhood self enjoy a bowl of cereal. He[?] saw me and ran off terrified. My father, who recently passed, ran into the dining room and shot me in the chest. Pain surged from my chest to my brain.

I blinked.

Due to the stress of the situation, I can't really remember where I've been. I just remember fear and pain.

I don't know what's going on, but when I blink, I get ripped from where I am and I open my eyes to a new setting.

Right now, I'm trying my absolute hardest to not blink. I'm at a Best Buy on one of the laptops. My eyes are welling up with blood, and I don't think I can do this for long. I don't know what's going to happen to me. If I leave, I will check back when I can, if I can. My memory is slowly fading.

The only thing that I know for certain is that there is a man wherever I go. I can't see his face, but he looks to be in his late sixties carrying a duffle bag. He's here in the store. Watching me with a smile.

I don't know what will happen if I don't open my eyes. If I keep them shut, will this fix itself? I've gone to over a thousand different places today, and I need anyone's help. If you see a man bleeding from his eyes and mouth, it's me. Restrain me and don't let me go.

Do I need to talk to the man?

I don't exactly know where to turn, like the majority of the sub I'm assuming you share the same interest as me in the supernatural, the other side. I've always been intensely fascinated with it, usually the furthest I went was browsing /r/nosleep or heading into abandoned houses to sate my thirst for the creepy, although, the same routine things quickly became dull and eventually, I slowly got desensitized, bored. This was about the time I started reading 'recipes' for paranormal experiences.


The whole thing seemed awesome, the Midnight Man, One Man Hide and Seek, The Shoebox Telephone. All gave me chills, but I remained quietly skeptical the whole time. Fuck. Why did I have to be so blind. I still can't find the place to blame myself, I mean reading scary stories on the internet posted by a bunch of anonymous people, it would be stupid to take it all for fact, right?


Of all the rituals, one caught my eye, The Three Kings. I'm hesitant to post the link but I feel like it would be naive to think that no one would give it a quick search. http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wbo0u/please_dont_actually_try_this/ A blunt explanation of it would be a recipe where you can contact the dead, and ask them questions through two propped up mirrors.


After reading it I felt like I had to do it. I quickly spread it to a few friends and it wasn't long until hype was built upon the whole thing. Me and my best mate (For his sake i'll call him, Darcy), organized to do this when we had a few friends over for a small gathering whilst my parents were out for the week. Funny enough, at the time the thing I was worried the most about was it not working. We had tried a ouija board once at my request, and nothing happened, we all just sat there fingers on the cup for 10 minutes blaming each other for pushing it whenever it moved in the slightest. They all probably thought I was an idiot. So I thought I would give it a kick, my bright idea would be that we would all get absolutely hammered beforehand so that when it (surely) didn't work we would imagine that it did or at least get really scared in the process. Well at least we had the 'really scared' part down pat.


So everyone came at around 9:00pm yesterday, and it was all pretty normal, caught up, bitched about a few people, had some laughs and it wasn't until around 11:00pm that we started to set up. The atmosphere then was so... amusing of all things. We all giggled the whole time in our stupor, acting as if we were kids in primary school kids about to pull a really lame prank. It all seemed fun then. Of course I had to be the one who volunteered to be the one who sat the throne, eager to show my courage off to my friends. My lifeline was Darcy, if anyone was to hold the key between my life and death i'd gladly hand it to him.

For the sake of the story I'll skip all the tedious setting up and get to 3:33am. We were all fighting sleep by then and I think Sarah and Alistair were already gone, though we were sitting outside that door for so long it was hard for us to miss the time. When I had walked in I was immediately hit by the cool air, though this one wasn't the ghostly cold, it was literally fucking freezing from the fan that had been buzzing on for a few hours. Though something did feel off, it was either the fact that I was in a pitch black room holding a candle to my chest with a chair and two mirrors propped up adjacent to it, or it was that all of a sudden everything was quite. As if the world around me was devoid of life bar the constant drone of the fan. 


I sat down clutching the candle tightly, persistent to not let it go out, suddenly very aware to what i was doing. I remember shifting in my chair uncomfortably for a while but what follows that still remains hazy. I remember trying to call out for answers, ""Who's there"" ""What are you doing?"" ""Is there another side?"". None were answered, just silence, and the buzzing of the fan. I then said something stupid and heard giggling, assuming it was my friends outside I started cracking jokes. The more jokes I made the harder they laughed until I said ""Why arn't you responding, too scared to show your faces?"" and looked into the mirrors. Now, the huge cardinal rules of this recipe is not to look in the mirrors and around about this whole thing turned to fucking shit. The worst thing about looking into the mirrors isn't what I saw but rather the absence of it. I saw nothing, i saw the chair, the fan, but no me. I quickly looked to the other, and greeted by the same emptiness. Then the rumbling began, have you ever been in a house when a plane has flown overhead and the ground slightly shakes? It was like that except the sound emanated from the floor rather than the sky. It continued to get louder and louder until my eardrums felt as if they were going to burst and then I peed myself. The mirrors shattered and sent shards of glass everywhere and my candle was quickly snuffed out, and I screamed, boy did I scream, I legged it out of there like nobodies business and slammed the door behind me. Of course everyone was fast asleep but woken up with a few of my screams and sharp kicks to the ribs. They attempted to calm me down but i was flailing and screaming, I told them we had to get out of my house, but where do seven 17 year olds go at 4:00 am in the morning? Eventually I calmed down and tried to pass it off as a drunk hallucination which i knew was very impossible but it made my mind sort of at ease. 

We decided to get everyone up and camp downstairs in the living room. I felt safer with all of them around me and after much apprehension my tired state got the better of me and I drifted off to sleep. Last night was some of the worst nightmares i ever had, I saw my friends hanging and mutilated, I saw my childhood cat lay gutted on the floor, I saw myself smiling at a mirror. When i woke up, i was upstairs in the room. In between both mirrors, which had been shifted to face me lying on the floor. All my friends had left, when i called them they all gave me half ass reasons and some just avoided the question altogether.

TheeMikeG,13,,34,1r8w1k,,83,"Let me introduce myself. My name is Mike Gordan and I exorcise demons for a living. Yeah, work is hard to find, but I get by. I was born into a normal, loving family, but everyone kind of went their separate ways a while ago. I have an older brother who joined the military, and my mother and father are both pilots, so they obviously travel a lot. After I graduated highschool and was in college for a few years I tried my hand at law. But after I failed the LSAT I got pretty down and didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. I dropped out of school and found myself struggling to get a job and even more so struggling to pay rent. 


Then I found Jesus. And by that I mean I was dumpster diving and found a KJV little orange bible inbetween a moldy sandwhich and a spent tube of toothpaste. When I got to the part about the end of the world and that 666 stuff I got interested, really interested. I’d go to the library and do hours upon hours of research. I learned about the Devil’s crossroads and the Grimorium Verum and the Lesser Key of Solomon and demonic sigils and how to summon them. I watched all eight seasons of Supernatural in two months and got a license online to be a priest. With my trusty orange bible in my pocket I scowered Craigslist for people who needed saving.


At first all I found were people that wanted their homes blessed, their babies baptised, or someone to perform a homosexual marriage. But I had a wealth of knowledge of demons and I wanted to do something a lot more meaningful. Then I found her. Her post was desperate. She claimed to be waking up with bruises and in different rooms or even places than where she had fallen asleep. I messaged her explaining that I was a priest who specialized in demon removal and that I would be happy to exorcise her home. For a modest fee of course. 


She replied immediately that she would pay me whatever I wanted, she just wanted to get rid of whatever was doing this to her. When I got to her house I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. No weird smell, no demonic symbols or texts, nothing. And the girl looked fine aside from some minor scratches and bruises. But she cried and cried and begged me to help her. It was pretty awkward because I’d never done this before, but I played confidence and expertise. I had her sit down in one of her wooden kitchen chairs and I bound her arms and legs to it. I took out my bible and began to read from a page I randomly flipped to. 


“All nations whom You have made Shall come and worship before You, O Lord, And shall glorify Your name, For You are great, and do wondrous things; You alone are God.""


And then she started to scream. Not a normal scream though, a deep, dark sounding scream. I dropped the bible. Mustering up my strength, confident in my knowledge, I snapped out of my state of shock and fiddled in my deep pocket for the plastic bottle of holy water I had purchsed online. I splashed some on her face and was horrified. Her face sizzled and burned. I’m talking like third degree. And that smell, my God that smell; like sulfur. By now she was thrashing wildly in the chair. I bent down and quickly retrieved the bible, then started again.


“And He changes the times and the seasons; He removes kings and raises up kings; He gives wisdom to the wise And knowledge to those who have understanding, He reveals deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, And light dwells with Him.” 


By now shit was falling off shelves, furniture was sliding around, the whole shabang. It was awesome. In my element now, and comfortable, I improvised.


“Jesus I ask that you cast out any and all evil spirits in, around or attached to this woman! Lord,  sanctify this follower of your word, and help me to command all demons to leave at once! I bless this woman, and damn you back to hell!” 


Then she vomited and passed out. Everything stopped moving and all was quiet. When she woke up, she had no memory of what had happened but said she felt much better. The color returned to her face and I knew it was gone. After I untied her she went to her purse and handed me a blank check.


Since that day I’ve been performing exorcisms, and I’ve done so many that things have slowed down almost entirely. I haven’t had a job in months, and rent is getting hard to pay again. So, I used my knowledge to make a deal where everyone wins. I’ve actually got a new customer right now. She’s struggling against the straps, but it’s useless. Once I put the demon in her, she’ll pay me anything to take it out.

BensonHedges1,4,,25,1r2xlz,,77,"I heard the coffee pot drip before my alarm even went off, bizarre, I don’t usually set a timer. I like to go to the gym before I have my coffee. Maybe it was my boyfriend being nice. He typically works the graveyard shift, and sometimes he comes home in the early morning to leave nice surprises. 


“Might as well get up” I said aloud to myself, since no one else was home. 


My cat was absent from the bed, which is also weird, he’s usually by my head in the mornings. As I stretch my legs and arms out, I notice an odd chill run up my spine. Surely it was the weather, New England has a way with inconsistent temperatures, and the blanket over me was not quite fit for winter. It’s November, that sixty-degree weather is bound to disappear sooner or later. I haven’t quite figured out the thermostat, we just moved in, and the heat only seems to kick in on times when I’m not home. Must be the reason we bought this place so cheap...and why people keep selling it. New England is not the place to have a busted heating system. This has been the biggest point of arguments since my boyfriend and I started co-habitating. 


“Get out of bed, you’re going to be late to your class…” 


I said this to myself a few times, in hopes to have motivation to get to the 5:15am class at the gym. I had no idea what time it was, but if the coffee pot is going off, it’ was creeping close to sunrise. I haven’t unpacked the alarm clocks yet, so my phone’s been the only thing reminding me what time of the day it is. 


I thrusted my arms to the floor and pulled my phone to my bed — 2:11 am. 


“What the fuck?! I’ve still got two-and-a-half hours of sleep…and why is the coffee pot on?”


I slipped out of the bed from the left side and stumble to the kitchen to turn off the coffee pot. I’m a coffee lover, but nothing smells worse than burnt-coffee. As I went to flip the switch to off, I realize the time isn’t illuminated on the pot. Directly above on the microwave - nothing. Damnit. The power went out! The drip-sound of the coffee pot was so loud, and it was too early. I was confused. I could even smell the lingering scent of fresh brewed coffee…but it was 2am, my mind must be playing tricks on me. 


I headed back to the bedroom, a little freaked out, but convinced it was just all a coincidence. This hallway seems so much longer in the dark, and I still haven’t gotten used to the layout of this condo. As I pass the bathroom, I notice a shadow out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head and didn’t see anything, except the shower curtain pulled all the way open. Since we’ve moved in, we haven’t used that shower…we’ve got a shower stall in the bedroom…much more convenient. Though, I am sure there was a logical explanation for it. 


When I get to the bedroom - another chill down my spine. This was uncomfortable, it was a winter chill I was feeling. I was sure of that. Something was wrong, but i couldn’t figure it out. 

I need to go back to bed.


I hop in the bed and pick the blankets from off the floor. As I turn on my side, I hear the heater click on. The electricity is back on…fantastic! I start counting sheep in my head to fall back asleep, and keep thinking…”how did the blankets end up on the floor?”


What feels like an hour later, my alarm finally goes off. The smell of burnt coffee has filled the condo, and now I’m frustrated. I should have just unplugged the damn thing. And where is my cat? I have most definitely woken up on the wrong side of the bed. I moved to the kitchen to pour some coffee - and it’s dry. Nothing. I must be imagining things. 


That chill again! I could feel the hairs spike up on my neck - absolutely razor sharp. I decided to skip the gym and start my morning. I remained timid, but continued with my normal routine. As I rummaged around the kitchen, I noticed my cat out of the corner of my eye. He was twitchy, and obviously anxious. 


A few years ago my cat had major anxiety problems, and he developed what my vet called - “Rolling Skin Syndrome”. When my cat got anxious, his skin would roll around his body, it looked almost as if he had a small gum ball moving around beneath his fur. Today that ball was most definitely moving.


He paced back and forth around the house with me now, seeming more comfortable now that I was up with him. Every time I moved to another room, he cautiously peeked around the corner, almost as if he was looking for something. We moved to the bathroom, I started to floss, and then I heard it…drip drip drip. I am sure it’s not the coffee pot, and the house starts to smell again. As I analyze my senses the smell become more pungent. Less of a coffee smell and more of a rancid scent. 


Drip drip drip…


I follow the noise, it seems louder now, and it seems like it’s coming from the bedroom. Surely I would have heard it loud and clear when I was in bed earlier…it seemed so distant then. I enter the bedroom, and my cat stopped dead in his tracks. His skin is rolling again and he appeared more on edge, tail straight in the air and it’s hairs following suit. And that chill, of course, it was back. And my sheets and blankets, on the floor again.


WHAT THE FUCK? 


I’m working from home today, and every time I walk by the bedroom, I get the chills. I’ve resorted to closing the door until I’m not alone. It sounds like the wind is blowing up against the windows in that room, but from where I’m sitting, the trees are as still as ever.

TheGroovyTurt1e,12,,22,1raatv,,76,"So I'm not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told, if only for my own piece of mind.  I'm an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously under-served community.  The hospital itself is old, its been standing since the late 1800s, it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium. 
I've never really encountered anything supernatural, but I haven't written off the existence of such phenomena.  That being said, a shadow in the night isn't enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the night.
So when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty well.  I'd have my admissions, I'd take care of the current patients without issue.  Then one night I got an admission, I'll call this patient Jerry.  Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital, to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any would be physician that trains at this facility.  He has a whole boat load of medical issues, kidney problems, diabetes, high blood pressure.  He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia. 
Before meeting Jerry I was told he's actually a really fun guy, he's always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here.  So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen, I was a little anxious.  The admission was done, the orders were placed and I didn't think more of it.  He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night.  It was around 2 in the morning when I went back to see Jerry.  I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up.  When I went in there, Jerry wasn't in his bed.  Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet, his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor. 
I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying... not crying, but rather whimpering as if he didn't have the stamina to make it a full cry.  I tried putting on a brave face and said ""Jerry whats going on?"" For an old guy, Jerry was quicker than I thought, and stronger than I would have believed.  He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him.  ""They won't leave me alone, they won't let me sleep, they won't let me eat."" 
 He continued on in this line of things the phantom ""they"" wouldn't let him do.  I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home.  As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this, I still needed the blood and this wasn't the first time I'd dealt with a confused older patient.  I helped Jerry back to his bed.  Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK.  Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better, maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient, it was something familiar.  I tied the tourniquet in place, then I cleaned his arm, found my vein and went for it.  I'm not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing. 
I was filling up my vial, it was about half way full, when Jerry started screaming, ""LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE!"" He began to jerk violently, somehow the needle stayed in place, but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerry's body was pulling it back.  I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm, but the needle didn't budge.  In shock I pulled harder, my efforts still could not budge the needle.  In response, I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing.  The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being 3/4 full to maybe being about 1/4 full.  After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerry's arm, leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise.  Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me ""Can you see them?""  I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room.  I walked back to the nursing station, one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming.  I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill.  With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep.  I made my way to the on-call room, which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital.  I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes.  All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerry's eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them. 
I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing, and a senile sick old man.  The only trouble is since then the shadows I've seen in dark rooms seem darker, the lights unable to pierce them.  The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings.  I'm not really sure what to make of it.  In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker, the tapping louder and now I can't shake a feeling that I'm being watched.  ",Night Float,98,nosleep
floydnimrod,21,,22,1rhxtb,,116,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Of course, that's when I woke up.",I just dreamed of the apocalypse. I probably won't sleep for a few days now.,138,nosleep
Charlies_friend,20,,7,1rhapg,,81,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,88,nosleep

Terzis28,17,,38,1r6la8,,61,"So, a while ago (about a year ago now) I was sitting on my bed with the laptop on my lap. Next to me was my desk with my lamp on it. I was using an MSN video chat with one of my female friends. 

After talking for a couple of hours with my friend she messaged me (we both did not have microphones) and asked ""What is that kid eating? haha"" i simply replied ""What are you talking about?"" She stated that there was a kid sitting next to me with his hands at his mouth, as if to be chewing and gnawing either on his hands or something that he was holding. Chills ran through my body, but i soon realized that she was most likely messing with me.

I replied ""Seriously, stop messing with me"". She seemed like a pretty good actor considering she wasn't laughing or smiling at all. ""I'm not messing with you, I was just curious as to what he was eating"". At this moment I was getting a bit worried and decided to put her to the test. ""I want you to swear on your life that right now, you see a child next to me who looks like he is eating something"" I requested. ""I swear on my life, that is what I see"" she replied. I was pretty worried at this point and just when I thought I couldn't get much more creeped out, my lamp turned itself off.

I know it wasn't a power surge because my alarm clock was still on, and the standby light on my TV.

Mrs. Loughlin is dressed on the side table, waiting for the casket to be delivered. The 4 year old Ryan awaits my oven in the walk in fridge. And the 23 year old, Jill Brewer, is lying in the casket, sitting silently still, waiting for her family to pass by, look upon her pale, lifeless shell, and weep. 

Jones finishes pushing the blood out of his system, and I set to work. I use the needle injector to put the wires into his upper and lower jaw. I pull tight, and twist, like sealing a loaf of bread. He looks at me, with his eyes partially opened and his mouth firm. I grab 2 eye caps, lubricate with Vaseline, and grab my tweezers. One tug of the top lid, one placement of the bottom, and then again to the other eye. He no longer looks at me. He now looks like hes sleeping, if sleeping involved 2 hoses connected to the arteries and veins of your neck. His naked corpse is covered in purple and blue bedsores. They come with the elderly, and especially the cancer patients. Most of these dead who pass from cancer are older, and the older they are, the less they have moved in the months that the infliction slowly ate the remaining life from them. 

A quick threading of the needle send me into cleanup. I baseball stitch his neck, scrub him down, and rinse again. Some skin is slipping on his left hand. Nothing the embalming fluid shouldnt take care of. If it continues, I resolved to just wax it before putting him in the last suit he'll ever wear. 

I look up, just in time to see my colleague wheel in the dark blue casket. The younger worker is  guiding it through the door. He looks pale. *Id probably use the pink dye for him rather than peach. Would make him more lifelike.* I plan the embalmings of the people I meet. Some call it morbid. I call it early planning. 

We grab Loughlin, get our arms around her frame, and place her in the casket. They wheel it to the parlor, and set up the chairs. I take off my gloves, remove my apron, roll down my sleeves, and grab my jacket. As i shut the door behind me, i hear the door buzzer go off. The Brewer family has arrived. The service goes normal, and I tag out with another director to go finish up Loughlin. I prop the door open, get on the gloves and apron, and grab my trocar. I stick the pointed metal pole into his stomach, and vacuum him out. With the plug in place, i rinse him again. I glance to the clock, and a figure invades my vision. 

A little boy in his suit and tie. I panic, and immediatly stop what I'm doing and throw a sheet over the body. I ask the boy his name. He just stares at me. I ask if hes lost? He smiles, and walks away. I follow him. He goes into the first room, and circles back through the office. I get back to the hallway, and hes back in the prep room. I tell him he cant be here. He looks at me, sadness in his face, and looks back to the walk in. He begins to sniffle. I walk next to him, and say ""Ryan, it's okay."" He looks back at me, and stops sniffling. Instead, he holds out his hand to me. I reach for it, and... Hes gone. I open the door, and hes sitting on the tray, in his little suit, waiting for my oven.

TheGraveSin,10,,17,1rdci1,,58,"So I grew up on a farm, cows, chickens, horses, you name it. I usually got stuck feeding and watering the animals while my brothers ran the tractors and threw the hay bales. Dragging the water-hose to each and every animal's water pan was a pain and sometimes I'd catch my younger brother sneaking at the other end of the pasture watering some of the animals I hadn't gotten to yet and it would always make me smile to myself. Sometime in the summer our ducks started dying off, I'd find them smooshed and assumed it was an incident from them trying to breed one another and split some of them up in different pens and thought nothing more of it.   

Then three days later, I found a calf with its body oddly angled and no sure sign of what caused it to die. Nothing else happened for about a month or two. Then I found the horse laid out, freshly dead with sweat beaded all over it as if it had been running all night, it was a young and healthy horse, one of my favorite, and my heart shattered to pieces. I was reluctant to go back the next day, forcing myself to look at my sweet animals and focus on them instead but they were acting oddly, the pigs in particular, who were hiding in their makeshift huts and houses, not even coming when I did my usual call or dumped out the food. I got worried and walked in the pen, getting on hands and knees to look inside their little houses, as soon as I saw their snouts with a squeal one of them ran into me, biting at my arm and face. I toppled backward, kicking it away and dashed over the top of the pen, hurt feelings because they were almost always happy to see me. I didn't tell anyone, just let it go, assuming that at losing so many of my precious pets I was wigging myself out.   

The next time I went out, (at this point it was around winter) because of the cold I asked my mom to help me with the animals. As we were dragging the hose to the dairy cows she stops suddenly and asks ""who's that?"" I look over seeing the usual figure of my brother and just say ""oh it's just Derek Momma"" She shakes her head. ""No, Derek's at Paul's."" A weird feeling crawled down my spine as I glanced over my shoulder at the young male figure. Dropping the water-hose, I stepped in his direction. I could clearly see his dirt-smeared jeans and the back of his hair had the same blond curl of my brothers. ""Derek!"" I yelled, running over to him and reaching a hand out to put on his shoulder. He turned his head in my direction, his bright red eyes meeting mine as my hand fell through air. I passed out then. My mom says that by the time she reached me the figure was gone. After later discussion, my brother swore on his life that he had never once been in the pasture with me. ",On the Farm.,75,nosleep
MissMonstrosity,25,,30,1r5z11,,57,"Hello everyone. I told this story to a friend who told me I should post it here in Nosleep. I'm sorry for any grammatical errors or bad commentary, I''m not much of a writer.

About four years ago I was a troubled thirteen year old, who like most teenagers, didn't get along with my parents.
It was just me and my little Brother, our Mother who spent more time on the computer then being a real Mother, and our Step Father, who in most cases, acted more like a frat boy room-mate then a parental figure.

Anyway this all started one day when my and my Mother got into an argument, only god knows what it was about since we argued all the time  back then. 
All I remember is that I stormed off, taking a backpack of clothes and some food with me, and ran into the woods.

We live on a huge property in the country, and the woods go on for miles and miles in every direction, with only a small creek running through it to break up the never ending amount of trees.
Alot of people might be freaked out by the ominous looking place, but I loved it. I went exploring out there everyday and I knew those woods like the back of my hand.
I ran to the south west, down a large hill that had the creek I mentioned earlier at the bottom of it, the creek itself went on even farther than the woods, cutting through several private properties and stopped just outside of a town over fourteen miles away.
I decided I'd follow to town, where I'd find somewhere to stay the night.
Why not just take the road to town? well we lived in the country, there were alot of crazy people out here, drunks, hill-billies, prostitutes, and a combination of all three. I figured if I took the road I'd only be asking to get raped or robbed.

I'll fast forward a little, about 2 hours later I finally came to the edge of our property.
The property after ours belonged to an old man, we met him in church a couple times. Despite several threatening ""No Trespassing"" signs  I wasn't worried, If he did so happen to come all the way out here and somehow find me, I could just claim to be lost.  I was sure he wouldn't be this far out in the woods anyway. 
Here the woods thinned out a little, and there were several small fields tucked between the trees. I came here before, but never went any further then the edge of the fields.
At this point   the sun was only an hour or so away from setting and I started walking faster to hopefully get to town before nightfall, I ran through the creek that separated me from the field, and slipped on something causing me to fall.
It hurt like hell, later I found out I had broken my toe. It was bleeding badly and I had to limp the rest of the way through the creek and fields.
I came to the end of the fields several minutes later, where a small path, either for ATV's or a tractor, led through the woods.
I never went this far before, but I knew if I kept going straight I'd get to the town within only an hour or so, so I went on.

After what felt like forever of following a twisting path that seemed to go nowhere It finally came to a small circular clearing. There was a fence surrounding it, with a large sign once again threatening anyone who crossed. I thought it was strange, we were hours from any house, why bother putting up a fence blocking off where no one would ever be likely to go? Then again I was going through, so maybe it wasn't all that uncommon. I crawled under the fence, foot still hurting like hell and went on through the clearing. I knew I wouldn't be caught, theres no way there would be anyone out here.
I walked, or more less, limped, through the clearing, on the other side there was another small field, and just my luck, there was a old tree stand in one of the trees surrounding it. 
We have a large hunting community, and hunters often hide out in the tree stands that were often camouflaged in the trees.
I thought it would make a great place to stay the night, since the town was still a long ways away and it was already starting to get dark.
I went up to it and poked my head inside, it was perfect. Just enough space to lay down and sleep if need be. 

I climbed back out and headed back to the clearing, There was a large hill to one side of it, I figured if I climbed up it I could see just how far away the town was. 
Ignoring my aching foot, I limped over to the hill, and right in that moment something hit me on the back of the head. It felt like someone angrily poking me, or throwing a small  pebble
I turned around quickly, expecting to find an angry farmer or hunter, no one was there, it was probably just an acorn or nut falling from one of the surrounding trees.
I laughed at myself for being stupid and rubbed at my now aching head.
For whatever reason, I decided to not try to force my way up the large hill, and instead went to the opposite side of the round clearing, I dont know why, it just felt like something was pulling me there.

About half way across the clearing I stopped dead in my tracks and gasped. I literally uttered  the words ""Oh my God"" Before quickly shutting my mouth in fear someone might have heard me.
There before me, were several grave stones. All ranging in height and design. 
The ground in front of some of them was lower than the rest of the ground, almost as if the coffins underneath had caved in.
I stumbled over to the graveyard, and bent down to try to read the head-stones.
Most were unreadable. Only one of them had enough words I could make out, it looked like two head-stones fused together.

The one on the left read ""G.A Keaton -date unreadable-
The one on the right said ""Harriet Keaton 18?? - 187?""
at the bottom, just visible, was ""Our angels, together in heaven""

At this point, I turned and ran.
I blacked out for most of the time I was running, I ran through the clearing, ran along the path, ran across the fields until I was finally back on our property. 
I only slowed down because it was pitch black outside, and stupid me forgot to bring a flash-light. It was so dark I could hardly see in front of me.
Once again, I'll fast forward, I finally got home after my step father had found me, apparently he went out looking for me, not to ensure I was safe and guide me home, no. 
Only because he wanted to drag me home to make me apologize to my mother.
I didn't care, I happily followed him home.
After finally getting there I found my brother, looking like he was crying, and my mom sitting at the table eating dinner, looking like she didn't have a care in the world. She glanced at me, made a face. And left the room.
Over time I ended up telling her about the graveyard, she found it interesting, and soon enough all my family knew about the weird graveyard in the woods. It became quite a conversation topic in our family, before over time, being forgotten.



One thing I never told anyone though, And the reason I went running out of that place like a baby-
 Was because, shortly after finding that cemetery, I started to hear whispering, and among the trees behind the graveyard, I could've sworn I saw something moving.

 Then, right after reading what was on the one tombstone, what felt like a long boney finger,
Started tapping on the back of my head.

iwillneverbefree,8,,20,1r1p8k,,51,"I'm just your average everyday guy with a job. I cook, I clean, I drink; hell, I even had a girlfriend before all this started going down. If you saw me on the street, you'd walk right by me without a second glance. It's just that I have a job. I'm a Paramedic.

I don't do anything important, I just help those in need. I started doing this because I didn't feel great about myself. I always loved helping others, and I always loved A&amp;P, so I saw this as a logical step. I loved every second of it when I first started. There was no greater high than when your adrenaline kicked in and your hands moved faster than your mind could think. It was ecstasy. This went on for 8 years. Every day I fell more and more in love with my job. My calling. The only thing that bothered me was that overwhelming sense of being in a battle. I thought it was normal; after-all, I was fighting for someone else's life I thought. If only I knew how true that statement was.

It started off with a shadow when I walked onto a scene. I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Maybe it was my constant concern of someone attacking me. God forbid I got shot while working. I should have known something wasn't right when my partner looked in the same direction when I did. I should have known better when he just shut down and barely spoke the rest of the night. This went on for a while, every so often seeing the shadow. Things started to get worse, however, when the whispering started.

At first, they were nonsensical. Sometimes I wondered if they were even there at all, if I was just going fucking nuts. But they were... They WERE there. It only took me losing my first patient to hear them clear as day. They were congratulating me. They were telling me how great of a job I did. I didn't understand then. My mind had been turning on me, it had to have been. ""It's the stress... It's the stress of losing someone"" I told myself on my way home. I sat at home and hit the bottle. Hoping that my next shift would be an easy one... one quiet shift.

It wasn't quiet. I should have known better than to use that word. It's bad luck. The voices didn't go away. They only got louder. Every patient I had I could hear them. ""It's their time"" ""She's ours now"" ""Let her rest"". I thought I was just compensating for losing someone. I thought I was just preparing myself if I lost another one. The more people I lost, the more they got more sinister. ""You're almost ready."" ""I haven't seen one this talented in eons"" ""You can't change fate""... ""Come join us"". I didn't understand right then, but I understood it all soon.

It was a 5 year old male. His heart stopped. I had to save this one, he was just a child, I HAD to save him. We got him to the back of the ambulance and I started my work. Things felt... odd. I felt as if I was in a daze. My vision was blurry, the lights seemed faint against the road. I tried not to think about the voices, I tried to block them out, I did a damn good job until it screamed my name.

""JOHN"". I heard. I stopped, and slowly raised my head to look at the bench seat across from me. It wasn't what you would expect death to be. It wasn't a man in a robe with a scythe. It was just a man in a suit with black eyes. I froze. I had to have been insane. I needed to tell my partner to drop my off in the psych ward when we got to the hospital. His smile was... calming. It was the kind of smile you'd expect a great car salesman to have... calming... but also sinister. His hair was well kept for a man his age, I'd have to say 50's or 60's. His eyes like a void of everything that makes us human, as if they were a black hole that sucked all feeling out of whatever had the poor misfortune of getting caught in their path.

""Haven't you been listening John?"" He said with a caring tone

""You know what you must do... You know who you'll become... Why are you fighting?""

I started screaming at him. ""Who are you?"" ""What do you want?"" ""Why have you been following me?""

He ignored all of my questions. He simply put his hand to the child and started rubbing his head.

""You fought for so long John. You know this is your fate. How much more pain can you endure?""

""What are you talking about?"" I yelled at him as the child's rhythm became worse and worse.

""Don't you understand John, we've been with you since day one! We are who you fight every day... We are the ones who you ignore to do your job... We are you.""

I began to understand.

""John, you must know something."" He said looking at the monitor as it flatlined. ""This will also be your fate. You will die just like everyone else. There's nothing you can do about it""

""Don't you think I fucking know that?"" I yelled grabbing the epinephrine out of my bag.

""JOHN"" He yelled again knocking the epinephrine out of my hand.

""You need to understand the forces that be. When you die, John, you will become one of us""

""The fuck I will"" I said, standing up, but was forced back down by some unknown force.

""It's not something you can change, John. You have so much potential... so much promise... We've been watching you from the day you were born... and we are very, very, excited to meet you""

I stopped fighting. I looked into his eyes and I felt something. Something I wish I never would have felt... I felt at peace. It was if all the stress of saving a life was gone. It was as if I didn't have to fight anymore. It felt like I was being held by my mother again, like all was right with the world.

I sat there and placed my hand on the child. I felt death pass through me. I felt the coldness of the nothing reach my heart and sit there. I understood now. I understood why I am who I am. It was as if everything made sense to me...

iampatheo,11,,15,1rcqug,,47,"  This is my first Reddit post so please excuse my mistakes. I live with my parents and my grandfather, who is my father's uncle actually, so basically not my grand""father"". 
     I am going to jump straight into the problem here because there is something definitely weird going on in our house. There have been this series of events which have occurred throughout my childhood which I have always put them at the back of my mind, maybe because as a child I didn’t look into it enough, but I never forgot. But with the most recent event I can't help but ask you guys for advice.
     The first event occurred when I was around 10 I guess. I was probably getting ready for school or something and the only people in the house that morning was my mom and my grandfather. Mom was helping me put my tie on ( we had a school uniform ) and I remember glancing towards the living room which is visible from my room. I saw my grandfather walk into the living room after which he proceeded to go towards the balcony and out of my sight. I got out my room and I was walking towards the kitchen to get some water. Now, the kitchen is right next to my grandfather's room and it’s on the other side of our house. As I reached his room I saw him sitting there reading the paper. I got a bit surprised because I clearly remembered seeing him in the living room just a few seconds ago and there is no way he could have gotten back here before me or without bumping into me. I asked him about it and he said he had no clue what I was talking about. So, I just put it at the back of my mind.
The next incident happened a year back or so. It was after 11 p.m and I was locked up in my room listening to really loud music through my earphones while doing some reading( I like doing that, getting a whole background score feel for the things happening in the book). After a while I heard my parents banging the door and shouting at me and I figured they must have been knocking for some time. When I opened the door I saw them both standing there with concerned looks on their faces. I asked them what happened and they said that apparently they could hear me crying out  for help from my room in a really panicky way and they thought had probably slipped and had broken a bone or something. I obviously had no clue what they were talking about and they swore that the voice they heard was mine and no one else’s. It freaked me out a little. But even then I didn’t put it together with the incident from all those years back.
     And now something has happened again last night and this time I am pretty freaked out. I was having my dinner in my room as I was watching a movie on my laptop. As I finished I got out of my room and headed for the kitchen. On the way I noticed my mom, dad and grandfather in the living room watching TV. As I walked past my grandfather’s room I saw him. Sitting on a chair by the window. The room was dimly lit but it was enough to see everything. I did a double take. I looked towards the living room and he was still there with my parents!  I looked back and he was still there sitting in his chair by the window. He was looking at me but for some reason I couldn’t see his eyes. Not because they weren’t there or anything but it was as if I was feeling this weird force which was trying to make me look away from there. I also got this head rush which you get when you stand up too fast. As soon as I recovered from that and my head cleared he was gone from his chair. My parents and grandfather were still sitting there in the living room chatting amongst themselves as they watched the TV. I told them what happened but they obviously did not believe me and thought I was making it up.
I really need to know what this is. Is this a doppelganger? And if so what should I do? Is this thing going to be harmful? It hasn’t done anything harmful so far.

WontThinkStraight,12,,11,1rcy69,,49,"I just had a long overdue catch up with Brad, and to check on how [Emily's family were doing since their tragedy](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p22cl/notes/). In some welcome news, they are now expecting a new child to join their family.

Brad had another story for me though; one that has kept me awake  the past couple of nights. I've captured it below to help get it off my mind.


-------------------------------------------

In a universe filled with choices, but with only one life in which to make them, regrets become inevitable. Regrets for things done or left undone, for words said or left unsaid.

At that moment when our life is fading, and we see it all over again... how would we feel about those decisions we've made?  Would we be proud of those moments that defined us? Those moments alone when we think no one else is watching? How we treated those we loved, and those close to us?


Brad was not the only child in his family. He also had a younger brother, Paul. They could not have been more opposites to each other.

Where Brad was brash and wild in his youth, Paul was introverted and contemplative. And like many siblings, their childhood was one of constant warfare with each other. 

Looking back, Brad admits that he was an arrogant, possessive and obnoxious brat. Any of those traits alone would already have given him an excuse to hate on his little brother.

But it was really the fear of the Burnt Man that really started it all. 

As an only child, Brad enjoyed the attention and adulation that brought him. That changed when his brother Paul was born three years later.

At first, Brad had loved the idea of a brother to play with. He imagined they would play together and be best friends. That idea disappeared when he discovered Paul was a useless baby that only cried, smelled bad and demanded constant attention. The second year wasn't much better, with Paul starting to get a larger share of Brad's toys and presents.

It became really bad in the third year when Brad had to give up half his room and share it with Paul. He found they had nothing in common.

Where Brad liked being loud and attention seeking with others, Paul just babbled and talked with himself. Brad loved being outside and active, Paul preferred to stay indoors and draw with his crayon set.

What unsettled Brad though was what Paul would draw. There would be the usual things every child draws - houses, animals, trees and family. What was unusual was every drawing of their family always had an extra person.

Their parents would be there, and Brad and Paul, all drawn in rainbow hues. Right next to Paul would be a mysterious figure drawn in black and red.

The family faces all had big smiles, but the stranger was a disfigured mess: two big black circles for eyes and a shapeless mass for the mouth. In every drawing of the stranger, he was missing an arm and had red streaks running through all over.

Over time, this stranger began to feature more and more prominently in the drawings. Brad and his parents would no longer appear in them - just Paul playing with the stranger inside the house, or outside in the yard.

At first their parents thought it was just a phase, but eventually became concerned enough to ask Paul who that was. He told them it was his friend ""the burned man"". He had always been there for as long as Paul could remember. He never said anything - he just stood there, watching and listening.

They concluded it was just an imaginary friend. Granted, it was a bit more unsettling than having a dinosaur or elf for a friend, but at least Paul wasn't drawing some real-life predator.

One night (when Brad was 8, and Paul was 5), they stayed awake after their parents had tucked them in. Brad wanted to know more about the Burnt Man.

Paul said that he had been in an accident, a fire that had burnt his entire body and face. It had melted his eyes away and made his arm go missing. He was very sad.

Paul didn't find the Burnt Man scary though. He had always been around, and never did anything. Just watched and listened.

Brad told him he was stupid for having an imaginary friend.

Paul yawned, and simply replied that he wasn't imaginary. He was in the room with them right now. In fact, he was standing right next to Brad, watching and listening, as he did every night.

Brad felt a chill go up his spine. He had always been a brave child, but for the first time in his life he felt fear. He looked around in the darkness, not sure if the shadows were his imagination or the Burnt Man waiting for him to go to sleep.

Brad didn't go to sleep that night, and concluded that he needed a room of his own.

He could no longer share a room with his annoying brother and his creepy friend. But he couldn't admit that he was afraid either, so his 8 year old mind came up with an idea.

His plan was simple - to make it so painful for their parents to keep them together they would be forced to keep them in separate rooms. So began their adversarial relationship.

They fought over everything for many years, and often physically. Each prank they played each other escalated into new rounds of retaliation, all to the chagrin of their parents. 

It would take six more years until they moved to a bigger house and they were able to have separate rooms at last before the feuds started to die down. the Burnt Man had been all but forgotten by this time, replaced with pure animosity for each other. 

But on the first night in their new home, Brad remembered waking in the middle of the night and seeing a figure sitting on his bed, watching him. It stared at him through hollow eye sockets, and moaned at him through an open jaw. It reached for him with a horribly burnt hand, the other hung uselessly by its side with the lower half missing.

Brad screamed so loud it woke the house, and the figure had disappeared by the time he blinked. When Paul came into the room to check what all the commotion was about, Brad told him he saw the Burnt Man.

Paul laughed, and said he hadn't seen him in years. In fact, he could hardly even remember him. In any case, he couldn't see him in the room now. Paul closed the door as he left, then reopened it quickly and shouting ""Boo!"", before laughing again and walking back to his room.

For Brad, the memory of it seemed very real though. It wasn't just the terror, but the overwhelming sense of sadness he felt from the encounter.

Another incident was when Paul was 17 and involved in a hit-and-run accident. He was rushed to hospital in a critical condition, and the doctors weren't sure if he would survive. Paul was lying in bed with a coma, with his parents crying around him.

Brad could could see a figure through the corner of his eye standing by the walls. It was the Burnt Man, watching Paul intently.

""Just go already! Why are you still here? You're not wanted. Just leave us!"" Brad remembered shouting at the figure. He got a severe reprimanding from his parents, thinking that he was shouting at his brother.

""Paul is dying, Brad! It's time to put your stupid feud behind. We're family for god's sake. Act like it!"" his father had rebuked while his mother cried.

The words stung Brad, especially since he couldn't explain that he wasn't shouting at Paul. He quietly fumed, then stormed out.

Paul did recover two days later though, and was out of the hospital a week later.

That last incident was 15 years ago. The Burnt Man was never seen again by either of them since. 

Brad had become a serious and buttoned down computer analyst since then. Paul married, had two children of his own, and had saved countless lives through his job as an EMT. They had developed a grudging respect for each other, though their lives had drifted off in different directions over the years.

The Burnt Man was just another long forgotten childhood memory, filed away and never thought of again until recently. Only a recent tragedy brought it all back into sharp focus.

A few months ago, Brad learnt that his brother had died while on duty. He was on scene with other emergency services dealing with a factory fire.

A chemical storage tank had unexpectedly exploded near his location, dousing him in burning chemicals. The flying shrapnel had sheared off his left arm at the elbow.

Paul was 32.

---------------------------

In a life of many regrets, Brad now has one more for the list. He never did let Paul know how proud he was of him, and that despite their differences, he loved him as a brother.

He regrets that his last words to Paul weren't goodbye, but a text message which read ""You suck. I've shat better excuses than that."" It was said in jest about why Paul didn't have time over the weekend for a beer, but it was devastating knowing it would be the last memory both had of each other.

So every now and then, Brad talks to the silence in the room hoping that his brother, the Burnt Man, is still around to hear. Now much older and wiser, he no longer fears the Burnt Man - but fears that the only one listening might just be himself.

One that can only observe in silence, powerless to stop whatever fate awaits him, judging him with regret for the decisions he's made, and is yet to make.

Here's a example, one day, my mother called me into the kitchen to fix something for her. As I was walking through the hallway, my dads hand pulled me into the closet and whispered ""That's not your mother"".


These pranks freaked my out and my little cousins too. One day, my cousins mother told me about this story. I will tell this like how she told me.


*So, I tucked my five year old son into bed, and he went to sleep. When It was time for him to go to school, I called him to get up and come to the living room, I was reading the newspaper while I came across this one article. ""Missing children"" It read. My son then ran to me screaming and crying saying ""A man pulled me into the closet telling me not to come to you!*

ohthankheaven,5,,16,1rbpkl,,46,"I don't have an exciting life. I wake up each morning at exactly 6:30AM, and by 7:15AM I'm starting the engine of my poorly kept up with vehicle and begin my venture to work. I'm late every single day by about fifteen minutes, to be precise. I don't care, they could fire me if they wanted, but I'm the kind of guy who comes to the office, keeps his mouth shut, and gets the job done. They also figure that the fifteen minutes of tardiness isn't so bad, compared to the hour and forty-five minutes of unpaid overtime they sentence me with every day. I would describe my job as dull, repetitive, and relentlessly boring, and correspondingly, so is my life. My house isn't particularly lavish. Living alone as a male really doesn't give your residence that home feeling. I'm not your average lonely, I lack companionship. I do not have a family, I do not have friends. Every day is the same. It's winter time and the days freeze together. 

My alarm goes off, I hit snooze. Again, the obnoxious ringtone I set on my phone crackles out of the tiny speaker, I hit snooze. After a third ring, I'm out of bed and on my way to work. It's freezing this morning and the heat in my car does not work. My weather-beaten jacket doesn't provide that much protection either. I scrape through the day, counting the minutes. 
The drive home from work offers my only source of human contact, and this lies in the sports talk radio station I listen to. Their snide remarks always make me laugh, and I sometimes call in to dispute some of the commentary they are making. It also feels good to have somebody to talk to, especially when you're as solitary as I am.

I don't choose to be this way. I am a single child and my parents died three years ago in a car accident. It was a tough loss, it put me in a downward spiral until I hit bottom, which just so happens to be where I still reside. I try to socialize and be friendly but it seems like I'm lost in the masses. Maybe I should be more interesting, or funny, or wear nicer clothes. I'm not good with these things. I started taking comfort in the internet. For me it felt safer, more secure from the harshness of the real world. Not that the internet isn't any less relentless, the only difference is I'm hiding behind a screen and a handle. I do not have a Facebook. I don't know if it's because I don't see the point of having one or I'm too scared to deal with the fact that I would lack companionship on there as well. I visit my favorite sports websites, browse Reddit, and enjoy YouTube. None of those things could ever satisfy my primal need for a physical partner in life, so eventually, I started using a dating website. A website that I don't feel the need to name. They are all the same anyway. It was slow at first. Slower than it took me to fill out my profile and eventually take a picture anyway. I didn't know what to write about myself, and even convincing myself to finally publicize my life in an attempt to get anyone to talk to was an effort in itself.  Months went by and I received no glimmer of hope. Suddenly, a chat prompt appeared on my laptop.
""Hello"", she said.

Her name is Julie, and she is beautiful. I don't know what she saw in me, but for the first time it is real, it is there. We spoke for years. Endless chat logs, phone calls, video chats. We shared tears, laughs, and something I never felt before, love. 

Two days ago I asked Julie to meet me for the first time, and she said yes. I was nervous at first, but extremely happy. I asked her if she wanted to have dinner, but she said she would rather just come to my house instead. Yesterday she came over, she really is a special girl. We hit it off so well that she decided to spend the night. She really is excited to have me now, I can hear her calling for me now. I have never felt so happy and so confident. There is one thing that is for certain, she will never leave me. Even if we fight, even if we argue, she still won't leave me. We are going to have a great time together, and we are going to play. Even if it turns out she doesn't like the games we play she still won't leave me. 

There is that chance though, that small chance that things won't work out. That chance that the love will fade and that abominable lonliness will come back. It scared me at first, because I can't go back to being alone again. I won't go back. I don't worry anymore though, because Julie loves me and the games we play, Julie loves to be with me, and Julie isn't strong enough to bend the bars of her basement cell.

DickBanditDoneLanded,11,,65,1r1zac,,42,"As a kid, I grew up singing songs of joy with my friends. Fun songs that made me feel like a child. There was one song that I never really liked, for reasons unbeknownst to me, but that one song would become a living hell during my adult life.

My wife packed my son's lunchbox with a pizza lunchables; It was always his favorite one. I had the privilege of walking him to school that cold October morning, holding his hand the whole walk. We talked about toys, games, and then the topic of songs came up.
""Hey, dad...how come you never showed me the song about Josh Jacob Jinglehyper Smith?"" he asked. ""Haha, you mean John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt? I never liked that song, kiddo,"" I replied. ""I thought his name was Josh, like mine!"" He added.

 We got to the school about half an hour earlier than the entry time, so I suggested we go to the playground located around back; Josh agreed and followed me. The air felt relatively dense that day, I could barely see fifty feet away and asked Josh to stay in sight and have a little fun before school starts. I look away at the birds in the trees and I'm startled by the piercing cry of my son, nowhere in sight. I call his name and he says ""Sorry, dad! I fell off the monkey bars, I'll be fine!"" I sighed and laughed a little knowing my kid was such a warrior. I notice Josh riding a swing and laughing with another little boy who also came to school too early. I see his father standing on the side, laughing and I worry about not being a good enough dad to Josh. I start to walk toward the boys and that's when it hits me; I wasn't watching Josh play, none of the two boys was mine. I tried to keep calm but felt the need to yell out his name to locate him. I look around the playground and the school bell rings, announcing the school's opening. The dense, foggy air dissipates and I'm able to see everything clearly. I find a note in the second floor of the jungle gym, it reads: ""I know how hard you tried to avoid me, I wouldn't want the same thing happening with Josh.""

My heart sank and my eyes widened as the note dropped on the mulch and made a thud. I felt every possible emotion at that one point in time. I didn't know what to do, where to go, who to ask for help, so I walked into the school, where I come across a corkboard with pictures of kids on it. All of these children were abducted by a strange man who walked into the forest beside the school. I knew what I had to do, I ran into the woods, clenching the note he had written. ""John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt!"" I hear a high pitched voice scream from the bushes, as I fall to the ground in fear.

 I noticed a building on a hill about a mile into the wild. It was a greenish wooden house, much like the ones mystery inc. would investigate, but this was not a game, this was my son's life and possibly that of many other children. The smell of rotting was emitting throughout the air, and I feared the worst for the status of the kids. Not willing to be detected, I snuck in through a window that was left open and creeped about the dark house with nothing but my signal-less cellphone and my dedication. I was in the basement floor and couldn't see anything, so I turned on my flashlight app. I had no idea I was about to come across one of the most horrible sights anyone could've seen.

 There were mutilated corpses, not just any corpses, but children, kids who I had met through class pictures my wife bought and showed me. The kids were decapitated, burned, sliced, naked. I was scared for my life, I almost threw up one too many times but swallowed it back along with my will to flee. I found a wooden staircase that was old and rotting. The first step I took on it made a loud creak and there was a groan in the distance. I hid behind a giant flowerpot as a huge figure approached the area I was in. I could barely breathe as I noticed this man had blood between his fingernails, as if he mutilated the children with nothing but his fingers. He returned to the room and I followed him from afar. The smell I picked up earlier was much stronger than before and I heard muffled cries coming from the room the man walked into. 
""Say it with me, now, kids!
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt! 
His name is my name too! 
Whenever we go out! 
The people always shout! 
There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schm-"" A kid bit a hole through the duct tape on his mouth and was able to scream while he sang. I heard the kid's name; It was Gary.

The children were all able to remove their mouth bindings and cried in unison for about ten seconds. Then I hear a loud laugh, followed by a ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" At this point, I was enraged. Nobody has the right to scream at kids like that, nobody. I barged in, grabbing this freak by his back-length hair and slamming his face into a table with limbs on it. ""What did you just say to those kids, you motherfucker?!"" I yelled, oblivious to the children in the room. ""You're gonna pay for all your shit, you son of a bitch!"" I said ""Well that's just too damn bad!"" He added ""I didn't know today was the day I'd be found! It's such a shame you've missed your playdate with your son...he was SUCH a nice boy!"" He said, laughing his head off at the sight of my expression. I was cold, I was numb. My son was dead.

 I unleashed my fury on the man, not holding back at all. I knocked him unconscious and tied him down to a giant piece of metal. I broke both his legs and made sure he'd never walk again, then I released the children, many starving and ready to go home. I tugged the slab down the hill and walked alongside the children toward the school. The police had previously raided the woods, but never came across the house in the entire year he had been performing the kidnappings. I called the school and notified the authorities of the serial killer I had slayed and I wanted to make sure he was arrested and would suffer his whole life for what he did to my wife and I. She was hysterical, unable to perform for almost a whole year. We cancelled any holidays and vacations and mourned a year away. We finally concluded that our son was happy in a better place with the rest of his friends. Although my wife and I never had any other children, I became teacher at an elementary school in another state and was happy knowing I had kids who were fun to be around and nice to me. 

One Monday morning, we have a new girl come in and I ask her to introduce herself. She's laughing and she's shy and she wants to whisper something in my ear. ""I'll introduce myself if we can just play today."" She says I promise her, along with the class, that we'll have a free day and she introduces herself and makes friends. I start to like this girl because I never had a chance to have a daughter and always wanted one. She was very sociable and was the class clown.

She stopped coming to school for a week, and out of curiosity, I called her parents to ask about her sudden disappearance. Her mother was crying and I couldn't understand her, so her father came to the phone. I told him about how the class missed her and he told me about a note that was left at their door one afternoon. It read: ""Go through her drawings"" I asked the dad to give me a minute while I did just that. *HE* was in the pictures. Every drawing she made had *him* hiding in the background. There was a folded piece of paper that was thicker than the rest. Little did I know, it wasn't school paper, it was skin; Pressed and cut to replicate a note. ""I thought, by now, you'd figure out I was never human"" I got on the phone to tell the girl's father the news, but all I heard was a demonic, maniacal laughter. I felt a hole in my chest, as the phone line went dead, followed by three beeps and elongated static.","His name is my name, too.",107,nosleep

On the outskirts of the large city known as Canto; a small cathedral stands unscathed by the horror happening not twenty miles away. There were some smaller towns outside of the city, but most of their residents fled as soon as the vague news reports of “cannibalistic” citizens came flooding in. In the end, those who were smart enough to run at the first sign of trouble were the only ones who made it, the hesitant died along with the rest of the city. 
However, this small cathedral was different. It was located in the middle of nowhere and had been long abandoned and forgotten by everyone, aside from the city itself the closest town to it was almost an hour way and a small dirt road was the only thing that even hinted that there was another world past the miles and miles of flat plains. The glow and black smoke from Canto can be seen in the distance.  
Short flashes of lightning filled the air, just long enough to illuminate a figure on top of the cathedral, his legs swung over the edge of the roof and head leaning against the lighting rod. The faint glow of a cigar intensified as he put it to his mouth. With a small grin played on his lips, he gazed dreamily at the city.
“What a sight. Obliteration has never looked so divine.” He whispered to himself. Images of a crumbling Jerusalem played through his head, “Well, I guess you can’t get much more divine than that.”
Feeling a little foolish for talking to himself again he took one last drag of his cigar and flicked it behind him. The man noticed that there was a thin layer of ash that had settled on to his body. Slightly irritated by this, the man glanced at his watch while getting to his feet, ruffling his short black hair in an attempt to get as much ash off his head as possible. His long black coat blew in the wind as he brushed it off. 
The temperature was dropping fast, it wouldn’t be long until the rain began to pour. The man wondered if it would be enough to quench the flames of the city. The Vatican ordered complete destruction; they wanted nothing standing of what they thought to be a “heathen city”. The man wouldn’t feel accomplished if the flames were so easily disposed of. Glancing at his watch again figuring he had roughly another half hour before the he was picked up and debriefed. He leaned back against the lightning rod, and lit another cigar, daydreaming of the day before.
****************************************

One bite, one citizen, and his work was done. His mission was to just get the ball rolling, nothing more. Being as potent as he was, his victims often became immensely strong. They were puppets, sure; but also unstable. The more of them that were roaming the streets the more dangerous the mop up was for the church. The man was frustrated that he only got one snack, he was tired of the left over’s from corpses and the donations from Italian blood banks. He was craving prey with more… life to it, one he could enjoy stalking before the kill.
The Vatican dispatched him and a helicopter to the abandoned cathedral. Along with being the drop point, the house of God was also were he was supposed to rendezvous with the evac crew. His orders were to simply enter the city, light the spark, and watch “God cleanse the Earth” from the cathedral. 
“You zealots are no fun!” he would tell them “I’m doing “God’s work” for you lazy ass holes, the least you could do is let me off the leash!”
The hungry man could not help but feel disappointed when they were offended. They preached how the last crusade was such a failure due to the fact he had so much “freedom”, the mobs of the powerful undead nearly completely consumed the Holy army.
It pissed him off that they never got over that.
He resolved that it was never really his fault, humans were frail, weak creatures. They are easy to corrupt in every way. None of them could handle the thirst, and they tore everything apart. Turning their victims into, for lack of a better word, zombies. 
The Pope himself preformed the unnecessary but “ritualistic” blessing before he set off.
“Vai quarto Locke e fornire i nostri nemici a Dio.”
“Deliver them I shall.” He sarcastically whispered to himself with a smirk. The helicopter was taking off; it was time to go to work.
Locke could not stop thinking about his one victim, regardless of whom it was he planned to savor every last second of his feast.
****************************************

The man found himself seeking a challenge. In the back of his mind he knew he wouldn’t get one, but the fantasy of a dangerous prey kept his thoughts occupied as he made his way towards the glistening city. 
With the pace he was traveling at it wouldn’t be long before reached the edge of Canto, his long strides covered more distance, faster than a high-end sports car going ninety on an open freeway. The cool night air was refreshing to him, it’s not often he is allowed to roam out in the open like this. He slowed down a bit to prolong this finite feeling of freedom.
Being cooped up under Vatican City for so long had begun to take its toll on Locke’s sanity. Other than living off nothing but the scraps of Roma, he had no real connection to the outside world. It’s not like he longed to live amongst the humans, no, the thought of that made him sick. The only reason he could stand the “Men of God” back at the Vatican was because they were as far away from human as possible. He’s seen them put on human masks, sure, seen them absolve the masses with a crooked smile, seen them preach peace and the word of God to a thousand ignorant faces. No, no, behind their masks, they are every bit a monster as Locke.
The city was drawing closer, massive sky scrapers were lit up in a brilliant fashion. A sense of intrigue radiated from surrounding, smaller clusters of lights. What were the humans doing at this hour? Were they working overtime, tucking the children in, late night binge drinking at the local bar? They were all so very ignorant of the malevolent fury of God that was about to rain down upon them. Sure, it looked pretty from a distance, but Canto was the antithesis when viewed up close. The Vatican made it clear to Locke that this was not a city that deserves pity, even though he never considered giving it anyways, he asked to be briefed on the city’s situation.
Canto was dying, almost all who’ve entered abandoned all hope for it when they saw what a hell hole it has become. Corruption plagued the city’s central government, all of the representatives’ power focused on how to make the wealthy more capable of shitting on the poor. As a result, crime was abundant. Drug trafficking, prostitution, child labor plagued the down town streets. Whole families were often caught in cases of “indentured servitude” as the wealthy put it, where even the children would have to be at the beckon call of the privileged, doing strenuous and dangerous work that led to more than a few deceased children. Anyone who cried foul ended up dead too, it was just the way it went. 
And it was reason enough to cleanse it.
Locke reached the edge of Canto, he could now hear the grumbling sounds of the suffering city, a siren blared unceasingly somewhere among the throngs of buildings. Looking at his watch the man whispered to himself.
“Time to light the match.”
****************************************

Upon entering the city, Locke found to his disappointment, that there was no shortage of easy prey. The homeless aimlessly wandered the streets, practically half dead already, prostitutes looking vulnerable as ever. He was slightly surprised, however, to find a couple of security guards having a smoke outside of a large ominously lit building. A young woman dressed in rags, stumbled past them, she was appeared very exhausted and in need of medical care. The guards just looked upon her and laughed, asking the woman unrepeatable questions. When she didn’t respond to their cat calls one of the men grew frustrated and ran after her. She let out a quick yelp of pain as he put his cigarette out on the back of her neck.
In a very swift motion the girl whirled around, grabbing the guard’s wrist and pulling him close. The man’s face was within an inch of hers, his expression showed that of pure pain. She had broken his wrist. In a split second she revealed a small revolver, put it to the man’s chin, and pulled the trigger.
There was a bright flash, then a spray of crimson red. The man’s body crumpled to the newly painted sidewalk, with a softball sized hole where his skull used to be. The woman was already on the other guard before he was done unhooking the strap to his sidearm. Landing knees first on the guard’s chest she pinned him to the ground. Grabbing a firm hold of her prey’s head, with both hands she lifted up his skull and brought it back down to the concrete. Over and over again she did this, until the guard was pulverized into the sidewalk.
It was all over that quickly. She stood up without a sound, her face expressionless except for a small smirk that crept on the edge of her lips, she bent over to pick up her revolver that lie next to body of the first guard. She shot Locke a quick glance and disappeared around the corner. While the look she gave him was quick, it was more than enough to excite him. She had piercing brown eyes that screamed strength, and short, dirty, black hair that was almost just long enough to veil her left eye. Locke knew her just by that single, short glance. He knew her struggles, knew her strength, and knew her will to survive.
He knew he had found his prey.
The building the two guards were once protecting let out the piercing wale of an emergency siren, snapping Locke out of his mystified state. It was then he noticed the streets were completely empty, not a piece of human filth to be seen. Whoever the guards were protecting called for backup and he had mere minutes to escape. A thought crossed his mind, and made him almost consider revealing himself to the approaching authorities before pounding them into dust. Not wanting to risk compromising the mission, Locke reluctantly retreated into a dark alley way. He scaled his way to the roof tops from there and began the hunt for his new found prey. 
****************************************
The mystery woman’s scent was still live and growing stronger as he strides across the apartment building rooftops. Locke’s mind wandered back to the two guards, how efficiently and violently she dispatched them. Two full grown, armed men could not handle the slender girl half their size. Where can a human learn to kill like that? Without mercy or emotion, just pure unadulterated instinct. After searching for a short time he came across her entering a dimly lit liquor store, only to return moments later with a bag clenched in her fist. 
The hunger was starting to get to him, it was a ravenous gnawing that made his whole body tremble with anticipation. He knelt down on one knee and gazed down at her from the roof tops. Across the street from where Locke sat perched he saw her lean against a brick wall, and begin chugging whatever was in the paper bag. Locke felt his heart sink, he had to stop her quickly or that alcohol will kill all the fun. What was the fun in feeding from intoxicated prey? He let out a small sigh and leapt off the building, and descended to the street below. 
The woman let out a small yelp as Locke landed safely in front of her. A small cloud of dust and filth from the city escaped from under his feet, leaving a small clear circle around where he landed.
For a moment she just stared at him as he rose to his feet. Only a dim street light illuminated the empty street, the only thing she could make of the man was a pair of piercing red eyes that glowed like the moon.
“There is something magnificent about the moment you make yourself known to your prey,” spoke the man. His voice had a crisp, raspy tone to it, full of anticipation and a hint of sensuality.
The woman’s eyes widened at this, not out of fear however; it was more like she just received a jolt of electricity, the grip on her bottle tightened. She put on a smirk and spoke with an authoritative tone. 
 “Listen, I’ve had a long day. I already have had to deal with two assholes today,” she lifted her hands almost defensively, to reveal that they were caked with dried blood. 
“I caved both their heads in before they learned their place, maybe I should take my time with you so I can really make a statement around here.”
The man cocked his head a bit to the side at this threat, amused and intrigued by her intensity. He opened his arms wide as if to bow and took a step forward. The woman reacted quickly and swung the bag at Locke’s head. The sharp crash of the class mixed with the sound of cracking bone traveled all the way down the street. 
The woman expected the perfect stranger to be on the ground bleeding, begging for his life like she has seen so many other “men” do. 
However, the man was still standing. Aside from a small shard of glass that was lodged in the left side of his face, he was completely unfazed by the vicious attack. Locke licked his lips as the remaining alcohol from the bottle trickled down his face.
“Hmm, I’m not much of a whisky man. I prefer a more... ,” he paused for a moment as he watched the panic in his prey begin to rise “… exotic spirit.” 
He began to chuckle to himself, in all reality the whole situation was darkly humorous to him. This is the most pain he’s been in in years, and that is saying something. His chuckle escalated to a howling laughter.
The woman wore a look that held a combination of shock and excitement. Even though she was beginning to panic, a smile spread across her face. Not once in her entire time in Canto has she met a man who could last more than 2 minutes in fight with her, much less one who could so easily brush off a whisky bottle to the head.
She watched as the man’s laughter grew, his bloodshot eyes screamed madness.
“It’s time to put you down you crazy son-of-a-bitch,” she said with a smile. 
She slowly removed the revolver she used to kill the security guard, the aged blood glistened in what little light was available. The sight of the gun just seemed to incite a stronger laughing fit out of Locke. The woman extended her arm and placed the barrel of the gun into the man’s open mouth, and pulled the trigger.
Again, there was a quick flash. His head snapped back with full force, but he remained on his feet, never ceasing his laughter that grew into the howling of a demon. He lowered his head, fixing his blood red eyes on the woman.
He was able to stop his laughter long enough to respond to the horrified look on his prey’s face. 
“What’s the matter baby doll? You seemed surprised you can’t dispatch me as easily as those two security guards,” Locke began to laugh again “Honey, they are nothing compared to a true monster.”     
Locke took one last look at his victim, then opened his jaws to reveal several sharp teeth. The hole left by the bullet can be clearly seen as he made the final move on his prey.                           
****************************************
The man wiped his mouth and looked down at his meal. The woman’s eyes were glossed with fear, but there was an eerie smile that still crept on her lips as she stared blankly into the night sky. 
Locke allowed the woman’s essence to dissolve and flow throughout his body. Fresh blood from a living victim holds a piece of that person’s life and personality. Anyone who takes that essence inherits a part of that person’s life. All their thoughts, feelings, information becomes a part of the predator’s body and soul. 
“Veronica,” He whispered
The woman’s body began to violently shake. She was beginning to reanimate. 
Locke felt a slight pang of worry in the back of his mind. A human of her caliber would be a serious threat as a vampire, everything about her will be augmented and enhanced. 
Locke looked back at the shaking body. 
“Give those zealots hell for me, Veronica.”
Turning around he began to make his way to the edge of the city, the sun was going to be rising soon it was in his best interest to get back to the Cathedral as fast as he can. 
He had lit the match 
“Canto will be devoured by flames by tomorrow night.” Locke finally said with a smile.
                               ****************************************
 The enveloping darkness cascaded across the night sky. Leaving the silhouettes of clouds drift overhead, like veils of moving sentinels, suffocating the very light out of the stars. The scent of moisture and smoke hung thick in the air. The sound of distant thunder boomed across the sky, echoing into the midnight horizon. A light from below slightly illuminated the world, trails of thick black smoke were dressed in the light painted on by miles of inferno. It was as if the gates of hell opened under the earth, releasing and delivering throngs of angel’s utmost nightmares unto God’s domain. The pounding hearts of a million terrified saints could be heard as the sky boomed again. 
Below the heavens, true evil incarnate devoured the world. Sky scrapers wore flames from head to toe, fire danced on the water under decimated bridges, streets were in chaos, destroyed vehicles littered the crowed avenues. Exposed hands and limbs peek out from under of overturned cars, burning corpses are contorted in horrible positions behind the wheel of their tombs. Police stations show no sign of life, a constant siren blares somewhere in the city, with nothing living left to answer. The city, its souls, everything was devoured by chaos.
Well, almost everything.

TheeMikeG,20,,10,1rdk7o,,42,"Hey, all, I’ll try and make this quick because I don’t know how much time I have. My name is Cliff and I live in a nice two-story house in a suburb in California. I have a loving wife and an amazing little princess of a daughter. Today I woke up and went downstairs to see her watching Sunday morning cartoons on our small, discolored TV. She turned up at me and smiled, jumping to wrap her arms around my leg. 

“Daddy! Mom wanted me to tell you that she left a note for you on the counter.”

I rubbed my fingers through her bleach blonde hair before turning to retrieve the note.

Morning honey, it read, have fun today on your father-daughter day! She is really looking forward to spending quality time with you. Maybe take her to that new movie she won’t stop talking about? 	

I set down the note and crept up behind my daughter who had returned her attention the the TV. I sprung, tickling her as she laughed and laughed. Stopping, I gave her a kiss on the back of her head and smiled. 

“So what do you want to do today?” 

She shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t know, can we get icecream?” Her eyes lit up with excitement and she nodded enthusiastically. 

I chuckled, “Yeah, that sounds great. Do you wanna see that movie too?” 

She clapped her hands and giggled cutely. “Yes!” she shouted.

I smiled and pocketed the car keys I had left on the counter the day before. “Ok, go get ready, I’ll be down here waiting.” 

“Ok daddy!” she smiled before bounding up the stairs. “I love you!”

“I love you too!” I shouted after her. I walked towards the TV and shut it off. Yawning, I walked through the eerily quiet house to the fridge. The silence was almost unsettling. I glanced around, looking out the windows for nothing in particular. 

“Almost ready!” yelled my daughter from her bedroom upstairs. 

I shook my head with amusement. I could remember the first time I saw her in the hospital. I promised I would care for her like no one else. So far I had kept my promise, and we’ve been inseparable since. Guilt struck me as I recalled how much I’d been working lately and hadn’t been home to spend time with her. My wife had been telling me late at night when I’d finally come home how our daughter would spend most of the day crying in her room asking for her daddy. Today I was going to make it all up to her. Right after I grabbed a snack. 

I smiled to myself and opened the fridge. The decapitated body of my wife tumbled out and knocked me to the floor, covering me in blood.

I screamed and scrambled backwards until I slammed into the cabinets under the sink. My daughter came skipping into the kitchen holding a knife in one hand and my wife’s head in the other. Her face was distorted as if she was screaming when the blade fell. “I’m almost ready!” she giggled before smiling real wide. “There’s just one more thing I need. Then we can spend the whole day together.”

I got to my feet but took a nasty cut to the leg. I managed to get past her and upstairs, and into my bedroom behind a locked door before she reached it. I can hear her slowly dragging the tip of the knife against the door. She keeps saying “Daddy, please come to the door, I miss you!” She might even be crying, she sounds so sad. I already called the police, I just wanted to leave a tangible record of what’s happening. But I’m sure I could handle this on my own right? I mean she’s a little girl! I might just go to the door now. What do you think?

youngsterjose42,3,,10,1rd8lb,,37,"My mother once told me a story, her sister had an encounter with the paranormal that eventually lead to her suicide... this is that story.

My mother had a sister once, I remember my earliest memories of her, she was always so depressed and I always asked why was she sad. She never had an answer. My mother told me it all started one night when she came home from work. She was walking the streets around midnight heading home when she noticed a man walking behind her. It wasn't the first time she had been followed by this man, Only difference was... this time he tried to talk to my aunt. He asked ""are you happy with your family? aren't you tired of living in a house of religious fools?"". She was scared and asked ""who are you?"" and my mother told me as soon as he stepped out of the shadows my aunt saw his face he looked rather normal except for his long hair and ember red eyes. He smiled and said ""your people call me the devil"" and she started to run. She ran as fast as she could. Eventually my aunt got the house of my mother and she explained what happened. My mother tried to calm her down, my aunt was breathing heavily and could not control herself. Soon enough she passed out.

A few days pass by and my mother sees that my aunt has a serious problem. She didn't go to work for about a week and she felt as if she was not safe at my mothers house. So she moved back to my grandmothers house. They were extremely religious and for some reason my aunt felt safe at her house. The same night she moved back in to her mothers house something happened that drove her into being institutionalized. It was around 1 in the morning and my grandfather and grandmother were fighting. My aunt knew she was awake because she could see her mother. she was in the kitchen and she was looking through the crack in the door. she suddenly felt something brush up against her arm. Her breath taken away, her eyes wide open, she turns around and sees the man claiming to be ""the devil"". He says ""tell me whats wrong. I know, I know something's wrong let me take you away from all your troubles"" she screamed as loud as she could until her mother and father came into the room, they turned on the lights and she kept staring at the empty space next to her bed. My grandmother started yelling at her ""are you crazy?! do you have any idea how late it is?! why are you screaming?!"" she kept going and going until my aunt finally screamed ""the devil, he's after me mom!"" my grandmother was religious, still is, but for some reason she did not believe my aunt and they put her away in a hospital for about a month or two.

While in the hospital my aunt told my mother what she saw in there. They had to put her on several medications before she stopped seeing the man. Every now and then she would try to fall asleep in the hospital while the man watched she said she heard him bragging ""you know they'll never believe you"" or ""you know they cant see me"". When the lights went out she closed her eyes. She could hear his threats, she could hear him mocking her life. She always kept her eyes closed she did not want to see his silhouette even less his ember red eyes. She described him as a physical being yet at the same time he did not exist. At some points she thought she was arguing with herself until she realized the voice was overlapping her voice, her thoughts. She had nightmares almost every night in that hospital. Around 2 month goes by in there and she pretends to be fine they let her out a week or so later. 

My mom did not hear of her for about 3 months after she got out of the hospital. My mother was worried and she sent out search parties she called cops. Yet she never found her. Turns out she was hiding in the woods. She didn't want see anyone, my aunt told my mother that she never gave in. I don't know the way my mom told me I can only assume she was lying. She told me how she lived in the woods for a few months living off whatever she could find. She explained to my mother how he never left her side, he was always there talking to her, he did not want to let her go. My mother told me that the last thing my aunt told to her was something this man, ""the devil"" said to my aunt "" i want you"" she ended up killing herself a week after. She was weak and brittle and was basically a walking corpse. A few members of the family came to her funeral, not many though that's what my mother told me. My grandmother did not go. She was embarrassed of her daughter and the fact that she killed herself.

A few months later after the funeral my mother gets off work around 8pm its still light out so she thinks ""why not visit my sister she needs it"" so she walks to the cemetery. It was almost sunset and my mother told me she sees a man placing flowers on her gravestone. My mother has never seen this man before and she starts running towards him as he walks away she starts running faster. He disappears into the woods and just before he did he looked back and my mother saw his ember red eyes. She told me ""some things in this world happen that cant be explained and that was one of those things.""",My Aunt,47,nosleep
REALreptus,7,,22,1r8gsb,,37,"I was about 13 living in CA at the time and like any other 13 year old kid I was best friends with the boy that lived down the street. We often spent the night at each other's houses, but when we spent the night over at his house I would always try to get him to agree for us to sleep out in his huge treehouse, we would stay up till dawn eating candy, chips, and playing playstation until our eyeballs hurt. I always asked him if we could sleep outside because the first and only time we ever slept in his house, I saw this ghost. The ghost himself was a tall man wearing a black coat with a big black hat that sort of looked that that cool hat that Hugh Jackman wears in Van Helsing, and he didn't have a solid or not solid form, I know that sounds weird, but it was like he was there, but wasn't at the same time. I guess the best way I could describe it would be like really thick black static in the shape of a really tall dude wearing a cloak and hat. Well my best friend's little sister would always talk about this guy in the hat, I think the exact way that she referred to him was ""The guy in the hat"", but we were to busy doing our own thing to ever listen to her, to us she was just my friend's annoying little sister that wanted to follow us around and do what we were doing. Well that night while we were playing video games, I glanced down his hallway and at the very end of it there was the man in the hat, but I had only glanced, and when I did a double take, he was gone, so I just ignored it. That sort of glance and disappear thing happened like 2 more times before we went to bed. Now what happened next is what made me never want to spend the night in his house again. We fell asleep just fine, no nightmares, no spooky visions before closing our eyes, but around 3am, no, not exactly 3am, I was young and scared and didn't look at the time, so I'm just guessing it was around 3am, every single radio in his house turned on at the same time and at full volume, and it wasn't music or even just static that played, it was this really deep and low pitch rumble that came out at full blast. It didn't say anything, I don't even know if it was a voice or anything, all I remember is that it scared the living shit out of me. His mom got up and shut off all the radios and yelled at us cause she thought we did it as a joke or something, and wouldn't listen to us when we said were where both sleeping when it happend. My family moved away about 6 months or so after this and I haven't heard from my friend since, I don't know anything about the house or the land or if there was a murder there or whatever, it's just something that happened to me as a kid and something I'll never forget.",I was about 13 when this happend at a friends house.,59,nosleep
childrenofsamhain,9,,6,1rhdoj,,34,"My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Until recently, he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters, Sarah and Emily. Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three. Within the first two years living in the house, Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't until his daughter Sarah was around two years old, that he started to notice she talked to herself. Jamie thought nothing of it, she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself. 

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""Is she your imaginary friend?""

""I guess."" 

Amused, he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall, whispering quietly. ""What's your friends name?"" he asked her. 

""Her name is Helen Mary"", she said. 

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

blkmagick,8,,6,1r8old,,32,"My father was in the military, which meant that we moved around a lot as I was growing up. One of the places we moved to was Pensacola, FL. We moved there right before 8th grade started for me, and we lived in military housing so we got to live in a two story house for the very first time. I was excited; I got my own room and my own bathroom right across the hallway. 

Things were great, until after a year of living in the house when things started to get strange. I was home alone talking to my boyfriend on the phone when I heard a large crash in the kitchen. I slowly walk in to see what happened, and one of the cabinet doors were wide open and bowls were all over the floor. I quickly pick up the bowls and put them away, freaking out. I was in there just five minutes earlier and everything was closed; there was no way for the cabinet to open on its own. I ran up to my room and locked my door until my family came home. When they returned, they asked why bowls were all over the floor in the kitchen. 

A week after that incident, I woke up suddenly out of a deep sleep, gasping for breath. I looked at my doorway and I see a girl standing there. She was wearing an old white nightgown stained with blood, and she had long black hair. Her throat was slit and hastily stitched up, along with her lips being stitched together. Her eyes were gouged and missing, and her hands were chopped off. 

Thinking it was just my imagination, I closed my eyes and reopened them, only to see she had moved closer. With each blink, the closer she would get, so I threw the covers over my head and prayed that she didn't touch me. I ended up falling asleep and awoke in the morning with her nowhere to be found. 

Over the next year, she would appear every other week, just watching me. I got used to it eventually, because I thought it was just a chronic bad dream and she didn't do anything to hurt me. It wasn't until after we moved to back to Michigan did I get really scared. My sister and I were talking and sharing stories about our house in Florida, and she told me something troubling. She mentioned that if she had to use the restroom in the middle of the night, she would always use my parent's bathroom in their room instead of the one across my bedroom. I asked her why, and her response was:

""Because I would always see a girl in white standing outside of your door and it scared me.""

Knowing that I wasn't the only one that saw her terrified me, because I knew it wasn't just a dream. I still wonder if she appears for the new family that's in the house and who she is and what happened to her. I have to say though, I'm just glad to be out of that house.

I’ve never had suicidal thoughts myself, I’ve been depressed but that’s just life, you can’t be happy all the time. 

**Most** people don’t think of the repercussions that can happen when they have suicidal thoughts as they just think that no one cares about them so they assume that they don’t have a reason to live and just want to end their lives.

Isn’t it weird how one thing can change your life drastically? From good to bad? I don’t know, I can’t explain it but I’ve always found it weird how one thing in the universe can make your life go from being good to bad or vice versa.

                                                                                                                                                                                              


My dad had a great friend (no names) once who was amazing, he had a job that he enjoyed a lot which was him being a train driver.

My dads friend was driving a train to Glasgow when out of nowhere, a person jumped onto the tracks and died instantly. When this happened, my dads friends life just stopped, I can’t really explain it myself as I wasn’t the driver, he was. 

But can you just imagine driving a train, not seeing/seeing a young person jump in front of a train whilst not being able to stop the train from hitting that person? With their blood splattering the window and tracks. I mean the average speed limit of being hit by a car going 30 miles per hour can kill you, just imagine being hit by a train going like 5 times faster than that.

After that happened, my dads friend was just at a loss, he felt like it was his fault as he was the driver. Nothing my dad said, my dads other friends and his family could cheer him up and his life was just spiraling downhill and it was just one thing after another that made him even more depressed and aggressive.

We were the same age and she looked just like me. She would come to school and even stay all night at my house but no one else could see her. She wanted to be seen so badly.Sometimes she would get angry.One time she was so mad she scratched my arm and told me if I said anything to anyone she would hurt my parents.  She was always there staring at me, she wouldn't even blink. One day I started to cry. I was scared. my mother finally asked what was going on and I told her. ""Its Madi mom my friend she's mad at me.""The look on her face went from concern to questioning. ""who's madi honey"" I didn't want to answer her madi was in the corner of the room ripping her hair out and her eyes had grown dark.I told her she was my friend but no one could see her aside from me. My mother at that point thinking it was some silly kid thing began to joke around. ""oh and what does this madi look like?"" I told her she looked just like me and my mother froze.

lovelylizards,4,,4,1rc40h,,29,"I've always loved pictures, it's like capturing memories to look at later. I take them any chance I get. I guess you could call it an unhealthy obsession. Being a little homesick lately, I've been going through old albums. I wish I hadn't.

I invited my sister, Nicole, over. We poured a couple glasses of wine and got out photo albums, scrapbooks, whatever we could find. It was nice having a change instead of my boring routine, but I'd definitely pick that over what happened next. 

After a couple drinks, a few laughs, and tons of pictures, we started to notice something. There was a man in every picture I was in. Just standing there, in the distance, smiling. At first I thought it was just a coincidence, but the more I looked, the more I recognized his face. I've seen this man before. He looked like a normal man, roughly 6 feet, brown hair, bright green eyes. The one thing that was off is that he was always smiling. I didn't think too much of it, it was getting late. Nicole went home by then so I decided to head off to bed. 


I usually never have nightmares, a few in a year at most. Tonight was different. I don't know if you'd call it a nightmare, but it was enough to scare the shit out of me. I was in a dark room, with nothing but a chair and a window. The window didn't open. I could see that man. He was behind a tree and just looking at me, mouthing some words I couldn't make out. Soon after, he started walking towards me slowly. He walked right through the window, he was just about to walk up to me when I woke up in a sweat. I wasn't sure what this meant, or why I was so terrified by it but I shook it off and went back to sleep.

The next day was rather normal. I was out running errands, as usual. It was when I was in Best Buy that I saw that damn guy again. Just smiling at me, staring at me with those bright green eyes. I decided to go up to him. 


""Excuse me, sir. May I help you?""


Nothing.


""Sir?""


Again, nothing. 

After what seemed like forever, just as I was about to walk away he said something. 


""I've been waiting for this.""


""Um, waiting for what?""


""This, you."" 


I got really uncomfortable, and felt it was best to walk away. On my way out the door I heard him say quietly ""Have a nice day, Jennifer."" Okay, how the hell did this freak know my name. I just wanted to go home and sleep. I left the store and continued on my way home. 

As I walked up to my door I found a photograph. It was of me, getting into my car at Best Buy. I was hoping this was just some prank because I didn't want to think of the alternatives. I looked on the back and one sentence has never scared me so much


""I've waited too long."" 


I had no idea what the hell this meant but I was getting sick of it. I didn't know what to do so I decided it would be best to just go to bed and get some much needed sleep. As I laid down and got comfortable, I heard a scratch by the window.

The first instance was about 5 months ago, i heard a singular door bell ring at 7am, it woke me up, and i didn't think much of it. Later that day i asked my mother if she heard anything and she said no you're dreaming.

Now im not a crazy person, i am probably the most sane person you would ever meet, in addition i don't do drugs, or drink

So i don't think much about it, thinking my parents their old im young, young people have better hearing than old people.

But this keeps happening around the same time 7am, and im thinking who the heck is this, is this some joke is this the delivery man?

No it wouldn't be a delivery this early ever

Whenever im home alone i have the habbit of whenever the door bell rings i don't answer it, so it was about 4pm one day and a singular door bell ring happens, i tip toe and peek out the front window, i wasn't very fast so i saw nothing, and it never rung again.

A month later, its about 6pm, singular door bell ring, im there in 20seconds, nothing, front gate not moving, again me alone in the house.

Am i imagining all this? there is no way i am not crazy

Coincidence or not, a few days later my mum is in the house, the door rings, my mum answers, its my elderly neighbour.

So i think to myself so it was her all along, all those times i never answered the door it was her, even the times at 7am, shes old ok old people wake up early... ok case closed right.

Today

4:53am singular door bell ring, wakes me up from my sleep, i am not freaking crazy, you know how a door bell sounds, its long it lasts about 3 seconds, i am awake and i can hear the second half of the ring all around my house

I go back to sleep because i was tired, then it rings again at 7am... i tell my mum when i wake up says she didn't hear anything

Heres the good part my dad thinks im crazy too so bought some cctv security cameras and has installed one at our front porch

Today I rewinded the tape to 6:45am, 

I see two lumps laying vertically on our front porch, it is two people in sleeping bags

Skip forward to 6:55am

They get up, I see two men one wears a long brown coat and a black hat, he is big and fat but i couldn't see his face, the other guy is thin and small, he was wearing grey sweat pants and a grey sweater...

Him i saw, his face was skinny and pale almost half skeleton he has yellow rotten teeth

7:00am

I see him ringing our door bell then go back to sleep in his sleeping bag same with big fat guy, they zip themselves up before you could see their heads but here they zip themselves all the way up, and inch away like caterpillars, out of camera view (this took 3mins)

WTF - was this their sick way of saying thankyou for your hospitality 

(I rewinded the tape further they came at 3:09am and started sleeping on our front porch)

I think the ring at 4:53am meant the time they showed, i might have been in deep sleep the other times idk. I also think they hop our fence, I told my dad to put a camera there too, called cops shown them this, there's a patrol car outside our house right now.

WILLingtonegotiate,11,,5,1rdxhm,,29,"Well to start things off I have a hard time convincing myself that any of this is supernatural. Just extremely weird, somewhat scary. It may be due to the fact I worry about my families safety, more than anything. Well, I will start from the beginning.

We moved into our new home around the end of August. We resettled here in San Antonio due to my wifes employer requiring her to live here.  I say ""new"" home because it is just that, a NEW home. The neighborhood is new as well. All the homes are brand new the oldest being around a year old. We love the area. Awesome neighbors, rural setting, though stores still within walking distance. 

We know absolutely nobody in this town, so we have pretty much stuck to ourselves in the short time here so far. We live in a 4 bedroom house, with our three children's rooms upstairs and my wife and myself sleeping in the master bedroom downstairs. Our room is literally 10 feet from the front door. I say this because my story revolves quite a lot around that very front door.  

Around our third night in the new home is when it started. DING......DONGGGGGG!!!! The second part of the doorbell sound was separated by about 2 seconds. I don't know why I find that eerie.   DING......DONGGGGGG. 
DINGDONG DINGDONG DINGDONG
These three were quite rapid taps on the doorbell.

I must have woke on the first ring but did not quite have my mind working yet, much less my body. I open my eyes and hear the long drawn out sound of the doorbell being pressed firmly. Then three rapid taps. My room is completely dark, only lit by the blue lights of the alarm clock. This same clock showed me at this moment it was 2:30 am. 

""Wtf"", I thought. I immediately started fidgeting in my drawer for my handgun, it's a Glock 23 with an extremely bright light attached just under the barrel. It would be quite handy in a few minutes.  I grab a magazine, slide it in and chamber a round. With a flick of the switch the super bright beam illuminates my room and my clear path to the front door.

As I sleepily stumble my way to the front door I hear another rapid ring of the doorbell followed by a deep, loud, booming knock.  I check through the peephole and can make out the top of a mans head, as if he were leaning on the door, listening for any type of movement coming from within my house. I place my weapon on the door around where I figure this persons head to be and I speak.

""Who is it?!!"" I shouted

My question was greeted by only what I can describe as the loudest silence I had ever felt wash over me.

Again I shout, ""Who is it?!!"".
And I hear him for the first time.
""It's me, Daniel"", replied the dry, calm yet exhausted voice of the man outside my door. 
""I do not know a Daniel!"" I replied sternly. ""What do you want?"" I asked.
""I've been left here, I do not know where I am and I just need a place to sleep."" Replied the oddly calm voice just inches away from the barrel of my gun.
""You have 3 seconds to leave my property or I will shoot you where you stand!"" I said this with a very loud and booming command. In retrospect this seems harsh and I am not proud of it. It was after 2am and I was worried for the safety of my family. I mean no ""good"" person would do this type of thing to a stranger, right?

I start to count, ""1...........2"" just then I look out the peephole, and no one is there. ""3"", the 3 was noticeably quieter than the previous two in the countdown. I have a bathroom just off the foyer and it's window has a clear view of the front door.  I peer out of it, no one there. I think to myself ""okay, he got the point."" Oh shit what if he didn't and this asshole is now taking revenge on my wifes car or worse my baby (truck). I decided I would need to go outside, against my inner monologue telling my white ass to stay inside.

I enter my room to grab my shoes, and got a shock as my wife broke the silence.

""You are not going outside after that!!!"" She exclaimed. She must have heard the entire thing.

""Do you want this asshole screwing with our cars?"" I asked.

""I could care less, you are NOT going out there!!"" She again rattled off.

""Baby, go back to sleep I will be fine."" I assured her.

I get my shoes on, go to the front door and that is when I saw something so  simple yet extremely terrifying. The door had been unlocked this whole time. I do not know why but this had a huge effect on my nerves at the moment that it was noticed. I check the bathroom window once again a quickly snap open the front door while sweeping every bit of the front porch with the barrel of my weapon, the beam from it's attached light painting my yard as if it were the broadest brush in the pale. Nothing. I step outside and onto the wet grass. I check the side yard closest to my door, and then start towards the driveway. The vehicles looked fine as I could see them clearly due to the very bright street lamp illuminating my driveway. No sign of ""Daniel"". I start to check the other side of my home when I hear it. Thinking of it right now sends chills all the way down my body. 

""I'm right here."" Replied Daniel in a scratchy but clear whisper.

This was so chilling at the time, that I could not bring myself to turn around right away. It felt as if he were inches from me. Right behind me, staring. I feel a little embarrassed to say it took quite a lot of courage to turn around, but when I did, I was surprised. Daniel had not been directly behind me, but about twenty feet away, sitting on the curb beside my driveway facing away from me. His silhouette small and twig like. There was a lot of light coming from the street light across the street yet he seemed strangely dark. As if he were able to escape the lights grasp ever so slightly. I remedied this with the light beaming from beneath my pistol. When I illuminated him, it was not what I was expecting. 

Maybe my being terrified at the moment had me thinking irrationally. I was expecting an old bearded ghost of a man waiting for me to peer into his cold dead eyes, only to grasp my soul and rip it out through my throat, I know, too many movies right? This was a noticeably unkempt young man but not dirty, more of a grungy type of look going on. He was wearing a vertically striped orange and green striped tight fitting sweater, he was african american and seemed to be in his early twenties. He sat there seemingly in no hurry to turn around and greet me, legs stretched out into the street, hands placed palm down stretched out behind him, fingers noticeable grasping at the blades of grass between them. 

""What do you need?"" I rattle off, with an understandably shaky voice.

""Only what I asked for."" He replied, again way too calm for the situation. 

""I suggest you get up and move on before I call the police!"" I say. I crinfe now thinking of how I reacted to this young man. 

""That will be fine, would you do that for me, would you call them for me?"" He spat back, as he peered slowly over his right shoulder at me, his eyes closed tight seemingly due to my extremely bright light beaming into the back of his head.

""Sure, do you fucking realize how close you were to being shot man?"" I ask.

""Why on earth would you shoot me? I could have walked into your home, without ever knocking, right?"" He said this the way a mother would say it to her child when revealing she knew a secret the child thought nobody knew.

""Alright, move the FUCK on dude, NOW!"" I shouted but noticeably terrified now.

He rose to his feet, seemingly in one movement. Turned to me, his hand stretched out as to block the beam of light so he could open his eyes and look at me. He opened his eyes which were noticeably bloodshot and just looked at me, staring as if he were asking me to lower the light, which I did. As I did this he showed me his hands first palm then the back of his hands like a magician would when assuring his audience he had nothing up his sleeves. He brought his hands to his face and covered it, while rubbing it quickly as someone would while washing their face. He slowly lowers his hands to his side and then looks straight up into the sky, and then slowly down towards me. He smiled, and said in a hushed but very deep voice. 

""Call them motherfucker!""

I raise my weapon back up and start to back into my driveway towards my door, every few steps I make towards my door he makes one towards me.

""Call them motherfucker!"" He screams. As if he knew what the outcome of the call would be.

""Take one more fucking step, and it will be your fucking last!!!"" I shout, my finger fighting the urge to squeeze of a round into his torso.

He stops in his tracks, cocks his head at an angle and presents a very dramatic frown. Followed by a snarl. His face seemed to twist and contort while staring at me with the most anger I had seen on a human face, ever.

I get into my home grab my phone a run upstairs to a window to get a view of this motherfucker while I call the police. My wife was already up there, she must have been watching the whole thing. I quickly dial 911 while ushering my way to the window. As I peer down at him, he slowly looks up at us, still snarling.

""Call them, motherfucker!!!!"" His scream muffled a bit by our walls but still noticeably louder than before.

I get the operator on the phone, never breaking eye contact with Daniel.

I explain everything to the operator as they assure me she has officers on the way.

She calmly starts to ask for more details. What is he wearing, physical description, what has been said, did he physically attack me, was he still there, did he have any weapons, do I have any weapon? The questions seemed to go on and on. She then says.

""Sir you should be able to see the lights from the unit arriving, can you see it?"" She asked

""Yes!"" I exclaim.

She then asked for me to stay inside until the officers knock at my door. I immediately head down stairs and there is the knock.

""Poh-leece!"" A male voice shouted.

I opened the door, and was greeted by an officer. The cop was about mid 30's, portly and visibly sweaty. 

""You called in a disturbance?"" He asked.

""Yeah, did you grab him? I replied.

""Hell no, is he still here?"" He snarked. 

""Well he was ten seconds ago."" I said.

We both walk out into the yard where we had stood. No sign of Daniel. I explained everything to the officer as I have just done to all of you. He seemed to believe it all and was also a bit shaken. 

""Damn, that's some crazy shit!"" He said with a look of astonishment.

""You're telling me!"" I replied. 

He retreats to his car for a few moments and comes back. He explains that a family had just reported their 17 year old son missing. Their son was african american, tall, and most importantly his name was Daniel. He explained further that Daniel was a diabetic and they worried he may be going into some sort of diabetic fit. Everything started to fit perfectly. There was a reason he was so irate and up and down. This wasn't a maniac, it was a young man that was simply ill. My emotion went from scared for my family, to scared for this young man. As we are standing there in my yard, the cop and I. We hear it.

CRACK!!! ..........CRACK CRACK CRACK CRACK!

Five very noticeable gunshots rang out. Followed by my neighbor, a 60 something asian widow, running from her house, handgun swinging wildly back at her home. She was screaming, quite literally bloody murder.

As I stand there paralyzed with shock, the officer quickly draws his weapon and starts shouting commands.

""Put the weapon down, now!"" He screams thunderously.

""I killed him!"" She shouted while simultaneously throwing the handgun to the ground recklessly.

The officer orders her to the ground, approaches her slowly and quickly handcuffs her. He starts to search her, stands her up, walks her to his car and retrieves the thrown weapon. All while I am standing there in horror.

He shouts for me to go into my home and stay in there.  It turns out Daniel saw the lights about the same time I did. He must have quickly ran to my neighbors and ran through an unlocked door. My neighbor found him standing in her living room, naked and apparently slamming her cats head into the wall. She said he had the cat by the tail and was swinging it violently into the wall, blood splattering everywhere. She retrieved her handgun and shot him 5 times, running out her door immediately after.

I was told he was dead before he even hit the floor. She hit him with three bullets. One through the neck, one through the thigh and one, the fatal one, through his temple. I met the young mans family, who actually was pretty hostile towards me. They wanted, quite surprisingly, to sue my neighbor for wrongful death or some shit. I cannot judge them as I do not know what they must be going through.

Oh yeah, I forgot the craziest part. After the police officer ordered me back into my home, my wife and I found something that send chills down our spines. Lying there at the foot of our bed, a pair of shoes and socks. You guessed it. They were Daniels.

mitchbresh,4,,11,1rfvu4,,24,"So, let's just get right into this. I work at a Futureshop, and I have for quite a while now. One of my co-workers, Will, used to work in LA, moving his way up the ranks as a screenwriter, but moved to my city for his marriage. We both started talking one day about how we love to write and started tossing ideas back and forth. We both have a knack for the horror genre and decided that we would work together on writing a horror screenplay. This was about a month ago, and as of yet we haven't been able to sit down and work on anything together. 

On saturday we were both working and took our lunch break at the same time. We started talking about when we could get together to work on the screenplay and that's when the story came up. Will knows how much I love anything creepy and how invested I am in the paranormal, so he shared something another one of our coworkers, Chelsea, had told him. 

After he told me her story, I had to meet with her. She worked on Sunday and I asked Will to talk to her to see if she would be okay with discussing it with me. Yesterday I received a text from Will saying that Chelsea would really love to talk to me about the situation. 

One thing I should mention is that i have a family history of being involved with the paranormal. I have had many of my own experiences along with helping out friends of friends with questions they have about the topic. 

So yesterday I went in to talk to her about what had happened and this is what she shared with me:
She has a son who is about two-years old named Lucas. A week ago Lucas woke up in the middle of the night screaming at the top of his lungs. Chelsea ran to his room and tried to calm him down, but nothing seemed to work. She decided to take him into her room to sleep with her, but when she did this, he freaked out even more. She said that Lucas was fixated on one corner of the room and kept staring at the corner, repeating ""No, no, no..."" over and over. This obviously creeped her out, so she took him out of the room and he seemed to calm down. A couple nights ago, the same thing happened, but this time he pulled the sheet over his head as though to hide from something that was standing in the corner. The second night he freaked out, she had to take him on a car ride around the block just to calm him down.

She said that her room has always felt off to her and that she often gets the feeling that there is a presence in the room with her. I asked if she owned any pets and she told me that she has a dog. Chelsea then proceeded to tell me that the dog has acted strange in the room before as well. 

I asked her if there was anything else important I should know and she shared that her older son had said he saw a ghost in her room the other day. I'm not sure it's linked though, because he happened to ""see"" the ghost after the first incident with Lucas.

After I had asked her all of my questions I told her to start paying attention to certain details and to note them as they happen. I gave her my number and told her that if anything happens or if she has any questions, she should call me. At this point in time I don't think she has anything to worry about, but I told her that I would like to come visit her son and her house to see if I can get a reading on anything. 

I'm not sure when I'll be able to visit her house or if anything else will happen, but if something does happen, I'll make sure to update those who are reading this.",My Co-worker's Son,35,nosleep
yurglar,10,,14,1r6zsn,,27,"Under the Bed

I’m writing this because I simply cannot sleep and there’s something I really need to tell someone, and I find this reddit to be a good place to do so. It is something that is not what you’d consider in the domain of classical horror stories, like zombies or ghosts. It is not, because it was, and I’m afraid still is, real. 

It is so real that it happened 11 years ago, when I was only 7, on a cold morning of December. As you can see, not the night of 31st October. Just the placid, boring morning of 7th December. I was in bed, and I knew my parents were already out, they liked going on morning jogs together. It was a Sunday and my head was throbbing. I have frequent migraines and that 7th December migraine was particularly bad. So there I was, feeling shitty and thinking about lunch, when I moved and my bed creaked. The house was old, like proper old, and we had just moved in (in this regard that part of my life did sound like the beginning of a cliché horror story). I thought it was just temporary anyway, once dad left his job we would leave to California.

When I was a kid I had this habit of putting a pillow over my face when I had a migraine, normally one of those useless small pillows always hanging around. They were always cold, and the cold felt good on my forehead and cheeks. It might sound a bit stupid to you, but to me, it felt good for a few seconds. On 7th December I did this and suddenly, I could not remove the pillow.

I tried to remove it with all my strength, and whoever, whatever, was pushing down, gave in. It was more or less the strength of a skinny teenager. I started panicking, scared, my legs twisting and my heartbeat shooting through the roof. I didn’t even wonder what was happening. I managed to catch a breath and then it happened, all of a sudden. I heard the light switch of my room go out, and the blinds closing violently, and the pressure on the pillow suddenly increased. Twice, then tenfold. It was no longer the strength of a human being but something else. I felt my mind slowdown from the lack of oxygen and I stopped fighting. I felt a strange calm wash over me. Whatever was killing me was impossible to fight, it was like there was a ton of stone over that pillow. I saw a light, my vision going white and then tunneling, and I heard whispers. I was dying. I felt scared then. I put my hands over the pillow, but there was nothing there, and I only felt the hairs of my arms standing up. My hands were not smashed as I expected. My young brain could not make sense of it, but I remember 
being scared, really scared. That’s when I heard a bark.

My dog, Thor, had heard me twist and struggle in bed and had come, to my lucky rescue. The pressure immediately disappeared, the blinds opened and the light turned on and that’s when I felt it, sliding over my right arm, like a hand caressing it, but a dead hand, callous and cold hand, and I felt it, whatever it was, turning and hiding under the bed, like a snake hiding under a rock. Thor kept barking madly, teeth showing and ears back. He was a German shepherd, huge for the standards. Then he neared my bed, looked under my bed, growling and then stopped. He sniffed once, then twice, looked again under the bed, and then climbed on top of the bed and licked my face, where I laid, regaining my breath and control over my limbs, which had gone a bit numb. I remember hugging Thor and almost crying.

I told it to my parents but they did not believe me, they thought it was the migraines and started talking about a psychologist or psychiatrist and bad grades at school. I remember being angry with their reaction, but over time it faded. It took some time for me to sleep again and Thor always slept in my room, sometimes even with me, but there were never any more issues. I never even remembered it from time to time, it was just a scary, traumatic memory my brain just erased. For 11 years, I slept over that memory, over whatever was under my bed.

We moved out a month ago, after 11 years, to a new modern house in California, where my bed doesn’t even have space under it and I love it. My dad sold the house to this young couple who were his friends, who didn’t have much money, but loved the retro feeling of the house. Back then, I didn’t even remember that scary event 11 years ago.

That’s when, as I was laying on my new bed yesterday, I remembered, along with all my morning nightmare details 11 years ago, my dad complaining the other day at dinner table how John and Mary, the young couple, haven’t phoned or said anything about the house since they started living there.

I went to get Thor in my bedroom. I can’t stop thinking about it and I hope they are alright.

sinbysilence,9,,2,1r49de,,28,"Okay. You have to believe me. And what I'm about to say is going to make you not believe me. But please, be patient with me.

You're not real. At least, the you who is reading this isn't real. You only exist because my mind tells you to exist. Regardless of how unbelievable that sounds, I know it to be true. You're helping me cope. You're helping my brain stay active.  And, I believe, to some degree, you're helping keep me alive.

Since there's no better place to start,  I'll just start at the beginning. Back before I knew you existed. Back when you had the possibility of being real.

Back when my normal life got catapulted into this current situation.  I lead a very mediocre life. Living paycheck to paycheck, small group of friends, and no one in my life worth falling in love with. I was on my way to work, just like every other day. Stopped to get coffee. Lit my cigarette as I left the gas station. I began my morning commute.  It was all very routine. Until the car pulled out in front of me.  I stood up on my brakes, but still hit him at an abrupt 45 miles an hour. I ran the red light.  My seatbelt burned my chest.  My head  was blasted by the air bag. My femur protested against the impact until it snapped. The pain was dizzying.  Disorienting. I dug for the phone that flew out of my hand. Mom was still  on the line, crying. She heard what had happened and was over an hour away. But her and dad where on their way.

Now this is what I believe may have happened next. I think I remember getting out of the car and being put on the stretcher. I remember the god awful pain of having my leg reset on the side of the road. That had to be real, right?  It hurt so badly. It was the most earth shattering pain I've ever felt. Once I got to the hospital I was drugged and put to sleep to prep for surgery.

I faded in and out all week. After four nights, I woke to a conversation with my mom. I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night and, considering the drugs in my system, I was very much alert. My mom snapped to attention when she felt me stir. I look at her as though she was a stranger. I'll never forget the confusion I felt as I asked her...""who are you? ""

""It's me, Em. It's mom.""

""Where am I?"" I cried, tugging at the IV on my hand. 

""You're in the hospital,  sweetie.  You were in an accident. ""

""Was it bad?"" I begged for an answer. ""Was it bad?"" I was more hysterical the second time.

I never got an answer. Even when I woke up the next morning she acted as though the conversation never took place. And here's why: I never woke up. Instead,  my brain started to build my new percieved reality. Looking back on it, I think that conversation we had was the last real one I had. Because the accident WAS bad. Because I am still suffering from it, to some extent.

Suffering may not be the best way to put it. Sure, the first two months were brutal. I had to relearn to walk. I had to have help getting in an out of the shower. I had headaches. I got dizzy and sick often. I couldn't work. But it had to seem real.

Now,  life is amazing. I've met the person who made me believe in soulmates. I'm back at work - they even transferred me closer to home and gave me a raise when I came back. Remember how I was the one who ran the red light?  The guy I hit doesn't want to sue me. My life couldn't be anymore perfect if I wrote it myself. Because I have wrote it myself. My brain has created a life to make everything seem normal. I would have never questioned it if it weren't for the other night when I caught a glimpse of reality.

""Nurse...nurse...I think she's waking!"" 

Mom?

Opening my eyes felt like I was fighting a week without sleep.

""Where am I?"" I mumbled.  I hurt. It made no sense.

""You're in the hospital,  baby. You were in an accident, but it's okay. You're going to be okay. I'm so glad to see your eyes.""

Accident? I don't remember anything in my recent history that would have landed me in the hospital. I've been overly precautious these past five months. I voiced my confusion out loud.   ""What accident? I've not been in an accident since June."" 

I saw mom's face fall from optimism to sadness. I asked again, ""what accident?  Was it bad?"" I was scared. Scared because I didn't remember an accident. Scared because of how badly I hurt and didn't know why.

""Sweetie, you've been here since June.""

And then I understood. Why she was so happy to see my eyes. They had been shut since June. 

""Is it bad?"" But before she had a chance to answer, I was drifting again. And the next thing I knew,  I woke up in my bed with my boyfriend at my side.

Since that night, I occasionally catch bursts of their conversation inside my hospital room. Remember how I said I think you're helping to stay alive? 

""She's showing good brain activity. That's a good thing. Unfortunately,  it was a nasty bump to her head. But we've seen people wake up from comas after months, years even. So long as her brain remains healthy, there's no reason not to hope for the best.""

Sounds optimistic,  right? So why am I scared?

I've built an amazing life inside my head. I'm afraid I'll have to leave it. I'm afraid that I may soon wake up.

BumpinRapTapes,10,,9,1r0hla,,25,"So I got a call from a telemarketer, nothing weird about that really.  But before I hung up the automated voice started spitting out stuff like my address, age, stuff like that.  And then my social security number.  Then a list of my room mates.  And then I was concerned.  I waited until the machine stopped, expecting some numbers to press for more info or whatever so I could find out what's up and get myself off their call list.  All the lady robot said though was ""The Intermed company thanks you.""

Reasonably concerned I started doing some research, after ignoring a bunch of message board sites  I finally found what I think was the Intermed site (in like the fifth page of results).  This is all it said:

""Intermed is at the forefront of the organ trade market and thought processing innovations.  All our services are backed with industry leading research and proven by numerous customer testimonials.  Many of our customers are satisfied to the point of frequent return, and we pride ourselves in maintaining our client pool.  Products and services offered by our company are backed with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime maintenance, all available with a phone call.  Hereditary conditions of the mind and body are often the only thing holding you back from reaching your full potential.

Never again will the flaws of your fathers keep you from the life you deserve.  Even the best and brightest are far from perfect, and we strive everyday to make you, the perfect human being.""

Nothing else.  White page, black text.  That's it.  I decided to backtrack to the message boards to see what I could find.  This led me to some random sites and eventually I found a few message threads of people sharing stories similar to mine.  A weird robot caller with way too much information.  One guy got the call in the wee hours of the morning and totally laid a boner kill on a sweaty night with his lady.  They all seemed to be on the same hunt I was, except for one username that I saw pop up on a few of the sites, he called himself ASimpleCipher.  All this dude did was sing Intermed's praises, how he and his friends had used their ""products and services to tremendous avail"" and ""would recommend to anyone!""  All very cheesy and all seemingly marketing plants.  Since that was my best lead I decided to make an account on one of the thread sites and try and get in contact with him.

I sent him a rather aggressive message, which may've been a mistake looking back.  But regardless, and unsurprisingly, I got no response.  I decided if worse came to worse I'd just deal with it when it came up.  I put the whole thing in the back of my mind.  For a few months.

Then ASimpleCipher responded.  Here's a copy and paste of our correspondence:

[Me]  Hey man it's really obvious you work for intermed, you're not fooling anyone.  I want to know who you are, what intermed is and how you got so much of my information.  And I want MY private information deleted from your database, and I want off your call list.  Immediately.  I will not hesitate to get a lawyer involved if this goes any further.

[ASimpleCipher]   I appreciate your interest in my company, Ben!  As always, customer care is a top goal at Intermed.  My representatives tell me that based on market research, you would be a prime candidate for our products and services.  As a courtesy, we like to know as much as we can about potential customers, so as to provide the best quality care possible.  Like you, I once felt a terrible weight in my life, one that rendered me incapable of reaching my full potential as a human being.  When doctors could not help me mend the flaws given to me by generations past, I took matters into my own hands.  As it came to pass, that effort is what gave way to this current business venture.  You may hesitate at terminology like ""Thought Processing"" and ""Organ Trade"", but let me assure you the danger begins and ends at the television screen.  So, if I may, I'd like to draw some common ground between yourself and I.  We do share many similarities.  As a young man, I was plagued with severe asthma (like yourself) from my mother's side of the family, leaving me unable to compete physically with my peers.  This lead me to more intellectual endeavors as I began to mature into an adult.  Cruel as fate is however, I soon discovered I'd inherited a more severe form of my grandfathers autism.  His genes riddled me with social anxiety, and I was thus outcast from much of any community I was ever a member of.  In spite of my flawed genetics I was only more driven to clear the blemishes of my being.  Nothing, I vowed, would hinder my quest for perfection... of the perfect human being.  Given to me from my lineage, however, was the savvy and cunning of generations of businessmen.  

Years, centuries it seems, passed while I honed my craft and built my empire.  Once one is outcast from society, one develops a strong callous to sympathy.  Under a mutual agreement of confidentiality between you and I, I will admit to using almost every associate of mine as merely a means to my own end.  Well, that end is Intermed.  Intermed is my true brainchild, as it were.  I will also admit to misleading you a bit, giving the facade of a full staff under my employ.  Let me assure you I am fully capable of operating this venture on my own.  Let me also assure you your personal information is safe and sound, as I said, I only aim to ensure the best service possible.  Never miss a detail is a creed I operate under.

Enough business however!  Even a jaded outcast such as me has need for camaraderie!  During my time working in the shipping industry I found myself in Northern California in the early 1960's.  My business associate at the time was a rather unstable man.  Every bit of his free time, it seemed he would study the art of coded language, ciphers, cryptograms... whatever one may call them.  Strangely, he got me very interested in the art and it has since become a favorite hobby of mine.  Of course his were much more complex than anything I cared to attempt, he was also versed in astrology and loved to incorporate knowledge of the stars into his little puzzles (This earned him quite the sinister reputation after we parted ways).  On the other hand, I preferred to leave little clues here and there, woven into my business dealings.  Now imagine what fun it would be if someone figured out my little puzzles!  All that work of building a persona of mystery!  Unravelled by a thread I'd left loose for some cunning soul to pull!  Really, I thought someone would've found it by now.  Even after everyone I've tried to sell Intermed's services and products to it is you, cunning lad, who has finally made contact.  Very clever, indeed.  Of course you saw my companies website.  I admit it is a bit sparse, a work in progress.  Reducing my mission for Intermed to a single paragraph however, I did put in a bit of extra effort.

I have been rambling though, I do apologize!  Thank you for inquiring about my company, I hope my response has eased any concerns you may have.

I really don't know what to make of this guy.  It really can't be some prank, the guy knew I had asthma as a kid.  How?  I have to say that I've never experienced such an air of creepiness from pure text.  Something about the way he composed his message was off.  I don't know.  I can't make a lot of sense out of any of this.  I stopped my investigation there, being as I have seen too many horror movies and don't like the idea of rabbit holes.  It's been a few months since and I haven't heard anything from Intermed or ASimpleCipher.  I check the thread site every now and then.  I did go back and check out the Intermed website again.  I'm really not one for puzzles, I can't make anything out of it.  So I'm submitting it here to see if someone is more ""cunning"" than me.  I hope so.

NeonPaint,12,,6,1ra0o4,,26,"I need someone to help me. I need to actually be able to go to sleep and not worry about what I'm going to wake up to. I need it to stop.
The past few days have been enough to make me pack up and check myself into the crazy house. It would have to be better than this. 

I work at a nursing home. It's not a luxurious job for sure but this nursing home makes my job interesting. It's haunted. I know it sounds stupid but it really is. We have a shadow that haunts one room and our residents will act in ways that will set you on edge. I guess the most recent example is Dessy, I obviously cannot provide you her real name but this is a nickname I have given her myself. 

Dessy is a cute little old woman. She is the grandma you wish you could have. We've always had a pretty good companionship. A couple weeks ago she changed. Her appearance and her personality completely shifted. Her eyes become sunken in, hair was constantly messy when it used to always be well groomed, teeth started to turn a nasty yellow, and her feet...dear god her feet...they looked like they belonged to a creature who only resembled a human in the slightest way. The best way I can explain her feet is that they looked like long fingered hands with jagged finger nails, they didn't look like they belonged to some little adorable woman of 92. 

She started saying *things* to me. There was one conversation that has stuck with me. 

""Dessy, do you want to go to the dining room tonight?""

""Fuck...fuck...you little **whore**.""

""Excuse me? Why are you saying that? Honey, you can eat in your room, I just wanted to make sure...""

""How does it feel whore? Little slut you fucking slut you whore you **SLUT**.""

""You need to stop being mean. How bout we go into the bathroom and you can go before dinner?"" 

At this moment, she shuffles into the bathroom with me and I grab her pants to pull them down.

""You fucking slut. Does he do this to you? Does he put his hands in your pants? Does he fuck you with his hand? He fucked that little virgin c--t......virgin....whore slut **fuck** you...with his hand....virgin c--t c--t c--t."" 

I went white as a ghost. I was close to Dessy but this old woman never knew anything about me other than my age, my name, and that I wasn't married. I never spoke a word to her about anything sexual but she knew *things*. My personal life isn't something I want to share but her mentioning those last words did relate to me in a very personal way. I looked at her as if the devil himself were standing in front of me. And then she smiled. I can't explain to you guys the smile this woman gave me, how it made me cringe, how it made me sick. 

Fast forward from that moment to a few days ago. Stuff starts happening to me at my house. It began with scratching. One night I heard scratching coming from the walls then it was above me in the ceiling then back to the walls. I didn't think it was too scary until it started to follow me around the house. If I went into the kitchen, the scratching would follow. I couldn't get away from it. But I soon realized there are **much** scarier noises out there.

The moaning is what followed and it's been driving me to the brink of insanity. Every night I hear this awful moaning. Like someone is in this house crying out from a pain I can never imagine. I get up, I search for who ever or what ever it is. If it sounds like it's coming from the living room, I run to the living room but as soon as my feet hit the carpet, the moaning is now in the kitchen. It plays with me. Toys with my mind and makes me run around here on an endless hour consuming search of where it is coming from. If I even want to know where it comes from.

The sound is so sad but it feels unmistakably evil to me. I can't explain it but when I hear it, I know it's a cruel joke. I know people say that they are sensitive to spirits all the time but I have always felt like I have been. I can't sit down and talk to them like all these psychics out there but I will get random thoughts or names or feelings. If a spirit is around, I usually can get a name and maybe a fact or two but *this* has no name, nothing. 

What it does have is a moan that makes me instantly nauseous and it has a *smile*. I haven't seen it in its entirety but I got a glimpse of something that has made sleeping and living here nearly impossible. 

One night when the moaning was louder than usual, I went on the pointless search again trying to find it and figure out a way to stop it. When I walked into the living room, I saw a shadow and it had a smile on it's face that made me throw up right there. It made everything in me want to come up in my throat. After I cleaned up and calmed down, I realized that the smile was familiar to me. Maybe that's why it caused me to get sick, it could have been that my body knew instantly where that smile had been before. Sweet Dessy showed me that smile that day in the restroom in her room. She has never smiled at me like that again, but I can't handle the thought of seeing it again whether it's with or without a face.

The moaning and that smile haunts me. It keeps me running around my house every night because I want it to **STOP**. I haven't had a real nights sleep in days.  I'm exhausted and I'm working a full time job on a quarter tank of energy. Things I usually love to do, I don't have the energy to do. I always liked to post comments on reddit but it's been a couple weeks since I've even done that because the thought of actually reading a post and commenting is too exhausting, it's pitiful. 

I need someone to tell me what I can do. Any ideas will help. ",Maybe I'm losing my mind.,32,nosleep
ggtheblock,4,,8,1r2ucw,,26,"I don't know what I saw, I'm not even really sure I should have seen what I did. 

Two nights ago I was having a wonderful dream. There was nothing odd or creepy to it, just a dream. I woke up in the middle of the night as some people tend to do but then I have wondered since if I ever really did wake up at all. From my bed I watched as 2 figures cloaked in crimsom, one considerably taller than the other, walked into my room. The shorter of the two turned to look at me as he shut off my alarm clock. I woke up the next morning several hours after my alarm was supposed to go off. Did I unplug it in my sleep? Did I even set it in the first place? I didn't want to consider any other options. Last night however tipped the scales in the other direction.

Last night's dream is still fresh on my mind. I was on a mission to stop a bomb going off. I had a key and as I raced through the city streets I checked my watch every block to see how much time I had left. I made it inside the building, rounding the last corner, checking my watch one last time and saw that I had just 2 minutes to spare but when I looked up I was no longer dreaming. I was on my couch, looking eye to eye with the hooded figures as they sat only inches away. They were green, withered. The red of their cloaks matched only by the red of their irisis. No glow to be found, however they had perfect white teeth. The smaller of the two had the larger smile, clearly taking pleasure in what he was about to do.

 ""I'm sorry but we can't let you do that."" 

It was then that I noticed a small familiar watch in his hand and didn't really realize what he did as he removed the final 2 minutes from the timer. I was back in the dream, staring in horror at the monitors of the console I was supposed to have reached in time. Millions dead, cities in ruin, more carnage then I have ever witnessed. I broke, fell to my knees and cried until the building's security came and apprehended me. 

I don't know what happened. I'm not sure if I fell into some sort of inception scenario but I pray I do not have anything important to dream about tonight.",We Can't Let You do That,34,nosleep

I live in a somewhat medium-sized house, out in the country surrounded by trees.

I've always felt safe here, never once paranoid, never worried, the crime rate here is pretty low.

In the entire twenty years I've lived here I've only seen news of one single break in.
I'd say that gives me plenty of easy sleeping.


Until recently.


I was getting ready for work, my job is night cook at a local restaurant.
I left the house, noticing the cool air of November,
And as the chill whispered into my lungs, I felt,
As cliché as it sounds, as if I was being watched.

I looked around, nothing was there.
But when I finally shrugged it off, and got Into my car,
I noticed that my mirrors were all fogged up.

Normally, this wouldn't even bother me, as It's so easy to get out of my driveway. 
But tonight, everything seemed wrong.
As I turned the key, and my engine started up,

I heard my radio move to static, from channel to channel, instead of the usual classic rock station.
Living alone, I have no reason to believe anyone would tamper with my car. I don't have neighbors nearby, and My dog would have warned me if someone was messing around.

Again, I checked my clock and shrugged it off.
I'd be late if I didn't hurry.

As I reached the switch off the static, my radio stopped, 99.9FM. 
And I heard a whisper, at first I thought I was going insane or dreaming.
But I turned the volume up, and could barely make out the words,
""kill...me.......Kill....me...""

The words sent a chill colder than the freezing air through my spine, and I immediately turned the radio off, and left,

theunlockeddoor,2,,10,1r1j47,,24,"I work at a public library and I really need to write about this.  Yeah, boring. Librarians=Blah. I know.  This is probably going to be tl:dr and dull.  I know I'm super-new to reddit, but I really need to get this out of my system and I'd feel weird posting about this anywhere else.  So, mock me for my noobness, but I really need to talk.

And aside from 'sexy librarian' sterotypes, you ought to know that the people checking books out from behind the desk have to deal with all sorts of people.  People checking out books about livestock and winking and grinning at you too much, and women, teary-eyed, avoiding your gaze, checking out books about abuse or divorce.  We're sort of like bartenders, but without the convenience of bouncers.  So, when I tell you that meeting this one particular guy kept me up at night, you ought to know that it's not because I have a simple, dusty job. 

This is a story about  person I met through my job.  It's also a story told to me by that person.  

When I came in to work one morning my boss was wandering around the workroom looking disgusted.  She kept going between the bathroom and her desk- trying to work but getting nauseous every so often.  Apparently, when she'd rolled up in the parking lot that morning, she'd found something on the pavement.

A wet set of dentures.

We all laughed at how weird that was, and set the things gingerly on a pad of paper towels in the backroom.  No way were we putting a pair of raw dentures in the lost and found tub.  We forgot about them before lunch.

Later that day, though, this guy came in.  I ended up knowing him as ""Irma's Nephew"".

He limped in and asked if we had any books about dentistry.  I told him I didn't know where to find them off the top of my head and proceeded to do a search on the computer.  As I typed things in and scanned our holdings, he kept staring at me.  His eyes seemed too large and white, popping out against his skin.  He kept chewing his lips and the sides of his cheeks.  It was so fierce, so intense and obsessive, it looked painful.

Then he said: ""Teeth.  C'mon, gimme anything about teeth.  How they grow....""  And trailed off.

I was rattled but I managed to scribble a number down on a scrap of paper and gesture towards the nonfiction section.  He hobbled off.

Twenty minutes or so later, it was the top of the hour, and my turn to do a ""walkabout"".  ""Walkabouts"" are a thing our library system made up to make sure nobody is being harassed or molested out in the stacks.  We're supposed to check all the blind spots in the building every half hour.

So, I was doing my walkabout when I spotted Irma's Nephew sitting on the floor between two rows of books.  He glanced up at me, stood, and as I was moving away, caught me.  His hand on my wrist made me nervous, but I looked back at the circ desk and saw Vikki watching us like a hawk.  Somehow this made me brave.  He told me he needed my help, that these books weren't helping.  So I asked him what else I might look up for him.

""No,"" he said, ""I need to talk to you, to someone, to someone, to anyone.  My aunt, she...""  And he trailed off, eyes bugging.

Sadly, money doesn't reach super-far in the library world, and I hadn't been trained on how to properly treat a mentally ill patron.  As a fail safe, I went with gentleness, since he had a hard grip on my wrist.

So, I asked him to talk to me (looking back over my shoulder at Vikki).

This is the best version I can write of the garbled story he told me.  I could just say: ""And then he told me a spooky story"", but that wouldn't explain why I'm jumpy. I apologize that this is long, but I'm trying to get this out in an accurate way.

""I’ve got an Aunt, named Irma, and she pretty much raised me.  She’s like my mother, but she’s been gettin’ on, gettin' on, you know, and recently she’s been forgetting things.  I need these books for her.  She’s got a problem.  A real….. strange thing goin’ on.
	
“Last summer she got all her teeth pulled.  Got dentures instead.  And she hated them, said they always felt funny in her mouth, and I TOLD HER! we’d go get them refit, recast, but she’d still hate them.  She’d just spit them right out onto the carpet and glare at me with her mouth-skin all sunk-in and puckered up.  I’m the only one of the family that visited her anymore.  So that meant she blamed me.  I was the only one around to be hateful to.  Fuck.

""In June, she started doin’ this thing where she’d say she lost her dentures.  Whenever I went over to see her, she’d ‘lost’ them and I’d scold her because dentures are damn expensive.  Pardon me.  But she’d say it’s no problem and grin big.  I’d look all over- turn the house upside down, and not be able to find them.  She’d say “They’ll turn up in no-time” and wave her hand at me like this.  

""The weird thing is that they would.  I’d come over again and she’d have them back in.  Clack them at me and laugh.  Everytime.  Clack, clack, clack.  And laugh.  Clack, clack.
	
""She, uh, she just kept losing them.  I tried talking to her neighbor down the stairs, Lucy, to try and help her out.  Lucy is a nice woman and said she’d check on her when she got the chance.  And she did good.  When I hadn’t been able to visit in a few days, I’d get a text or call from Lucy lettin’ me know everything’s alright with Miss Irma.  
	“Only I got into a car wreck.  Was laid up in the hospital doped out of my brain on pain killers for who-knows-how-long.  Doctor said I’d broken my thigh-bone.  I didn’t see Miss Irma for a long time.  I think I got a call from Lucy at some point but it’s a foggy.  I remember answering and Lucy just murmuring, murmuring something I couldn’t understand.  It must have been the drugs.  It must have been.

So, eventually, I’m better, and I go over there.  I try knocking on Miss Irma’s door.  She never gave me a key, but she always bustled up and let me in.  I knocked and knocked and she didn’t come, so I got nervous, you know?  I went over to Lucy’s then, to see if she had a back-up key, or could call the building manager.  But I when I knock on her door it just kinda…whoosh…opens.
	
I call her name, but nothin’.  So of course I go in, cuz maybe they both in trouble.  But Lucy is nowhere.  Her apartment is just… empty.  Except, just as I’m leaving, I see something pink on the floor.
	
{Here, the guy paused, licking his lips again.  It seemed to me he was winding up his courage, or working past something particularly horrible.}

""It was teeth, ma’am.  Dentures.  A top and a bottom, both.  The top was kinda falling off the bottom, was at an angle.  Like they’d just been dropped and left.  
	
“I knew Lucy didn’t wear dentures, so this scared me a lot, because Miss Irma might be wandering around lost with her dementia.  She’d started forgetting my name.  She could be anywhere, doing anything if she was spitting her teeth out again.
	
“So I run.  Run and find the janitor that sometimes cleaned up the stairwells and he looks at me like I’m crazy.  He says “I thought your gramma moved out last month.” I say “No, sir, you are mistaken.  She can’t have gone nowhere.”  And he says “Well, I ain’t seen you nor her in that time.”  And I argue with him but eventually he comes with me and unlocks the door.   
	
“Inside Miss Irma’s the tv was on, but, she wasn’t in her chair where she’d sit for hours and watch tv.  I mean, she’d sat there so much it had left an impression, her shape.  But that wasn’t all she left.  She also left her teeth. {He was giggling a bit hysterically at this point}
	
“No, not the ones in Lucy’s place.  These were different.  These were more.  These were MORE.  All over.  Pairs and pairs of false teeth were lying all over Miss Irma’s apartment.  They were on bookshelves and on the kitchen table.  The biggest pile was around her chair.  I was confused at first.  There was no way she could have collected all these teeth by herself.  I certainly only bought her the two pairs.  She didn’t have no friends to bring her sets of teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth.
  
""And they were different, too.  As in, some were little.  Like, tiny white baby teeth, just little gappy chips.  And others were big and wide and long.  And some of the sets, I don’t know how they could fit in a person’s mouth.  they were full of fangs and tusks and.

“And it makes no sense.  I can only come up with one idea.  She was on her own for a month, except for Lucy.  I know Lucy didn’t bring her all those teeth.  The only thing I can think is that she was growing them back herself.  That, every time she had ‘lost’ and found her dentures before, she’d just thrown them away and grown a new pair in her mouth.  Then that set would fall out and she’d grow more.  And then they must have started growing strange in her mouth.  And she's gone off somewhere wandering wandering, I can't find her. I don't..  I need help for her.""

I peeled his hand off and somehow got out of there.  I went back and handed him some paper I think had a number for psychiatric help on it.  Really, I went back to the staff bathroom and sat against the wall for a while, breathing and feeling really strange in my stomach.

When I left work, I had to pass the set of dentures my boss found in the parking lot that morning.  I found myself staring at them.

Chenigin,8,,9,1r6b7r,,24,"When I was ten my parents divorced. Soon after I moved into an old house in Orange County CA with my mother and stepfather. This house had a nice floor plan but needed major work. With all the remodeling being done to the house it was not uncommon for my step father to walk around at night to check up on and see how the house was holding up. One night I was laying in bed when I heard heavy footsteps outside my bedroom window. My room was located at the side of the house. Me being young and naïve I automatically thought it was my step dad. I heard the footsteps walk into the garage and enter the house via the garage door. I knew this was the time to go to the restroom because well.. their was an adult and he could protect me from my fears of the dark. When I heard the footsteps walk past my door I slowly opened my door and called out my step fathers name. At the same time I stuck my head out my door and saw the back of a boot I never saw before turn the hallway corner. This made me reconsider how safe it was to go take a leak. I heard a sound in the kitchen.. the distinct sound of the drawers opening and a hand shuffling through its contents. After what seemed like an eternity I decided to call out to my stepfather again, this time slowly creeping out of my room so I can get to the corner of the hallway. As soon as I started to edge forward I heard the heavy footsteps make a b line straight for the front door.. I started to pick up my pace so I could get a good view of who it could be. When I got to where I could get a good view of the door I saw something I would never forget. The door slammed shut and the lock turn to the lock position. As if someone had the key and was locking it from the outside. By then my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I ran to the door to see if I could see who was in our house. When I opened the door I saw nothing... No sight of someone running away.. no evidence of anyone ever being there in the first place.. Just 10 year old me.. standing in the dark.. Suddenly the fight or flight instinct kicked in again.. but instead its the opposite instinct.. fuck! I'm ten.. I am by myself in the dark.. someone just broke into the house! I slammed the door shut and ran into my mothers room. My stepfather right away called the cops and propped a chair to the front door and the garage door so even if someone had the key they could not open it. The cops showed up and didn't find a single thing. No footprints nothing.. My mother turned on me and said it was just my childish imagination making up things.. I started to doubt myself after the years... Chucking it as what my mom said.. my youthful imagination.. I am 24 now.. I don't sleep walk nor have I ever. If it was a dream... I never had one like that ever since. If anyone has any ideas on what I might of experienced please.. I am all ears. I always wondered what other people would have to say about this.

 It was so bizarre - my boyfriend got home around 5pm yesterday and went to take a nap. He worked a detail after his shift, so I was home alone for the most part. I did my best to stay away from the room. My cat just growled.  
There was a good hour of him sitting at the doorway...growling. For anyone that knows him, he's has the most amazing temperment...he never hisses or growls. The entire time my boyfriend was in the room napping, NOTHING. He thinks I'm crazy because I begged him not to sleep in that room...he went to work at 10pm last night, and I slept on the couch. Remember that wind? I have no fucking clue what it was, but I was on a conference call and heard a small rumble from the room. I ignored. Apparently whatever is happening - ignoring makes it worse. A couple minutes later, another rumble, and a smell. I lied when I said the worst smell ever was burnt coffee. This smell was like death. Not the death that a cat drags in by the tail. And then another rumble. As soon as my call was over, I rushed into the room, febreeze in hand. I can't explain it exactly, but as I opened the door to the bedroom, all of that windows made a loud thud like they were closing, but they were open. I sure as hell didn't open them. Is it even possible for them to thud OPEN? What the hell. Against my better judgment I went into the room. It's day time, what can happen, right? There was a stain on the floor - just a big dark stain... I don't want to say blood because it's not mine and fuck this supernatural shit. It got bigger though, like water expanding. I could see it growing, but I couldn't tell if my mind was playing tricks on me. 
I ran.
Fucking ran.

What the hell is my cat seeing? I wonder if this is just my mind playing tricks on me. 

I've had some trouble posting this today - but I haven't been home, and I'm returning tonight. My intention is to sleep in that room. I want to know what's going on, and why it's getting so cold. I'm getting the chills thinking about the chills.

BiohazardTyrant,3,,10,1r4rao,,20,"So to begin, I was eleven years old I believe...

My father had brought me to a friend of his' house. Or rather farm.

I was excited because I had befriended the son of my fathers friend, for stories sake I will call him James. James had a older brother who was a year and a half older, so I was eleven, James was twelve and his brother thirteen. We had all played around the barn and fields plenty of times before. This time though it was a celebration of some sort, I wish I could remember why but anyway, they had been in this house on this farm for about half a year. Tonight was the big party, as in the most vivid thing I remember about that night. The cut off pigs head. Literally just cut right off, and sitting on a support beam about shoulder high to the adults. The body was dangling from a chain for a while, until they skewered it onto a metal pole and roasted it whole over a fire.

I really wish I could remember why they were doing that but sadly I cannot. In any case, me James and his brother were just running around like we always did like idiots. They had all of the farm as a playground and plenty of space to play. We began by walking over to the stalls where they kept the horses and cattle. The sheds were HUGE, and seemed to be endless to a younger kid as myself. 

After about a half an hour of walking through corridors left and right in the dark we started hearing noises, but not normal ones... Like chains being hit on metal and slammed into the ground, then grunts. We all took off running following James' brother who quickly let out out to the closest exit. None of us knew what the sounds were because of the fact the farm had been out of commission for about thirty years. Nothing alive should have been in there. 

We quickly made out way back to the farm house, the big one where all the adults were partying and tried to talk to them about it but of course they had all had a drink or three and ignored us laughing it off as childish imagination. 

For some reason. Some stupid god forsaken reason, James said we should go back out and just play in the field where there was a little light away from the adults and we listened. Once the three of us were out there it turned into a ""I dare you to go out in the field"" game.

We each took turns going farther and farther out into the night. Finally we all ended up ignoring the occurrences from earlier and started playing hide and seek. Bad idea. Very bad.

James and I were hiding in the tall grass near the side end of the barn and his brother came running out faster than I have ever seen anyone run, screaming bloody murder, to get away as fast as we could, get to the adults! James and I ran to him, and stopped dead in our tracks, quickly seeing why he had been fleeing. 

There we were, James, his brother and I all standing still, like sacks of meat staring to the treeline where we saw it. There were three if I remember correctly faces. All white and elongated, just weirdly shaped about six feet off the ground, and then came the true horror, the glint off the blades they were holding. 

We all ran.

Faster and faster we ran.

I turned around two times and I regret it to this day for the fact they were even closer than I thought blades outstretched trying to mince us up and drag us back into those hellish woods. 

We finally made it to the adults. The only thing I remember after that was that damn pig head, cut off, and just sitting there, I could see the spine, and every last vein... we tried telling the adults but they just laughed. None of us left the main barn after that for the rest of night.




About a week later my friend Chris came over, and had the worst part to share with me. He had been having these night terrors of these creatures tearing at him and chasing him through his own new home.

Then he told me his family had left the farm, and moved to the city.

Then he told me why. He was attacked.

Then he showed me, and lifted his shirt up, showing me a scar which I know he did not have before because we used to swim together all the time. He never had a mark there a week before. But now, across his stomach he had a fully healed scar of about ten inches going from left to right, like he had been gutted. But the scariest fact like I said was that it had not been there one night, then he woke up with that kind of scar. 

His family moved because of that, that day. And never returned to that farm.

I have long since lost touch with him, he became very paranoid after that and I just cant forget that.

Figured I would share it with the community, I do hope if any of you take anything away from this, if you see a creature, with a white face, long arms, and a huge blade by a treeline. Run, just run. And try to forget about it.","A tale of a Farm, and three young kids.",30,nosleep
JordanThirstExile,11,,34,1r857m,,22,"It started with the roses. Ever since I was a little girl I loved them. I loved the scent of them, and the colors they came in. I loved them so much that my mother had planted a few rose bushes outside our house so when it bloomed I could sit and stare at those beautiful roses. They bloomed in shades of white, and pink, but my favorite rose was red like satin. It reminded me of my mother and the way she always drew roses on her letters. 


Fast forward to the time I was 14 years old. I was never a popular girl, by far, but I wasn’t unknown either. I didn’t have long blonde hair or blue eyes, but I had talent, a slim body, and an obsession for roses. All my friends knew how much I loved them. They’d buy me perfume in a rose-shaped bottle, or a dress with red roses on them for my birthday.  I made the best out of what I could in high school being a short, brown haired, green-eyed girl. 


It was the day before homecoming when the boy I’d secretly been in love with asked me to the dance with a white rose. I swooned and he took me to the dance the next night. (I, of course, in a rose dress and him in matching colors.) He had brought me a white rose corsage to match my dress. We danced all night, and we continued to date until high school ended. After our senior year we went our separate ways and stopped talking. But this didn’t bother me, I hadn’t time to waste when I was busy with my roses.


In college I had been taking Art classes in my third semester when I got a call one evening informing me that my mother had pasted away in the hospital. 
The following Tuesday we attended her funeral. My father had picked out the colors. We buried my loving mother in pink roses, because she was a former cancer survivor, and we were blessed to have her as long as we did.
For the months following my mother’s death I became deeply depressed. The only thing that eased the pain from losing my mother, were the roses. When they bloomed in the spring my sprits suddenly lifted. The roses were my life, and I don’t know what I’d do without them. 


2 years go by and I ended up meeting a nice guy who joined my ecology class. His name was Dylan and we immediately hit it off. He gave me everything a girl could’ve ever wanted and treated me like a princess. I loved him more than anything in the world. We talked about moving in together and buying a house after college. We talked about getting married and having a daughter named Rose for my love of roses. His handsome blonde hair and chiseled feature would make a beautiful baby.


We went through college and eventually graduated together and got married. We lived in a small townhouse in Vermont for a long time after that. After trying many times to have the baby I so desperately wanted, the doctor came to tell that I was infertile. Dylan tried to tell me we could always adopt, always have a child if I wanted, but I didn’t. It wasn’t fair! If I couldn’t have a child that was my own flesh blood, how would she share the love of roses like my mother did with me? 


Again for a long time I became mute. I could not eat or sleep. Dylan became very distant and we hardly spoke. Everything we had was gone. Nothing made me happy anymore. Nothing would until I had a baby rose. I would look out at our garden and wait for them to bloom, but even then the roses did not make me happy. 


It was the next winter before I found out. I knew something had gone wrong because all of the roses had turned over black instead of falling off and dying. Dylan had come home late that night and seemed very stressed. I decided that night while he slept I’d go through his phone. 


He had 3 missed calls and a text from a girl named “Lisa”. The text read:
“You HAVE to stay home tonight! She won’t stop crying unless you’re here! –Lisa”
Who wouldn’t stop crying? Did someone care that much about my dear Dylan to cry when he’s not there? I remember him saying he worked at the office with a girl named Lisa, so I decided to send her a text replying, “Get her to stop crying, I can’t be that important.” 


After that I waited for a reply for several minutes before I got a reply back.
“Of course you’re important to her love! You’re her daddy! And she needs you here! Just take off work this one night!”


WORK? SHE though HE was at WORK? He was supposed to be at work all day! And WHO’S daddy was she talking about? 


I carefully went through his address book in his phone and found her home address. I silently walked downstairs, and out the door, grabbing a hoe from the garden before leaving in the car.


I knew the black roses meant something was wrong. 


I returned a few hours later with his “baby” in our car. I left her there while I waited behind the house. About an hour later I see Dylan walk out the front door to leave, when he suddenly stops when he sees the child in the car with the windows up. 
He screams “ALLISON!” 


Is THAT the things name? So it IS his! At this point I was furious! 


As he went to unlock the door to retrieve the child, I pulled him backwards so he fell into the garden. I picked up the hoe and shouted “ALL I WANTED WERE THE RED ROSES!”


The hoe dug into his head once, and I felt all the love I’d ever had for him release, into the small, tiny bits of pieces that were once my loving husband. When I was all through I tossed his body into the cellar along with his companion’s. At least now the black roses are blood red once again.


 A beautiful thing, the roses are. 


Little rose lives with me now and she has just enrolled in preschool. She loves the roses as much as I do, but her favorite ones are the dead petals. 


“So pretty!” she said, “Even after they’re dead!” 


I always agree with her on that. Sometimes she asks where daddy is and I must tell her, “Simple, Prim Rose, ask the petals!”

I froze as soon as I looked towards the front of the house. I saw something short, maybe 2-3 feet walking on two legs. It was walking in the direction of my porch or front of the house. I thought it was kinda strange since I live out in the suburbs and something like this would easily be noticed by any of my neighbors. The funny part is we both made eye contact, it noticed that I was looking straight at it. As soon as it did it ran away, and I ran after it. When I turned the corner there was nothing. I ran around the whole house just in case it was running circles around my house. Nada. So yeah I saw that once. No biggie since I havent seen it again or it hasnt messed with my garden.

cmd102,4,,4,1r2xzg,,21," unexplainable experiences are not completely abnormal for me. Every house or apartment that I've lived in, I've seen or heard something that would make a lot of people hide under a blanket or leave the house all together. The man at my window was one story of mine that never fails to make whoever I tell shudder, so I figured I'd share it here.

It began when I was 7 or 8 years old. We lived in an older house, but not one that would instantly stand out as ""creepy"" or ""unusual"". We didn't live in the middle of nowhere, but rather on a street lined with houses on both sides of the road. It was a fairly quiet neighborhood, the kind where the rare car that came down the street would often break up a game of football or hockey that was being played by the kids that inhabited almost every house. It wasn't perfect, but it was great. I was a very happy child. 

One night, I was plagued by a very odd, yet equally terrifying nightmare. I dreamt that I was in my bed, in the room that I shared with my older sister. I sat up and looked out of the window that was next to my bed, which sat in the one corner of my bedroom flush against the wall. The window overlooked the back yard, and in that yard stood a man. He wore a long black coat, a wide-brimmed black hat that hid his face from me, and a black suit. On his shoulder, there sat a very large black bird with red eyes. I stared at him for what seemed like forever, before he looked up at my window. The only features of his face that I could see were his eyes, which were a deep red, just like the bird's. Just as he made eye contact with me, the bird left his shoulder and flew straight at my window. When the bird got to the point where it would have inevitably smashed through the window and probably eaten me, I woke up. I was on my side, facing my sister's bed that was situated in the exact same position as mine, but on the opposite side of the room. I stared at her as she slept soundly, terrified and unable to go back to sleep. I decided that the only way I would get any rest was by looking out my window and proving to myself that the man wasn't really there, so I rolled over and sat up. My curtains were already pulled to the sides of the window, since my bedroom was on the second floor of a house in a decent neighborhood,  we didn't really worry about anyone trying to peep on my sister and me. The second I looked at the window, he was there. Even though he was impossibly directly outside my window,  close enough that he should have left fog with his breath, I still couldn't see any features of the man's face except his blood red eyes. I did what many children would do, I laid back down and threw my blankets over my head. I eventually fell back asleep, despite being scared out of my mind.

The man visited me several times a month for several years after that, always just staring at me through my window during the darkest parts of the night. When my sister moved out, I started sleeping in her bed,  across the room and away from the window. I didn't see the man anymore. 

One day, I was cleaning my room in preparation for my friend to sleep over that night. I knelt on my old bed, still there for when we had guests,  to clean the window. I pulled the curtain aside (as a teenager now, I valued my privacy), and saw a handprint on the glass. It was bigger than my own, but I didn't think anything of it. I had assumed one of my friends had left it there. I sprayed the cleaner and wiped it away with the paper towel, but the handprint remained. A little grossed out, I went over it again, a little harder to scrub the print away. It was still there. That was when I realized that, despite not seeing him anymore, I still received visits from the man with the red eyes. The hand print was on the outside of the window.",the man at my window,25,nosleep

I just kept clicking through - that was my greatest vice. I could have let it rest. But with every story, my blood pumped faster, my breath came quicker.

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

My stomach is in knots, every heartbeat a hammer blow against my sternum. My hands are shaking. My breath comes in stecatto bursts. I can't hold on much longer. The anticipation is mounting, building to orgasmic frenzy. I found it, the ultimate high. Or rather, it found me. All I had to do was believe. All I have to do is turn around.

My faith is sure, and I know it with every fiber in my being:

It's here. And it hates me.",I couldn't stop.,26,nosleep

This night, I had a friend over. It's not related to the woman or this story at all - it was planned much earlier. I needed some help with my new place so she'd help me and sleep over because we had no idea how much time it would really take.

She had to leave really early, before 7 AM, so I thought I can just sleep until 7 and then go.

But as soon as she went out, I felt something weird. As if there's someone still with me. Someone watching me. I just knew someone is there.

Kind of like when I lived with my parents and I just KNOW they're here even though the door of my room is closed. And I know so I have to get up and check.
That's how it was. 

So I got up to check. Nothing, I couldn't see anything but I could still feel it. I figured the feeling would go away when I look around the apartment and see that there's nothing there. It didn't. It just felt like I was chasing after something and it kept getting away. Like when you try to hold onto something really slippery. 

I felt helpless and very hopeless in that moment. It was much deeper than just not being able to find something I felt was there - it was just an in-general feeling of misery and despair, not related to something specific. 

So I figured maybe I was just getting sick, maybe I was too tried, too stressed, maybe it's really nothing, and I went back to bed. I fell asleep really quickly. 

Then the doorbell rang, I woke up. It felt like I slept for hours and hours, but in reality it was only like 6 or 7 minutes. I went to open the door, guess who it was? The woman.

Yeah, I was terrified and for a moment I thought - I'm done. It's over. Byebye cruel world.

It  wasn't  regular fear, like you'd be afraid when you know there's a reason to, like a gun pointed or an angry dog. It was more like fear of the dark, you don't really know what exactly you fear but it's still scary.

And just to make it clear, once again - she doesn't LOOK scary. She looks normal.
She speaks in a normal tone, with a normal voice. But there's just something about her that makes me want to get away, but in the same way intrigues me - I feel that I HAVE to know.

So I was really holding back the ""what the fuck are you doing here you mad bitch"" rant that was forming in my mind, I just greeted her instead because seriously, what good could come out of getting pissy? Not like that would help now.

She says hi. I'm like uh,umm, yeah, hi. And then she tells me she just wanted to visit me to see how am I doing, how's life, etc, etc. So I'm like wtf, you saw me yesterday and the day before, and the day before. She ignores me. She asks to come in but I tell her I was just planning to get out, I have things to do so  I wouldn't be a good host right now. She says she doesn't mind it all. I say I feel embarrassed about having such a messy home. Maybe when I fix it. I know  she knows I'm lying. But I just HAVE to say that. I can't tell her the truth. She just walks in and I immediately escort her out.

And the truth is, I just DON'T want her in. I can't let  her. I know she can't do anything more than she could do in the hallway, or from the door, or in the park, or in an alley, or anywhere else really, but I just didn't feel like letting her in (and still don't). I know it was rude as fuck but so is trying to force someone to let you in their house at 7 in the morning.

She keeps trying to get me to make her coffee or breakfast or something. And the pushier she gets, I get less afraid, more angry. She then asks me about my old town, my friends, family, my new friends, my new place, what am I planning to do here. I don't tell her shit, I just ramble about unspecific things, getting more and more angry. 

She makes me feel dizzy. Not in a Oh-so-nice-and-cute way. In a very bad way. In a I-could-pass-out-or-even-die way.

Somehow I get through the conversation, and then she just suddenly stops talking and stares at me. ""You're really not going to let me in?"" I explain to her, again, that I'm going out now and the place is a mess.
So she glares at me and nods. ""Alrightttt"".

I really thought she was going to attack me - I was really waiting for her to try to hit me or stab me or whatever.

But she turns around, then she turns back to me and says ""See you soon. Maybe I'll come again tomorrow."" I tell her it'd be better if she just lets me invite her when I'm ready for visitors, when I can actually provide a good stay for a guest.
""But *friend's name* stayed the night?""
I get terrified again - bitch how the fuck do you know, but I just say that friend is helping me with the apartment.

She nods again. And then she says bye, see you. And walks away. Turns around once again, stares at me, and says ""I still can't figure it out. That's why I just have to come back, like you had to interrogate me at the park."" And then walks down the stairs. I try to stop her, but she ignores me. Won't talk anymore.

Now the thing is, nothing about her, except the knowing my great-grandmother part, seems supernatural, otherwordly. She seems like a silly, but creepy lost cause. And if it wasn't for my grandmother's warnings and the woman claiming to know Magdalena, I'd even consider her a cute wackadoodle. But I still have NOTHING to explain WHY my grandmother appears to fear this woman and NOTHING to explain HOW could she, a woman that looks not a day older than 30, have known my great-grandmother that died over 30 years ago.",Who is this woman ?

-----

For several years now I've had this story inside me like lead shot in my gut. I've considered telling it hundreds of times over, but the sheer magnitude of it has always stopped me. With six months of therapy under my belt, I figure it's time. I know now that I won't be free of this thing until I write it out. Settle in, because I can't tell this story in ten thousand characters or less. I'll be lucky to get through it in twice or three times that. It's hard enough to sum up everyday life, and this story is anything but.

I had a recurring dream when I was really little. I would wake up in the dream, and standing beside my bed was the most beautiful lady I had ever seen. Long, straight hair and long, flowing gown, both of the purest silver like captured moonlight. She would smile at me so sincerely, so lovingly, as she sat down beside me and began to speak.

The words were comforting like a lullaby, but I couldn't understand them. Though she spoke quietly, her voice seemed to echo through the room, through the universe, backwards and forwards in time, begging to be understood by my adolescent brain.

I always tried to stay in the dream as long as I could, but eventually I would drift back off to sleep in the dream and wake up to my mom gently rousing me for breakfast.

My mom died when I was seven, and the dreams stopped. Well, I prefer to say she died. She was murdered. I hate that word. It's so cold; it falls off the tongue like shards of glass.

My mom was a health nut; protein shakes, weight lifting, yoga, the whole lot. Above all, she loved to jog. We had several acres of untamed land around the house. She always woke me up about an hour before dad went to work so she could go take a forty-minute run through the forest and along the creek; it befell dad to make me breakfast and get me ready for school.

They found her by the lake south of the house. And hanging from the old weeping willow in the middle of the pasture. And scattered across the countryside in a ten-mile radius around the house - but that was mostly after the funeral. All told, the casket had about two-thirds of a person inside when we finally buried her. They never found her head.

We used to be a close family - me, my sister, my mom and dad ... Losing mom, and losing her the way we did, splintered us. Dad lost himself in his advertising job. My sister turned inward, and fell into drugs and alcohol, when the kids our age figured out how to get ahold of it. Besides his job, dad's other mission was to keep his girls safe from all harm, and he took that one even more seriously. Leanna got it a little easier since she was four years older. I was taken out of school. Dad hired a tutor to homeschool me. I wasn't allowed out after dark. I wasn't allowed out without supervision. Unless I was being taken to town for some reason, I wasn't allowed to range out of eyesight or earshot of the house.

I started writing obsessively. Mom taught me how to keep a journal as soon as I could hold a crayon. I still have my very first one; the pages are filled with scribbles in different colors, and some pages are nearly colored solid. I guess I thought that good writing should fill as much of the page as possible. I remember how unabashedly delighted mom was to see every single entry. I guess writing is my way of honoring her memory.

I took mom's death hard, but it was a long while before I really understood what it meant that mom was killed. Dad told me that a very bad man had taken my mom from us, that she was dead, that she'd never come back. All things considered, he handled that conversation pretty well. Nothing could have softened the blow, though. My mommy was gone. I loved her and wanted her, but I'd never see her again. She was dead, and death meant people were gone forever. We weren't a religious household, so at that young age I was coming to grips with the fact that mom didn't exist anymore. There was a hole in my world. It was like that feeling when you go to grab something like a can of Coke without looking at it, and you end up swiping at the air because that can wasn't where you expected it to be.

I healed in time. For several years I was just chugging along, going through the motions, numb to the outside world. Closing myself off was easy; the outside world mainly consisted of our house and the clearing around it. My dad was mostly an authoritarian figure when he was home, always vigilant but never available. My sister babysat me when dad was gone, though she usually left me entirely to my own devices. She was homeschooled too, but she could drive; sometimes she would simply leave me at the house and go off to do Big People stuff. 

That Big People stuff, as I've written, consisted mainly of shooting up with her friends, or scoring more dope.

She had been chasing her high for ten years straight when I turned eighteen. Leanna had been living with her junkie boyfriend for a couple years. She was never able to hold down a job for very long, so she would spread her legs for a dealer until he let her move in. That was how she kept up her habit. When that didn't work out, she'd beg dad for more money and find another dealer to fuck.

It was a miserable, shady life for her, and she would have kept going until it killed her. And it did.

-------

My dad got the call at four in the morning on a Tuesday. I remember waking up, bleary-eyed, to see him looking like death warmed over. I had only seen that tortured look on his face once before, and I shot straight up, wide awake, when I saw it that night.

""Leanna,"" I said.

He nodded. My heart sank into my stomach and stopped beating. She was living in the city, a forty-minute drive away. A long, miserable forty-minute drive away. Neither dad nor I spoke a word. He sat stoically, knuckles white on the wheel, crying silently. I might as well have been dead myself. I stared at my lap, taking in nothing, thinking nothing, feeling nothing. Where my heart had been was a gaping hole.

Dad led me by the hand into the funeral home, and sat me down in a chair where I waited motionlessly as he went to identify the body. I heard his wracking sobs as he came back to get me some time later. I reflexively turned towards the sound. The funeral director and another man were practically holding him upright as he stumbled across the lobby. They took me up and walked us to a private area with a couple of couches, where we both collapsed.

I sat on the couch, mindlessly pulling at my hair, gazing at my father as he poured out his grief. He had always been a reserved man, but the dam had finally broken. We had no family but ourselves. Mom had grown up in a foster home, and had no love for the people she called her ""fake parents."" My biological grandma had a stroke and passed in her sleep. My grandpa followed not long after, as old widowers are wont to do. I never knew either of them. If we had any extended family, we never knew them.

I half-noticed the little hank of hair tangled around my hand. I hadn't felt it when I ripped it out.

Dad cried for a long time, eventually slumping sideways into his couch. When his voice was gone and his sobs came without tears, he stood up. He seemed to be carrying the weight of a thousand suns on his shoulders. At his slight nod in my direction, I stood up myself, and we walked together to the car. He pulled out a rumpled piece of paper and his phone, and dialed a number. We were at a motel fifteen minutes later. We went to sleep in our clothes.

The next few days were a blur. There were arrangements to be made, and that was dad's job. I went to town and bought us clothes and toiletries to keep us going while we stayed at the motel.

The funeral was a small affair back home. We laid her to rest in the plot next to mom's. Dad and I were the only mourners. A minister said some words, we each tossed a handful of dirt on the grave, and it was over. It was over.

-----

We stepped through the doorway and into our home. Quiet pervaded the empty space, the sort of quiet only found indoors. Clocks ticking, a gentle hum from our air conditioner, our breathing and the stecatto hitches as one or the other of us suppressed a sob.

We stood alone in an empty house, our bodies kept upright through some force of habit or instinct in the absence of warm blood flowing through our veins. My sister had imparted some vitality into this place, unbeknownst to us, even after our mother's murder. As our Leanna died, so died the house. I might have turned to see the land itself had withered, without so much as a shrug.

Dad pulled the door shut, and the click of its latch, impossibly loud against the quiet, signaled the start of our new life, or merely the end of the old.

I glanced at the clock: almost noon. The gears in my brain began turning, cast about for something to fill the time until bed, and found nothing. It then latched on to the only activity left, and my feet carried me to the stairs with sliding steps. They balked briefly, as if puzzled by a reason to lift off the ground more than half an inch, and then continued. A minute later, I fell backwards, collapsing onto my purple comforter. My toes brushed the carpet from time to time, but that didn't matter. Nothing did. Apathy sang me a lullaby, and the world faded away.

My staggered footsteps echoed through the tunnel, meshing with the steadfast crashing of many feet behind me. Searing hot agony blazed through my side. I had to keep running, I had to reach the end before -

I snapped upright, eyes unfocused, drenched in sweat. I bent forward reflexively and threw up bile into my lap. I sobbed, and choked on my own vomit. I coughed until my throat was raw, until the vessels in my eyes popped, and then collapsed sideways.

Good morning, world.

quietgrl,12,,7,1rchof,,20,"I had moved to Minnesota months ago, in order to get away from some strange phenomenon happening to me in Philadelphia since May 2013. I don't know what to call these things... ghosts, phantoms, spirits? However, my friends and family aren't judging my experiences as real accounts of the paranormal, they believe that I'm slowly losing my mind. And sometime... I wonder if that's the case too, if I'm simply falling into to some form of schizophrenia. 

I decided to share my stories here, so maybe I wouldn't have to feel much like a freak or that I'm going crazy. Or maybe I just don't want to feel alone with this. 

Well, I had a week to relax again, without anything strange happening to me. However, I had that feeling again that things weren't over and was just getting started. I am anxious all the time, ready for the next creepy thing to happen to me, and I'm not even sure if I can call my life “living” anymore. I rarely sleep, I barely function at work, and I'm losing a lot of weight from the lack of eating. 

My only distraction these days seem to be stupid videos on the web and chatting with the cute neighbor named Charlie. I don't share with him about my “experiences”, because I don't want him to look at me with those same pitying eyes that my friends and family give me.

Although last week, I did dare to ask Charlie if he had noticed anything strange in the neighborhood. He gave me a funny and confused look and I had to try my best to explain what I was asking, without really explaining the truth of my situation. “Oh,” I said, waving my hands as if the movements would untangle my nervous words, “You know... I mean, do you notice anything weird or any weird stories from others in the neighborhood?” I was trying to figure out if I was the only person who had a ghost following them.

“No.” Charlie said, shaking his head slowly in thought. And then his baby blue eyes lit up, “Well, yeah! If you mean if there are any weirdos here, yes we have a few, like anywhere else. I am a bit weird, for example.” “Nah.” I blushed towards him, “You're not weird at all. You seem very normal to me.” And very cute, I wanted to add, but I kept that thought to myself. 

Well, after a while of nothing happening to me, I didn't exactly catch onto the next bizarre incident right away. 

It must have been nearly 3am in the morning, when I heard a man singing loudly outside, “If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe... I'd been married a long time ago! Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?” At first, I was a lot annoyed for having my sleep disturbed by the most unlikely song, but then it was kind of funny that someone really seemed to like this song and thought it was a good idea to bellow it early in the a.m. 

Then another thought came to me, that it may be the voice of Charlie, proving me wrong about my earlier opinion that he wasn't weird. It sounded a little like his voice and I couldn't help but wonder if he was drunk off his ass and having a bit of fun tonight. I rushed from my bed and peered out the window, my eyes slowly adjusting to the darkness outside. The only thing I could see was a shadowed figured of a man, non descriptive, as he shambled towards the direction of the pathway between my house and Charlie's.

I giggled to myself, before heading back to sleep, knowing that I would tease the guy tomorrow about his choice of song. I slept peacefully, as the night faded back into silence. 

The next day, I did run into Charlie, a silly grin on my face. I told him how I spotted him in a chorus of Cotton Eyed Joe, stumbling towards his house, at 3am in the morning. He gave me the most confused lemon face that I ever saw on a man and replied, “Well, I don't know who you saw, but it wasn't me. For one thing, I was asleep at that time, dead to the world. And second of all, I hate that song! I don't even know all the words to it, let along could sing the chorus.”

“Hmm.” I said, a bit confused now, because I swore it was his voice that I had heard. “Hey,” he smirked, “I did tell you that we have some weirdos among us, right? It was probably Mr. Roy, who lives about two houses down from us. All he ever does is drink and he only seems to leave his house during the night to avoid conversation and eye contact with any of the neighbors. I wouldn't be surprised if he had a few too many last night.”

I agreed with that explanation for the time being, but I wondered if Charlie was somehow covering up an embarrassing moment that I had caught him in. 

The next night, the singing happened again, this time at 2am with a loud chorus of, “Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?” I rushed to the window and again I could only see a shadowed figure, shambling towards the pathway and disappearing around the corner leading to the front of the houses.

I felt uneasy about the movement of the shadow, as it didn't seem exactly like a human's walk at all, and very unlikely for even a drunken one. It was a combination of stops and jerks forward, like someone moving a puppet on a string. And sometimes the shadow seemed to jerk too far ahead, causing the figure to appear a couple of feet in the matter of a blink. I wasn't sure if I was just overly tired and seeing things or maybe not. I decided to go back to sleep and forget about it.

The next night, I was awaken by the man singing the song loudly again, this time at 1am. I had left my floodlight on before bed, a light that illuminates my driveway. I eagerly peered out of the window, hoping to see the guy's face this time, whether it would be Charlie's or the weird neighbor's. This time, the figured shambled directly in the path of the bright light and still his face was nothing but a shadow. There was no hint to any of its features, just a shadowed figured that belted out, “Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?”

I was frighten, shutting my curtains, and hiding under my blankets. I slept with my bedroom lamp on for the rest of the night, just like a little kid. Later in the day, I asked Charlie if he heard the singing man last night or any time this week. He did not. And again, I felt as If I may be hallucinating these things.

Last night, I heard the man singing again, this time at 12 midnight. And I refused to leave my bed and look out there, not wanting to see that shadowed figure shambling by, moving many steps ahead in the matter of seconds. I figured, it was all in my mind, that it would go away if I just ignore it. That's when I heard the creak of one of my floorboards at the end of my bed.

I sat bolt upright and could see the shadow standing at the foot of my bed. Its darkness seemed to stand out much bolder than the darkness of the room, a silent silhouette of a man, who just stood there and said nothing for a while. I was too afraid to move or to call out to my sister who was asleep in the nezt room. I just stared at the figure, barely breathing, waiting for it to move or flinch.

In a voice that was deep and demonic, it sang out, “Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?”

At that moment, I lost my shit and began to scream, as I flipped out of my bed and hit the floor with a huge thump. I began to crawl my way towards the door of my room, but that thing... it grabbed my ankle and began pulling me back towards it! I kicked, flailed around on the floor, and cried out, “No, no, no, no! Let me go!”

My sister burst into the room,flipping on the lights, her eyes wild and her voice wavering, “What's happening?!” The shadow man was gone and I broke out into tears, still very afraid but so relieved that it wasn't there anymore. After some moments of hysterical sobbing, I was able to tell my sister what had happened. I thin this time, she believed me.

I don't know if the whole thing was just a horrible nightmare or if I'm somehow hallucinating. However... that grab from the shadow man felt a lot real. I can still feel the memory of that grip on my ankle, a rough and cold hand, that eagerly wanted to pull me in towards it. I can't sleep with the light off now...",Cotton Eyed Shadow,27,nosleep
Mrreeburrito88,14,,6,1r1tik,,19,"I don't know if this counts as a lucid dream or not but I have been having the same time of dream for a number of years and it has always managed to freak me out. I don't know where else to post this so if I could get some insight on I would be get grateful. 
How it starts is that I am laying in my bed and I am slightly awake but I cannot move or speak. I can how ever see what is going on so there is that. While in my bed it feels like I have a huge weight on me and I cannot move. I do however, try to edge myself over to side of the bed in hopes of waking up because I don't want to feel that way anymore. 
There has been one time where I woke up several times on to be slammed back down onto my bed. That time managed to freak me out so much that I ran out of my apartment and did not return until later that day. Another time I felt as though I was dragged off my bed and dragged down a hallway that seemed like it was at an elementary school only to never reach the end. 
I thought it was a ghost, for lack of a better terms, for awhile but I could not gather enough evidence to prove it. I do not rule it out though. I have had not physical harm come to and it happens so often sometimes that I end up ignoring it and just get annoyed by it. Oh I almost forgot that this usually happens from 12-4 am if that makes any differences. I have wanted to film myself and maybe record what I might say during these happenings.

Myzrath,5,,8,1r5zd8,,17,"I came from a universe where things twisted and changed at the mercy of my infinite will. But here everything was the same. Every day I awoke encased in meat, trapped in the same skin I’d loathed for so long. I interacted with the same people I hated, and wondered why I couldn’t have been born across the ocean. My will and infinite vision was no use here: No matter how vivid my dreams were, they were meaningless and intangible. I spend endless nights staring at the mist and midnight skies, longing to revert to my true form. I dreamed of another existence that was so real, so overpowering that it choked out this disappointing joke  you call reality. Things are woven into the fabric of your world that you will never see or comprehend. And I longed to see them again.


I came from a place where I never had to question sanity, because there was no such thing. There was only the boundless infinity of thoughts. I was nothing, yet I was everything. I had no body and I had no pain. For vast, uncounted ages I soared through the bleak darkness of space, savoring the isolation and the pain it brought. My soul was seared by the fire at the hearts of stars, and my dreams were inspired by black holes sucking entire galaxies into oblivion. I wandered for eternity, but suddenly, it was over.


And I awoke in this prison of meat, wondering why the stars were so far away.


 I wondered why I had these new emotions, like hatred and longing. I was jealous of the other meat puppets for having better skins to walk around in. Or for living in a nicer house, or fucking a better looking slab of meat. Slowly I began to forget everything. And only in dreams can I remember true freedom: the boundless infinity where I once roamed as a collection of particles calls to me, and soon I will return.

I came from a dimension where my dreams, desires, and fears were nonexistent. I had no one to envy, no one to despise. I was a subatomic particle with the fury of a dying star, and now I’m trapped inside a walking corpse waiting to die.

The vomit had soaked through the covers, moistened my legs, and cooled by the time I decided to move. The clock read Too Early; I had slept for nearly sixteen hours. Whatever. Once my mouth was rinsed and the bedding had been bundled up and tossed in the laundry room, I padded into the main living room to watch infomercials.

Dad was up at six. I didn't notice him until he slumped back into the couch beside me. He was the first to speak.

""Morning,"" he said quietly.

""Mm,"" I agreed.

""How long have you been up?""

""Since four.""

""I came in to check on you several times. Looked like you were having nightmares.""

""Yeah.""

""You were crying. Tossing and turning. I tried to wake you up."" He pulled up the sleeve of his robe to show me some scratches. ""You, uh, thought I was a bad guy.""

My eyes misted up as I drew my knees up to my chest. Words began to spill out. ""I'm sorry --""

Dad cut me off. ""Shh. It's fine. I know you didn't mean it.""

His voice was so gentle. The authoritarian figure that had watched over me with a stern gaze was gone. The fierce strength behind his eyes was broken, and this man had no fire left. All at once, the protectve shell of numbness cracked and shattered. I wanted my daddy. Without a word, I crawled over and laid my head on his shoulder. Two weeks ago, this act would have been inconceivable. Two weeks ago, Leanna was alive. Some shred of rational thought in the back of my head noted with muted shock that the roles we had played every day were nothing more than an artificial construct, an act we played out every day.

Dad wrapped me up in his arms, and we cried together until I lost track of time altogether. Inevitably, the tears stopped flowing, though neither of us made a move away from the other for another hour. Who was left to prop the two of us up but each other? We sat watching infomercials, one after the other, neither of us really caring for anything but the hypnotic power of the glowing screen.

My stomach growled. I remembered that I hadn't eaten. In the same breath, I realized that my head was pounding. I clutched at my stomach.

""Eggs okay?"" my dad murmured.

I nodded, still bent over.

Dad lifted his arm from my shoulders and stood up. In the span of that motion, the weight fell on his shoulders again and he walked slowly to the kitchen.

I scarfed down the eggs unceremoniously and thanked my dad. After that, I retired to my room and spent most of the day at my writing desk, staring at a blank sheet of paper. I took regular breaks to stare out the window at the trees waving in the wind.

Eventually, the sun sank below the treeline, and I began nodding. As I did, my heart skipped a beat. Would I wake up tomorrow tangled in the sheets, fearing that unknown terror at my heels?

In the end, I told myself that it was irrelevant. Sleep is inevitable. I still couldn't shake the feeling of impending doom, that I might face that terror again. As I slipped under the covers, I cast about in my mind, looking for anything to ease my fear. A memory came, of a lady in silver. The dream I had when I was little. Suddenly I missed that lady. I couldn't recall her face, but the feeling she brought with her was clear as day when I thought about it. She made me feel safe, protected, warm.

Tears leaked from between my closed eyelids. I missed my mom. I missed my sister. I wished I could dream of that lady just one more time. Nothing was more important. I dwelt on her memory, and the aching desire for that little bit of relief spread through my body until I craved her like a starving girl that smelled pizza.

I fell asleep thinking of nothing else. And then I woke up.

She was standing at the edge of my bed, and she was beautiful, an angel wrought in the finest, purest of silver. And I did't hurt. I stared at her, and she was beautiful, and she returned my gaze, a quizzical look on her perfect face. And she was beautiful. Her hair and gown flowed behind her in slow motion, defying gravity. She opened her mouth as if to speak, then closed it and paused and lowered her gaze. Her eyes drifted back up to me, and ...

""Can you see me?"" Her voice was the choir of heaven, the sweet whispers of a thousand mothers cooing at their newborn children. It echoed through time and space, it echoed within my mind, and my heart lifted up higher, higher, until the echoes died away. I found myself smiling, tears of joy misting my vision, blurring it into a shine of silver against the darkness of my room.

I could only nod.

""You can understand me."" Her accent was stilted as though she was deaf; I got the feeling that speech was mostly unnecessary for her.

I collapsed as the sorrows, heartbreaks, and betrayals of my past bled from my soul, all at once. A moment later, I was at peace. I sat up in a fluid motion, turning to the silver lady before me.

""Yes. I was hoping I'd dream of you. I'm so glad you're here.""

""This is no dream.""

I laughed. ""How could this be anything else?""

""I do not know. But I promise. No dream.""

I considered this for a time while the lady waited, motionless save for her gown and hair. Some part of me knew that nothing this apparition would tell me would ever be a lie. Nevertheless ... ""Alright. I'll just stay up all night, then. That should make it pretty obvious."" I grew serious. ""Will you stay with me? Can anybody else see you?""

""You called me. Not sure how. Usually death calls me. But no one will die here. I don't understand. You know death. You should not see me now.""

My jaw would have been hanging open, except I seemed incapable of registering surprise that could overpower the warmth radiating from the ethereal lady in front of me. As it was, I responded, ""Hmm,"" a sound less consideration than contentedness. ""Well, what are you?"" I said, after a lengthy pause. She responded with a pause of her own, dropping her gaze and softly stroking her chin. And then, I felt a whisper in my mind, the gentlest touch of wind as something made its way inside. Her eyes lit up, and I felt her happiness. She could communicate without speaking, I suddenly knew, and this way was much faster, more precise. I tried to think back at her, and she didn't respond. A look of confusion passed across my face, and then I understood that I'd have to project myself back for two-way communication. Telepathy wasn't nearly overpowering as the sound of her voice, or maybe I didn't have anything left inside me to soothe and fix. I realized that I had a thousand questions, and we began to converse; to an observer, it would appear as though I was having half a phone conversation. I can only summarize our exchange:

She didn't seem to know what or who she was. She had no name. She simply popped into existence one day.

""What's your earliest memory?""

Dark-skinned, brutish people in caves. A woman being raped while her child watched. A fleeting moment, blurred, before her world became darkness, a state she termed sleep.

Holy shit.

She came and went, and sometimes she was in many places at once. Rarely she was everywhere. The last time that happened, she described lots of people starving or shooting at each other. Patches on shirts and overcoats: triangles and stars. The holocaust. She was everywhere then.

Holy shit!

My jaw was, in fact, hanging open now. ""You were everywhere? In the entire universe?""

No, not the entire universe. Just the earth.

""The oceans too? All the land?""

No. Only where there were people.

""Why do I feel so much better when you're around?""

She shrugged, lines of sadness creasing her face like cracks in polished diamond. The tragedy of her expression threatened to break my heart, as though I was watching a snake eat a kitten. Suddenly I saw myself as a child, myself and my mother. I knew this to be the last time I would see my mom alive. The silver lady was embracing her, weeping tears like liquid pearl. I could see a swirling darkness surrounding the two of them, there but not there. The more closely I examined the miasma with this second sight, the more sinister it became. I began to see through it, as though it was a portal to another dimension of gnashing, swirling teeth and rotting flesh. I felt a cold, alien intelligence invade my mind, and then I was a bug under a microscope. My mind was aflame with pain and disgust, pushing through the dull opiate warmth of the lady's protection. The demonic thing was plotting, yearning, and I could taste its desire with my own tongue. My vision began to fade to black, and I was immersed in inky, single-minded hatred of unfathomable depth. Time lost its meaning, and then I was back in my room, unsure if a second had passed or a century.

The lady nodded, filling my mind with her own, and I understood; I had seen the hunger in the world, a faceless, timeless entity whose only purpose is to consume and destroy. And before me stood the force of light.

Dawn broke through my window.

This might have been a bad idea, but I read about Astral Projection and started trying to practice it but I've had no luck.  But since then, I've been hearing things before I sleep and when I wake up.

A few weeks ago I started hearing the sound of boiling water coming from my kitchen in the middle of the night; after that it was quiet conversation; and after that it was the sound of a light switch being turned on and off.

In the mornings I hear scratching, and speaking and I can't pinpoint where it could be coming from.

What happened last night is what made me scared enough to write about this.  My eyes were shut as I was trying to fall asleep, and out of nowhere I heard typing on my keyboard, which is only a few feet from my bed.  I was too scared to open my eyes and look, so I acted like I was asleep.  This morning I saw a new icon on my desktop, it was a jpg, eventually I opened it and it was just black.

I remember a story arc in Grey's Anatomy, where the ghost of a doctor's dead lover followed her around and only she could see it. That's when I stopped watching the series.

I was eating cereal, watching reruns of Scooby Doo. I couldn't recall cereal ever tasting better, and I couldn't recall Scooby Doo ever being so entertaining. But that's how it goes when the embodiment of good is sitting beside you on the couch, giggling musically at the television. Today was a day of firsts for the both of us. Dad walked in at some point, looking haggard as I had ever seen him. His eyebrows shot up when he saw me curled up on the couch, neatly groomed and with color in my cheeks. I gave him a half-smile, equal parts enthusiasm and sympathy. Make no mistake; I hadn't forgotten my sister's death, but no therapy on earth could have matched the aura of the silver lady. I stood up smoothly, walked the three paces across the living room, and wrapped him in the biggest hug I could muster. He was apparently speechless, but when I looked up at him, I saw that the worry lines around his eyes had softened a little.

I reflexively looked back over my shoulder at the silver lady, and she expressed her joy at my desire to comfort my dad. I smiled at her, and then glanced back at my dad, who was looking at me quizzically now. I brushed my hair back over my shoulder and smiled at him again.

""We're going to be okay, Dad.""

He only nodded and wandered off. He had taken time away from work to grieve, and so he had not even dressed himself. In the silence that followed, I looked around. I had to laugh, and then I was shocked at the inappropriateness of my laughter. Sitting on the couch was a ghost that only I could see, a ghost that magically took away all my pain and trouble. Yeah, I must have snapped. Two deaths was one too many. My laughter had drawn the lady's attention. She looked at me and frowned a little. I shook my head at her, incredulous, and turned away. Things like this didn't just happen to people.

I was grateful, though; at least I didn't get the ghost of deathly melancholy or something. There wasn't much of an earthly nature that could upset me, with her around. That and the fact that I had an entire day to kill considered, I decided I might as well make the best of it. Everyone grieves in their own way, I suppose? Jurassic Park was showing, and I figured I'd go see it. The movie wasn't for several hours, though, and so I grabbed up my things and went for pancakes at IHOP. The silver lady sat across from me, and I couldn't help but laugh. The entire restaurant was going about its business, and yet, here sat a figure so obviously paranormal as to be hokey, like a ghost bride, her hair and gown blowing in a wind that only she could feel. She noticed my disdain and expressed a mild indignance within my mind. I shrugged it off and asked her what she could expect from me, but quickly shut my mouth and looked around when I realized that I looked like a total schizophrenic.

I still had an hour to kill after breakfast, so I decided to spend off some of my allowance; though it had been meagre from week to week, I had saved up almost a thousand dollars over my sheltered years. I drove down main street and visited several little boutiques, built into the slightly-renovated shells of old department stores and hotels from the town's conception way back at the turn of the century. Several tops caught my eye, and the lady waited patiently as I tried each one. I asked her what she thought of them from time to time, but she didn't seem to have an eye for clothes, having probably worn the same ghost dress for hundreds of millenia. I was just wrapping up at the last store, preparing to break another fifty dollar bill, when a little girl in front of me in line turned around.

She smiled wide and began tugging on the hem of her mom's skirt.

""Mommy! Mommy!""

""What is it, honey?"" the woman asked, a little exasperated but apparently feeling indulgent.

""She's so pretty, mommy!""

The mother looked at me and smiled, and I smiled back. ""Yes, she's very pretty, hon. Now come on, we've got to get to the bank."" She half-walked, half-dragged the girl out of the store; the girl's eyes were locked back over her shoulder, that cheesy grin still on her face.

I would have felt flattered, except the child wasn't looking at me. She was looking five feet to my left. Right where the silver lady was standing. My heart dropped right onto my stomach.

A sense of surprisingly smug satisfaction filtered through my mind simultaneously with a surge of grief and longing. Satisfied though she may have been about my reaction, the silver lady desperately wanted to follow the girl. Suddenly I was along for the ride, as the silver lady's desires became my own in our shared headspace. I paid quickly at the checkout counter and trailed along behind the mother and daughter as though in a daze. We walked out into the sunlight and I sneezed as my eyes adjusted. Their car was parked twenty paces from the store.

By the time I had halved the distance between us, they were pulling out. And then shrapnel was everywhere. I dropped to the ground reflexively and was peppered with safety glass. Truly in a daze now, I staggered to my feet and wandered, it felt, towards the smoking ruin in front of me. Their little blue sedan was wrapped around an old steel truck. I walked up to the passenger side window, got as close as I could despite the truck, and felt a warm breeze blow past me. The silver lady was in the car then, embracing the husk of what had just been an adorable baby girl.

Blood trickled from every orifice in her head. Her skull had split open from front to back, stretching her face oddly, and she was staring vaguely off into the distance, blinking out-of-sync, one eye and then the other. A couple arterial spurts sprayed the chrome bumper of the truck. One moment there was a girl fighting for life, and the next there was a life-sized gory mannequin.

I never got used to that part; when life leaves the body, the body ceases to be a person and becomes a shell, inanimate as though it never breathed or laughed or ate or drank.

Sound returned to the world, and I heard choking, gurgling screams. ""Oh my god, oh god no, my baby, oh god no."" My legs went out from under me. I sat down hard on pavement, kicked my legs until I bumped softly against the curb. The silver lady was crying again.

I don't know how long I sat there, but the next thing I knew, the street was lit up with red and blue lights. The din of sirens was crashing through my skull. I was nearest the crash when it happened, and so I had to give a statement. I must have done well enough at it, because the police let me go with the promise that I come in later to write everything out. The driver of the pickup was clearly drunk, and he must have been going twenty over the speed limit. I made my way back into the boutique with stuttered steps and asked for a phone. My dad was there in ten minutes flat.

I stared out the window blankly all the way home, held aloft solely by the presence of the silver lady. Dad tried to get me to speak several times, but his words were a dull chatter in the back of my mind. I closed my eyes as the tears began to roll down my cheeks. I curled up inside myself, and felt a welling spring of warmth rise inside of me as the tightness lifted from my chest. I fled into it, covering myself with the warming blanket of the silver lady's loving embrace like a child afraid of the dark. I breathed deep and opened my eyes. My gaze was drawn down to my own body. My skin had taken on a silver-white glow and an opalescence like polished marble.

I glanced over at my dad, wondering if he was seeing this. My heart skipped a beat as I took in the dark, sickly-hued vapor sticking to his skin like lake fog on a cold morning.

""Sarah? Sarah, what is it?"" he asked, seeing my face tight with shock and alarm. His voice was jarring; I could hear new and unfamiliar tones of worry and sadness layered within it. But I couldn't respond. I was busily looking around at the world, which had taken on an alien cast. The flora radiated crystalline hues and the sky boiled with color like something alive. I could see the air itself buzzing with activity.

""This is the true world,"" I thought to myself in a voice wholly not my own. ""We seem to have ... merged."" I felt my inner eye flipping through my memories and thoughts like the pages of a book, each moment replayed and recast in the new light of a foreign perspective. Simultaneously I felt my mind open to a tome of memories not my own, as though a hidden eye within me had opened for the first time. So much suffering, so much death. I was a failure. For aeons I had tried to stem the tide of pain and misery that ran rampant across the earth like a plague, but all my efforts amounted to a drop in the ocean.

I was being shaken. My mouth tasted of ozone. Dad had stopped the car, and I realized I was doubled over and screaming. Dad was near hysterics, trying to get a response from me. My voice, shaky and otherworldly inside my skull, said, ""Sick ... stomach. Home. Please, take me home.""

Benlightenment,1,,7,1r3pbk,,13,"So, my auntie used to work for a millionaire. Not the best kind though, the kind who got the millions by being lucky in the national lottery. He only won about 6 million or so, but it was enough to get him a fancy ass house, and to hire my aunt as a housekeeper/general helper woman.
His house was a kinda half-new project. There was an old bit of land with an old house sat on it just outside the city they lived in, which he bought up, and then built his house around that one. And then his garage, and a private gym... he wasn't clever with his money (and my aunt was stealing some too, which she went to prison for eventually, but that's another story).
So in the end, the guy pretty much bankrupts himself on silly business ventures and cars. He has to sell the house. At that point, I was staying with my aunt for a week or two for a little holiday, so she asked me if I wanted to come along while she had to clear some stuff out. Me, coming from a crappy little town, jumped at the chance to have a nosy around a millionaire's mansion.

Once we got there, my aunt took off into the kitchen, which is where Mr Millions was (his name was Lee, really). They basically said I can have a wander round, play on his Dreamcast (that was a mega thing for me at the time) and just don't mess around with stuff I shouldn't. Understandable.
So I wandered off, walked through a few of the mega living rooms with leather sofas and stuff. It was all pretty old, but I think that was more just because he'd bought it to look that way. I sat down and messed around on the Dreamcast for a bit, but got bored playing Quake and decided to go have another wander. He had a swimming pool, but I didn't have my trunks, so I was kinda lost for something to do. I figured I'd just go down the other end of the house where I hadn't been and see what else he had kicking around.

So, the house itself was a pretty standard layout. You know the mansion in Resident Evil 1? The entrance hall kinda looked like that, only it was dark colours and wood rather than white. Upstairs was basically just one long landing corridor which had loads of doors off it to bedrooms and stuff. At the very end was a double-door, which I'd never been through. Given the way the doors looked, I assumed they were part of the old house which he'd kept, so I went to have a look.

Inside was a pretty tiny room, considering the house. Probably could've fit two or three double beds in there at most. One side had a couple of armchairs and a little table, and the rest was like a little library, with a couple of bookcases free standing and the opposite wall to the chairs being a full bookcase wall, which was amazing to me at the time.
I figured there had to be something in here I wanted to read, so I went up along the wall of books just having a look what was there. It was all pretty standard stuff that you'd expect to buy just to fill up a bookcase. Dickens, Austen... that kinda stuff.

Now, from where I was, I couldn't see the doors anymore, cause the bookcases were in the way. So, not paying attention, when they slammed shut, I squealed like a girl and jumped almost out of my skin. Given the size of the house, I figured it was either the wind or someone closing the doors, not realising I was in here.

It wasn't, though. To this day, I still have no idea who did it (I say who rather than what, cause what is crazy) but both the doors were shut tight. But that wasn't the odd thing.
On the doorknobs was a book that had been placed there, balancing. So yeah, my gut is already going a bit weird at this point, cause that's just odd. The cover had bright colours though, so I assumed it was someone playing a prank. As I got close enough to read, I saw what it was: a kid's book. Innocent enough. Except for the title. 

“I See You”

It was some kind've of Peekaboo book for kids, but that didn't matter at the time. As soon as I read it, my blood froze and I ran out of there like a little bitch. 
I still don't know whether it was one of his family or not. The house has been pulled down since, though from what my auntie told me, the half that he built around is now a protected building, so it's still there, in pieces. 
She said it was haunted too, but that was only after I'd told her the story. It's about 10 years on now, and I still dunno what happened that day. Given that my aunt was thieving from the guy... it's not like I can ask him either.",The millionaire's library,20,nosleep
lamented_dreams,4,,8,1rgqu8,,14,"I love the dark. I really do.

I don't mean going gothic and pagan and all that, but I do like the dark. I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos, researching diseases and the supernatural, and writing stories.

Anyways, I've recently come across a quote from a game called 'Knock Knock'. And let me say, it's utterly terrifying for not just the player, but the watcher too. There's nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the game.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside."" —Knock Knock

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

I brought her dog just to stay there for a second line of defense as i was opening the door (The dog was a basset hound for those who might wonder). I opened the door and i saw two weird guys there, they looked like they have come from a party or something, atleast they looked drunk. ""Hello"", i said in my own language ofcourse, didn't expect visitors from other countries. They looked weirdly at eachother, dog barking like flipping fuck at them. ""Is this Norway?"" they answered, Surely that must be a weird question to ask. ""Yes, i suppose so, where are you guys from?"" i answered, trying to be as polite as i could. ""Oh, nowhere, was just checking with ya'"" they said with a weird look on their face. ""Umm, do you need to borrow a phone or something? surely that must be the reason you are here?"" i said. ""Well, we were just checking with ya'"" they said, with the dog between my feet still barking like heck. They looked at eachother and left. They went about 8 meters away from the house as i was closing the door. Thought it'd be impolite not to say goodbye, so i opened the door again to ofcourse... say goodbye.
They weren't there. Nothing was there. Everything was as usual, the dog had stopped barking, and i was left with a question: Is this real?.

I am sure that they couldn't have gotten more than 2 meter away from their spot while i reopened the spot, even if they ran at full speed. Even then i would have seen them. What do you think happened, people of reddit? could it really be some logical explanation for this?",I might have encountered a ghost.,17,nosleep
funnyguy135,2,,5,1r3dcj,,13,"When I was younger may family moved around a lot.  One of the places that we lived in was a town in New Jersey.  We were only there for about 1 year but the events that occurred will leave a lasting mark on me for a life time.  In order to protect the identity of people names will be changed.

During the summer when I was around the age of 13 my family moved to New Jersey.  Upon moving I quickly befriended my neighbor, James.  James and I began hanging out a lot and soon he started introducing me to some of his friends.  I soon became friends with these people and joined their little friend group of 4.  Pretty soon school started up again and I began meeting fellow class mates.  I made a few new friends but I mostly stuck with James and those people.

One day during school I left class to go to the bathroom.  Upon entering I noticed that someone had clogged the sink with paper towels and turned on the water.  Luckily I got there before the water started flooding over so I turned it off, cleaned up the sink and went about with my business.  When I got back to class I told Henry (one of the people in my friend group) about what someone had did.  He began to chuckle and told me I was funny.  I asked what he meant and he turned to me looking confused.  He asked, ""Wait, you don't know?""  I said I didn't know what he was talking about and he told me he would explain after school.

At the end of the day I went to go meet Henry so that he could explain to me what he was talking about.  I walked outside and saw James, Henry and Tim (the other member of the group) waiting for me.  I asked what was going on and they said they would explain.  They told me that about 5 years after the school was built, before any of us were born, a boy had been killed in the bathroom that I had used earlier.  They told me that he was being bullied and the bullies thought it would be funny to give the kid a swirly (a swirly is where you hang a kid upside down, put his head into the toilet and then flush it).  Any way what the bullies did not expect to happen was the kid to drown.  The bullies thought he was just being a pussy so they left him on the ground.  The body was later discovered later in the day when another kid went to use the bathroom and saw that he was not breathing.  The bullies got into some huge shit and were expelled and got into some trouble with the law.  After that there had been strange occurrences of toilets or sicks being clogged, strange noises being heard, toilets flushing on their own or even for some people seeing a little boy soaking wet standing in the middle of the bathroom.  The school had been putting it off as tricksters trying to scare younger kids but people honestly believed what they saw.  At the end of the story I told my friends that they were bull shitting me but when they kept trying to convince me so I got frustrated and went home.

The next day in the school the guys were still on me about the whole murdered kid and how he haunts the bathroom.  I didn't believe a word of it and started to get really mad at them.  We got into a fight and I didn't speak with any of them for a while.  About a month after our fight Henry left to go use the bathroom.  He was gone for 20 minutes and the teacher asked me to go check up on him.  I agreed and left go see what was wrong.  I walked into the bathroom and saw no sign of Henry but only a small puddle of water on the ground.  I figured that this was just some elaborate trick that the guys had set up to try and scare me.  I started saying out loud, ""Really funny Henry but you can come out now cause what ever you're trying to do is not working.""  Thats when I heard a slight whimper coming from one of the stalls.  I opened it to find Henry curled up in a ball on the ground soaking wet.  I knelt down and started shaking him and yelling for him to get up but all he did was lay there whimpering and slightly rocking back and forth.

I ran to go get a teacher and then brought her back to the bathroom.  When we arrived Henry was no longer curled up in a ball but now standing up in front of one the mirrors just staring into it.  The teacher ran over and asked what was wrong but he just stood there staring.  She started to pull him away and he look at her and said, ""No...I need to stay...he told me to stay...that i'm going to join him.""  The teacher asked who told him to stay and then after another second of silence Henry burst into tears and said, ""The boy...the boy tolled me.""  For about the next week Henry did not show up in school and James, Tim and I got worried so we went to visit him at home.  When we got there his mother answered the door and when we asked how he was she said that all he does is stay up in his room and when ever they asked him to leave his face changed and he said he was to afraid.  We went up to see him and when we got up there all he did was look up at us and then look back down at the floor.  We asked how he was doing and he didn't answer.  After a few minutes of silence Tim blurted out, ""So what happened Henry?""  James and both gave him a nasty look and he just shrugged.  Henry looked up at us and said that he saw him.  We asked what he was talking about and he said he saw the boy.  That they had stared at each other for about 20 minutes before the boy started walking towards him saying that he had to stay with him and join him.  Henry started to back away but that only angered the boy as he lunged at Henry.  Henry said that he was all of the sudden drowning in the toilet and he heard his name called and so he sat up and then collapsed to the floor.  I then entered the stall and tried to get him and the rest we already knew.  We all sat there in silence before with out a word got up and left.

Henry stopped coming to school and after a few months we heard that he had moved away.  We stopped talking about him because we refused to believe what he had told us.  As the school year came to a close my parents informed me that we were moving again.  I was upset because I would be leaving my friends but also slightly relived.  I stayed in touch with James and Tim but over the years we grew apart and the whole long distance thing stopped working.  The last I had spoke to them they said that they hadn't seen or spoke to Henry since that day we all went to see him.  I hadn't seen Henry either but to be fare I was purposely trying to avoid him.  I grew up and one day while reading the paper I saw a story about a man who had drowned in his own home.  His name was Henry Goldmen.  I figured that this couldn't be the Henry that I knew so long ago.  But there is still apart of me that wonders that maybe Henry was telling the truth and maybe what ever tried to kill him the first time waited years before trying again but this time it succeeded.

The_John_Deere,11,,14,1r800l,,14,"I thought i would be safe from stuff like this, that these sorts of things wouldnt happen to me for a long time. Honestly, I didn't. Hell, I especially didnt expect it to be at school. 

I've dealt with ghosts before, more than I can count. I can normally help when people have problems with the paranormal, but now I'm the one in need of help.

I assume many of you remember u/inaaace's stories about Rose and the orange, correct? How could you not, that was one of the biggest things on this sub all year. This encounter/series of encounters is like that.

It started about a month ago. I'd have a dream that I wouldn't remember, and then at random points in the day I'd remember having that in the dream. Every day more and more instances of déjà vu would happen. This week has been the worst. I remembered my dream on Wednesday, and everything tht happened Wednesday I knew would happen, like us having a substitute in French, a pop quiz in Trigonometry, and a surprise workout at Track.

Last night, I thought I had a normal dream. Just regular stuff. Until *she* showed up.

This girl has bothered me sine freshman year. She's a bit of a weirdo, and all my friend think she likes me. The feeling is not mutual. Anyways, she popped up in my dream with the creepiest damn smile I've ever seen. And ten everything went black. I don't know if the dream ended or I just forgot the rest, but it just stopped. 

I came to school today thinking everything would be dandy, and it was, until 8th period seminar (my school has a ""free period"" that we go to every other day, and the class we go to during that block alternates every time). I walked in, and she sat next to me. Awesome. Just what I need. 

For most of the class I felt her eyes on me, and everytime I looked over she had a smile that grew gradually bigger. By the end of the period the smile resembled the one from the dream *exactly*. I was extremely freaked out, and it was probably showing, too. I looked over one more time, and then te entire dream flashed back to me. She had been holding something in the dream, some small enough to fit in her hand. As soon as I remembered this, her eyes locked with mine, an then she reached into her bag, 

And held out an orange.

I have to go back to that class in 2 hours. I don't know what to do. Nosleep, please help me. I don't think I can handle this one alone.

Edit for words. Sorry I was in a rush to write this.

EDIT 2: 15 minutes left in class, nothing really noteworthy has happened. Seems like she's backed off a bit. I still feel her eyes on the back of my head, though, so I'm bracing myself for when class is over.

EDIT 3: sorry about the delay, early track practice. The remainder of class was extremely uneventful except for the last 5 minutes, during which she got that freaky smile on her face and started slowly moving closer to me. When the bell rang, I bolted. Didn't want to stick around any longer. 

But what's really freaky is what happened around the end of practice. We had a workout today, and on our cooldown I could have sworn I saw her, behind the trees or on the other side of the road. I just ignored that though, and it's all been pretty good since. I just got home, so I should be safe. I'll keep you guys posted if anything else exciting happens.",I didn't think this would happen to me.,28,nosleep
Pretending_To_Care,2,,10,1r6wgf,,14,"It was around 1am, when Steve and I stumbled upon the railroad tracks that lead out of our small village. 

""You know, about two miles down the track, there's an old church that's been abandoned. I hear it's a place for Devil worship."" Steve was grabbing a branch just off to the side of the track. 

""Fuck that."" I snapped. 

""Chicken shit?"" Steve smiled. 

""No! I just don't think it's a good idea. Rick said he'd been there during the day with Alan, and there was blood all over the place and a stick that had been used to stab something.""

""How would he know that?""

""There was blood on it.""

""Well look, I've got a stick! How's about I stab anyone if they get near. Or you, for being a pussy."" Steve began jabbing towards me like some sort of fencing opponent. 

""Fine, we can go, but you lead the way, big man."" I agreed. 

We hiked down the tracks for about an hour and a half, maybe longer if you count the couple times we stopped so Steve could smoke from his pipe. The church was in sight. 

As we got closer, we notice a faint light pouring out of the broken door at the front of the church. When we were within twenty or so feet from the side of the church when we crouched behind some trees in the woods. 

""Do you hear that!?"" Steve gasped. 

""Hear what?""

""That chanting.""

We fell silent for a few seconds, but in turn were met with more silence. Nothing. 

""Look, let's creep around front and see if we can get a look inside."" Steve was already headed toward the front before I could object. 

It's a surprise that if anyone were inside, they didn't hear us. Steve was stepping on every stick his feet could've found.

As we placed our backs against the wall of the church, we could hear shuffling against its concrete floor, then silence again. 

Steve leaned over to me ""Right, on three, we both take a quick look... One, two... three.""

We probably should have booked it as soon as we saw what was inside, but shock had totally frozen us in place. 

Upon looking inside, we were met with the dead stare of about thirty fully cloaked people. They knew we were there, and they just stared at us. Behind them was a bloodied lamb, and beside it, a man holding a stick.

Now I'm no expert, but I thought sacrifices were conducted with a blade. NOT by gouging what must have been a couple dozen holes in the body of your sacrifice. 

""Jesu- Oh my God man, fucki- RUN!""

We ran as fast as we could for about ten minutes before I pleaded Steve to wait for me. I couldn't run any more. I had to catch my breath. 

""What... the FUCK was THAT!?"" Steve gasped. 

""I, don't know. You fucking idiot. I told you we shouldn't have gone anywhere near that fu-"" I stopped abruptly.

Behind us was a mob of people carrying flashlights.

""Get down!"" I gasped. 

We laid silently in the dark of the woods for what seemed like forever. We kept our heads down, trying not to breathe. The only indication about where they were was from the lights they carried, and then the worst possible thing that could've happened, did.

In succession, all the lights that were just on, went off. We were blanketed in darkness with this group of men, no more than thirty feet away. We only heard the crackling of branches and the shuffling of leaves for the next few seconds before we heard a voice nearby, grumble a faint ""We have seen you. Come out.""

I couldn't see Steve, but I knew what had happened. Steve bolted off further into the woods, snapping their attention right at us. I could hear him sulking as he ran harder and harder, but they were catching him. I remained silently on the ground as they disappeared. 

I must have laid there, not making a noise for fifteen minutes. What just happened? I was worried sick about Steve. They got him, I just had this feeling, they got him. 

Eventually, I crept my way back home and snuck into my room without waking my parents. I contemplated waking them up to tell them what happened for a while, before I broke down and did exactly that. Sort of. 

At this point, it was around 6am, and dad was getting ready for work. I told him that Steve and I were in the woods and we got spooked by an animal and lost each other running, so I just came home. I told him I was worried Steve might have gotten hurt and that we should call to see if he was okay. My dad is a sharp man, and knew something was up, but didn't question me. He just nodded his head and said ""Okay. ""

We contacted Steve's mother, who confirmed that, surprisingly, Steve was home. After a few more minutes, my dad concluded their phone conversation and reassured me Steve was okay. 

Around noon, I drove over to Steve's house to check in on him. When I got there, he signaled me to follow him up to his room. 

""They know who we are."" He said. ""As I was running, they yelled my name at me. These people, they know who we are.""

I froze.

""If they know who we are, then they live in our village.""

""Exactly, we-..."" Steve stopped himself. ""What do we do?"" He asked.

Theresa92,5,,7,1r3wvr,,12,"I have been reading this subreddit for a while, so I upgraded to pro so I could post my own creepy stories. Depending on the response, I have plenty more.WARNING: sorry for the length . Rather be thorough

So a little background, I'm a First Nations female living on reserve and I was probably around 15 when this happened... As a native women I have always been very spiritual.

The house I was and am currently still living in is about 4acres in the country on reserve and the area by my house is surrounded by trees on 3 sides, with a long driveway. There's a path just off the trees line that I used to love too walk but to get to it you need to do a bit of bush whacking. 

So one day I'm out on a walk on these trails with my 3 dogs; Ginger (mix breeds of something), Maggie and Charlie ( both black labs). The trail I'm walking goes for about 1km before you reach a sort of T intersection, go south and in .5 you reach these sand dunes or head north and there's acres and acres of trails. As I'm walking with my dogs, I get to this intersection when I hear Ginger start to whimper, she's nudging me trying to get me to head back home, I think this is odd  but my other dogs are fine so I brush it off and keep walking as Ginger takes off running home with her tail between her legs. 

Feeling adventurous I go north to do some exploring. 2 dogs in tow. I get another kilometre before a coyote comes across our paths. Dogs growling , coyotes looking at us, growling. That is till it looked behind us, kinda whimpered, and took off. Still didn't think much of it. What I was paying attention to was the howling coyote close to us and close to probably 5-10 of them I can hear howling not to far in the distance. 

Decided it was time to take my growling dogs home far away from the pack of coyotes coming for us. 

Everything was going fine on the walk back, coyotes got close then they got distant. Dogs were happy, that is... Till we got to that damn T intersection. It was like a fricken flip got switched. My once happy dogs started whimpering, I felt them nudging me on both sides, they started kind of running up ahead before they would turn around, realize I wasn't with them and they would come back by my side, nudging me to go faster, whimpering, tail between their legs. I was  scared... Then I heard it .

2 claps, right behind my head. I'm I'm the fricken bush ! I turned around slowly and ... Nothing. I grab the biggest branch I could find and start walking. 
Double clap, keep walking
Double clap, maybe it's an animal, but what kind of animal makes that noise right behind your head ?!? 
Double clap, turn around.., still can't see anything !!!
Double clap, keep walking
Double clap, little people, centaurs, bad spirits ? 
Double clap, I want to run all the way home but force myself to walk because running seems like it would make the being watched and followed feeling so much worse... 
Double clap, scared me, scared dogs...ALL...THE WAY...HOME... followed me all the way to the tree line, my dogs were scared all the way home, till we hit the tree line..then they were happy...

I ran to my mom crying, warning her not to let anyone walk the trails alone anymore. I still can't, not alone. 

I don't know what followed me home, but I know that whatever it was, it was very bad..",Followed home by something while walking in the bush,19,nosleep
angelcot,3,,1,1rh91p,,12,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep

I walked beside my friend, and as we walked, we talked. I can’t remember what we talked about, but all I remember is this bland, superficial conversation about nothing in particular. Conversations like these bothered me; they didn't seem real to me, just like sounds, verbal ""things"" that hold no real meaning. And as I thought about our conversation, I wanted to make it more real for me, to give our little talk some depth, and just before I asked her a meaningful question, I tripped. I startled awake, rubbed my eyes, glanced at the clock but the time didn't register in my head. I realized that I needed to go the the bathroom. I shuffled over, dragging my feet to be sure I didn't trip or stub my toe, flicked on the lights, squinting from the brightness, relieved myself and turned on the faucet; I ran my hands under the cool water, threw some water on my face, picked up the towel and wiped my face off. As my eyes adjusted to the light, I looked at myself in the mirror, and my reflection was... smiling at me...I considered that I may have been dreaming, or hallucinating, but my cold damp hands and the pain of the bright light was all too real. I did what I would usually do when in this sort of disbelief and rubbed my eyes some more, hoping I was still just a bit drowsy. 

But nothing changed. 

I looked at myself and was quite curious. I felt my face with my hand to see if I was actually smiling… It certainly didn’t feel like it. Normally this would creep the hell out of me, I would, on any other occasion, scream or run away, but I just stared at the reflection, looking into my eyes as if they weren’t mine. A genuine happiness. I haven’t felt that way in far too long. I felt calm. But suddenly, as though something dropped to the ground, the feeling of calm had broken, like a shattering vase, a feeling welled up inside me. 

A tightness in my chest.

Like someone had just punched me, it was one of a gurgling frustration. I would be happy if it weren’t for this stupid house, things are constantly broken, and this wretched family; it all torments me, every day of my life. That’s when I heard the voice of my father from couple days earlier “Because I said so.” the words resonated in my mind, I could feel my teeth gritting, the sound made my skin crawl... but the reflection just kept smiling back...taunting me. The shrill sound of my mother’s voice beckoned in a continuous annoying ringing in my ear…I shook my head to clear my thoughts but the ringing was still there. I peered over at the clock and looked at the time. 2:34... 2:34... 2:34…2:34? It's late.

I couldn’t possibly sleep now, I was simply too stressed. I had school tomorrow, but I had to deal with this.

“Let me sleep” I muttered half to myself, half to the voices and that face in the mirror. This was when I noticed the mirror had stopped reflecting my actions, and just was a still image of myself smiling. I became angry at this point “What is wrong with you…” I said to it, hoping it would stop. “Just go the hell away!” I growled through my teeth. Feeling rather violent I stared back into my eyes, trying to counteract that incessant grin with my anger. ""No."" It's mouth didn't form the words, but the sound just streamed out of it. The ringing got louder and louder, I tried to cover my ears but it felt like it was coming from inside my head, the voices began circling me and taunting me and that terrible ringing. Then it all just stopped. Was it over? I just wanted to go to sleep so I could continue my broken life. It started laughing, a laugh that sounded unmistakably like my voice... But it was a sound I had never made before... a sound like... true laughter... this was new to me. It bothered me. I was envious. Why can't I experience that kind of happiness? He bothered me.

I had enough. 

The voices all faded away but the mirror kept smiling. “STOP!” I yelled as I punched the mirror, the blood was quick to run down my arm and the few pieces of mirror were stuck in my hand, I could feel them scaping at the bone. The remnants of the mirror on the wall reflected nothing but my angry scowl and bloodied arm. I stared at my hand. It didn't hurt, but I could lightly see the reflection of my own face in the bloodied shards. It still smiled. IT STILL SMILED. ""NO."" I slammed my hand against the counter, the blood spilled all over the room, on my shirt and face.

“And so it happened, Blake had snapped;
though In his own mind, he was trapped.
Broken and confused he wanted to die.
But all he could do was simply cry.”

“The lights flicked off, his mother shrieked, in the other room;
scared, as though she could feel her impending doom.
His father had been up all night drinking
While Blake was pondering and thinking.”

“The sound of the window outside smashing,
rang in his mind, terrifying, echoed the crashing.”

“NOW OF ALL TIMES!?” Blake shouted furiously.

“We enter Blake’s house to a horrid scene,
the smell of blood, nothing was clean.”

“The sanctity of his mind, and house violated,
with adrenaline and fear, his pupils dilated.“

“Sprinting to the kitchen he grabbed a tool,
a knife, very sharp, for he was no fool.
Not afraid to risk his life, with nothing to live for,
This life. And the criminal, he did abhor.“

“Creeping through the house to find the thief,
He heard a loud scream, though very brief.“

In his parent’s room he finds the two mangled corpses, the floor already soaked in blood. His parents had been completely mutilated, each had been stabbed numerous times, now slumped on the floor, eyes still open. A figure stood overtop the lifeless corpses that were once his parents, hunched over, with a bloody knife in hand, the tall man was half visible in the moonlight that came through the window. His skin fair and pale, his face, was itself a conundrum... it was an inexplicable quality. His face looked… off. Like an optical illusion where all you can do is stare and ponder. His fingers were skinny, the joints looked massive in comparison. He looked almost inhuman; but he was unmistakably a man. 

“Awkward” echoed in my mind; perhaps for lack of a better word, as he edged toward me.

""You didn't..."" I said to him.

“‘You’re welcome,’ I stated in a soft, warm voice
to Blake who accepted my words without much choice.”
“I followed him back to the kitchen, as he put the knife down,
The blood dripped from his hair, as heavy as a crown.” 

“‘Its done, its over.’ He quietly muttered to himself.
‘We can sleep now’ He put the knife on the shelf.”

“I climbed back out the window, never there was a mess;
as Blake walked, he had no more stress.”

“His house unviolated but his mind still tainted,
to this new life, he will never be acquainted.”

My wits came back to me. Cold blood streamed down my arms. I walked calmly to the bathroom and looked at the cracked and bloody mirror, the counter was a mess. Between the cracks I see my face, depressed. Sad to the point of a complete bleak. The frown. That was more like it... That makes more sense to me, no longer that disgusting smile. I saw a tear on his face. It was of blood. Feeling around on my face, I felt a drop of blood. Blood on my face? Then I felt something that I did not expect. 

A smile. 

My mind twisted. Reality as I knew it broken, demented, distorted. I looked again at my hand... The shards of glass still glistened in the light, even covered in blood. I saw a piece of bone fractured. I glanced again at the clock, 3:07... ""When did that happen?"" I said, as recollections of what had just happened streamed back into my mind. Did I wake up my parents when I hit the mirror? Then reality hit me in a particularly cruel manner.

For a moment, dead silence.

“MOM, DAD!” I yelled as I sprinted across the house into their room. There they lay. Bloody and mangled bodies, multiple stab wounds on both of them, in the torso, the chest, the legs, the knees, even the face.

I hugged them, soaked in their still warm blood. Yelling at the top of my lungs, “I’M SO SORRY! I’M SO SORRY!” 

Like a pin dropping, the tick of the clock in their room brought me to how real this was.

But only one thought reverberated in my mind. 

This is going to totally ruin my day... 

After about 20 minutes, the blood grew cold, and the corpses began feeling rather stale. I walked around their room, looking for my next day’s lunch money, and as I was walking out, I slipped in a pool of blood. With a loud crash, I continued to lay on the floor for quite some time, I silently muttered to myself

“Dammit, now I need to get some new clothes.”

I began pacing toward my room, taking off my shirt, frustrated by this inconvenience. I threw it on the floor, and it made a sloshing sound. ""Maybe I can wash it..."" My mother had done my wash up until now. I took a shower and put on some new clothes. Clean at last. 

I walked back into my parents room. I stared a little while. Maybe 2 or 3... hours. It was so… Peaceful. This should’ve happened a long time ago.

When I remembered that it was time for bed. 

I began laughing. Laughing as I never had before in my life. Overjoyed. More genuine than any laugh I have ever had. 

Time for bed? I don’t have a bedtime anymore. No one to yell at me. No one to tear my mind apart. I laughed and laughed until I heard my alarm clock go off in my room. 

“Oh, time for school!” I said with a grin on my face.
But without my parents here to test me, this was no race.
Me? This house was now my place. 
I'm here to stay, for I had left quite a trace.

Dectrek,2,,4,1rbx7r,,13,"All my life I have never believed in luck. It’s just some stupid phrase coined from the minds of jealous or self-absorbed people saying, “Aren’t I the greatest, I just won $50,000 off the lottery! I’m so lucky!” or, “Can you believe that he just won 50 grand off the lottery, that son of a gun.” Now just because I think that luck is a bunch of crap doesn’t mean that I gamble. Oh I gamble alright, I gamble until I’m rich and drunk at the same time. I’ve been to Vegas with my friends, Ron, Jerry, and Max a ton of times and they always say, “Wow Rob, you’re so lucky!” and I’ll either ignore them, or I’ll be too drunk to hear them. I was addict when it came to gambling, but one night, that all changed.

It was another Vegas trip with the guys. I had lied to my company telling them that I was going on a “business trip” and they had completely bought it. I even was able to use company money to pay for the trip! We checked into our hotel room and decided that tonight, we were going to live like there was no tomorrow. I played craps until I was running low on money so I went to the blackjack table and counted cards until I was well funded for the rest of the night. We drank and we drank and we drank until we could barely see anymore. I started to black out so we went to the streets.
	
Now the next events were blurry and I don’t remember all of it. I think what happened was that my friends were telling me that I lucked out at blackjack when one of them said something about me cheating. I got all offended and started taking hits at him and I think we got in a fight. Next thing I knew I was in an alley and was starting to black out, probably not such a good idea to have had that much to drink, and that’s when every turned black.
	
This is when it happened. First, everything was dark and I couldn’t feel anything but then I heard voices. They were cheering all around me that sounded like something exciting was happening and then I got the sense of feeling back. I was lying on my back and there were voices all around me, cheering as if it was a football game. Then the lights went up.

I was blinded at first but as my eyes adjusted to the light, I saw thousands of people sitting in stand around a stage that I was on. I was laying a colorful wheel, something you would see on the wheel of fortune, and I couldn’t get up. Beyond the crowed was darkness and the only light came from a huge light bulb that was about 10 yards from where I was laying. A man was standing on the stage and was holding a microphone.
	
“Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome too our next contestant, Rob Johnson!”

The crowd went wild and the wheel started to spin, slowly at first, but it gained speed quickly. I was beginning to feel sick when I heard “Jerry, press the button when you’re ready!” and the wheel began to slow down. As it slowed I heard the man on the stage yell, “Let’s see how luck our contestant is!” too which the crowed started to yell out colors that they thought the wheel would land on. The wheel stopped on the color green, and the crowd screamed with joy. All around the room the color green was shown with the words “Bad luck” on them. I was deeply confused when I heard, “Well it looks like Rob wasn’t too lucky, stay tuned for our next contestant,” too which I blacked out.

I woke up at the hotel in bed, where I instantly began to contemplate what happened during the night. I came to the conclusion that it was all just a dream and that my friends found me in the alley that I passed out in. They had driven me back to the hotel where I slept the rest of the night away and was now waking up from a drunken dream. Ron came into the room where they asked me if I was ok and what I was doing in that alley, too which I replied, that I just had had one too many drinks. They gave me some water and then told me to get ready for breakfast. The rest of the day was ok up until we went back to the casino at night. I was losing my fortune at craps again so I thought I would count cards at Blackjack again to refund my losses.

My count revealed that the next card too be thrown was going to be a four and I had 17 points on the table. He had thrown 4 aces, kings, queens, jacks, 10, and so on and so until 4 to which he had only thrown three. I knew that there was no possible way that I could lose so I went all in He picked up the next card and laid it on the table, and what I saw I couldn’t believe. He had laid down the ace of spades which I distinctly remembered getting three games ago. I just sat there in disbelief as he ranked in all of my money.
	
I ran to the atm and took 5000 dollars out of my account and ran back to the blackjack table where I counted cards until that was all I could think about but every time my calculations revealed what the next card was, It was always a card that made me go over 21. I kept running to the atm and running back to the blackjack table but I always lost. My bank account was swept clean that night; all of the money that I had worked hard for year after year was taken away from me in a few hours.Ron, Jerry, and Max all said that it was just bad luck but I couldn’t believe what happened that night. It had been a terrible night, but not as bad as what happened when I feel asleep.

I was back on the wheel, and everything was exactly the same as the night before, except I got a new color! This time, I landed on purple which lit up the room with the word “Truth”. When I woke up, it was the next day, and my friends came in and brought me too breakfast. That day, my company found out I lied to them about the trip when all of my bank account money disappeared, and I was fired. The bill for the trip was sent to me but I knew I wouldn’t be able to pay for it. That night I was back on the wheel being spun again for a new color.
This continued for ten days, each brought a new horror such as “pain” or “divorce” to which I was beaten up by some muggers and then divorced by my wife. On the eleventh night, I was standing on the stage with the man holding the microphone. “Let’s give it up for Rob Johnson everyone!” The man yelled and the crowd went wild. I was ushered off the stage and was taken into a room with the guy who had the microphone.
	
“Nice job Mr. Johnson,” He said, “The crowd loved you!”
	
“What was that?” I asked, “I demand you tell me at once what is going on.”
	
“Oh, I’m sorry, you must be very confused. I’m Chris Armstrong, and I run this show. You see whenever someone new comes along, we take the number of big sins that that person had committed in the past 24 hours and we have them face the wheel and its consequences that many times. You had 10 total major sins in that past day so you faced the wheel ten times. You sure put a show on for the audience!”
	
“Sins?” I asked.
	
“Oh yes, you committed theft, gambling, murder you name it! You cheated at blackjack, you became drunk, you beat up a few people, and you committed more theft. We haven’t seen a suspect like you for a while!”

“I don’t remember anything like that!” I snapped at him.

“That’s probably because you were drunk when most of it happened. Don’t worry though; you’ll have plenty of opportunities to make up for them later.”

This is when a thought occurred to me, he said I committed murder but I didn’t remember doing, or who I did it too.

“Wait… who did kill?” I asked suspiciously. 

“You don’t know? I thought it would have occurred to you by now. Let’s see if I can make you realize who. You got into a fight with him after you left the casino. You hurt him pretty bad, and in your drunkenness, you killed him. When he came here, we thought that instead of making him face the wheel, why not have him push the button that stops the wheel from spinning. It was an attraction that brought in a larger crowd than usual.”

That’s when I remembered him saying “Push the button when you’re ready Jerry” and how I had gotten into a fight with one of my friends about me cheating at blackjack.”

“I killed Jerry?” I asked in horror, but then a new though came into my mind, “Wait, if Jerry is dead and he pressed the button to stop the wheel, then does that mean I’m…”
	
“Yes, you are dead,” Chris said as if he knew exactly what I was about to ask, “You died of alcohol poisoning when you passed out in the alley. The past 10 days have been a simulation. Mr. Johnson, welcome to Hell.”

Lucky me.

nisyldaed,10,,10,1r6mcx,,11,"Someone once said ""The greatest strengt is to know your weaknesses."" Luckily I found that out quite Early. 
You might say that I've been blessed with a keen perception, so I always tended to grasp certain concepts and situations quicker than the peope around me, which quickly lead me to thinking that I was somehow superior to others.
Letting these thoughts and thus my hubris overtake me : that was and still is my greatest weakness, but ironically the very cause of my Pride allowed me to realise this very thing, so whether it's a blessing or a curse might be your own perspective.

My story begins with something that should have been a regular day at my university, you know: attending courses, not paying attention, browsing the internet on your phone, etc.
I can't really get into detail here, 
because my memorIes of what happened are really blurry, but I remember a loud crack, a bang and loud rumbling. The next Thing I know is waking up in the local hospital.
From what I've been told, the corridor I walked through that day collapsed without any reason and buried 5 students beneath it. I was the only survivor.

NOw, that event didn't really help with the aforementioned pride, quite the contrary:  I convinced myself that somehow I subconsciously saved myself from the collapsing ceiling and that my surival once again showed that I was better than the others wo died.
Once I fully realized what I just thought I couldn't help but feel disgusted by myself, but this was only the beginning of my descent.
Of course I went back to university after a fEw days, since I only had some bruises and a boken finger, and that's when the prideful Thoughts became more frequently and more aggressive. Word of my survival got around pretty quickly, since it's a small university, so everyone I knew and some people I didn't know came up to me and talked like I was some kind of miracle survivor, or in some cases even a hero. And, needless to say, I absolutely loved that. I also began to notice that I began to be more condescending towards other people. Sure, I've always had my share of disrespectful thoughts about some persons but ever since the accident I sometimes said things aloud and I Always hit them where it hurt, it was pathetic to watch.

After a few weeks things started to go bacK to normal, people wouldn't talk to me that much anymore and this bothered me to no end. They wern't giving me attention anymore. Had they forgotten what I waS? Had they forgotten that I WAS SUPERIOR?
It couldn't go on like this, they needed to be reMinded, reminded of the greatness that was mE, no, IS ME!

Remember the quote from the beginning? I think it's bullshit. Because one of the greatest strengths is actually to be a good liar. And what a great liar I am – I've been lying to you all the time!
They still haven't figured out that I blew up the corridor. Still don't know that I indeed survived the collapsing corridor by an accurate calculation. 

And next time I'll be showing them my true greatness, it will be a lasting reminder.",Pride,21,nosleep
TreasureHouseofDoom,16,,62,1r396v,,12,"Channeling Aunt Lucia’s strength and wit, remarkable as both had always been, I felt myself fortified for what lay ahead, but that didn’t mean I was completely unafraid.  Fear and anxiety are nearly interchangeable in certain situations, and shedding them completely is not always the wisest approach.  Composure maintained, I dealt now with redirecting the bases of these emotions into something productive and controllable.  I remembered my mother’s fearlessness, the way she seized every opportunity to create and do good, the inner power she exuded. This I channeled, too.  Sisters in unison (one living and one passed on) to strengthen me, I was sure I carried now a shield of sorts.  Across the miles, as if she knew the battle I faced, I could almost hear my mother say, “Keep your head up, Julianne.  Stay focused.  Do good work.”  This was her mantra, and as far as I knew, it had never failed her.
Laughter rose from the study again, and I was about to step through the door, open myself to the onslaught, when I caught the fragrance of chocolate on the air, warm wafts from just beyond the door from the foyer to the hall.  I heard the voices of children, conversation and giggling, just beyond that, too.  Instinct told me this is where I was needed most.  Dulcie wanted me to follow her into the study, and in her realm, there was no telling what might happen, but Mary’s presence was just ahead of me, and it was possible I would have the opportunity to observe more of the events that had led to terrible schism between friends.
Doors shut and power out, the hall was dark, and the musty odor of rooms not allowed to breathe hung in the air.  I tried but couldn’t recall if I had smelled this odor the night before.  The chill and dank fragrance felt captive, too, as if I were stepping into some forgotten time and place.  It was completely possible that I was, that I had discovered some portal, that Mary had provided one.  Passing doors, I heard the sounds of the once living in other spaces, the turn of a music box in a nursery, the zip and knock of a trestle-powered sewing machine, probably a Singer like the one my mother used as a plant stand at home, the coos of a baby and the lullaby her Mama sang.  These memories, vital and vibrant, empowered me, too.  There was good energy about this place, and I allowed it to circulate now through me.  
Three doors I passed to either side, and I was just about to open the door to the kitchen, when a fourth door to the right opened slightly.  Through the slim space provided, I heard the singsong voice of Dulcie, coy and friendly, beckon, “Won’t you come play with us, Julianne?” In the background, the festive tones of a calliope rose and fell, and I found myself reminded suddenly of a wonderful memory from my childhood.  My siblings and I had been treated to a day at the North Carolina State Fair, where my mother had introduced us to a man she knew from antiques auctions.  He’d shown us the most glorious old calliope, and he’d had a real pet monkey named Clayton the Scoundrel.  
These are the old tricks of angry spirits, to tease some memory out of us, exploit and make it vile, distract good people from good works.  I knew this, but I longed, too, for simpler days, days when my sister, brothers, and I were among familiar people in a familiar place, days when we were too young and innocent to recognize the darkness in others.  
‘Julianne,” familiar voice from the kitchen prevailed, and as I reached for the cool brass doorknob, I knew immediately whom I would find on the other side.  
“Aunt Lucia,” tears stung my eyes, but joy filled my heart.  Three years she had been gone, on the other side, only her voice to guide me, so much more than most others ever had again of a loved one, but now she stood in front of me, poised, pretty, powerful.  Emanating from her in golden beams was the very energy she had radiated in life. “How can this be?”
Aunt Lucia’s smile was warm invitation into the kitchen.  ‘Forgive me, but I worried you wouldn’t get the fudge just right.’ And she laughed at me as others of our family often did.  I was neither a baker nor a cook, ‘but she is a Kook!’ my sister might have said.
‘These young ladies have just introduced me to Vassar fudge.’ And now I saw Mary at the island in Seth’s ultra swank kitchen measuring out white sugar.  Across from her stood Dulcie, her expression perplexed.
‘Miss Lucia, wouldn’t it all be better with more sugar and perhaps a little more cream,’ she asked, but Aunt Lucia only laughed sweetly.
‘Well, Sweet Dulcie,’ she began as if she had known Dulcie Moseley for years, ‘why don’t you tell me.  Isn’t it a Moseley who sent this recipe to you from Vassar, and didn’t she help to invent this sweet confection?’ Aunt Lucia had such a way with children always.  ‘Never ask a yes or no question,’ she had often told me. ‘Always engage a child.  If necessary be wrong so that they may be right.’ I remembered this as she winked at me over Dulcie’s golden head.
‘Well, no, Ma’am. My Aunt Mae did send this, but she isn’t a Moseley; she’s a Baker, on my mother’s side,’ and she and Mary burst into laughter as if her aunt’s being a Baker who sends fudge recipes was just about the funniest thing they’d ever heard.
‘Or she could be a Boiler or a Cook,’ Mary giggled.  I watched in some awe as the two girls exchanged looks of pure love, deep respect, and as my Aunt mitigated whatever memory might endanger this momentary union. 
Now she turned to me, expression earnest, voice so soft I practically had to read her lips to understand her words. ‘Mary is a pip and an angel, but there’s deep sorrow about her, and Dulcie really is a sweet girl, good and kind, but the anger that rages in her spirit is pure fire. You must handle this all very carefully, cautiously, and you mustn’t lose either your temper or your control.’
This was the way of the women in my family.  Always they’d presume that the younger women were ready for anything, too, that we could accomplish anything we set our minds to, that our minds over matters-at-hand would suffice.
“How did I get myself into this mess,” I said out loud, and Aunt Lucia raised finely sculpted eyebrows, as if to ask, ‘You mean you don’t know?’ and suddenly I was reminded of the walk through the cemetery, the prank gone too far, the Ouija board I’d promised my mother I’d never used.
‘How you came to be in the middle of this is no longer the issue. What matters is how you plan to get yourself out.’ And her insistence that I must disengage myself only after my promise to Mary was satisfied was implicit.  There really was no other way.  Now she only mouthed without even a hint of whisper, ‘Don’t bring home any hitchhikers,’ and I understood her warning.  There are people who live their lives under the shadows of dark, sad spirits, hitchhikers who will never find their paths home. To be under such shadow would be detriment not only to me but also to anyone who loved me.
“But what do I do?” I asked Aunt Lucia.  And perhaps some answer would have come if only I had been strong enough to hold this lively memory open longer.  Instead, I felt the collapse of these exhausted spirits in front of me, and in moments the vision in the kitchen they had never known had faded.  Only red and black trim against the swank white and stainless of the kitchen Seth’s mother had designed remained, or so I thought at first, but as I investigated more closely, I found the buttery print of a child’s right hand smudged where Dulcie had stood only moments before. Moving closer to it, I thought about tearing a paper towel from the roll that stood upright just beside the sink to press it down for some evidence of this impossible reality, when suddenly it combusted to tiny flames and the sizzle against the stainless island carried the salty tingle of tears.
The nature of my gift is such that I cannot press spirits to reveal themselves, and even if I could, I don’t believe I ever would.  Instinct dictates that as little engagement as possible is always the best mode, and it’s a rule by which I live my life whenever possible.  But I knew I’d have to take a more proactive stance to accomplish what we all—Mary, Dulcie, and I—needed, and for that I’d have to examine the house. 
I thought back to the night before, almost literally decades ago considering the journey along which these girls had brought me, and the things Seth had told me about the house.  I knew, for instance, that his father had discovered a secret compartment in the study, that old photos and tintypes had been stored in the tin handkerchief box found in the wardrobe that stood in his parents’ room, that the hall was part of an elaborate addition to join the kitchen to the rest of the house, and that the Ouija board was strictly taboo in the Jefferies household, just as it would have been in mine. I knew, too, that the kitchen was not built in 1870 when the house had been, and that the original kitchen must have stood just past the rock wall in the farthest portion of the back yard.  I did not, however, know where the Ouija board had come from originally, and now I wondered if it had been in the house when the Jefferies had moved in or if it had come into the house with them.
I’d have to go to the study to begin my investigation.  The notion sickened and worried me, but I gathered myself for the inevitable.  My mother had long taught me that the most direct way to gain protection from spirits that might harm you was to go to the Big Guy himself.  Some might laugh at this, but faith was and still is much more than a crutch for me, and anyone who believes in the fires of Hell must embrace the comforts of Heaven, too.  Opening the door to the study, I pushed it open so that the door knob bounced lightly against a chair just to the left of it.  Colder air pushed into the space right in front of me, and I shivered as if I were outside in a snowstorm.  Dulcie was here now, I knew, and she had been waiting for me.  

“Our Father who art in Heaven,” I began, voice bold and strong, “Hallowed be Thy name,” The chandelier above the Dr Jefferies broad mahoghany desk swayed slightly at first and then began to spin from the center, reminding me of the whirl-a-round at the park. “Thy Kingdom Come, Thy will be done—” 
And now Dulcie laughed with much more depth than a child might have, cold echo of the anger that was eating away her soul, interrupted to say, “I’m not the Devil, Julianne. I’m only a little girl, afterall.”
And I strengthened myself for the tantrum I felt welling in her, “On Earth as it is in Heaven.”
“Look at me, Julianne.” And it was all I could do to not make direct eye contact with her, but I did see that she was as pretty in what came close to flesh as she had been in the picture, innocent and sweet looking, and completely mesmerizing in her charming presentation. If I had not known what I did, if I could not recognize the hate that burned her from the inside out, I would have reached to hold her, stroked her golden ringlets, played dolls or drawn with her just as I would have my own little sister, but there was no denying the tenacious embers of her eyes, even as I avoided contact with them.
“Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us,” And now her laughter was maniacal, sad and laughing all at the same time.
“‘Forgive us our trespasses’,” she mocked, “and who is the trespasser here?” The question hovered between us and then seemed to take on an energy all its own as the accessories on Dr Jefferies desk and the loose items throughout the room rose and began to spin as if convection of Dulcie’s anger moved them.
“Lead us not into Temptation,” I continued, spirit emboldened with every word of the prayer I had known by heart ever since I had been a toddler, “but deliver us from Evil—“
And Dulcie’s angry laughter swelled to a cackle that rattled the house, but then it fell, too, as the little girl so consumed by anger became increasingly exhausted as I continued, “for Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, Forever and Ever. Amen.”
I knew the entities that had exploited Dulcie’s sorrow and loneliness were not dormant and would not give up so easily.  Stronger now, I added, “Dear Heavenly Father, Give me strength for the challenges I face, and cast all unkind, mischievous, or evil spirits from my presence.  Wrap me in your loving arms to protect and fortify me.  I ask these things in your name. Amen.”
And now the room became silent, its energy subdued, and the objects that had spun around me lowered then settled in relative proximity to where they had been to start.  I breathed deep solace and was happy to find new warmth about the room and to detect the spicy scent of candles burned perhaps days ago in the air.  For the time being, this was a study almost like any other.  Now I set my task to discovering its every secret free from interruption for awhile.

Spudz_OCD,6,,5,1rgcw5,,10,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

irinax0,6,,4,1rcop2,,10,"First part [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qzk7i/who_is_this_woman/)

So I approached her because what my grandmother told me just wasn't enough. 

She was in the park, on a bench with anther woman.

I said hi, and at first I started just saying random stuff like the commenting on the weather and such things, but then I decided to ask what I want to know. I asked her if I can talk to her about it, and the other woman excused herself.

I asked her a lot of questions, but basically all she told me was that if I really am not Magdalena, she can't tell me all those things.
Though she said if I am her, and she finds it out, then I'll be sorry for lying, because a deal's a deal and you just can't run from it. She said she'll know if I'm lying to her because she always knows. I
 was pretty scared so I tried explaining to her that I really, really, REALLY am NOT my great-grandmother, but she told me ""Don't bother"", and explained to me that if I AM Magdalena, she'll know. ""How will you know?"" ""I'll be.. seeing you around.. so I'll know easily."" Creepy, stalker-ish, creepy.

I asked HOW could I be Magdalena - it's been a LONG time. Even if she was alive she'd be OLD. But she just giggled and wouldn't explain. ""Can't tell you now. You'll probably find out one day. Actually, it may be very soon"".
I wouldn't stop asking and making remarks at how impossible it is, but she just said ""It happens. And she wouldn't be the only one, you know"".

And in the end, she said something like ""Let's say I believe you - but if you are lying... We're friends, but that doesn't mean you can just forget a deal. A deal is still a deal even if we're friends. And you're not being a friend right now."" 
I tried to say I'm NOT lying, I was like ""I'm not.."", but she cut me off , ""Just in case."", she said and then got up and  started just walking away, but she came back and said, almost laughing ""I was on the bench first, you're the one that should go now"". 
So  I got up and as I was leaving, after I said ""Bye"", she said ""Bye bye... IRINA."", with an eyebrow raised and a smirk. As in ""I know it's not Irina but whatever I'll say it for now."" Like if someone says ""He's just a friend"" and then you'd say ""Sure... FRIEND"". That kind of tone.

I'm not sure if I should be afraid.
I mean she didn't do anything to me and she doesn't seem to even want to anything to ME as me, as in really me, not Magdalena, but it's still creepy. Especially the ""I'll be seeing you around"" part. That's basically ""I'll be looking at you"". Kinda scares me.

dws7rf,3,,7,1r8d9t,,10,"I was reading posts today and was reminded of something that happened to me when I was a kid.  

It was an average summer day and I was somewhere in my mid to low teens (couldn't drive yet).  Since it was summertime school was out and like most kids I spent it with friends doing whatever seemed like a good idea at the time.  Usually we would go play in the woods or ride our bikes around.  

That day I decided to call up one of my friends and see if he wanted to hang out.  So I picked up the phone and to my astonishment the line was dead.  I didn't think much of it because I figured maybe they were working on the lines around my house or something.  His house wasn't very far from mine (only a mile or two) so I decided to just ride my bike over and see him.

When leaving my house the first thing that surprised me was that I didn't see any people or cars around.  It was summer in a residential neighborhood so there should have been kids out playing and people going about their daily lives.  Again it seemed like a coincidence.  As I was riding I remember thinking it was eerily quiet.  There was no wind that day which is odd enough in and of itself but the air seemed almost stagnant.

Being a kid it didn't seem like much of a problem and at the time it just seemed like a small thing.  What I remember most now is that not only were there no people going about their daily business but there was not a single sound from nature.  I could hear my bike tires on the road and the sound of the crank and my own breathing but there were no other sounds.  No birds, no dogs, no chirping or buzzing of insects.

I got to my friends house and knocked on the door. 

Nothing.  

I knocked again.  

Nothing.

That was just plain odd.  He had several other siblings and even though his parents worked, I remember thinking that there should have been at least one of them there.  At that point I decided that something was definitely off.  I rode my bike back to my house as quickly as I could and went up to my room and shut the door.  Several hours later my sister came home from work and I went down to talk to her.  She asked how my day was and I couldn't bring myself to tell her about the strange events of the afternoon because I figured that it must have all been a coincidence and I was reading too much into it.  I went outside and everything seemed normal.  Wind blowing, kids playing, dogs barking.  To this day I never figured out what was going on but it was like someone turned a switch and turned off everything but me and then flipped it back and everything was back to normal.  Never though much about it until I started reading /nosleep.  Maybe someone else has an idea of what went on.",The day with no sounds.,17,nosleep

Jonathon and Katie, both 22 years old, broke up two weeks ago. ""Boredom,"" as Katie would put it, is the reason for her diminishing interest in Jonathon.

Jonathon still loves Katie.  Jonathon misses Katie; he didn't want to break-up.  He still looks at her with the same eyes he had when they started dating at the age of sixteen. Jonathon is struggling with the break-up. He's depressed and has called in sick at work four days in the last two weeks. Today is one of his sick days.

He lies in his bed, it's 11:57am.  He stares at the ceiling, wondering what Katie is doing.  Wondering when, or if she will take him back.  He loves Katie, but he can't help but feel anger towards her too.  How could she do this to him?  After all they have been through together, she ends it... because she is bored?  There must be another reason.  

*She must be seeing someone else.*

Jonathon snaps out of his internal back-and-forth and sits up in his bed.  He sighs and turns his head to look in the mirror. 

*I haven't shaved in a week.  Katie doesn't like it when I neglect shaving.*  

He slowly steps out of bed, stands, and looks blankly at his bedroom wall.  His attention is captured the moment he receives a text-message.  Reluctantly thinking it could be Katie, he quickly grabs his phone.  

*It's Katie!*

""We need to talk.  1:30 this afternoon at McAlister's Coffee?  It's important.""

 *This might be my last real opportunity to convince Katie that the break-up was a bad idea. Not too eager though...* 

He slows his thumbs from tapping like an Irish river-dancer, and slyly replies, ""Sure. Sounds good.""  He looks in the mirror once again and smiles. His first genuine smile in two weeks.  

*Now to shave.*

Jonathon shaves, showers, puts on his most decent clothes and decides it would be a worthy gesture to stop by the supermarket for flowers before meeting Katie.  

*Katie always loved it when I bought her flowers.  This will remind her of the good times.*

It's 1:15pm and Jonathon is driving to McAlister's Coffee.  He is nervous and excited.  He hasn't seen Katie in nine days.  

He pulls up to the coffee shop five minutes early and decides to sit in his car until 1:32pm. 

*Not too eager.* 

At 1:29pm, Katie comes out of the coffee shop looking emotionally distraught.  She sits on a bench located in front of the coffee shop.  She notices Jonathon's car and perks up, wondering why he is just sitting.

*Shit.  Now she thinks I am being flaky.*

A whole three minutes too early, he reaches for his flowers and gets out of his car.  He smiles at Katie and makes his way across the parking lot.  Katie gets up from the bench and meets Jonathon halfway.  

""I don't really want coffee.""  Katie admits to Jonathon.

With his most charming smile he replies, ""Oh? Why are we here then?  What did what you need to tell me that is so important?"" 

""I... went on a date last night.""

Jonathon's charming smile slowly turned into a subtle frown. ""You did...?  With who?""

""That's... not important.""  Katie's eyes began to swell as she looked into Jonathon and hugged him.
""I made a mistake. My night made me realize what a fool I have been. How can you ever forgive me?"" 

Katie pulls away to look into Jonathon's eyes once more.  Jonathon wipes her tears away and with the truest smile says, ""Katie, I love you.  Of course I forg...""

The noise begins...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

...

...

...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**


Jonathon, Katie and everyone around them grimace, grab their ears for cover and look to the sky.


**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

...

...

...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

Cars in the street stop dead in place and their operators look out of their windows, wondering where the sound is coming from.

Katie looks at Jonathon with a fear he has never seen in her. ""Jon! What is that!?""

Jon's knees give out.  As he falls to the parking lot, the loud ambient chatter goes silent. The only noise he hears is the sound of the rustling wind and the brushing of leaves on the ground.  He tries to stand up but he can't.  He tries to comfort Katie from the ground, but he can't make a sound.  Katie is standing completely still in place, as though a mannequin.

*What the fuck is going on? KATIE! KATIE! CAN YOU HEAR ME?*

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

...

...

...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

Jonathon, locked in an upward looking position, sees it.

He sees where the noise is coming from.

He notices a wet stain overwhelm the outside of Katie's jeans.  

*She must see it too.*

Everyone around him is paralyzed, but he feels their fear. He feels their need to run, but they can't.

He realizes these are his final moments, he tries one last time to speak.  Though only thoughts are allowed.

*I love you Katie... I love you.*

He sees the first person launch violently into the air, then the second, the third.  It's his turn.  He's jerked in the air in the direction of the anomaly.  The last thing he sees is Katie.  She is the last thing he wants to see.

bebadhavefun,2,,4,1r3ema,,11,"Hey guys, well, I'm a new user but I've been reading NoSleep for about a year now, though I never felt like sharing my ""supernatural"" experiences until now. In time, I'll post more, but I feel the need to start with something that brings tears to my eyes to this day.

It was mid-2011 and I was on my winter break, my mother was working her night shift and I was alone in the house with my little brother (who was 7 years old at the time). 

At around 1 AM, I started to feel sleepy so I turned off the computer and headed to the bathroom to grab some toilet paper in case my flu got worse during the night. 

As soon as I get to the bathroom I notice two things: The first, outside it was raining incredibly hard and the second, the dog had followed me to the bathroom and was whining softly while he waited for me to come out. Being a recently adopted dog (We've had him for a week or so back then) I didn't think much of it, ""Maybe he's afraid of the rain"" I thought as I headed out and closed the door.

That was when I saw it. A couple of meters to my left, through the half open door that leads to the garden, something that made me question my sanity. 

It was a...creature, I guess. Taller than the door frame, covered in thick light brown hair that walked in two feet. I saw it for a split second before it hid behind the wall. I thought I was hallucinating -even though I've never been skeptical- so my first impulse was to open the door to see what the hell was that. It was the moment my dog got in the way between me and the door, shaking, whining and showing his teeth at me to keep me away. As I said, we hadn't had Morrison for too long and I didn't want to get bitten, so I backed off to the kitchen trying to wrap my head around what was going on. 

Suddenly, the sound of scratching on the walls made me jump. It seemed to come from everywhere and Morrison started barking at this. I made him shut up and, in desperation, I grabbed the biggest knife I found in a drawer and stayed there in the middle of the kitchen, shaking because of the cold and the situation I was.

The scratching faded in the rain and for a moment, I thought everything was alright. That until the door swung open and slammed back shut, making me jump and run to get the hell out of there and lock myself in my brother's room with the dog, still holding the knife tightly. 

I remember hearing soft ""bangs"" on the door outside that started to get louder and louder each time and I just covered my ears, praying to anyone who could hear me for it to stop. But it didn't.

When it became too much for me, I gained enough courage to go outside and put a couple of chairs against the door just in case. When I came back inside leaving every light in the house on, a few minutes passed by before I heard a loud bang outside the room. I knew that, whatever it was, was trying to get inside, so I opened the bedroom door and looked down the hallway: The chairs I had put against the door were knocked down and the door was wide open. I could only shake my head in disbelief as I came back to sit on the edge of my brother's bed holding the knife -that seemed to be useless by then-.

I don't know at which point I fell asleep, but my mother woke me up at around 8 in the morning and asked why wasn't I in my room and what was all the mess with the chairs in the hallway. I told her, she didn't believe me and I'm pretty sure I'll never know what the hell was that thing.

PS: Sorry about any mistakes on the writing of this story, english is not my first language. 
",I'll never know.,15,nosleep
IntricateVenom,9,,5,1r2dyl,,11,"I've known that I have had this ability since I was six. Actually it all started when I was six.

I can see spirits. I see them sometimes like normal people, but they have a sort of ""glimmer"" to them. In all of my encounters I have never been to speak to one, but they don't need to; their expressions tell me all I need to know.

As I said, this all started at the age of six. My mother and I moved into an old house that was built in the 1910's. There was another house next to it that was a complete mirror image of the one I lived in. The history was that the houses were built by two twins. One twin was a good man, while the other had a sadistic side. He was a murderer and he alone had killed around 6 people in his house (which was the one I lived next to). To this day, around 20 people have been murdered in that house.

Anyway one night I was in my room staring at the ceiling (I have insomnia so it's quite hard for me to sleep) when suddenly, I got this immense feeling of anger and fury. However, the feeling wasn't coming from my house, or even from myself, but the house next door. I got out of bed and looked out the window and I will never forget what I saw.

Staring out of the window across from me was a man who had to be in his late 40's. His face was contorted into a meanful scowl. He was wearing old tattered clothes. He was staring right at me; right into my very soul. Then, almost instantly, he vanished. I started to cry really loud and eventually my mom came running in. I told her what had happened but she didn't really believe me.

Fast forward to 16. I've been seeing spirits all the time but only when I'm ""tuned in"". This is the best way I can describe it. Its almost like tuning a radio to the right channel. I've found that once I ""tune in"" I can see spirits in all kinds of forms and shapes. However, one night when I was 16, I found that i can see more than spirits.

When I was 16 my friend and I were big into the paranormal and we liked to go to graveyards and such to see what we can find. On this day we decided to go to one of the most haunted graveyards in our state - Dice Roads Cemetary. There have been lots of people encountering things there so we decided to go. 

Apon arriving there, I become overwelmed with a sense of dread, sorrow, anger, sadness and everything inbetween. Besides that it looked pretty normal. We did some walking, some voice recording, normal shit, and finally we were standing outside the car talking when it happened. It was around 3 in the morning when I saw a shadow move. I clicked on the flashlight and moved it over to that spot, yet nothing was there. I decided at this point to tune in and see what I could find. When I was certain I was tuned in, I opened my eyes and immediately wished I hadn't. 

In the graveyard floating were a pair of blood red eyes and they were staring right at me. They were full of hatred, scorn, and just pure evil. Time seemed to have stopped and I just kept staring at those eyes. I couldn't look away. Then, all of a sudden, they rushed forward with lighning speed, out of the graveyard, and directly through me. What happened next is a bit fuzzy. I remember feeling all sorts of emotions and having many intricate thoughts. Then everything goes black. The next thing I know, I awake to find my friend knelt down next to me shaking me. He said that I had uttered one word before i fell. 

Destroy.

The entire ride back i was physically sick to the stomach and had a massive headache.I've never gone back to that place and never will. I'm 17 now, and Ive gotten a lot better at controlling what I see. 

These are only two of the many stories I have to share, but I felt these were thew most important. I just wish that I could forget some of the things I've seen. I also hope others are like me and see where I'm coming from. I'm going to keep working on it, and use this ability to possibly help othersw in the future. ",My Ability,16,nosleep

I have decided as a birthday gift to myself I am going to commit suicide. Not real suicide. I have made a Facebook account and added all my old friends. I am going to fein death so people will care about me again. Then I am going to change my name, move country and start over. This won't be easy but the pain will be over soon. Just a few more days.

Hi everyone.

First off, I owe everyone who read and commented my story my deepest gratitude.  I still haven't been able to tell anyone about last weekend's events in person.  Lately its easier to look others in the eye, and I even enjoyed a buritto the other day, but I still can't bring myself to actually *say* what happened.

Yesterday, after reading everyone's comments I made my decision. u/GeneralJiblet, u/BraveGoldHeart, and u/Explodingtaoster01 really got me thinking (and all of those who contributed helped; just knowing I'm not alone was a relief), and most importantly I realized that I'm not powerless in this.  What I do will be *my* choice; on my terms.

I'm not sure how to explain it, but the moment my mind was made up a deep, zen-like calm came over me.  Almost instantly after the thought crossed my mind it felt like a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders; I have you all to thank for that.   

__________________________________________________________________________________

I do, however, need more support from you guys.  Like I've iterated before, I just can't talk about this to my friends or family.  I had some episodes and struggled with depression (doesn't everyone at some point?) a few years back, and I just worry they might think I've finally snapped if I start talking about “aliens” and stuff.

Anyways, I need your input.  I'm sure there's rational explanations for this stuff...so if you guys feel the need to talk some sense into me; *please* do.

Like I said, its like a weight's been lifted from my shoulders. That night; last night was the first time I've slept since the weekend. Today-and this is what has me *unsettled*- my tattoos are...almost disappearing. They've faded a ton, literally overnight. 

These aren't that old, and even the newest ones are just...washing away? They're silly but substantial tats from back in college when I was in the Coast Guard Reserves...and I swear I hadn't noticed a change just a few days ago. The blacks, blues, reds...they're all fading.

I've also had almost a dozen nose bleeds. I know its November; its getting colder out and the air is dry...its just that this many has me...*worried*. I almost fee like I *should* be more concerned, but I'm unable to focus any any train of thought for more than a few moments.  I'm sure its because of how little sleep I had been getting.

Even now, just typing this has me feeling light headed. I'll probably lay down, the glare from the computer screen is hurting my eyes and putting a slight red tint to my vision.  

Thanks again guys.  You have no idea how *truly* comforting it is knowing I'm not alone.

SprightlyMonkey,2,,7,1r98ph,,10,"Most people, no matter what their age, can't really remember many things before the age of 4, barely anyone can remember most of their life before the age of 10. I know that my earliest living memory was when I was 3, when my younger brother was born. It's odd that, after it all, of all the things I could've remembered, it's that which is stuck in my mind. When, after it all, I was left with but a notepad with three notes. A URL, an address, and some jottings. And thus, I take it upon myself to inform you of all that I've learned in these past few hours.

I don't really know who I am any more. I'm a tall, gangly male with long black hair, and the only name I have to go on is the pseudonym I'm using to convey this message. I know that, once, I was interested in psychology and philosophy. These things mixed together to form a fondness for one thing in particular. I slowly became obsessed with working out how memories worked, why we had them and how they formed. Of course, you have the scientific answers, but thinking back, they don't really provide you with much explanation. Very, very few people, if any, can remember their birth, perhaps the single most important events of your entire life, and barely anyone can remember it. Don't you think it odd, that whilst we remember inconsequential things like our first tooth falling out, or how you grazed your knee when falling off your bike, you can't remember being born? People will put it down to a theory called ""Childhood Amnesia"", where adults find it difficult to recall early memories, as children haven't got fully developed limbic systems. But how come there are exceptions to this rule?

Of course, the answer is I don't know. Or, more, rather (as horribly ironic as it is), I forgot. I know that I did research this, I did a load of it. In as much detail as I could. It was a personal project of mine, one I know I'd been working on for a long time. Again, God knows how long, I forgot that too. It all feels like an eternity ago now, considering I've forgotten it all. I suppose that it's my own fault, considering I brought myself into this, I went perusing into areas one should've left untouched, as far as this transcript can tell me. And that has landed me deeper in whatever mire I find myself in than I can assume most others ever have. And that scares me. Not because I fear for my life, definitely not. I am literally nothing now, with nothing to my name but this notebook and what I am writing here. 

I suppose you want to know what the jottings are. Well, they're in two parts. The first parts are like stage directions, with little annotations in handwriting I can only assume is my own, describing the setting (presumably so I can find my way back there). The second part, is a statement. A saying, or a speech or something. So without further ado, I shall do my best to relay this script.

I am sat at a bench at my local green. It's a cold, dark winters evening, with heavy air hanging over me. Across from me, stands a man, who is much better equipped for the cold than I. He's wearing a large overcoat, with the collar rolled up around his cheeks, and a small hat stuck atop his presumably bald head. He looks about 40, the only reason I can tell being the soft amber hue from his cigarette, betraying his wrinkles, lined with a rushed stubble, with awkward tufts slightly bushier than the rest. The wisps keep rising up and obscuring my view of his glassy eyes. If I didn't know any better, I would've said he had been crying, but that's silly. He stands a good inch or so higher than me, and makes an effort not to slouch. Whenever he speaks to me, he addresses me very carefully and politely, referring to me as ""Sir"" or ""Mister"" and making sure to annunciate every syllable as if a single mistake would betray him. This makes his speech slow, but not staggered, he has no difficulty in speaking properly, but he is deliberately taking care. He isn't particularly stocky, but nor is he lanky. He's a perfect medium. He's addressing me, gesturing for me to approach him. He's ushering me on now, waving his hand as if to say for me to fall in behind him. I do so. He's leading me to a flat. (the address is written here, but for your protection I shan't be putting it in until I can confirm it's safety). It's very well kept. 5 rooms. All doors are shut.
He's gone into the room straight ahead of the sofa I'm sat on, shutting the door behind him. I'm not sure how, but I don't think he noticed this.

This next part, is not in the same handwriting as above. It's very intricate, certainly whoever wrote it took their time. There are, however, mistakes. Very obvious mistakes, but I cannot figure out what they're for. I think that that may be why I am writing to you now, to see if you can assist me.

Dearest Curious Inquirer, 
It is my solEmn duty to regretfully inform you that you have gone far enough in your scour for the true workings of the human mind. It is a sincere wasTe of a life, lived too litTle, for me to have to extingUish, but you leave me with no other option. You simply have discovered toO much. The real worry that I have, is that I may have intervened far too late. However, there is no use in dwelling upon these mistakes. They are mine, and mine alone. I was charged with the protection of your Blood, and that is a duty which I can onLy suffer for so long. Our exIstence is insufferable at times, I can only imagine how yours must be, liVing without such core memories, so many thIngs that you must hold so dearly important. Of courSe, you meaning you alone. Everyone else is too ignorant to go out and look for that which has been taken from them. They're Content with the answers they're provided with, acting as if there isn't exemption to the so-called rules. One shoe, it would appear, does not fIt all. I truly wish I could reward your innovation, I honestly do. In as many years, I have desired a chase such as this. Something I can truly be proud of. 
If you remember one thing, which is highly unlikely, I want it to be that your childhood is something you have to keep. Once it's lost, it's lost.
The infinite possibilities of a child's mind, is often labelled as immature, but tell me, can an adult construct a story from but a pen, paper and some squiggles? Do we consider men like Picasso to be immature, and simple-minded? How can something so infinite, and yet so delicate, be incomplete? You mislabel it as immaturity, when in fact childlike wonder is a blessing. A blessing, lost to age, because it no longer ""suits"" you. It doesn't ""fit"" the world you're entering. That is why you are stripped of it. We act, simply as you ask.

You brought, your lack of memory upon yourself. Persist in finding it at your own peril,
Your Saviour.

JustAnotherLondoner,1,,9,1r8zg3,,10,"Last year, my brother Liam fell ill and took himself to hospital. He wasn't insanely ill, but due to the fact that he kept fainting and falling into things, he felt the hospital was the safest place for himself to be. After an examination, he was told that an ear infection was causing his balance to be off and him to faint. They kept him in for observation until he stopped fainting and would be safe at home alone. 

He told me that the first night he couldn't sleep. The man in the bed next to him would groan throughout the night in agony. He didn't know what was wrong with him, but it was too late for a nice chat, so he remained silent. 

The second night wasn't much different, but Liam managed to sleep for a few hours, from about 3am until around 10am. He hadn't faint for a while and felt he was getting a lot better, hoping that he would be able to go home soon.

Later that day, the man in the bed next to him awoke. 

""Hi, I'm Jim."" He introduced himself. ""What are you in for?"". My brother explained his ear infection and that he had fainted and fallen into things, and asked why Jim was here.

""Well..."" He began. ""I don't really know. I was only in here for a broken leg initially. Then I fell ill. I think they're keeping me here.""

""What? How?"" Liam asked. 

""When I was close to recovery, I told the nurses that I felt ready to go home. Later that night, I woke up to see a nurse leaving my bed. She didn't see me, but I noticed that my leg felt funny. I think she did something to it. I don't know what... but the next day I fell terribly ill with pneumonia. This was nearly a week ago, and i'm still here, not getting much better. Don't tell them when you're ready to go home... just go."" His face was dead serious. 

Liam was a bit worried about Jim's story, but assumed he was a bit crazy and paranoid about the nurses. He ignored Jim's advice and told the nurse that he was ready to go home. He felt the disappointed gaze of Jim fall upon him as the nurse walked away.

""Well... Good luck."" Jim sighed. ""I hope they let you out."" 

""Thanks."" Liam replied. The nurse later returned and confirmed that the doctor would look at his ears the following day. 

That night, Liam had another restless night. Jim was groaning again, but Liam was beginning to grow used to that. 

Suddenly the groaning stopped. The silence of the night was instead met with the screams of Jim.

""AARGHH. STOP. GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME. DONT YOU DARE PUT THAT NEEDLE NEAR ME. FUCK OFF!"" the curtain was closed around him. Liam couldn't see what was going on. He was too scared to speak. 

The curtain swiped open. Liam pretended to be asleep, his eyes slightly open. He saw a nurse leave Jim's bed. Jim was laying in his bed, holding his legs. 

""A..Are you okay?"" Liam whispered. ""What the fuck just happened?"" 

""I told you, man. The nurses are keeping me here. They saw that I was getting better again and she just stuck a fucking needle in my leg again. I'm not getting out of here any time soon."" Jim replied. He revealed his leg to Liam - there was a small hole with blood dripping out of it. He had indeed been injected with something. 

Liam laid down in shock. Jim decided that now the attack was over, it was safe to sleep. 

When Liam awoke the following morning, Jim was gone. Liam asked a nurse where Jim was, and the nurse apologetically replied 

""Mr Morris passed away late last night"". How could that be? He was well enough to hold a conversation with Liam just hours earlier to his apparent death. The injection. It must have been the injection. 

I visited Liam later that day and he told me of the events. He begged me to sign him out and get him home that day. He was desperate. He was not in safe hands there, after all. I tried to sign him out, but the doctor assured me that it was in the best interest to stay one more night to ensure the infection had completely cleared. I reluctantly agreed. 

I visited again the next day and Liam was in a terrible state. He was pale, his face was sweaty. He even had a temperature... he was in a much worse state to what I had seen him like the day before. The doctor told me it was just a side affect of the medicine they had given him. Liam told me otherwise. 

""They attacked me, Kate. That's the only way i can describe it... I was pretending to sleep late last night and a nurse came in. She rolled me over, and prepared my leg for an injection. You know what they do, they wipe it with some sort of liquid. I startled her when I asked her what she was doing. She told me it was 'just procedure'. I asked her to stop and said that i'd rather not have the treatment. She got aggressive. Called another nurse. One held me down while she injected me. I screamed but nobody came. Now all of a sudden I'm ill. I'm not getting out of here, Kate. I'm going to die in this bed. Just like Jim."" He began rocking back and forth as I tried to comfort him. He was soaked with sweat. 

I asked his doctor what was wrong with him, and the doctor told me it was pneumonia. My heart sunk. It was just like Jim. Liam was right - he wasn't safe here. I needed to get him out. 

""I'll be back tomorrow to get you out of here"" I told Liam. ""They won't let me today... and now that they have a clue that I want to get you out, they're all watching me. I was almost escorted out when I shouted at the doctor. Tomorrow I can do it quietly, when i'm not being watched so closely."" Liam agreed. 

The following day I returned to the hospital. Liam told me the nurse had not returned that night. I put him in a wheelchair and took him to the toilets. I gave him some clothes that I had collected from his apartment and he changed. I asked a nurse to bring me any belongings he had left with the desk, stating that he had asked me to take them home for him. The nurse agreed and brought me his things without a word. We escaped and I took him home. Before leaving, we slyly stole the 'sign out' clip board, and Liam was able to sign it. He was legally free. 

Three days later Liam was found dead in his apartment. The pneumonia had gotten worse and, without treatment, took his life. He left a note. It read: 

""I was taken into the hospital with an ear infection. I left without said ear infection, but with bigger problems. I was abused. I have made a realization; either the secret injections being given are procedures to keep population down, or, they are ways to make medicine companies money. After all, they make money through our illness - they don't really want us to recover. I would not advise anyone who is not dying to stay in a hospital - definitely not alone. There, you will never truly be in safe hands.""

AfterYourHeart,0,,11,1r7cv5,,7,"This is an update from: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r1po8/dead_ends/)

Ok! I have a little bit of time. I’m not sure when they’ll be back so I have to be careful.

That day, the day Pugsley died, Joe and I talked about it after Sophia had gone to bed. He swore he didn’t leave the window open. He always had an encyclopedic memory, remembering the tiniest little things about just about everything, so I believed him. I know I didn’t open the window. I also know that when I left to pick up Sophia, I had to un-deadbolt the front door. Joe quickly went down to check the back door. Also locked. We decided to just drop it and we went to sleep. If I remember correctly, I didn’t sleep well that night.

I wish Joe would come visit me. They said I could have visitors occasionally if I was well behaved. It sure does get lonely in here. I mean, there are others, but man do they have issues! I’d rather just keep to myself. At least I have my art. They even let me try to sell it, well rather, they let an art gallery try to sell them, and occasionally someone buys one. I plan on putting these letters in the back of one whenever this is finished. Hey! Maybe that’s how you’re reading this. If so, thank you for buying my art. I hope you enjoy it.

I remember the day I painted my daughter’s eighth birthday portrait. I had never tried such a thing before, but she was so beautiful that I had to at least try. Her hair was blonde and getting quite long. She liked to straighten it. She had the look that screamed head cheerleader, queen bee, but I always hoped she grow up to be a scientist, or an engineer. She was so smart. With her smile, she could get away with murder. She was missing a few teeth at the time, and a few more were still growing back. That just made her even cuter. Looking at her was like looking into the heart of your childhood. She always made me feel young. I loved going on adventures with her.

The day I painted her, I needed her to sit still for a while, and I wanted to try and make it fun for her. I wanted to paint her smiling, not bored out of her mind. The first step was music. She loved music and she loved to sing. She was pretty good at it too. Then I came up with a great idea. I got her her own easel, canvas, and paints, and figured we could paint together. I’d help her figure out what she wanted to paint and get her started, and then I’dl paint her.

Just thinking about that day helps me almost remember what it’s like to be happy. We had so much fun. We listened to music, sang and danced a bit, painted (she decided to paint me back), and talked about just about everything. She told me all about her new school and the friends she was making. She was such a people person. People were drawn to her and always wanted to be around her. Looking at her, it astounded me how quickly she was growing. When did she get so tall?

At the end of the day we did our reveal. I showed her my painting and she showed me hers. I have to admit, I was pretty impressed by hers. Looks like “artist” could be added to the list of things she could be when she grew up. We decided we’d hang them together in the hallway once they had dried. I wasn’t quite ready for the day to be over, so after we cleaned up, I took her out to eat.

Joe got home after Sophia’s bedtime. I proudly took him to the spare room to show off our paintings. I turned on the light and Joe laughed. I screamed. I explained to Joe that I didn’t do this. That when Sophia and I had gone to dinner, it was just a normal portrait. That someone else must’ve come in and painted over the original painting, altering it. He stood silently, staring at me for a moment. Like he was trying to figure out if this was some kind of weird prank. He then kissed me on the forehead, told me we would figure this out later, and went to watch a movie. After he walked away I turned back to look at the painting.

Whoever had done it had blackened out her eyes. They had also paled her skin, and given her deep circles under her eyes. It reminded me of a picture I had seen when I looked up black-eyed kids. I made the mistake of looking it up at work, and the picture had stunned me so badly, that I immediately drew all the blinds and curtains in the place and covered all the windows. I am usually not that much of a chicken, but for some reason that picture had a serious effect on me, and now there I was staring at my daughter, turned into a black-eyed kid. 

I quickly destroyed the painting. I never showed it to Sophia. She had been so excited to see a painting of herself. The next few days were her scheduled days to stay at her dad’s, so I decided to try to repaint it. The duplicate was pretty good. Not quite as good as the original, but it was pretty close.

The next morning, I went to check on the duplicate and it had been ripped to shreds. I showed Joe, but he shook it off. This time he was convinced that it was some kind of joke. He swore he wasn’t falling for it. Then he went off to work. I sat and cried for a while, burned the painting, and tried one last time. This time I hid the painting, and this time the painting stayed safe.

Ok. It’s almost meds time. I better hide this again. I hate the meds they give me. They make me feel so weird. I don’t even know what day it is anymore.

NightOfTheLlamas,4,,8,1r6rmn,,11,"There are few things that drive me mad. I don’t even understand why they get me so worked up in the first place. I’m not OCD or anything of the sort. It’s just that I can’t stand things such as the sliding door when it is open. It should be closed at all times. The door is just a small problem compared to my shower. It drips. 

At first I could turn the shower handle and the dripping would come to an end. It was inconvenient at times because I would stop whatever I was doing to shut up the *drip, drip, drip.* Sometimes my food would burn slightly or I would miss a phone call cause I was busy pushing around the handle to end the sound. I really don’t mind though because it ended that cursed dripping and that’s all that really matters to me. 

It got worse. When I turned the handle to end the sounds it would start up again randomly later. I would be watching Netflix or reading a good book when I hear *drip, drip, drip.* It doesn’t ever end. All through the day the shower leaks water out in a steady rhythmic beat. It drives me crazy. 

After a week or so I couldn’t handle the sounds anymore. I couldn’t handle the *drip, drip, drip.* I bought a new shower head thinking that would solve the problem. After setting it up I blew out a breath of relief. The dripping would finally end now. I ate dinner that night happy. I closed the open sliding door before settling myself on the couch with my laptop. I was on Netflix and about half way through my show I heard something. *Drip, drip, drip.* Covering my ears with my hands didn’t stop the sounds from making their way to my brain. I could still hear it. 

I tried everything I could think of. I called the plumber but that did nothing. I wrapped a rag around the shower head. That worked until the rag started to drip from all of it’s water build up. I also took the rag and placed it at the bottom of the shower hoping that it would mute the dripping sounds. This worked yet it didn’t. I could no longer hear the dripping but I could *feel* the drops of water slamming against the rag. 

In the end I just spent as little time in my own home as I could. There was no way to be bothered by the shower if I wasn’t even inside of the house. This worked until I had to go home and try to sleep. Which ended up with me not getting a wink of sleep. I would stare up at the ceiling with my eyes unblinking just listening to the shower leak. I would pray in my head that this torture would end somehow.  

I stopped sleeping in my home. I hated going to that place. Whenever my feet hit the floorboards of that house it was as if at that moment the shower started to leak again. I slept at a friend’s house. She never asked questions as to why I wished to stay with her. That was something I was dearly grateful for.

It has been a few weeks since I started to live here. I haven’t felt this much peace in a while. I was heading to the kitchen for a glass of water. It was almost midnight and the sky was pitch black. As I walk down the halls towards the kitchen I freeze. To my left was the bathroom door. Through the wood I could hear a soft *drip, drip, drip.* ","Drip, Drip, Drip",19,nosleep

It most likely already killed her. Please listen to me Torsen. Please. I don't want to sound cold. I truly don't but if I thought that in any way she could still be alive in there I would go instead of you. I would tell you how to go back. But I will not do that. I will not allo any more people to die because of me. Please believe me Kyle. Please.

fennelliott,0,,6,1r1j2w,,8,"I think the scariest number in the world is 1. Singular and individual in it's stance, only separated by 9 decimal points to 0. It's the foundation of other gathered numbers to be made stronger by the additive of another. However, if the unit remains alone it can be a reflection of myself. There are others number out there, but what are they but to be counted, added, subtracted, and divided. In a way, there's solace in being singular, but safety is not reassured.

I can count the number of steps it take me to cross the hallway into my bedroom by the measure of 12 units to create what is called a foot. 15 1/2 feet takes me from end to the other, each print of my callous sole leaving behind an echo of flesh sticking to hardwood floor. Each step is lonelier than the next.

There are portraits to the side of me of my family, filtered out by a camera lens portrayal of vintage black and white with an average border frame 9 x 12 inches protected by glass and wood. The reflection of my bedroom light shines to the side of it, 11 feet more until I reach the shimmering source. However the darkness of the picture reflects something else, more darkness than light, 6 feet behind me.

I cross a doorway that leads into an open room. Two bunk beds found belonging to my sisters, and a faded moon glow behind the blue curtains whipping gently upwards toward me by the open air flowing in. Someone forgot to close their window, and I think to step into their bedroom to close it, but then that would wake them. Also, it would subtract my distance to my bedroom, and I would be closer to the darkness lurking 5 feet now behind me. It reflects my light as well, an edge sharper than the glass that holds the photo of my loved ones intact. More intact than the pieces of my sisters hidden beneath their blankets, soaking a dark color that a small stream of moonlight shows.

I step closer now to my room, the T.V. hissing at me in white noise. I had only gotten drink of water after checking upon the noise that came down stairs. A crashing sound, not like glass but like a muffled collapse on the hardwood floor embedded all around. I would have went to check on my dad to see if he heard it too, but he's with mom in the other bedroom across from me. I know, having seen his shadow creep into bed with her, and the rustle they made to wrap around one another. My mom gave in, and I had passed by before they would noticed or I would have seen too much. She lays quiet now, drooped across her bed in slashes of romantic red, her favorite color.

Feet creak closer behind me in another gained step.

My room is in it's warm glow with the study light turned on, the T.V. static buzzing, and my phone vibrating in the pocket of my pajamas. I stop to look at the text just before my door. I stand as a silhouette with a face lit by the small framed screen fitted in the palms of my hands. I notice the text before I notice the added step, and quickly I read, ""Closet Keeper, Family Seeker. 1 by 1, piece my piece, the family fits in the closet.""

the text is disturbing, even as I step into the comfort of glow, reaching to close the door but instead find myself grabbing the hand of another. Lifeless it feels, sheltered by a thick fabric in tight grip to the something that extends into my back. I don't notice it until the withdrawal of what I thought was only a cold chill running against my spine. More and more I feel the same chill run up and down my body with gathered droplets spraying across or falling down around me and in my uncontrollable fall, I spread out flat 6 feet even. Straight and presented in that same red as my mother. That same sound as my fathers muffle down stairs. and slowly chopped piece by piece like my sibling.

Together we are gathered in the closet, one by one. However we do not form anything greater beyond the mess we contribute to my bedroom floor. Though I was not the first, I am number 1. Alone together, and singled out amongst the living as a dead soul. I am afraid of 1, for even in number there is still me and you. We are individual, and only more bodies prove that we are just that. Alone in fight, and alone in death.

BOATSSnHOESSS,2,,1,1rdzvd,,10,"So when I was 15 my love was having a bonfire on Saturday nights. Although one thing did change that.
I live in way out in the country part of town so having a fire was usual, hearing coyotes were usual, and that sort of thing. So this night me and my friends decided we were going to stay out in a tent tonight, so me and my friend allen went in my house to get blankets and food. This is when I knew something was wrong, a sudden sense of dread came over me as we returned outside to my friend Ryan and Cory running towards us screaming bloody murder. Cory explained what he had heard, he said something made a noise sounding almost like a panther. I went back to the fire leading the pack when i turn on the spotlight (i luckily grabbed just in case) and began sweeping across the woodline, thats when i spotted it. It was a grotesque pure white creature with hollow black eyes staring at us. I was petrified out of fear. My friends ran away back into my house. I stayed. I couldn't move an inch. Then it began crawling at me on all fours, but there was something wrong with it. Its arms were almost backwards on its arms. Then it screached at me. Ill never forget that horrible sounding scream. It made me think of death. That's when I decided I needed to get the hell out of there. I began running back to my house, unaware of where the creature is I looked back to see it crawling right behind me. Thats when i saw its face and claws. Its mouth was filled with jagged sharp teeth and the claws were not animal like, almost like someone carved bone into a razor sharp knife. I gained speed and jumped over the fence at full speed causing me to fall. I got up and screamed and starting waving my arms as if the creature were a bear then I realized it was gone. I walked back home and told my parents. They didn't believe me though.
But to this day 4 years later I have no clue what this creature was or wanted.",Louisiana Demon,11,nosleep
kenandmforever,1,,2,1rc5s5,,9,"Hey, guys. Long-time lurker, first time poster…I guess I finally have something to post about. Everything’s just been wrong the past few weeks. I miss her so much. I know this isn’t a therapy subreddit or anything, but I was just thinking…maybe if I can get these thoughts out, they’ll stop bothering me. It’s just, I should have been paying attention, you know? I should have seen something was wrong. But I didn’t, and now she’s gone, and it’s all my fault.

I guess I should start at the beginning. She was my first serious girlfriend – I’ll call her M, to protect her privacy. Last thing I would want is her family finding out I’m talking about this on some site for thousands to see. Anyway, M and I worked together at a tutoring place on campus. It was my first job, and I was nervous, but she helped me figure everything out. M was really shy – she could almost never meet my eye, and her voice was super-quiet – but really sweet, once I coaxed her into talking. I got the impression she didn’t think too highly of herself; whenever I tried talking to her about her major or anything, she’d change the subject. All I really got was that she was a Bio major, and she was working on some research project about some new “cestoda,” whatever that meant. But she liked hearing about me and my major – English, I’ve never been science-inclined – and laughed at my jokes and everything, so we had a good time.

After our shifts were over, we’d go to the Subways down the street sometimes; I would always offer to get her something, but she always turned me down. She would just watch me eat while we sat together. It always made me feel kinda bad, especially since she was so small; it was like eating in front of an African kid, or something. But she never seemed to mind, so I got over it. We became good friends.

Eventually I asked her out for dinner and a movie. I can’t even remember what we saw – some remake horror flick about mind-controlling carnivorous worms, or something? – but we had a good time. We were laughing through the whole thing, and she kept pointing out the impossibilities and throwing all her science knowledge around. I don’t want to sound weird, but I found it pretty hot.

But by the time we got back to the car, she had stopped smiling. She said she didn’t feel too good, like she was sick or something. She said she wanted to walk back to her apartment – she lived just off campus, and was really big into fitness and everything – but it was like twenty minutes away and in the middle of the night, so I drove her home. She got out, said goodnight, and that was it. No kiss, nothing.

I went home thinking I had blown it, but when we had the same shift again, she was really happy. Kept saying she’d had a great time, and everything. So we went out on a few more dates. I let her pick what we did – she never wanted to go out to eat, but she did teach me how to ice skate, and we went on a few hikes, even some 5k runs. Those were the worst, but it was worth it to see the way she lit up. 

At the end of each one, I kept wanting to kiss her, but she was really sheepish about it. Every time I went in for one, she’d turn her head, or peck me on the cheek before I could. She was always embarrassed about it and apologized, but I figured she just wasn’t ready; she didn’t seem the type to have done a lot of dating herself. That was fine, I wasn’t going to rush her into anything.

The first time we kissed was like three weeks after we started dating – and I won’t say anything but wow. At this point, I realized I was completely head over heels for this girl. She was smart, she was funny, and she liked me, which was different from most girls. We started “going steady” after that – and that’s when everything started changing. The signs that something was wrong had been present before, but they really should have become apparent afterwards. God, I’m so stupid.

She started wearing big, baggy clothes to work – huge stifling sweaters, that sort of thing. I wondered if one of the guys at work was hitting on her or something and making her uncomfortable, but they were all either huge or really friendly, and I didn’t want to ask. She would shake sometimes, too, like she was cold, even when she was being swallowed up by these enormous shirts. I’d hug her and she’d lean into me, but it was like I couldn’t even feel her underneath the clothes. 

She started eating a lot. Like, I mean, a ton. When we went to Subway now, she’d put away two footlongs like it was nothing. I took her out to a few ritzy places, but the portions were always too small, so we would end up getting burgers or something afterwards. I didn’t really mind – it was nice to see that she felt comfortable enough to stuff herself around me, I guess. We were kissing a lot more, too, which was of course awesome. Because of her, I was into hiking and stuff now, so I felt great. Everything seemed perfect. Maybe that’s why I wasn’t noticing the signs.

I stayed over at her place a few times, as things got more serious, but we never went too far. She was still embarrassed about that sort of thing, I think – but that was fine, I could wait. Her couch was still infinitely better than my dorm bed anyway, and her fridge was always heaped with food – mostly meat, granted, but I’m no vegetarian. 

Despite all her eating, though, she seemed to be getting thinner. Her face was paler, and she was more withdrawn. Sometimes she would just stare into space for half an hour at a time, not saying anything, only to shake herself as I touched her or called her name a few times. She started calling into work sick, and when I visited her she would just be curled up on her couch heaped in blankets, the remnants of some sandwich or a pizza box scattered around her. I started to get worried, but I wasn’t worried enough.

Once, when we were making out, for a moment I felt something more than just her tongue in my mouth. The feeling didn’t really leap out at me – it was just a sort of niggling sensation, swallowed up by everything else that was going on – but I kinda stopped, and she drew back and looked at me with curiosity. I swallowed, ran my tongue around my mouth a few times, but decided I had just imagined it. Then, she asked what was wrong, and something flickered in her eyes.

I don’t mean that in a poetic, English-major-y way. I mean I literally thought I saw something tiny dart through her eye.

I freaked out, needless to say, but she was just confused. She said she didn’t feel anything, and even when I shined a light on her eye to see for sure, there was nothing there. I thought I was just going a little bit crazy, so she went to bed and I stayed on the couch. I shouldn’t have dismissed it. I should have taken her to the doctor. Damn it, why didn’t I?

Things got worse. She stopped coming into work entirely, and I began taking time off to go make sure she was okay. Her staring into space was more pronounced than before, as was her shaking. When she got up and walked around, it was disjointed, like she had forgotten how to use her body. And she kept asking for food, all the time. At first it was just sandwiches, then it was hamburgers, then it was just the burger itself. Then, once, she asked if I could just give one to her raw.

I was taken aback, disgusted, but she just looked so pitiful, shrinking into her bed with all her pillows and everything fluffed up around her. So I did. Well, I cooked it a little, but it was still plenty pink in the middle when I brought it to her. She ate the whole thing, gave me a sleepy smile, and fell asleep.

I went back to my couch, silently freaking out. It was all too weird for me. I’d never heard of anything like this. I’d heard about feeding a cold and starving a fever or whatever, but this was ridiculous. I decided I was going to take her to the doctor the next morning, whether she wanted to go or not.

But when the morning came, she wasn’t in bed. I could hear the shower running in her bathroom. Frankly, I was a bit surprised she could even manage to walk that far, as weak as she seemed. But I decided I’d give her some space; if she was showering, maybe she was feeling better.

I decided I’d go and make myself a sandwich. When I came back, the shower was still running, which was weird. It had been more than thirty minutes – I had ended up making myself a second sandwich and had eaten a hot dog, too. I was just weirdly hungry. Anyway, by now I was a little concerned. I had no idea how long she had been in there before I had woken up, and she wasn’t the kind to take really long showers anyway.

“M?” I called, opening the door a crack. “You okay?”

No response.

“M?”

Still nothing. God, the sound of the water hitting her is still in my head.

I stepped inside. The steam was almost blinding; there was a window she usually opened to let most of it out, but it was closed. “M?”

I pulled back the curtain, and there she was, sprawled on the tile, blood pooling around her fractured skull, her eyes gazing sightlessly upwards as the rain pelted her naked body. But that was not the worst part. The worst part was that she looked like a skeleton. I still remember those pictures of the Holocaust victims we all see in high school, where they look more dead than alive; that was exactly what she looked like. She was so painfully thin, it was a wonder she had managed to walk on her matchstick legs at all. Her ribs looked like they were about to poke through her skin. But her belly…that was round and full, like the distended ones you see in those images of African children on the charity commercials. 

I knelt by her, but of course there was nothing I could do. She was long gone. She must have collapsed and hit herself on the temperature knob on the way down. It didn’t look as though she had struggled at all; she would have died almost instantly.

I stayed there for a long time, just staring. A few times, I thought I saw her stomach move – but of course that was crazy. It was just the way the water hit her. Then, in a daze, I left. I called 911 – even though it was far past that now, obviously – and explained what had happened. The lady on the phone promised to send a cops and an ambulance my way immediately, even though there was no need.

Then I sat down, and made some bacon.

I can’t even really remember what happened when they arrived. There were just people swarming all over my house, suddenly. Two big cops started asking me questions. I don’t really remember what I said. They kept asking me why I was eating, and I just kept repeating that I was hungry, over and over. One said I needed to go to the station with them, so I did.

While I was there, they wouldn’t give me any food, not even a bag of chips, no matter how much I asked. They kept asking me how I couldn’t have known she was starving, how I couldn’t have known something was wrong, over and over and over. All I could say was that I didn’t know. She’d hidden it all from me, with her huge clothes and thick blankets. I kept saying if I had known, I would have helped her. I would have saved her. Now I know she was too far gone for that, of course. I hadn’t seen the signs in time, and it was too late.

Eventually, they let me go. Later in the day, someone called her apartment, but I didn’t pick up. A doctor, I think, or maybe a coroner. They left a message. Something about her stomach. It sounded important, but I couldn’t bring myself to listen again. I wandered around her apartment for hours, touching everything that had belonged to her as if it would bring her back. As if I could take back her mistakes, and mine.

She must have had some sort of eating disorder, I guess. Looking back, the way she acted when we first met sounds like classic anorexia…but then it must have changed into something else, I don’t know. Maybe she was eating a lot and then throwing it up – I’ve heard about that on TV.

Sometimes I can’t help but think back to her stomach, how swollen it had been, how deformed. I have no idea what could have caused that. But it doesn’t really matter now, does it? She’s dead, and it’s my fault.

I’m sorry, guys. There’s not a whole lot else I can say. The past few weeks have just been awful. They kept it out of the news, but somehow people keep asking me about it anyway, wondering why I didn’t do something, why I didn’t see. I don’t know. I’ve just been living in a daze since it happened, like I can’t feel anything at all. Nothing seems right. Sometimes my hands kinda jerk on their own, when I’m just zoning out. I keep waking up in the middle of the night, feeling like I’m starving, but I think I’ve been losing weight. Grief, probably. I’ve heard it can do that to you. I really don’t know. I just kinda wish it would end.

Again, I’m sorry. This is a lot to dump on you all, but I just have to get it out. I’m going to post this and then lie down for awhile, I think. I haven’t gone to work in four days now. Just haven’t felt up to it. Maybe make myself a burger – that sounds good. Don’t think I’ll cook it, though. My stomach seems to handle it better when it’s fresh.

Lady_rosalie,6,,4,1rbth4,,9,"I found a journal today while sifting through some things at a little local secondhand shop. They have a lot of old and cool things, so I tend to go there a lot. I decided to buy it and a few other things. I didn't look through the diary, since honestly I assumed it would be empty. Well when I curled up to write something's a few minutes ago, I saw it wasn't empty at all. Or even that old!

The first page was dated September 23rd, 1993. Only two decades ago. It was filled with normal teenage things. The author, a 16 year old named Lily, was worried about school, and the hunky guys and if they liked her. Boring things, yet I kept reading. I couldn't help it. I read things Lily might not have told anyone. It was kinda cool. 

Then I got to October 3rd, 1993. Lily and her (B.F.F4evur) Sarah, as well as a few other girls, Ruth, Emily, and Jessica, came over to stay the night. A slumber party. After doing the normal things, the pulled out a ouija. Oh great, I thought, it would be a bunch of 'scary' occurances. But nope. Nothing happened according to Lily. But it spurred talk of the local haunts. 

""Everyone knows about these places. Like, pinkys cave, that crying statue, there's like, two insane asylums, the screaming bridge, lovers gate and witches gate. Well of course we talked a put them. Emily said she swears she saw a ghost at lovers gate. Yeah right. Ghosts are totally bogus. Well whatever. I decided, with S.E.J.R's encouragement of course, that I would spend the night at each one. So there chickens. I'd write about it too. Don't worry Diary. The times I go will be reaaaally dull."" 

I felt a chill go up my spine and I've stopped. I looked at the last paper pages, to see if it went on. There was nothing. She stopped writing like, a quarter of the way to the end. What's even worse, is the dry red shit on some of the papers. I think it's blood, but it's not like it's soaked. But still...I want to go on, but I'm worried. What if she did go? What did she find? 

I'm going to try and do research on this. Figure out who Lily was, and hopefully, I'll find that she alive, well, and that blood is just from something else. ",The Diary,13,nosleep
RayAllenLovecraft2,0,,8,1r7jhu,,8,"A rather peculiar incident happened not too long ago on a cold, rainy night.  It was a little past 2 a.m. when I left my friend's house.  Its a old Victorian house in a once thriving town.  As I was driving down the empty road, I saw a taxi cab in a left turn lane.  I was able to see it's lights from about a mile away.  The green glow shined through the mist and created this aura on the surprisingly empty street.  This is not uncommon in a large town such as this, but the thing that puzzled me is where it was turning into.  The taxi was turning into a mental institution for the criminally insane.  This event happened to startle me because it was so early in the morning.  I continued to drive home wondering why someone was being released so early.  The next day, I went to school.  My school is only a stone's throw away from the mental hospital.  As I walked out of my last class I saw a familiar glow.  It was that green taxi again.  I didn't think much of it, being a college. I see taxis picking up people all the time.  As I hiked across the parking lot and got into my car I noticed it was still there.  I didn't really pay much attention to it because classes can run pretty late, maybe someone was taking there time walking through the campus.  As I tore out of the parking lot I noticed it wasn't there.  Maybe the driver got pissed and left.  I met up with some friends from class at a Mexican restaurant down the street.  As we were waiting for our food I told them about the coincidence that happened the night before and what just happened in the parking lot.  My friend, whose family had lived in the area for a long time, told me more about the mental institution.  He told me about how they once tested drugs on the patients and preformed lobotomies up until the 1950's.  The room was dead silent.  Luckily, our food came out shortly after the disturbing conversation.  When we finished eating, we talked more about it.  I was becoming obsessed with it.  Why was it there so late? Who where they picking up?  Was it the same taxi? Our conversation was cut short when the bill came to the table.  We were too busy counting our singles and change (we are college students!) to be talking about the mental hospital.  We stepped outside and had a cigarette before we would part ways.  We were standing in a empty parking lot at around 10:30 p.m. when we noticed something out of the ordinary.  We saw the green taxi picking someone up at the restaurant across the street.  It was just parked there.  We abruptly said goodbye and got into our cars.  I drove home without stopping.  The next night at dinner, I told my parents what has been going on.  They didn't believe that a green taxi has been following me around.  Days and days passed and I continued to see the taxi again.  I was getting really paranoid.  I started to take days off of school to avoid seeing it.  My parents were deeply concerned with my behavior and suggested that I see a psychologist.  I mustered up the courage and drove there myself, after all, I am a college student.  I couldn't concentrate on the road.  I was afraid that I would see it again.  I was so bent out of shape, I accidentally ran through a red light while making a right turn.  I heard somebody laying on their horn.  I was shocked to see who I pulled out in front of.  It was the green taxi!  I raced to the psychologist.  I ran as fast as I could into the office.  The councilor was frightened by my actions.  She took me into her office to hide me from the other patients.  I told her everything. She was gravely concerned with my state.  She suggested that I be admitted.  My heart dropped. I started to break out in a cold sweat.  She left the room to make a phone call.  I assumed that she was notifying my parents that I was being taken in.  She talked to me for a few more minutes until she got a call.  Once she hung up, she told me my ride was here.  I was puzzled.  She walked me out of the building and told me she called a cab.  I froze.  I looked out the glass doors and saw the green taxi parked in front of the exit.  I broke out into a violent fit, thrashing and resisting.  I was not getting in there.  Two security guards restrained me and started to drag me in the cab.  We were driving down the same street that I first saw it on.  We got into the left turn lane and entered through the opened gates.  I gotta cut this short.  My computer time is up.  The hospital only gives you an hour a day. I hope you enjoyed the story.

I had two glasses of wine while my clothes were in the drier and fell asleep on the couch around eleven. I woke up at three-thirty with all the lights on, it was raining out. I love falling asleep to the rain. I tried to drift back to sleep despite feeling completely awake. I never felt the sleep pass over me, but eventually I began dreaming. In my dream I was giving my manager a ride home. It was dark and quiet in the city and I was jokingly pretending to be asleep while I was driving. I had my head leaning back on the head rest and my bottom jaw was slack so my mouth was open. But then I felt that I was stuck that way. So he started nudging my right shoulder to make me wake up. I felt panic in my dream. That's when I came out of that dream and back into my living room where I was asleep on the couch. My mouth still agape, my eyes still closed. I was short of breath. That is when I realized that I still felt the nudging sensation. Now, however, it was coming from behind the couch cushion against my right shoulder. I could feel and hear the cushion pushing me back and forth on my couch. It then felt like I was fully awake and the nudging stopped for a second. I took a second to let myself feel afraid. The nudging began again but now there was an orchestra of movements all around on my couch. The cushions under my feet were being pulled upward in short little beats, and the left side of my pillow was doing the same thing. I felt and heard the blanket next to my right ear moving like it was trying to tickle my face and ear. I allowed these hallucinations to feel real, and as soon as I gave in to their reality, I felt the sides of my pillow begin to curl up and over my face. My heart began racing, my breaths were shallow, and I still was unable to move or wake myself up. The pressure of the pillow on my face increased until it felt like I couldn't breath. I was sinking into my couch, the pressure was on my entire body now. I knew I had let my fear fuel this hallucination for too long. I took a giant gasp of air, and woke up. I didn't know how to prove to myself that I was truly awake, so I stayed sitting upright with the lights on and opted out of sleep for the night. ",My dreams won't let me sleep,17,nosleep
Lady_rosalie,1,,6,1re4vh,,7,"So I tried to research this girl, Lily. Nothing on the Internet sadly. I didn't think it would be that easy. After all. I have no last name. Alley Cat, where I got the diary from, is open tomorrow. If the weather isn't bad tomorrow I'll go. 

But I did read more if the diary. There's some normal things, but October 8, 1993 she went to Pinky's cave. This is what she wrote;

""So mom thinks I'm at Sarah's. I'm spending the night or, whatever. She never calls, so I'll be good. I'm at Pinky Cave! It's like, dark so I'm writing with a flash light. The rules are all night stays. Ruth and I made a bet. Ha! She's way going to lose! Then I'll have 50 bucks! 

Okay diary. This is the legend. So like, no one knows why it was built. Or when. Some say moonshiners, some say the city. But it's not on city plans. At all. It's like, a three mile long tunnel made of concrete. Not a real cave! Anyway, so like, Robert Pinkman lived across the street from the opening and claimed it as his. A baby and her mom got caught in a super bad storm and drown in the cave. So now she haunts it, asking where's her baby. (No sight of her so far!)that's sorta all I know. Well I'll write again in a few, I'm going to eat some food. (Chips! Yum.)

2:15am So I fell asleep but I woke up and heard something weird. Like, crying. I'm sure I'm the only one down here. Maybe it was a dream or something. I'm going to try to sleep again.

5:53am I just saw it! I was getting ready to pack it up and go to Sarah's, when I saw it! Her I guess! She was white with this like super long hair and like, sorta an old dress. She was crying, then turned to me and vanished! I like ram out of there. I just now came back for my things. Okay so one thing happened. I can't wait to tell the girls though!""


And that's where that night ended. Not super spooky, I guess. But I still keep getting these chills. Like there's more to come. Pinkys cave, was actually a drainage place, built forever ago. It's on city maps though. Still I heard a woman died there too. But who knows for sure? 

Well there's more, but that's for tomorrow. I'm far to scared to read what comes next, at least at night.

""Fuck that. You need a hospital,"" said my Dad as he arced the car across the road, onto the shoulder, and back into the opposing lane, headed to the center of town. I was smushed against the door and then the back of my seat as he gunned the accelerator, giving the engine a run for its money and losing traction briefly in the process. My heart hammered in my chest and shocks of adrenaline coursed through my body. This was it. I was dying. My mom, my sister, both dead. Now it was my turn. Two minds swam around inside my skull like binary stars poised to collapse together. They took turns, rocking back and forth faster and faster, each feeling the pull of the other as they battled for control of my body. Faster and faster, approaching singularity, vibrating my perspective like an engine in a car, numbing my face and fingertips. Black encroached upon my vision as I drowned in fresh air, and then all was darkness.

""... appendix looks alright. Given her recent loss and the trauma she must have experienced witnessing the crash, it's likely she had a panic attack. Has this happened before?""

""No, never ...""

I opened my eyes. I inhaled. Sickness and death coated the inside of my nostrils. I pictured my sinuses and lungs darkening as though I was inhaling smoke from an electrical fire. Yellowed fluorescence glared down at me from the ceiling. Misery seeped into my pores and tugged my heart in several directions at once. Someone nearby was about to die and so many were suffering.

I heard beeping and someone yelled for a crash cart. Right on time.

I was alive and I was myself. But the definition of ""myself"" had changed. I felt distinctly like one person, yet knew that I consisted of two beings. We had fused together, the silver lady and I, and I was equal parts both. I examined my skin, its ghostly sheen. A greenish corkscrew-shaped worm drifted over my bed, briefly silhouetted against the glow of the fluorescent lights, and sighed dreamily.

""Well that was different.""

""Oh thank Christ, you're awake,"" my dad half-sobbed, lurching toward my side and away from the doctor.

""I'm fine, Dad. I think I had a panic attack."" A small purple leech-like thing with white spots had attached itself to his face while I was talking and slurped at a tear that had just trickled past. It shivered ecstatically and began purring.

""I thought you were dying. I just ... it would have been too much,"" he said, brushing another tear off and inadvertently dislodging the leechkitten thing. It screeched and flitted away with a farting noise.

I consulted my expanded library of memories - from when I was the silver lady. Strange and very hungry creatures loved to gather at hospitals. They fed off the dying, the vulnerable, the grieving. It seemed to be a drug for many of the darker things in the world. I mused to myself that fire was used to keep those pests away before it was used to cook meat. People were so much more in tune with reality before language let the mind shape perception.

The doctor checked me over and kept me awhile for observation. Dad and I left with a small prescription of Xanax and a referral to a local therapist. I knew I wouldn't be needing either now, but also that it would reassure my dad to go. I couldn't think of anything I wouldn't do to make him feel better, and mentally shrugged.

I wanted to go pick up my car, but Dad would have none of it. His tone told me that he'd rather walk through Hell than let me out of his sight right now, and I couldn't blame him. We went straight home, and I stared out the window in fascination. A herd of giant spotted fuzzy caterpillars were crawling across the road on the way out of town, wiggling phallic appendages on their backs quivering with the motion. We rolled the car straight through the middle of them and several popped with a glurping sound, like balloons full of soft, pulpy pudding. A tall, lanky, semitransparent humanoid was licking the red paint on a stop sign several miles later with a blue, fuzzy tongue the size of my dad's knobby hands. It paused when we pulled up and stepped over to the car in two long strides. I was slightly embarrased to notice, before it stooped over, that its wrinkly penis was the size of my forearm. I stared into one set of its chameleon-like eyes and smiled; its other eyes were flitting around and examining the car. It licked the window, leaving a slimy trail that lingered until we were nearly home.

The vast majority of the spiritual wildlife that hides in plain sight is harmless or mostly so, I knew. Extremely weird and illogical, yes, but for the most part its interactions with the world we know are trivial. Hardly surprising that we don't see much of it, considering the human desire for an orderly world: was a tiny six-armed ape just fucking my ear canal, or did that song get stuck in my head on its own? No, no earfuckers here, no sir.

My dad and I were both exhausted when we reached the house. I broke off to the kitchen while dad meandered to the living room. I popped open the freezer looking for my jumbo-sized tub of neapolitan ice cream, and was greeted by a tiny pixie-like critter with the head of a fly. It burst out of the freezer and shook its tiny segmented fist, shivering hard enough to affect its flight.

""Sorry,"" I thought at it, as though I had been telepathic my whole life. Which, technically, I suppose I had been.

""Damn right,"" it thought back. It shot me the middle finger and buzzed off, phasing through the solid glass window and toward the treeline.

Yeah, spirits are like that sometimes.

I grabbed my tub of ice cream and a spoon, because this was not a day for diets. I marched into the living room and plopped down beside my dad, who was just settling down himself. He turned the television on, and it was set much louder than it needed to be. I jumped, and so did the shadowy figure in the corner. It began screaming bloody murder. Shocked, I mentally yelled at it to quiet down, but I apparently didn't get through. Dad almost immediately turned the television down, but the figure only screamed louder and my ears began to hurt. I silently tried to reason with it for fifteen minutes, to no avail. In exasperation, I asked if it wanted some ice cream, and to my great delight it quieted down. I took the tub back into the kitchen, shadow man in tow, and scooped out a spoonful of icecream into a little saucer, which I sat in the sink. I wasn't really sure what it was going to do with frozen dessert, but I didn't really care as long as it was quiet about it. I grabbed my bottle of Xanax off the counter and tipped a couple into my palm, because it was most definitely a day for anxiolytics. I tossed them back and swallowed dry, and then went back into the living room, taking my tub. The living silhouette stayed behind.

Dad left the station on the news until it mentioned the crash, and then he channel surfed for awhile. Between the sedatives and the ice cream, I wasn't paying much attention. I whittled the strawberry down to almost nothing and then half of the chocolate before I realized I was really full and put the tub back up. The shadow man was gone and the ice cream in the saucer had warmed and melted. I mentally shrugged for the second time that day, which reminded me I needed to set up the therapy appointment. I grabbed the sheet of paper with the name and number on it, called, and scheduled an appointment. The earliest they had was about two and a half weeks from then, and would probably last an hour and a half, and could I please come early to get the paperwork filled out. I said I would and thank you very much, then hung up. I wrote the appointment down on the fridge calendar so I wouldn't forget.

I chuckled softly to myself. I was Alice falling down the rabbit hole. I needed a shaman, not a shrink, but I doubted either one could help me, and I thought back to the memories of my mother's death, of the wound in the world that had taken her away from me. I saw it over and over again; each time the person was different and so was the setting. The memories stretched back to antiquity, to the times before the written word, before hatred took the form of words at all. I knew that specter so well. To call it the devil would be misleading. To call it evil an oversimplification. I felt righteous fury well up inside me, a gift of the silver lady, a pure, single-minded longing for cleansing fire.

And then I felt the distinct impression that somewhere dark and far away, an eye had opened and turned its gaze on me.

I heard the voice as an echo carried on the wind from across a great chasm.

""My, Sarah. How you've grown.""

to me
3 minutes agoDetails
Since the no sleep community knows about some of this stuff I was wondering if you guys can help me out and maybe tell me what this thing is?
   Throughout my life I've had a couple experiences that a normal human being might perceive as...odd. Though slightly nerve wracking at times, I've been able to brush them off. They were all dismissed on account of lack of sleep or my stressful lifestyle. That was until four years ago. Four years ago began the string of events that now has my questioning my sanity. Because of what happened and what has continued happening for the past four years I have to sleep with a nightlight when I am alone. Even though I'm almost twenty years old.
   I remember the day clearly. I was fifteen years old. Fifteen and brave. Fifteen and oblivious. What did I know about anything, anyway?
   I came home from school as usual. It was such a normal and uneventful day. Painfully boring, really. It was a Friday and at 15 I didn't have much to do after school. Especially because the weekends were my father's days and he had a strict curfew of before 9 in place. No sleepovers either. I didn't mind this because I didn't have any chores to do. I was free to stuff my face with pizza and play video games all weekend. It was a pretty good setup.
   After playing with my GameCube for what seemed like ten hours, I was ready for bed. I sauntered off to the washroom, went through the motions of bedtime and was soon in what I considered pajamas. Just an old tank top and old gym shorts, really. I climbed into bed without a worry or care. After getting situated, I quickly drifted off into dreamland.
   A couple hours later I woke up. I had to pee. And bad. I sat up in bed and waited for my eyes to adjust. My light switch was on the other end of the room and I'm not the neatest person. I wanted to be sure I could make shapes out so I wouldn't step on anything on my way to the door.
   A couple seconds went by and my eyes adjusted. The room grew a few shades lighter and things were coming into view. That is, except for a spot in front of my bed.
   At the foot of my bed was a large shadow. It appeared to be the silhouette of a very tall person. I sat there, almost in a trance. Dazed and confused. And as I continues staring I noticed something. There were absolutely no features to it. It was just a black mass. That's when I understood. This thing wasn't human.
    I frantically blinked, hoping my eyes were just playing tricks on me. After every blink it was still there. Fucking staring at me. And whatever it was, it hated me. I could feel the malice coming off in waves. I knew it wanted to hurt me. To do something awful. The worst part was I was powerless to stop it.
   Fear washed over me. I could feel ice in my spine, lead in my stomach. I was completely paralyzed. I was at its mercy. My heart felt as if it would burst out of my chest. If that thing didn't rip it out first. I sat there and we stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity. Then it moved. 
   Slowly but surely it came closer and closer to my bed. My terror was reaching its peak. I was drenched in sweat. But I couldn't muster up a sound. That is, until it moved again. Slowly, it bent over me. It was getting closer as if it meant to come face to face with me. I gathered every ounce of courage I had. I shut my eyes and began screaming at the top of my lungs.
   A few seconds later, my dad came rushing in. Tears began streaming down my face and all I could say was ""There's something in my room."" My dad mistook something as someone so he checked my window, which was still locked. Then he checked my closet which was still empty. He dismissed it as a nightmare. But I know what I saw. I slept with the light on that night. And every night since then, when I'm alone I sleep with a small lamp on. A couple of times I felt brave and I have tried to sleep without a light. But I swear I can feel something there. And that is not the last time my own personal tormentor came to visit either. Does anyone know what it might be?",Can anyone tell me what the hell this thing might be?,14,nosleep
BensonHedges1,1,,7,1r8sq9,,6,"Upon arriving home last night, the first thing I did was drag my boyfriend into the room. I was happy he finally had a night off and could witness what I've been stressing out about. Seriously, you should see me. I look like a crack head - no sleep - wrinkled clothes - everything..I have to run in and out of the room to get clothes for the next day. Thank god I haven't had to go into the office.

Anyways, I've spent most of my time in the spare room and kept the door shut. My cat has been incredibly cautious, he's looking around every corner, and just sits on a chair in the kitchen that faces the hallway to the bedroom. He is normally very cuddly, he welcomes me at the door, headbutts me for attention. This has all stopped. The hair on his tail is at a constant stand-up position. I took him to the vet this morning - she says anxiety seems to be the cause. I've got some kitty-prozac, maybe I should take it? 

Anyways - we went out for dinner last night and came home and fell asleep on the couch. Around midnight we got up and went into the room, and there was no chill. The windows were closed, and there was seriously no activity. He thinks I'm nuts, but I swear this keeps getting worse! The only thing I had to show was the dark spot on the carpet...it's grown more of an amber color, looks like rust, and it smells if you get close to it. Not nearly as rancid as yesterday. He thinks maybe there was a leak in the roof or something, but I don't know...

He left for a detail this morning at 5, so I figured I'd get up and moving, I actually felt good about things. Maybe it was just some weird series of events...I will tell you though, I had some really crazy dreams last night. I don't remember them scene for scene, but there were some people who I'm sure I know, but can't put my finger on. All dead - a bunch of dead corpses laying outside all these spots of this new town I've moved to. Outside the barbershop I visited yesterday. Outside the clock tower that I thought looked so beautiful at sundown last night. Dead people laying outside a warehouse - which is where my gym resides now...it felt so vivid. I remember just walking around, and I could literally feel myself bumping up against spirits. It was so vivid that I literally sighed with relief when I woke up and noticed myself wrapped in my boyfriends arms. I felt safe. 

I digress...

The weirdness has crept back though. I showered, had breakfast, and made some coffee...though I've been using the espresso machine because the drip on the coffee pot kind of freaks me out. During my coffee making process, I heard some tapping coming from the bedroom - up against the door. The cat was sitting in front of the door, but not close enough to be causing the tapping. As I approached, it sounded more like scraping, but was really faint. 

I opened the doors, and the windows are cracked open. I didn't do this. The bed looked slept in - we had made it so nicely before he went off to work. And the floor of the shower in the bedroom was SOAKED. I did not shower in there - I used the one in the main bathroom. Someone's sleeping in this bed, someone is showering. Someone is opening the drawers in our dresser. 

I walked into the room, and there was that feeling - the feeling from my dream. It felt like I had to push through dozens of bodies to walk through the door. SO MUCH PRESSURE. You know those days when it's windy as hell out and you're leaving a department store? They have those heat lamps right before an exit and you walk outside into the freezing cold - it's such a pressure change. That was this exact feeling. I felt like I entered a totally different place - it didn't feel like my home. There was so much negative energy...I could feel it. My mind start racing with flashback of that dream I had. I was walking around this town, everything was much grey-er than normal...I felt like I was warped somewhere. It was nuts - it felt like a movie, but I know it wasn't. I know none of this was happening, but I could feel it happen. The next thing I knew - I was gasping for air with my back on the bed. I looked at the clock and it was 8am...somehow I had lost track of about 2 hours. 

I regained composure, walked to the hallway, and my cat just hissed at me. He wouldn't let me pet him, pick him up, anything. Just hisses...and I felt dizzy. I noticed some hairballs and some piles of puke from my cat, which was definitely out of normal. I lucked out, my cat produces very limited hairballs...

I immediately called the vet...

And now I'm home, freaked out again, and the door is shut. There's a pretty constant knocking, scratching, and I'm sure that I've heard the shower turn on. At one point I heard the door open and close immediately, as if someone was peeking out see if I was still here.

sineating,3,,5,1r72fb,,8,"So I'm very drunk right now and I'm sorry if this isn't super coherent.

My friend killed herself last year, in a park. An hour before they found her body another friend called me asking if I had seen her, cause she'd gone missing, and I started calling in-town friends to keep an eye out for her.

He called me again, an hour later, and said ""they found her"" and I didn't understand at first and he said ""what the fuck do you think happened?"" and, well. I hung up and curled up in the corner and cried for a little while. I thought she had hung herself.

I called another friend and she ran over to my place, and hugged me, and bought me a pack of smokes and told me we should walk. It was late, and it was dark out, and I swear to god I saw her hanging from every tree we went past, and she was staring right at me. She was waving around because the wind was fast and her feet were kicking, but she was staring right at me, I swear. She looked so angry.

We went over to a guys house to break the news, cause he's a really emotional guy and he'd need someone to hug while we told him. He cried. I stared at the wall and saw her feet kicking. 

We left, and it must have been 1am and my phone was going off but I didn't want to hear it because I kept seeing her up in the trees, except now she was crouching on top of the branches and looking at me, and there was no rope around her neck and no gun (she took half her face off, and my friend's dad was the paramedic who took her away so I know this)and she was watching me? She was creeping along the branches and moving her hands and watching me.

I went home and cried some more and I was afraid and confused and I smoked a few cigarettes to calm down (I want to go buy a pack right now but)but I could still hear her, creeping along the branches. So angry. I didn't sleep but when I did, I heard the branches creaking under her, the crying in the woods, and the rope creaking. There was no rope, but I don't think it knows.

I visited her grave at night, and the branch of the tree above it (there was no tree I am afraid) creaked and snapped and touched my neck.

I keep hearing tapping on my window at night, and when I work night shift I won't look at the trees, because suicides turn into restless spirits, don't they?

Is she even still there?

darkdreamers,0,,6,1r4n8q,,7,"Remember the old days where we used MSN as a form of communication? It was pretty sweet. We could give dancing emoticons of someone's ass and they can't do shit about it.

So back then, when they just installed this new voice note feature, I was hooked. You record a few seconds of you talking, send, and the other person can listen and reply the same way. So one day I was doing this with my friend, just voice-noting back and forth. We didn't think twice about using an actual telephone because holy shit voice notes! What a time to be alive!

So I was replying to his voice note and sent it. After sending it though, I always press play to listen back to my own note, but this time, there was nothing there. I paused, pressed play again, nothing. Quiet. As if I recorded a normal room. Then I heard a humming, not a machine hum but a woman's hum. I was around 13 or so at the time, and my voice still resembled that of a 13 year-old girl. But this voice was older and it was humming a song, really slowly. Really creepily, as if she was right next to me as I hit the record button previously. I paused it and ran out of the fucking room.

Up until today, I still don't know what that was. I quit the chat and refused to do voice notes ever again. The fuck was that?! ",Voice notes...but not my voice,13,nosleep
Darrenshan66,0,,8,1r3u6m,,7,"I walked up to the old elementry school with caution. It hadn't been used in years, and the gym had parts of a tree growing through the planks, and an entire section of it had to be torn down for having asbestos in the walls. I got to the entrance and what do ya know? It was locked. I cursed and kicked the door. I was supposed to be able to get in so I could do my project for history class. I was supposed to go to one of the oldest buildings and town and right a report on it, so I thought it would be cool to get first hand experience inside the building. I had even told the groundskeeper I was going to visit the school! But alas, the door was locked. I was right about to leave when I noticed something shining in the grass. Being curious, I walked over and picked it up. It was an old key. ""Could it really-"", I asked myself, turning towards the door. I walked up and stuck the key in and IT WORKED. Excited about my new found courage I ran into the building. The old concession stand for the gym was the first sight to greet me. Its old countertops covered in ancient dust. I pushed open the doors and entered the gym. Holes were broken in the wooden planks of the court where a tree had pushed through. I pulled out my camera and snapped a few pictures. As I looked over the newly taken photos I noticed what looked like a person standing on the stage in the background. ""Hello?"", I asked, hoping that whoever I had seen was kind enough to respond. I got no reply and decided to take a closer look at the picture. ""Must be the light"", I told myself, shrugging away the fear of whomever I had seen. Then I came to realize that there were no lights on. I decided to correct this error and walked to the back of the gym. I flipped the lightswitch and the lights burst into life. The gym became so bright that I had to cover my eyes. I walked into the middle of the gym. I was about to snap some more pictures with the flash off when the lights cut out. ""Stupid old fuse"", I said walking up to the switch. I flipped it off and on again, the lights came back on and I walked to the middle of the gym again. Then the lights turned off again! ""What the hell?"", I asked, walking up to the switch. My jaw dropped when I noticed that the switch was missing. All that was left was torn wires and twisted metal. I ran for the front door but it was sealed shut. I pulled the key out of my pocket and stuck it in the door. I yelped as the key turned red hot in my hand like a live coal. I dropped it as the metal liquified into a puddle on the floor. Just then, the lights in the gym came on again. I walked out onto the court and what I saw made me shiver. Something had left footprints in the dust. They looked like a cross between a skeletal foot and hooves. I gasped and ran to the exit at the back of the gym. I opened the door and ran down a corridor to the door to the outside. I tried the handle but it was locked. I cursed and shook the handle in anger, when I heard something and fell silent. Something was coming down the corridor. It moved on heavy feet, making clicking noises with each slow step. It made shallow breaths, almost as if it was struggling to breath. I covered my nose as the scent of rotting flesh hit me. I stared down at a puddle on the floor and got a veiw of the creature. It was wrapped in a red cloak, with tears in the seams and stains all over it. It's face was the skull of a cow, and it had long arms that touched the floor, the claws on its hands scraping the floor as it walked. I flew into a panic, i kicked at the door until the lock broke. I burst into the night and ran until I was numb, then I blacked out...


Ten weeks later the building was torn down. Some workers reported that they had found a basement littered with human remains. Then the story was never talked about again.

AfterYourHeart,2,,5,1r1po8,,8,"You ever have one of those days, one that changes your life so drastically that looking back you can’t help but wonder where you’d be if it never happened? I know I have. I also know that without that day, I would never be here. I apologize if this is a little blurred. They only let me have “soft” writing utensils. No pens. No pencils. So I’m writing this in artist’s charcoal. I don’t know why they think I’m so dangerous. I swear I’ve never hurt anyone in my life, nor would I! That’s why I’m writing this. I’m hoping that if I write it all down someone, anyone, will read it and understand my side of the story. The biggest problem there is that not even I understand my side of the story. Everything is so messed up in my head; events are out of order, somethings are blurry, others are just plain missing. Who knows, maybe I’m just writing this all down to help myself understand, but where do I even begin? Well, I supposed I already mentioned the day everything changed, so I may as well start there.

Sadly, for a day that sent my life into a quick downward spiral to hell, I don’t really remember much about it. Not the date. Not the weather. I could barely tell you the month. I can tell you this. It was night; well, I guess it could have been really early morning. I was working third shift at the time and I know I was at work. I was cleaning. I was cleaning the bathrooms more specifically. I had just gotten done with the upstairs bathroom and was getting ready to clean the downstairs bathroom.

Before I go on, I should mention that at the time I was working in a foster home for teens with mental and physical disabilities. Since I mainly worked nights, my main tasks were light housework, some dinner prep for the next day, and mainly, stay awake and make sure nothing happened to the boys during the night. It was a pretty easy job as there were only two boys at the time; one 16 and one 18, who for the most part, slept through the night. 

Anyway, where was I? Oh  yes. That night. I had finished cleaning the upstairs bathroom and was about to go clean the downstairs bathroom when I noticed the light in the garage was on. That’s weird. I knew when I got there at the beginning of my shift, that I walked up the driveway, and as it was already dark out, I would have noticed if it were on and it would have bugged me until I turned it off. I’m a stickler for not leaving the lights on. I know that I was deep in thought as I walked up. Maybe I was so distracted that I didn’t notice. I have been known to wander off in my own little world from time to time. Then again, maybe my boss left it on after I had already gotten there.

I decided that I better go check it out. After all, protector to the boys was also part of my job, and the phone was on the way to the door. I grabbed the phone, dialed 911 and put my finger on talk, ready to push it if something went wrong. Since it’s a landline, if I do call and can’t talk, heaven forbid, dispatch will still be able to know the address and send a car out to check. I crept slowly to the garage door. I’ll admit, I was terrified. I probably should have called anyway, just to be on the safe side. I made it to the garage, slowly opened the door, and peeked my head out. Empty. I gasped as I released the breath I didn’t know I was holding. Still holding the phone, just in case, I checked the back garage door. Locked. I let out a small chuckle as I started to relax and I headed back into the house, making sure to lock the garage door, and turn off the light on my way back in.

Crap. I noticed when I walked back in that in my stupid terror I had left the bathroom light on. *Sigh.* At least I could use the exercise, I joked with myself on the way back down the hall. I think I was still feeling really foolish for how worked up I let myself get. When I turned into the bathroom, a scream of terror got trapped in my throat so hard that I passed out.

I came to on the bathroom floor. I was a little achey in a few spots, but considering how hard I must’ve fallen on bare tile, it could have been way worse. Lucky for me, my head landed on the bath rug next to the shower; although, there was a bit of a ringing sound in my ears. It either went away or I got used to it quickly , because after a moment I didn’t even notice it. I slowly got up and checked out what startled me into fainting for the first time in my life. 

The mirror had writing on it. I looked closer. The writing was orange. Orange marker. Washable. Weird. Why would someone choose orange marker. That just seems like an usual choice. I mean, I know there were markers in the linen closet next to the bathroom, but who would look in a linen closet for writing utensils? I mean, it’s just not what I would expect writing on the mirror to be written with.

Wow. I can’t believe I can get so side-tracked, even at a time like this. Focus. Mirror. Orange marker (weird). Writing. Maybe one of the boys did it. Well, of the two, only one of them was verbal and literate. His bedroom was just down the hall. The other boy had his room in the basement. It was a fully finished basement that was remodeled specifically for him. He had pretty severe Autism and didn’t speak or write. I checked my phone. Not that much time had passed while I was on the floor. I decided to go down the hall and check to see if Gabe was still awake. I knew that if he had written it, he’d be giggling in his room, waiting for a reaction.

I opened his door and turned on his light. He was sound asleep. Even though he was face-up he didn’t even flinch when I turned on the overhead light. Now trust me, as the person who took care of him most nights and got him up and ready for school in the morning, I could tell when he was faking sleep. I also knew, in general, how long it took him to fall asleep. There was no way he wrote that.

I walked back to the bathroom. After looking again I couldn’t help but think, it couldn’t have been Gabe. His hand writing is atrocious. The handwriting on the mirror was fairly neat, feminine almost, and slightly familiar. Again, I couldn’t help but shake off a weird feeling, and again I should have called 911. I guess I didn’t want to be the one that had to call the cops while working, which I found stupidly embarrassing. So, after a quick yet terrifying search of the house revealed no one else and all the doors and windows locked, I cleaned off the mirror, first reading it one last time:

*“Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb.
Mary had a little lamb and she threw it out the window
The window, the second story window.”*

	
I couldn’t help but say it in the sing-songy way that my grandpa had originally taught it to me. It was a silly twist you could put on the right part of any nursery rhyme to make it even sillier. He taught it to my sisters, cousins, and I to keep us entertained on long car rides. Sometimes we’d pass it along to any friends who happened to have come with; although we quit doing it by time I was 12 or 13, so I don’t think I was friends with anyone any longer that would have learned the song with us.

I watched TV in the living room for the rest of that shift, trying to distract myself. It didn’t work at all and I jumped out of my skin at every noise. When my boss got there I blamed illness on my incomplete chore list. She believed me as I had never before not finished them, and she wished me better as I hurried off.

When I got home I curled up with my fiance and somehow managed sleep. Then again, I always felt safe in his arms. When he got up to leave, he quietly kissed me goodbye. As he slipped out the door, I slipped back to sleep.

I remember I woke up before my alarm. For some reason I was cold. I peeked one eye open and noticed Pugsley was gone. Oh well. He sleeps when daddy sleeps, I can’t expect him to sleep when I sleep too. I also noticed that Joe had left the window open again. Man, I hate it when he does that. Now I get to lay here and debate whether or not it’s worth getting up and closing the window before my alarm goes off. I decide quickly that if I close the window now, I can still jump back in bed and snooze for a little bit longer before the alarm, but when I got to the window, sleep was the last thing on my mind.

There on the sidewalk below, was Pugsley. The dog Joe, Sophia my daughter, and I had gotten together upon getting this new apartment. Joe had been so happy about having our bedroom on the second story. As I looked down, many thoughts flooded my head. One more than the rest. *“the window, the window, the second story window…”*

I put the dog in a small box, then double bagged the box with plastic bags, and put it in the garage freezer. After all, I still had to pick up Sophia from school. I would try to figure out what to tell Joe and Sophia on the way there.

They’re coming! Crap! They’re coming to check on me! I have to hide this. I don’t want them to find it. If I’m never able to continue, just know one thing. I AM NOT CRAZY!

sangarji,1,,4,1r1huu,,7,"I bought a camera last week and snapped pictures of my four year old daughter. I was excited about showing her those pictures as that would be the first time she would be seeing herself in a photograph.

When I laid the photos in front of her, she held them in her tiny beautiful hands and looked at me with a hint of confusion.

Who is this Daddy?

Its you of course, my darling. Don't you see?

No. Its not me.

Of course it is. Its my beautiful little angel.

But daddy, I don't look like this in glass ( She calls the mirror a glass ) I have blue eyes. This girl has black eyes. I have a mole on the cheek. And my hair is black. This girl has brown hair. This is not me. 

She was not lying. I know her play face. She was being earnest. 

And she was describing Sarah, my little sister who had suffocated to death in the attic 28 years ago.

While playing hide and seek with me. 

When she was four years old.

We don't have any pictures of Sarah and there is no way my daughter would've known how she looked. Unless...

Right now I see my daughter standing in front of the mirror and talking to her reflection in her sweet voice. I don't have the guts to see what she sees in the mirror. I'm scared. For her. For myself.",The Reflection,11,nosleep
00WELVAERT,5,,10,1r17ja,,5,"EDIT: Some spelling mistakes

Hey guys, I'm going to tell three real and inexplicable occurrences that have happened to me so far in my short life (Still a teenager) These occurrences involve a sound, or a sight being there that wasn't really there.
I can't really explain anything that has happened here, but I would like to share. Here it is...

The first time this had happened to me I was very young, around 7 years old. I was a confident little fellow, and after a day of playing with my brother and such I decided to sleep, in my sleeping bag, on the 3rd floor of my dads house alone...

So as I am about ready to start dreaming, with the moon out far and it being past my bedtime, I suddenly hear a man whisper to me.

The first time I had no idea what it said, completely unclear. So I freeze in pure horror, until again he whispers to me.

It still didn't say anything understandable, but at this point I was calling out for help from anyone in the form of some weird exhale of a loud shriek (That is really the best way to describe what I was doing). I was afraid if I called ""Dad!"" it would know I was trying to get away and it would hurt me.

So then it whispers to me, a little louder ""Noo no, it's okay"" ""shh shh"" as I scream for my dad as I remain frozen still from fear of moving a muscle.

Moments later my Dad rushes in to comfort me, as there was nothing there. I tell him what I heard, and even having it being the breakfast table conversation the next morning, my Dad was sure it was just my silly little child's mind playing games.

I slept in his bed that night. I knew what happened was real, it was so vivid and I still remember it all of these years later.

That was my first time experiencing something so inexpiable and supernatural, the second time was during the middle of last Summer.

So me being a stupid little fellow, me and a friend of mine decided to stay up for 2 entire days straight.

It was terrible in the first day, we could barley keep our eyes open. But coffee and monster pulled us through until the 48 hours were near over...

Nearing the end , as we are in the last hours of sleeplessness I had walked in to my room and closed the door to do something that I don't recall. It may have been to change clothes

As I'm changing, I started to hear the moaning and groaning of a person outside my window.

I took a good look outside, and saw no source of sound. It didn't get louder when I had opened the window either.

I had then started to hear my shower turn on, but when I opened my door to try and confirm someone was showering the noise stopped. I had opened and closed my door a few times and the noise stopped and started along with the door.

So I finished whatever I was doing, went in to the hallway and told my friend what happened  and that it was time to sleep. I was exhausted and confused as hell, maybe too tired to completely understand the fear I maybe should have been condoning. But, who knows.

So now comes for the most real and recent occurrence, this only happened 2 weeks ago.

So it was a Monday night, with school being off for Tuesday I managed to get my dad to drop me off to meet up with some girl to meet up with (Around 7:00 at night when he dropped me off).

The night played through, and it was eventually time for me to go (Around midnight when I left) . But luckily for me my ride fell asleep on me (Mom -.-) [More of my fault for staying with her so late]

So I didn't want to make her parents take me home, or make this anyone else's problem other than mine. So me being very tired thought ""Eh, I'll just walk, it wont take THAT long""

So I started off on my little (long as fuck ) adventure! I walked, and walked, and about 90 minutes in around 1:30 AM I'm walking by an elementary school in my neighborhood.

Everyone I have told this to has not believed me. So if you want to talk shit in the comments please don't waste your own time.

There was a leaf bag at the end of the street that connects with an intersection, but I swear to my life the leaf bag had limbs, was moving, and was on a bike.

I stared directly at it for moments at a time and it continued to ride the bike. It rode the bike, moving it's limbs but it was not going anywhere.

So, I just kept walking. Now pretty freaked out I start seeing black figures fly across my field of vision.

I just fucking ran because of that, past the elementary school, until I came across a giant parking lot for the church nearby.

So I took a breath for a moment or two, then I saw someone maybe 15 feet away. It was a pretty normal sized person, but it was wearing a full black coat, I could see nothing but black on it.

That just horrified me, I ran even more because of the adrenaline rush seeing that thing gave me. When I stopped running I could feel my pulse beat like drums. It was so irregular and strange, it would thump a few times, stop for a few seconds, and thump a few times again. I never saw that someone again.

I was very close to home at this moment, so I finished my 2 hour walk that lasted from 12AM-2AM within the next 15 minutes or so. The moment I finally made it home was amazing.

I can't say I know what was going on that night, or any of those times. But I can ensure to you that these things all really happened. I just can't explain how.",It has happened 3 times.,15,nosleep
Cremewagon,1,,5,1r15us,,9,"I'm 26 years old and I have been suffering from chronic sleep paralysis for about 9 years now.  I figured this would be a good place to recount some of the experiences I've had.

**Chicago** -  I was living with my girlfriend in a very tiny basement apartment.  The apartment was dirty and had low ceilings.  In our bedroom we had a bed and what was probably meant to be a closet in the corner of the room, only there was no door on it and no light fixture.  This corner of the room was always dark.  

My sleep paralysis dreams have always been vivid in the extreme.  Every detail is captured exactly how it would be as if I was awake.  It truly is impossible to tell the difference. 

My first incident at the apartment was one night when I fell asleep to my girlfriend watching Bridezillas in the other room.  I could see the light from the TV flashing under the doorway and hear the audio.  

Something was very wrong.  I could sense a presence and I knew it was in the dark closet/corner of my room.  It had not revealed itself, but it was there.  There is no fight or flight response in my very worst experiences.  It is just distilled terror.  I cannot move, cannot breathe, cannot scream.  That's when it comes out of the corner.  It moves very quickly.  Skittering almost.  I can see flashes of pale skin and long dark hair.  It is on the bed in seconds, I can feel the weight of it tugging on the covers.  Then it is on top of me.  I cannot breathe and I am face to face with something so evil that it is seared into my memory.  It is a woman, only she has a tiny face, her eyes are lambent green and she has draped her hair over me, trapping me right next to her face.  I can feel tiny puffs of stale breath on my cheek and the weight becomes unbearable.  I scream and wake up.  

This happened a few times, always the same woman.  Sometimes she would crawl out of the corner and across the ceiling before dropping onto my bed.  Sometimes she would just morph out of the shadows and appear on me.  This happened numerous times at this location and then she just stopped showing up.  

After a year we moved to a slightly larger apartment a few blocks away from the Belmont stop.  Sleep paralysis was very rare for me at this point.  We had lived at this place for about two months when I had another episode.

**Second Incident-**  I had just finished watching ""The Pixar Story"" on Netflix and had paused it on the credits and fell asleep with the lamp on beside me.  I had fallen asleep on my recliner so I was sitting up, which is strange because all of my other experiences I had been on my back.

When I wake up I see a massive being sitting next to me.  To put him into scale, I am sitting in the recliner and he is sitting on the ground.  The top of his head is level with my chin.  This would put him around 7-9 feet tall standing up.  Not only that but there was an aura of power that was palpable and just emanated from it.  He/it is resting there, it is the color of black marble.  I can see beads of perspiration on the skin.  Whatever it is, it is absurdly muscled and well defined.  Every possible muscle is nearly bursting out of the black marble flesh.  I can see the jugular vein in its neck beating with the pulse, black blood pumping through the spiderweb of veins under its skin.  I know now that it is a male.  His eyes are closed but I know they are completely yellow if they were to open.  I know that if I wake him I will die.  I sit there and watch him, he does nothing but breathe in and out as the perspiration rolls off his body.  This goes on for fifteen minutes or so.

When I woke up from this one I had a deep sense that I had encountered something from another realm.  That is really the only way to describe it.  It was too real.  Nothing in my room had changed, ""The Pixar Story"" was still paused and my lamp was still on.  But the presence of whatever I had just seen lingered for a long time.  

Another interesting thing about this one that sticks out.  I've never seen him again.  He just showed up once.  Which I thought was odd, because something as vivid and unique as this entity seems like a perfect thing for the mind to hold onto and conjure up again.  But it's been close to four years now and I have not seen him a second time.  I hope he never comes back, honestly.

**Third Incident-**  And now my last one.  This one happened three days ago.  I live in an apartment in Licoln, NE now and this is the first time it has happened here.  

I was laying on my side when I woke up, for some reason my phone was on and the clock is showing 2:01 a.m.  I live in the basement unit and there are orange sodium lights that shine into my room through the blinds.  One of the blinds is slightly lifted because my room-mate set her coffee there while she crocheted a scarf earlier.  Her knitting stuff is still on the chair.  At this point I start panicking because I cannot move and I know what is happening.  

There is a tapping on the window.  Really quick, light taps, followed by some scratching.  Like a cat is trying to get inside.  The orange lights start casting some strange shadows on the floor and I can see something moving outside the window.  It is moving with intelligence, trying to figure out a way in.  There are tiny puffs of humidity on the window too, so I know something is breathing on it.  At this point, I'm seriously trying to wake up because this is going to get very bad.  It moves over to the far right part of the window and starts tapping and scratching again.  Then it unlatches the window and opens it.  A frail looking arm slips in.  The skin is either dark, dark green or black and slimy.  The rest of it slips and it looks strangely cat-like, only minus the fur, and it glistens in the orange of the sodium lamps.  It just kind of sits there and stares at me with large pure black eyes.  Then it runs at me, only it moves without grace, like stop motion gone wrong.  I manage to turn my head and scream.  When I wake up I am moaning quietly.  

What bothered me about this one though is that my phone was on, and showing 2:04 a.m. when I woke up.  My phone had no reason to be on, the only thing I can figure is that I bumped into it during the episode.  

So, yup, those are my stories and yes, having these experiences have made it difficult to fall asleep some nights.  I've got a lot more of these experiences and I'll probably share them later, but this is enough for now.",I suffer from chronic sleep paralysis.,14,nosleep
the_dark_half,5,,1,1rhyj5,,7,"You know that feeling when you’re all alone and hear your name whispered? Maybe you’ve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop? Had things go missing only to re-appear in odd places? Maybe you’re like me and you lie in bed at night, only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around, nothing. 
Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately, tickling you? You check and nothing was there? I’m sure your parents tell you it’s nothing from a young age; perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination. They probably deep down fear it’s a ghost or apparition. Even they couldn’t know how much worse it really is.  Stop deluding yourself. It’s not a cobweb. It’s not the wind. It’s not nothing. It’s something far more sinister, an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention. 

Some of you, I’m sure, will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house. It’s such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do, it’s the spookiest part of a generic horror movie, because those suits in Hollywood haven’t seen what these creatures are really capable of. If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their ‘voices’. I’m sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed, taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because it’s real form is so terrifying you’d probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear, a zombie-esque state you’ll never awaken from-and that would ruin their fun too early. If you don’t die instantly, seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed; hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and I’ve heard of cases where insides have been liquefied, skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every pore.

The first time I awoke to one in my room with me, it was after I’d given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention. I had thought it was cool, I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me. I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination, until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg, followed by more spindly legs, followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs. Yep, a giant spider, bigger than a horse came into my room. I tried to scream, but that just resulted with me hyperventilating, then vomiting all over the floor. It strode in, all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away, but it held me down with its two front legs, piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devoured-which I was.  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn. I lay in bed, delirious, desperate, muttering for help. My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices, screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me. I passed out shortly after, from fear, blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later, believing to have all been a dream. I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals, birds mostly, wrapped up in what appeared to be spider’s webs, discoloured, drained of their blood and insides. All dead. I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself, dried blood caked on my body and face, puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts, my stomach, my legs and in my hair. 

The second night I encountered one of them, they took the form of my uncle. I lived with my uncle for nearly 5 years while my father was travelling almost every week for business. I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods. He didn’t know what his brother did to me. That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear, I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me. He crawled onto the bed and tied me down. I struggled, but when I did he beat me with his belt, like he had started doing when I was eight years old. I fought as hard as I could, tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably, but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl. The torture that night lasted for many hours, possibly days. I try not to remember it. I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago, when my uncle died. This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me. They’ve only grown stronger with every drop of blood, with every scream and with every hopeless sob I’ve given them.

Their true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that won’t instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane, yet; they like to take their time with their toys. The dreams for me started after those incidents. I have seen what those beings really look like and…just thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking, unable to stop retching. The other day I wasn’t careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train. In my dreams, it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world, but it all feels real. 
Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this torment…but what if when I die, I get sent to their realm, to be their plaything forever? 

It’s not just the occasional brush against my skin, the odd floor creak and the rare moment of ‘is someone calling my name?’ Now I feel them on me at all times, their rough, sharp skin cutting mine, scratching me, violating every single part of my body. Their voices scream and howl at me, maniacally taunting and laughing at my never-ending misery. Even when I shut my eyes, I still see them, their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you. 

Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts, of spirits. Yes, it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering, isn’t it? You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive; you open your mind and let them in. Don’t. What’s out there isn’t human, it isn’t some person with unfinished business, what’s out there wants you to think that, to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it. 

Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window, like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper? That creak outside your room? That faint sensation on your flesh? I hope not, because now you know what’s really there and they’ve always known about you.",Don't give them attention.,8,nosleep
Rhapsodeyus,1,,0,1rgtyq,,8,"Some may recall a story I posted a few months back, about shadow-like figures who visited me on a mission for knowledge, and afterwards, disappeared like ghosts. For those who do not recall, the story is [Curious Visitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4dv2/curious_visitors/).

If you have not read that, well, you probably haven't missed much, but it will help with the backstory for this one if you do read it.

Done reading? Good, let's continue.

This happened last night, Sunday, November 24th, 2013. I woke up at precisely 4:27 AM, and I know this because I watched my small digital alarm clock on my bedside table flip to 4:27 AM as my eyes opened. I also noticed that my lamp was off (I sleep with the light on for safety reasons, since living with cats can be hazardous). However, I could see my plain, black clock in a pale blueish light.

My brain clicked. ""My laptop is on. I must have left it on and the power went out, so it's running on battery."" Then I remembered, quite clearly, turning it off and closing it before going to bed. That's when I felt a weight at the end of my bed, sitting in front of my laptop.

I sat up, looked, and spotted a shadowy figure sitting in front of my laptop. The NoSleep submission form was up. I coughed, and said quietly, ""You could have asked."" Instead of, say, a sudden spin and a glare from Brarger, as I expected, my visitor vanished instantly.

I didn't expect that, and it startled me thoroughly. My previous visitors would never have been so rude, and certainly would have asked my permission to access my personal computer. I shifted, tossed the covers aside, and moved to the end of the bed, to read what it had written.

I now wish I hadn't.

Working in fast food is never an enjoyable experience. But by far the worst part is the smell of dirty dishwater. I’m not talking about your run-of-the-mill dishes at home.

I’m talking about 600 filthy dishes soaking together in the same water for 6 hours. It creates a smell unlike anything you can imagine unless you’ve experienced it. It smells like bacon grease, vomit and in the case of one terrible night, human flesh.

It started like any other night; rude customers, a barrage of fry and burger orders, floors to be mopped. The time dragged by with each minute feeling like an hour. It was sometime between 9:35 and 43 seconds and 9:36 and 29 seconds that I heard it. 
THUNK

I paused a second while taking an order “Hello?” said the customer in the speaker. Nothing else seemed out of the ordinary, and things resumed their familiar pace.

That is, until 10:41 when I heard a pounding coming from the walk-in freezer. I left my dish sink to investigate. And my manager, Sandra stepped in front of me. “Where do you think you’re going? Wash those dishes”. She stayed in that spot, arms crossed, unmoving.

I turned back to my dishes, glancing quickly around the corner before returning to the sink. I could swear I had seen that the outside of the freezer was blocked.

I heard the tell-tale beep of a customer entering the drive thru queue.

It was then that I realized that Kelsey, the sandwich maker was nowhere to be seen. I had been so focused on my own misery that I hadn’t noticed that Sandra had started doing both sandwiches and fries. With it being late at night, there had only been three of us there. It was at this moment that with a crash, Kelsey came racing out of the freezer, shivering and MAD. She came at Sandra, howling “you BITCH”, and tackled her. 

Sandra put her hands around Kelsey’s throat and squeezed. Choking, Kelsey backed up to the wall. She flailed, and kicked, freeing herself. She ran towards the back of the restaurant, grabbing the cordless phone. “I’m calling the police, you psycho! How could you lock me in there?!”

Sandra approached slowly, palms out. “A punishment to fit a crime.” Then she grabbed a knife and with one deft movement, pressed the blade at least 3 inches into Kelsey’s stomach. With a shocked expression, Kelsey gurgled, and fell backwards into the dish sink, her hands going limp. After a few seconds, she lay still, and red began diluting into the water. 

“It was self defense, you saw” said Sandra with a sly grin, and wide unblinking eyes. The drive thru began beeping loud in my ear as I stood motionless. Sandra retreated to the office and closed the door. My eyes flicked back and forth between the door and the water. To this day, I still hear that relentless beeping, seconds before I fall asleep.

frankthompson,2,,7,1redk6,,6,"There exists for all people a point. A point where the quantity of coincidences exceeds what one is willing to accept as coincidence. For a skeptic this point is rather high, while for the naive it might very well be one. Long have I thought of myself as a skeptic, particularly in regards to the paranormal. A scientist by trade, I never accept any evidence that is non-repeatable. Nor do I accept theories based on small numbers of events. I feel the need to preface my story with this short paragraph so that when I present my experiences you understand the viewpoint at which I approached them.

I grew up in a small house occupied by many members of my extended family. As such, rare was the moment in which I was ever alone in a room. Save time spent in the bathroom, someone was always within line of sight. College was much the same, having shared a rather small suite with three other students. Being alone was not a sensation I encountered until my late twenties, having had to live a rather spartan life upon discovering my chosen vocation left work opportunities few and far between; typically tackling this issue by living in small apartments with many other individuals.

I was 28 when I obtained my apartment. My apartment, no one else had any claim to the space. It was a two bedroom apartment, one bedroom utilized as my home office and the other for sleeping. I landed a job with the CDC, and even though the cost of living was higher than what I was used to in the Midwest the pay was more than enough for me to find adequate living space within my budget. I was ecstatic at first, but my enthusiasm rapidly dwindled.

The first nights were difficult. I often thought I was hearing noises within the walls, and after a few days I took to leaving the television on across the hall. This helped me sleep a bit, but the noises continued. Eventually I was content to drown them out with music at night.

I had lived in places with rats in the walls and old buildings that creaked many times before, but somehow this was different. These weren't the intermittent squeak of the floor nor the persistent chewing and skittering of a rat swarm. Odd rhythms with inconsistent breaks filled the nocturnal orchestra. Irregular beats; consistent sounds expressed in patterns I could not follow. The predictability of the music I played over it clashed heavily with the ever-present undersound.

Additionally, the noises seemed to get louder the more ambient noise was present. I first noted this phenomenon on a Saturday night when a rather eventful occurrence must have left the patrons at a nearby bar incredibly excited when they took to the streets at last call. I was awake finishing a manuscript when their merriment took to the streets, and rather than notice the commotion caused by the inebriated I first became aware of an inexplicable uptick in the level of sound coming from within my home. This noise was what broke me from my concentration, and only after it did so did I become aware of the people outside.

I began experimenting with the sound. Recording it, manipulating it. The volume increases linearly with the volume of other sounds, based on some rough audio analysis. I took to sleeping with ear plugs, and silencing all other sounds in my apartment such as to appease whatever is making the noises.

I presented the sound files and my analysis to a coworker in confidence after some time. I had little to fear regarding questions of my insanity, as I had taken some video footage as proof of the location and timing of the events. He was intrigued, but insisted it was most likely something mundane. My theory that some sort of creature or creatures were reacting to the ambient noise levels was rapidly rejected, and I felt rather silly. Still, something was occurring, and he offered to come help me seek out the source of the noise on the following weekend.

We grabbed dinner that Saturday evening, and he and I retired to my apartment shortly after sunset. It was a rather pleasant outing, and I was fairly certain that he was interested in me beyond what I had suspected initially. Still, though, the point of the evening was locating the source of the noise and that is what we set our minds to upon entering my apartment. Or rather, that is what we were planning on setting our minds to when we arrived. The noise was, disappointingly, absent.

He stayed for a few hours more, however, and we watched a movie. When it got rather late I saw him out, after agreeing to see him again outside of work. I did rather enjoy his company, and his presence seems to have kept the sound away. I went to sleep, rather giddy for what the future might hold between us, and slept more soundly than I had since moving. There were no sounds that night.

I kept busy on Sunday, barely setting foot into my apartment. While the previous night was pleasant, it quickly faded into memory as I went about running errands and keeping the rest of my life in order. I had more energy than I knew what to do with, and I meant to make the most of it. I was drained by the end of the day, but I had accomplished many tasks that I would otherwise have continued putting off. I dined alone, and went to bed early. Predictably the sounds returned.

The sounds remained a constant in my life for some time, and while they were present I simply put up with them. Eventually the previously mentioned coworker wound up spending the night for different reasons. I hadn't even thought of the sounds, nor had I mentioned them to him again since that first night. With him there they were again absent.

After a few more months we moved in together, him and I, living in my apartment. When my lease ended we moved to a larger place, and had been there around a year without incident. This week, however, he left for conference that, due to a few projects at work, I was unable to attend.

The noises began the night he left, three days ago. I recognized them instantly, and was unable to sleep. I immediately set up an audio recorder, as well as my laptop recording video and sound. They were louder than ever before, and clearer. I spent all of yesterday reviewing the recordings and analyzing the files from before, comparing now and then. Several aspects remained consistent between the recordings, and I am certain that they are the same noise. This time, however, I captured something different. The recorder I use for work is a new one, and seems to have picked up more of the sound than my laptop and other device. I can understand it, now.

There are voices. Alien and unsettling voices, as though someone taught a pack of cats to speak in disjointed sentences. Snippets of conversations that make no sense, frequently referring to me by name. They know who I am, they seem to be following me, and it appears that they... like me, in some twisted sort of way. The creatures want me to know I'm not alone. They don't want me to be sad, they want to make sure I know they're there, that they're watching me.

I slept in a hotel last night, to get away from them. I couldn't sleep with whatever they were nearby, and hadn't slept the night before. I couldn't sleep much last night either, though. It was almost too quiet... I had to turn the TV on before I could fall asleep. I went home this afternoon, intent on discovering more. A few samples of broken sentences was hardly enough evidence for me to base any conclusion on, and I needed to shake the feeling that I've gone crazy.

I ""borrowed"" a few more recorders from work and set them up around my home. At least one in every room. The plan was to discover where the noises were coming from, based on where the voices were loudest and clearest. They started shortly after dark, predictably. The sound files were sent to my laptop every few minutes, and I compared them on the fly. Consistently they are loudest in whichever room I'm in, or in whichever room has the highest levels of ambient noise (dishwasher and microwave created this pattern). The clarity, however, seems directly linked to my location and my location only. The longer I stay in a place, the better I can understand them. I can hear them... right now. I know what they're saying. I don't have to be alone again. I don't have to be alone... ever. I just have to let them in.

I don't want to be alone... I guess that's why I have this hammer now. I just need to let them into the house so they can be with me... so we can be together. The more I listen, the better it sounds. I can hardly remember why I even left last night, why I would ever want to be alone.

I'm going to let them in now. I need to find out what they are. If I come back, I'll post the audio and update. If I don't, well, someone will find the recordings. The recorders will be missed in rather short order. Wish me luck. At least I know someone will know what happened to me if I go missing.",Lonely,13,nosleep
thorninhisside,2,,6,1ra7n5,,7,"My eyes are heavy after a long day; my whole body cries out for sleep but no such blessing is forthcoming. I lie here in the dark, wishing for sleep. I have been like this for a number of hours. Right now, I’m desperate. I hear a noise outside the bedroom door, my dog Monty. He pushes open the door which floods my bedroom with light. He jumps on my bed and settles next to me. I lack the strength to push him away so I try and move closer to him in order to feel his warmth. I can feel his moist breath on my neck. It’s kind of soothing. I like it. He even licks my ear. This makes me smile. 
The noise of my mother opening the downstairs door that leads to the garden pulls me out of the light sleep that I fell into. I can still feel Monty next to me; his chest rising and falling with each breath.  Then I hear mother shouting ‘Come in Monty, its bedtime’. I hear something run inside, ‘Good boy Monty, here’s a treat for coming in when mummy tells you to’. The thing next to me starts lightly chewing at my earlobe. ",Monty...,13,nosleep
freezessmyblood,5,,5,1r9hka,,5,"So I am a firm believer in the natural world, and I really have never believed in ghosts or anything like that before. But lately, I really don't know what to think. I'll start from the beginning, about a year after we moved into the new house. My room is one of the biggest in the house, with a good sized walk-in closet. I have always had these fleeting thoughts about a ghost or some sort of spirit living in my house. I get that feeling that someone's watching me regularly, especially at night. My room is also very cold almost all the time, though it wasn't when we first moved in. 

Lately though, I've been noticing strange things going on with my closet. At first, I'd leave the room and find the door open when it hadn't been when I left, or I'd find the light on or off when it had originally been the opposite. I always just assumed I hadn't noticed the door being open, I just really didn't want to believe that anything was wrong. But then the closet lights started going out. I know that really isn't anything special, but every single bulb we'd put in would go out within a day. We all just thought there was something wrong with the socket for the light, so we just stopped putting them in. 

Last night, something I can't explain happened and I don't know what to make of it. I awoke early in the morning, at about 3 AM, and I stood to turn my television off. As I turned around from the tv to return to my bed, I saw that my closet light was on. I didn't think anything of it, I just walked towards it to turn the light off, when I noticed two dark shadows blocking the sliver of light under the door. I thought my brother must be in there because we share a room and I was still fairly groggy from waking up, so I slowly walked towards the door to try and whip it open to scare him. I grabbed the doorknob and flung it open. Inside was a woman, standing right up against the doorframe, and she was so pale. Her hair was limp and pure white, and she was dressed in these white clothes that hung from her loosely. As soon as I saw her I froze and we stared at each other for only a second before she screamed the most horrifying, piercing scream I'd ever heard, and the light blew out and she was gone. I slammed the door shut and ran to my bed which, unfortunately, is right next to the closet. 

I stayed there for a while until I must've fallen asleep, because I remember her staring down at me. I awoke in my dark room and there she was, standing over my bed, just staring at me. I was paralyzed with fright, and I couldn't move. She just stared, and as she began moving her face closer to mine, I finally shook the paralysis and yelled. She slid back away from me as though she was levitating and disappeared. 

I'm terrified to sleep tonight because I don't want her to visit me again. Her face is burned into my memory, it was the most unsettling thing I have ever seen. I don't know what to believe anymore",My room is haunted,10,nosleep

No one was home and they weren't expect to be there for another thirty minutes or so. I got the spare key and walked inside. The immediate sense of pooping my pants hit me as soon as I walked in the door. I ran to the restroom and my dog followed me in. I slammed the door, sat down, and felt heaven. Then I started surfing reddit. I was on this golden throne for about ten minutes when I heard the voices of my grandmother and grandfather talking to their cats. My dog's ears perked up, he stared at the door, then he started whining. I immediately assumed they had gotten home early. I walked out of the bathroom expecting to tell about my glorious victory of the gods. I was very surprised to see that no one was there. I wandered the house, checked upstairs, no one.

JUVIE_MAKER,2,,1,1rhq9j,,8,"I have a nose for things. No seriously, all my life I’ve had a very strong sense of smell and I don’t mean for the average person. I have an abnormally, freakishly, ridiculously, absurd sense of smell. It’s been that way since I was a kid. Here’s a prime example, when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother (god rest her soul) every month in Daytona Beach for the summer. My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood. I would always leave my Gran’s house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats. One Saturday, after a day of playing outside (when kids used to play outside!) I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air, but something was…..off. There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent. It was kinda tangy, bitter, sorta nutty …just all around unpleasant. Being so young, I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didn’t like it. Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate. She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgust.

Gran:  What’s the matter baby? Come sit at the table and have a slice of cake.

Five year old me: I aint eating that cake, it smells funny!

(Let me just interject for a second.  Now if your family is old school like mine, you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elder’s cooking! Especially if that elder is a family member, you just don’t do it! That is unless you want a black eye, ribs broken, missing teeth… you get the picture.)

Gran: Girl, get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of you!!

Oh geez…there’s that tone. You know it, you know it well. That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off. You know… that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives you’re delicate child-like mind nightmares for a month (or your whole life). Yeah that’s what I was hearing right about then. But still I was adamant. I would not eat that damn cake. That smell! It was just too potent. Now, you might be thinking, what’s the big deal? Surely you’ve smelled worse things than that cake before, which is very true. At that point in my life I’d smelled worse things before (WAY WORSE) but I’d never been subjected to eat those things either. Also, the stench of that pastry….it was just… so very not right. I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong, and that cake was definitely wrong! Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth. With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throat.

Gran: Come over here and take this plate now!

Okay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble. Even if my grandmother didn’t kill me, I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life! I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake. Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify. With every step she took it grew more and more intense! “Girl, you better take this cake!” she yelled holding the plate out in front of her. I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away. “No!” I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip, “I don’t want the cake, granny!!” but my pleas of desperation came to no avail. My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table, her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm. Suddenly, she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction, tilting my face towards hers. She looked down at me with an awful glare. Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Gran’s wrinkled sockets. Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before. “You will eat this cake!” She shouted through gritted teeth. “Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece!” 

I had never seen this side to my Gran before. My once sweet, devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares. My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes. I had never known terror like this. My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs. To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade! But you know what? There was something else I was more fearful of. Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devil-like grandmother, there was still something more bloodcurdling, more utterly terrifying than her…that fucking cake! 

“NO!!!!!!!” echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother. My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman. Her arms flew in the air (letting me go in the same instance) and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenly….CRACK!
The sound of my grandmother’s head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house. Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor. I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum. I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that. I bent down and looked into Gran’s half opened eyes. They weren’t black any more. They’d gone back to their normal brown again. Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all, watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red. 

To make a long story short the police were eventually called. My Gran’s weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body, and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it. Needless to say there were lots of screams. Oh, and you’re probably wondering what that smell was, right? I actually didn’t find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was. I was pouring it into my foster parent’s coffee one morning when it finally hit me…Cyanide. From the smell of it, Gran probably couldn’t have used too much either. Maybe half a teaspoon, give or take; totally undetectable to the average person’s nose…but not to mine. “So that’s what that was, go figure”.  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs. My foster parents passed away later on that day, I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really don’t.  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me? Was it because of what I’d done to Oscar, her cute little Maltese? I mean, if I’d known the oven wasn’t a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently. I was only two at the time. Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommy…that really was unfortunate. I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed. 

But anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I’m an adult now and those days are long behind me. I’m actually on my way to my boyfriend’s…excuse me….ex-boyfriend’s apartment right now. I’m visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with. And guess what? They just had a baby, isn’t that the sweetest thing.  ",A nose for things...,9,nosleep
1234FUCK,7,,3,1rhjmk,,8,"So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation, Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back. Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses. I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared. I mean that’s how I even know about this sub-reddit because I like reading it. And that’s one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation. 


	We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the 16 year old son was the one who had it happen the most. I went through every scenario I could think on the way there, Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal, one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things. Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children. The son was as I said earlier 16 and the girl was 14, they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such. I took a note about it but didn’t dwell on it that much. We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house. Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready. After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV (Point of view) cameras strapped on and started our investigation. My Uncle took the upstairs, our colleague took the first floor, And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own. 


I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walky-talky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker. He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely ( plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going.) Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen. And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness.. It answered back.
My instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were. And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be. My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly “You know who I am.” I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions. It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here. It chuckled again before I heard a small sound. Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it. My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before. I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks.  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement. I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message. My uncle did that a lot; he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible.  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob, it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime. I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open. 


I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door. The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly, even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself.  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room. I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more. I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror. It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing. I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over.  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water. My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out. I also saw a candle and a small match book and that’s when it hit me. My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head…. This was a “three kings” set up.


 I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped. My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help. After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice.. My voice whisper right into my ear. “ Do you know who I am now?” I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong. I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights. I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened. I just held out my camera to him and he took it. Before he watched it he asked me why I didn’t call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did. He looked at our colleague before watching the recording.


 After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in. I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in. and it was as I thought. It was a set up for “ The three kings.” I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was. He didn’t so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket “ and it has been used recently. The bucket was full of water. “ My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation. We went back home and I have decided to type this up. Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house.  


I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house. I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them.

deanjp92,2,,0,1re04y,,7,"When I was about 12 years old, I started making home movies with my cousin Ben and my friend Mark. My parents had bought me a new video camera for Christmas that year. We filmed a ton of crappy short films, some original stuff, but mostly spoofs of existing films, such as The Ring, Saw, and our personal favorite: Dr. Giggles. This was probably because horror films were so easy to make. All you needed was the biggest knife in the house and some ketchup packets. 

Now it was mid-October, nearly a year since I got the camera, and we were getting tired of filming at my house and in my backyard. We wanted to go somewhere exotic. So we walked around the block, where a small patch of woods stood next to the exit ramp of a highway that cut through my town. This is where we would shoot our next film, we decided. The basic plot was supposed to be “two hikers are killed by a mad man with a baseball bat.” 

When we had finished all of the planning, which wasn’t much (we didn’t write scripts), the sun was starting to set. This is what wanted. We weren’t going to shoot a scary movie in broad daylight. 

We made our way to the woods. I carried the camera, which had a light built into it, Ben carried the baseball bat/murder weapon (an oversized, bright red, plastic thing that looked like something out of a cartoon), and Mark carried three cans of tomato soup and a can opener in his backpack. 

This was the basic layout of the area: from the street of the block I live on, there was about 300 feet of grass until you got to the woods. The woods stretched for a little less than a mile, parallel to the street. The thickness of the woods varied throughout, but reached a maximum of about 200 feet. On the side of the woods opposite of the street was a small grassy ridge that made up the highway exit ramp.

When we got to the woods, we looked around for a spot where we could start the film. There seemed to be somewhat of a trail running through the middle of the woods. We decided we would walk the trail until we reached one end and start filming from there. I turned on the light of the camera, as it was completely dark at this point. We started walking. 

There was garbage everywhere. Gas station fountain drink cups, candy wrappers, old tires. The place was a dump. 

“I guess we’re not the first ones to pass through these parts,” I said jokingly, “Is this where garbage trucks dump their loads?” 

“This must be Oscar the Grouch’s summer home,” Ben said as he gestured to a small red tent we were approaching. We all burst into laughter. “Anybody home?!” Mark yelled, “It’s Burt, Ernie, and Big Bird, here for a visit!” The tent came into full view, and I shined the light in its direction.  

Suddenly we all shut up. A pair of big black boots were sticking out of the door of tent. We stopped as if paralyzed. My legs weren’t moving, and neither were the legs in the tent. I realized I was still shining the light directly on the tent and quickly pointed it at the ground. Ben whispered, “Let’s get outta here.” 

They started backing away, leaves crunching beneath their feet, but I still stood there, terrified. I don’t know why I was so scared. It was probably just some poor bum, sleeping out here in the woods. But hadn’t he heard us coming his way?

“Come on man, let’s go,” Mark quietly begged me. I finally got control of my legs. As I was backing away, curiosity got the best of me. I pointed the camera at the tent. 

No boots. 

I couldn’t breathe for a moment. Then I ran. Mark yelled at me, “What? What?!” I didn’t respond, but they ran with me. 

I didn’t know where I was leading them, I just wanted to get away from there, out of the woods, away from whoever was now roaming around, outside of his tent. I spotted a pair of headlights driving on the exit ramp and decided to head that way. We got out of the trees and caught our breath near the ramp guard rail. No more cars in sight. 

I told them what I had seen, and we agreed that we didn’t want to go back into the woods. We would walk along the ramp until we got to the street, and then walk back to my house from there. 

We were just about to leave when Ben asked me where the camera was. Shit. I must have dropped it while I was running. I wanted to just leave it, but I knew my parents would kill me if I told them I lost it. The three of us walked back down the ridge, being as quiet as we could and keeping our eyes peeled for any sign of the camera’s flashlight, which I couldn’t remember ever switching off.

We had just entered the trees when I saw a dim glow just a few feet ahead of us. I walked up to it slowly, and as I bent down to pick it up, another car slowly curved down the ramp, its headlights illuminating the area for a moment. 

In the brief second that the woods were lit up, I saw a pair of big black boots sitting just two or three feet in front of me. I almost cried. I choked on my own breath and looked up slowly, expecting to see a man attached to the boots, but there was no one. It was just a pair of boots, neatly sitting there. I was confused, but that didn’t stop me from running out of there with my friends as fast as I could, gripping the camera tightly with both hands. 

We reached the ramp, followed it to the street, and went home. Needless to say, we stuck to filming at my house from then on.

About a month later, my mom and I were driving home from my aunt’s house after Thanksgiving dinner. We got off on our usual exit. I searched the trees for a sign of the red tent, but couldn’t see it. We were stopped at the traffic light just off of the exit, when I noticed an old beggar standing on the corner asking passing cars for change. The street was full of cars, but he eventually fixed his sight on our car. I tried not to look at him, but I couldn’t help it. Finally I realized he wasn’t staring at our car. He was staring at me. I looked closer. 

Black boots. He was wearing a pair of big black boots. Before I had time to think, my window started rolling down. Quickly, I looked at my mom, who was handing me a dollar bill she had just pulled out of her purse. 

“Give this to that poor man, it’s Thanksgiving for heaven’s sake. I’ll slow down when get up to him.”

I took the dollar from her as if in a trance and looked back at the beggar. He was smiling at me with brown and yellow teeth. My heart was beating fast. I couldn’t breathe again. His eyes stayed fixed on mine. We inched toward him as the cars ahead of us slowly turned right. My mom stopped the car next to him, and I cautiously held the dollar out to him. “Happy Holidays,” he said, smiling. “Happy Holidays,” my mom replied, as I sat there speechless, his eyes never leaving mine.

Even as we drove away, I could still see him in the side mirror, standing there in his big black boots. Staring and smiling.

I swear there is something in my house I dont knw what it is, but its doing a good job of creeping me out. I have always felt this creepyness in my house. I really started noticing it when i was home alone. One day I was in my house when a LOUDD banging on the walls started. I was frightened so I went to run outside. Thats when my bedroom door slammed in my face. I opened it and proceded. I went to my laundry room. That door slammed in my face. Then on to my door connecting my garage and house. That did as well. I went into garage and outside. I was terrified and stayed outside of house until family came home. Another day i was at home alone and was hearing some bangs, by now i became used to it and wasnt as scared. I was on my laptop and was trying to translate some words into a different language. Google was taking a while to load. I didnt realize it did until i looked and my laptop was typing on its own.  The words were in some foreign language. I translated them into english. It said, "" Its a sunny day today isnt it?""  I wrote back ""No its not"". Because it wasnt it was cloudy. There was no response after that. I had a friend over for a serious of days one time and we began to notice that one of my family members always woke up at 3:30. When one of them woke up they always complained of loud noises and a weird feeling. Recently all of this seemed to go away until this week.  I can barely sleep. I wake up feeling like I am being watched. I wake up all the time. When i am home alone there are all these bangs and sounds. My dog goes ballistic. I keep my shotgun with me at all times now.

17minutes,5,,8,1r6us7,,7,"I'm... concerned.  
I was sick last night. Bedridden. It wasn't as bad as it sounds though.. I had a terrible fever, and it caused aching in all of my bones and terrible pain in my eyes and head. I wasn't sneezing though. My throat didn't hurt, my nose wasn't running, it was just the fever. I thought it was strange.  
I tried to stay optimistic, laughed it off. ""Hey, I don't have to go to class tomorrow!"" ""What if I'm going to be the first zombie? I'll have to type a story like that up for /r/nosleep.""  
Sleeping was difficult. The heat was unbearable but simultaneously, being outside of the blanket was far too cold even with my space heater on. I kept falling in and out, I'm not even sure if I got a wink of actual sleep. I'm beating around the bush.  
I woke up at 12:19. It's a curious case, I'm sure: How I recall such a vague moment in time. I'm sure the reason that number is burned into my head is because, well, it didn't change.  
I managed to force myself out of bed and grab a bite to eat, hoping a little bit of nutrition would help me feel better. Well, what's a better way to combat sickness than some leftover pizza at midnight? I grabbed the remaining pizza, threw it on a plate, and went to chuck it into the microwave. It still said 12:19, which I considered odd. I was positive that what I'd done since I woke up long extended the time period of a minute. I disregarded it, shit happens. I punched in two minutes and pressed start, but nothing happened.  
I was far too sick and far too tired to deal with a broken microwave, so I decided to just eat it cold.
I went to the living room where it was cooler and sat by the window. I love looking out the window at night. It's always so calm and serene, and no, I'm not afraid of something jumping out at me. There is a traffic signal within view from the window which always mesmerizes me. I don't know what it is, but the reds and greens stand out in the otherwise gray Massachusetts scenery.  
I had finished the pizza. I thought I'd eaten it fast, considering the light never changed. I threw my plate away and went back to my bedroom, only to see the clock staring right at me.  
12:19.  
I would think it was a weird dream. I have those a lot and they're always vivid. Dreaming vividly is sort of an ""unconscious talent"" of mine. The only thing is, when I opened the fridge in the morning, there was no pizza left.  
  
UPDATE (1 day later): I didn't have any odd experiences last night. Although I was scared to sleep in the dark due to my spending all night on nosleep, I slept well.

I've lived in my house for almost 14 years. It's a new build. It's never felt haunted or scary. It's always felt empty or normal until about two days ago. 
My fiancé and I went to bed as usual. In the morning my dog always wakes me up around 6. When I first woke I assumed my dog was the reason but no I could still feel her at my feet. When I went to open my eyes and glance down. A tall human figure outlined in gold was reaching out to me. The inside was ripple and distorted everything behind it. I slammed my eyes shut, pulled the covers over my head and rolled over to be closer to my fiancé. All I could think was please let it leave and don't touch me. Eventually, I drifted off again. My dog never woke me up that morning, which I thought was odd.

Ever since then I've felt like there's been something in my house. I could use some help figuring out what it is and if it's harmful and how I got here.

OsamaBinHiding,3,,1,1rhxdo,,6,"Last night was like every other night for me. Have dinner on my own in my small, yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV. Around 9 or 10 o'clock, I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time. The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was 12 o""clock. 

""Where did the time go?"" I thought. It had only felt like a few minutes. However, this was a normal occurrence for me. The world kind of, disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me, I can't break out of it.

I had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought ""Fuck, I better try and get some sleep"" 

See, I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city. So it isn't uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head. I wouldn't consider myself someone who doesn't get scared easily but when you're familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window - you tend to grow some thick skin.

Last night wasn't like any other night in my flat though. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was alone. My flatmate - let's call him, Evan for the sake of the story, was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but he's away a lot so I'm used to spending a long period of time on my own. My usual night routine of showering, brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something. My drawers were all pulled open. 

To most people, this is probably nothing - but for me it wasn't normal. I suffer from borderline OCD and everything, especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order. I hadn't left my flat today either. 

""I'm too tired for this shit"" I thought and went to bed. 

It's weird though isn't it? That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe, like nothing can hurt you. I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night. Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safe.

Well, not anymore for me. Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards - no biggy, right? However, as I drew closer to conscientious, I realised that these creaking sounds weren't coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bed.

And that's when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold, coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed.

TaylorBonaseraSr,0,,2,1rhb2e,,5,"I can explain why I'm so afraid of mirrors, or anything that could reflect light, even a glass door. It's so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes, but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible. She broke my mirror the first time, just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces. It was such a pain to have to clean all that up. I got at least five cuts. But she didn't care. At the very least she didn't laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster. At least she was nice enough to check herself for that. Anyway, I got my mirror replaced. She didn't break the bathroom mirror again, but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it. I don't understand how she did it, it's pressed up right against the wall. She'd have to ram her body sideways. She didn't even have any visible cuts. She told me she was sorry, and that she would try not to do it again. I believed her, and she was true to her word. But soon enough, I hear the crashing again. But this time it's my door. The majority of my glass door has been smashed through, but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo. No one lives here that has a body shaped like that. The other times I checked her she didn't have any cuts on her, but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her, but she couldn't explain what had happened. When the doctor asked, neither could I, because I hadn't been there. It's strange how selective she is; she won't smash into anything except mirrors or glass-looking things. Anywhere there isn't this kind of stuff, nothing bad happens. She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that, and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. She talks to me about it so often I feel like I'm beginning to share the feeling.

It's starting to unnerve me, and I don't want to live with her anymore. But I can't break the joint liability contract. She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection, so I did. But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks I'm not looking.

One day I'd had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room. It couldn't hurt, just for a little while when she couldn't see. She wouldn't notice. But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection, I saw her standing there. So close. She was so ugly. She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face. She followed me here, to my own room. I couldn't turn around. There was no point. I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldn't keep a straight posture. She was laughing at me.

But I'd heard that laugh somewhere before. And I'd seen that face before too. It looked so much like my own. She must have heard my thoughts, because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection. I couldn't stand the sight of her face anymore, it was so scary. It'd been such a long time since I'd spent so many minutes just staring at her. I had to take control. So I bashed the bedroom mirror in, balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skin.

It'd been so long since I'd last done that. Now every time I look, I can see her, feel her, I see her staring at her...our...reflection, through my eyes.",My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep
WillOTP,2,,1,1rc02m,,4,"My house is relatively an uneventful place. In the middle of nowhere in a Hollow in some backwoods hick town. It is a plain double wide, only here since 1994, scattered among normal homes. Dressed up to look like any other house, it is overall a lovely place to live. There is nothing noteworthy about this house until you stay a night in it. 

As my best friend has said himself, something about this home at night simply does not feel right. It feels odd. Strange. Thick air and eyes on your back. The backdoor of my kitchen is the worst, like someone is just waiting for you to turn around. Sometimes I struggle to stay alone in it, but for the most part I cope. 

That is, of course, until this morning. A late night's reading left me tired, in need of stretching, I wandered through my hallway into the kitchen. 

If you've ever been in a double wide, you'll know what I mean when I describe the layout of my home. 

My kitchen is partially open, a large walkway into the home only interrupted a wall with a pair of frosted glass windows peering in. If you walk straight, you'll come into my living room. On the left, through a short walk through the living room, is a bedroom+bath combo. On the right a spare bedroom, and another bedroom+bath combo (My room).

Sometime between 6 and 7AM I repeat a habit. I turn the TV on, turn on the living room light, and I wander my way into the kitchen. Making my way to my back door, peering out of the window at my yard and the graveyard that lies such a short distance away. I get goosebumps, as I so often do, wondering what makes me feel this sickly. Pushing it down into the pit of my stomach, I wander out of the small room into my kitchen, deciding to just go back to my room.

Walking back through the home, watching the colored laminated on the floor pass by, I look up and pause in horror.

My TV is on but I hear no sound. The colors pass by in my vision without any thought in the world. I am not focused on them.

I am focused on the massive white figure looming by my couch. I hear no noise it makes no noise. It stand tall, if you could call it standing - 6'5 perhaps. There is nothing special about it at all. I see no arms, no feet, no features.

And it was snow white. From top to bottom, there was no difference in color.

It doesn't walk. It has no feet. It wouldn't be so inaccurate to call it a white shadow, a shape similar to a person but without their details, but even more a blur.

It glides over the floor, passing through my living room to my bedroom without a sound or a movement except the position of its body. 

A few moments pass as I watch it go, and only once I hear my TV sound in my ear again do I move, running up to look in my bedroom only to find it as it was before, and nothing inside. 

Nosleep, forgive the corny title but I don't know what else to call it.

TreasureHouseofDoom,12,,75,1r7ztj,,3,"Dr Jefferies study lay before me, energy cleared and house relatively empty, but delving into other people's personal space isn't as easy for me as it may be for others.  Always, my parents have cautioned me and my siblings about the dangers of disrupting others' heirlooms, cherishables, and privacy.  I knew for instance that each of us has deep connection to those things he or she treasures, even if we are not personally aware of any sort of psychic ability and that some items carry with them certain protections.  A locket passed from mother to daughter, for instance, may have compound energies susceptible to unleash if disrespected.  Bring into this potential release of energy against an interloper a variable such as a holy relic or other spiritually imbued item and forces not easily rectified are to be expected.  But more profound than these fears of conflict beyond my control was the deep seated notion in me that all people, those among us and those just beyond, ever beyond, are entitled to their privacy, respect beyond measure, peace.  I'd done a pretty good job of jeopardizing such peace, and now it was time for me to make things right, but maybe, too, I would be able to bring more than satisfactory comfort.  Perhaps this predicament would be remedied with two little girls finding their way to Bliss.

""Whatever Bliss is."" I heard someone say over my shoulder.  Just to my left was a door that I presumed opened into the first room to the right of the hall.  Foreboding consumed my thoughts only a moment before I pushed it out of my mind and far from my heart.  Mama and Aunt Lucia would have called the voice ""Naysayer,"" and I knew far more than I needed about its powers.  

'The only power Naysayers have is anti-power,' I remembered my mother saying. 'They're the weakest link on a dark, rusted chain.  When all else fails, Naysayers speak to hinder what must be done for Good.' I must have been very young when I heard her say this, and I wasn't even sure she had said it to me.  Truth was, respect for privacy aside, I was a bit of an ease dropper by nature, and as far as I knew, she had been speaking to a friend or relative.   But the information, this reminder over time, was powerful strength to me.  I pushed the Naysayer from my mind.

There are two very important techniques to remember as one sets her mind to investigating scene and history.  First, proceed in an orderly and logical manner as often and well as possible.  Turn over every clue for deeper consideration, but remember to return every item examined to its proper place whenever feasible.  Second, follow instinct and revelation as each presents itself.  Order and Logic have their places, but in highly energized situations, short cuts sometimes arise.  Consult your inner voice in regards to each, and if that voice is true and strong in most situations, trust it now.

Having been involved in vintage house restoration through my mother's real estate dealings, I knew a thing or two about the sorts of places used as secret compartments.  Knobs on banisters, loose boards, trim and façade might function as easily concealed opening for places to hide cash or jewels, even the sorts of things others might never suspect had any value at all.  

Quick inspection of the study revealed a few components that might serve in such a fashion.  Among them were medallions at the corners of the door and window frames, along the elaborate built-in bookcases, and to the left and right of the fireplace, attached just beneath the mantle shelf. I presumed such opening would reveal a deep but narrow space.  Two doors, three windows, and an entire wall of shelving equalled 28 medallions.  There wasn't time to waste, so I decided the best method was to eyeball each for lopsidedness or failure to sit flush in place.  Any looseness might indicate wear and tear surpassing stationary use. Using the chair instrumental in bringing the ouija board to our attention to begin with as stool, I set myself to this task but came up short when I discovered each of the medallions at the windows and the doors paint sealed.  And the medallions along the shelves were all flush.  

Glad not to have wasted too much time in this pursuit, I set about removing books from shelves, five at a time, flipping through each carefully, feeling the plank of the shelf beneath and the wood behind to detect any anomaly.  This was time consuming but revealed nothing out of the ordinary.  By now I was becoming dejected and increasingly worried.  The sun lower in the sky, I saw beams of it peeking past the drapes at the center of three tall windows.  Now I pulled each to its corresponding side, let mid-afternoon light push through.  At first I only warmed myself in this, wondering why I hadn't bothered to bring more light into the room to start, but now I noticed something I hadn't before.  With my back to the door, it would have been virtually impossible to detect.    

From the outside of the study, the door was virtually mundane--heavy oak painted white, thick framework, medallions at the corners, nothing more. But from the inside, a fretwork panel of heavy design was fitted to meet the top of the door from corner to corner as if a transom window were hidden behind it.  And now, light pouring into graze the top of the desk in the center of the room hit a finely polished desk set, ricocheting to the fret work and passing through.  From behind, tiny glows of red and ember were cast against the white paint gingerbread.

Excitedly, I carried the chair across the room, stood on top of it hoping to budge the fretwork.  There was no such luck at this height.  I looked for something sturdy  to make me taller, but there wasn't anything else in here suitable for that. I'd have to grab a stool I'd seen in the kitchen earlier.  It troubled me to leave the study unattended, and I was not unafraid to travel the hall to the kitchen again.  The energy pushed from this room might have concentrated along that dark corridor, and--tired as I was--I worried that my resolve might be weaker now.   The best path, I decided, was through the front door and around the side of the house, and besides, 'I could use the fresh air,' I thought.

Opening the front door, surprise of warm air pressed against me.  For the better part of the last twenty-four hours, chill had held me in its grip, and now I basked in the warm mugginess of a typical Alabama fall day.  'Storms on the way,' someone said from the front walk, and when I looked down from my place on the porch, the broad smile of a tall man greeted me.  It didn't occur to me to wonder what he was doing here, and perhaps I already knew who he was.
'Miss Lucia, she's a fine woman, she told me you might need a few things,' and I walked to meet him with a firm, thankful handshake. His grasp was strong, and for a moment I pondered whether or not he might be just some local with a keen sense of what most couldn't see, some bright energy my aunt had detected from the other side, but his overalls and flannel shirt were old-fashioned even by farm standards, and the glow emanating from him spoke of peace and tranquility not found here on Earth.

'Name's Big Roy, Miss Julianne. And I'll help however I can. You got to know I love both those little girls.  Not one of them's an angel, but neither is they a devil.' And I was glad to find his grip strong now, if only for a moment.  He must've been a real force in life to bring such energy to me now.

""I've found a fret panel above the door in the study, Big Roy,"" I said.  ""And I need a ladder and maybe a hammer to remove it.""

Big Roy looked down for a moment, considered the peace of Heaven against the Hell of Life perhaps, then spoke.  'No, Ma'am.  What you need is a No.2 Goodell Brothers screwdriver.' Reaching into a pocket at his hip, he pulled out a relic to share with me.   'I made that fretwork for Mrs Moseley, put it up to hide a few things.' 

His dark marble eyes clouded, and he looked past the house to the back yard.  I followed the path his thoughts traveled, and suddenly we weren't in the front yard anymore.  Ahead of us stood the original kitchen, rock wall reminder of the boundaries between two converging worlds.  Within, two little girls working on some secret danced across the windows in silhouette.  The smell of fudge was heavy again, and laughter wafted, too, on convected breeze.

'That'll be Vassar Fudge,' Big Roy said.  'Never could stand the taste of it.  Mrs Moseley won't like it in the house, not since the fire.  But I swear, this place always smelled of barbecue and chocolate after that.' He shivered, tear at his eye, and I placed my left hand to his right arm, felt the sinew hard work makes, the strength of spirit hard life breeds, the exhaustion such projection brought from him. His memories were clues I could not cast away, but feeling the drain it made on his soul saddened me.

""Is this the only way, Big Roy?"" I asked sincerely, but he only smiled sadly back at me.

'Whatever it takes to bring peace, Ma'am.' Such is the nature of love and sacrifice, and now I committed the lessons Big Roy taught to memory, heart, spirit.

His pulse quickening at my fingertips, I felt the rush of energy course through me, inflate my heart.  Now was the time to prepare myself for the sort of vision that could drive some to madness, and just as I realized this, heat burst against my face like revelation of Armageddon.  Closing my eyes for only a moment, I turned now to see the pretty kitchen erupting in flames.  The shrieks of little girls trapped inside overwhelmed me, and now Big Roy ran toward the house as he had that day so many years ago, relived horrible moments, to break a window.  And there was Mary falling through to fall into his strong arms, but she reached back, scrambled to retrieve her sweet friend, the girl who might have been her sister always.  Big Roy pulled her more tightly to his chest, held her against the struggle she made, and ran from the porch, the pop and sizzle of pine planks harmonizing backdrop against the excruciating, rising melody of Sweet Dulcie's screams. 

Puddle of sweat and tears, I prayed for strength to continue as wails echoed through me.  And now I felt the whistling brush of silk against one cheek and the coarse scrape of wool against the other as two mothers ran to collect babies, only one to have her arms filled with a bundle of love ever again.  Big Roy passed Mary to her Mama's arms, and now he rushed to pull Mrs Moseley from the porch, just as the pretty gingerbreaded roof above it collapsed in spark and flame.  

Salt of sweat and tears at my lips, I wretched as the fragrances Big Roy had described--barbecue and chocolate engulfed me.

_butterflykisses,2,,7,1r2p73,,4,"There was this one time I was having trouble sleeping one night. Anxiety or something, so all I could do was toss and turn without really falling sleep. And on top of that I heard my roommate humming and singing loudly to herself from the bathroom around the corner. 

Annoyed, I turned over in my bed to get up and tell her to be quiet, only to see her in her bed fast asleep...

Darrenshan66,1,,3,1r0xps,,3,"I ran through the cornfield, I wanted to get out of there before the storm reached the field. I had just gotten into my truck when I remembered I had left the hose hooked up to the irrigator. I got out and ran, the wind was picking up and the sky was becoming dark. I had just reached the hose and was about to turn off the water when I noticed something move out of the corner of my eye. I quickly turned to look at whatever was there, but all I could see was the wind violently shaking the cornstalks. I shrugged and disconnected the hose. I was right about to return to my truck when I noticed something... The sky was now pitch black. The only things I had to light my path were the tiny flashlight on my truck keys, and the occasional lightning strike. I ran in the direction I thought my truck was in, I stopped running when I realized that thanks to the dark, I was completely lost in the field. I noticed a dark shape sticking out of the corn in front of me. I stuck out my hands and slowly walked toward it. It felt like it was made out of metal, so I turned on my flashlight to get a better view. What I saw made my blood run cold. The huge object that was buried in the dirt was my truck! It looked like it had been torn apart and thrown! ""Who the hell?"", I said, looking at the destroyed vehicle. Suddenly, I heard a voice whisper in my ear... ""Dont you mean WHAT the hell?"" 
I jumped at the sound of the voice, I turned around and shined the flashlight in the direction the voice came from but nothing was there. ""Who ARE YOU?"", I screamed ""YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?!?!"" I stood, waiting for an anwser, when the flashlight went out, then some unseen foe with tremendous strength wrenched it from my hand. I took off running into the rows of corn, the storm had picked up and I was being drenched with the now falling rain. I ran until I slammed into a wooden object in front of me. I dropped to the ground, the pain in my nose and the warm and sticky feeling in my mouth told me my nose was broken. I looked up at what I had hit, a flash of lightning revealed that I was staring at a cross. It was made out of crude wood and was held together using an old, crumbling rope. I slumped to my knees and stared at the sky, my eyes burning from the rain. ""God!!! What is doing this?!?!"" I received no reply.
I looked around wildly and shouted ""Where are you?!?? What do you want?!???"" I shuddered as a familier voice whispered back ""YOU""
Suddenly, I was picked up and thrown into the cross. It snapped as I barrled into it. I rolled into a nearby row of corn and stood up. My leg was in horrible pain. Lightning flashed again and I saw the splintered remains of the cross sticking out of my leg. I limped as fast as I could, my leg was killing me. I felt something quickly aproaching my back. I told myself ""Don't look back just keep running!"" I burst out of the field and dropped to the ground. I ran my hands along the ground and was overjoyed to feel asphalt. I stood up and limped down the road. The clouds parted above me and the moon shined down on the field. I came to an awful realization. Although I could see the corn whipping back and forth, I couldn't hear any wind. A dark, large mass burst out the the field and landed on the road. The clouds covered the moon again as the creature unfolded to show its decrepid features. It was completly covered in a black, whispy cloth that was torn and reaked of decay. It had two red glowing eyes burning in the center of its dark face. I turned and tried to run, but I dropped. The creature took massive strides toward me, It was at least eight feet tall and I noticed it wore a hood. I got up and sprinted down the road, pain ruptured from my leg but I ignored it, I ran inside a barn and locked the door. I sat on a stack of hay bails and listened. I heard silence. Then, as if it were a faint whisper, I heard my name being called outside the barn. Cameron... Cameron... I covered my ears. I saw the door fly open but nothing entered the barn. I slowly took my hands away from my ears, tears rolled down my face. I lost all control and yelled ""Why did you leave?!??!!"" All the hairs on the back of my neck stood up as something right behind me whispered ""I didn't.""",The Storm,6,nosleep
SeaDweller7,2,,2,1rhilw,,4,"I go to a regular school, its kindergarten to year twelve, so its pretty big. But, my school is an old public school, and the principle is ancient. Me? I am in year twelve, and I’m graduating next year, and my friends said I should share this story with you guys. 

Ok, where to start? Well, at my school we have a pretty serious problem with bullies, and when I say serious I mean it. One year our school was even on the news, but it was pretty traumatic. When I was in year nine, there was this little girl in fifth grade, called Melody. Her and me sort of talked sometimes, as she was a new girl and I was her school buddy (to show her around and stuff) She was a sort of short, curly brown haired, blue eyed and geeky girl. Glasses and all of that stuff, so your stereotypical nerd. Which pretty much was what she was.

After I moved up in to Tenth grade it was pretty clear that she was being bullied. Instead of gossiping or playing with the other girls, she just sort of walked around the school... bouncing a tennis ball and wandering around the grounds of the school. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Then, half way through the year, school was stopped. During lunch they lined us up and called our parents. Sent us home. They just said there was an accident. My mother and father lived in Melbourne and I lived with my uncle and aunty, and they’re pretty laid back and all ‘come home when you feel’ so I stayed at school.

I saw five year six girls with that sort of ‘we know nothing it wasn’t us we didn’t do anything’ look on their face before I saw an ambulance and a white body bag. Out of the end of the body bag stuck out locks of curly brown hair, and the always-screeching birds seemed to sing a sweet tune. A melody.

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Last week we had a substitute teacher who started screaming at a girl who was outside bouncing her ball after the end of lunch bell had rung. She didn’t realise Melody wouldn’t listen. 

No one knew why the back stairs from German were out of bounds for two months, and why the German teacher quit. No one asked why those five girls we’re stared at my Melody’s sort of... ghost.

I pieced it together. A simple push, a simple tumble. A simple death.

No one cares, all the kids just skip past her, all the laughter swallows up her silence. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

PeterTay,9,,7,1rf65v,,3,"""Don't run forward Timmy!""  I always have to tell him. He's an energetic kid but he has to pay attention. Being born with a heart disorder isn't easy. The doctor said that he can live normally without a heart transplant but we have to be alarmed all the time. Timmy is six now. My wife passed away when she was giving birth. I took good care of him since then. This morning I was drinking my coffee as always. Timmy was sitting at the table having breakfast and he was so pumped to go to school for the first time.I left some coffee in my mug and went to have a bath.i was in there for like ten minutes and when I came out  my son was already standing in the door and just made me hurry. I put my clothes on fast and opened the door for my smiling son. He was just smiling all the way. I'm much taller than him but he was always meters forward. "" Don't rush kid! "" He stopped. Turned back and looked in my eyes. The next moment he was lying on the ground. I ran to him. His heart just suddenly stopped. I Couldn't do anything. I tried to CPR but nothing .. My son's dead body was just hanging in my arms. I cried. The only one who I had left me. Timmy was dead.
At the morgue the doctors sent me home to rest. They didn't know why his heart stopped. My tears were flowing continuously on my way home. I stepped in the door, took off my jacket and put my keys on the table next to my empty mug. I wanted to sleep but I couldn't. I washed my face in the sink and as soon as I looked into that fucking mirror I cried. I lied in the bed for hours but nothing.. I just couldn't sleep. Suddenly I widely opened my eyes. My pupils shrunk. I've put my keys next to my empty mug. Slowly walked out to the table, looked into the mug. Some sugar left on the bottom. The sudden realization made me feel sick. I was about to throw up. I felt guilty.
""Don't run forward, Timmy! Wait for Daddy!"" I whispered as I walked to the drawers. I grabbed the cold metal weapon, aimed at my head and pulled the trigger. 
I woke up. opened my eyes but my son was not with me.
""The bullet didn't damage the brain's critical parts. He'll live.""
I couldn't move my arm, couldn't speak. I felt dizzy and sleepy, almost passed out.

hardupharlot,1,,4,1recln,,4,"""Medic 8, respond to the 1600 block of Norwood Road, cross streets of Fernhill and Walbrook Ave., for the report of report of a female down, covered in blood.  Await police arrival.""

That's how my Friday morning started.  7AM, and I haven't even had any coffee yet.  In hindsight, it turns out that I wouldn't need coffee.

I never liked that address.  It was a creepy looking compound.  Perhaps you want to call it a lot or a property, but it was always a compound to me.  Somewhere where bad things happened, they were just really good at keeping them inside.

We left the station, and made our way 10 minutes west.  It was on the outskirts of the city, and the sirens tore through the only road leading there.  As we pulled up, we saw a female with black hair, matted with blood and in a white gown.  She was lying face down, and we should've stayed in the medic.  We were told to wait for police, but during shift change...that could take forever.  She could be dead by then.  We strapped on gloves, threw our trauma bag over our shoulder and made our way to our patient.  The first thing that hit me was the twitching.  She was twitching her fingers and toes.  I saw the hair curled up in small concentrated spots in her hair.  It wasn't until we got closer that we realized why they were curled up; they were twisted by a drill bit.

We rolled her over, wondering what sick fuck got a hold of her, but the other side was worse.  She had been crushed, but evenly crushed.  It was as if it was done by a machine.  She was flat as a piece of three-quarter inch plywood.

Well, she was dead and there was nothing we could do about it.  ""Injuries incompatible with life"" was what our protocols stated.  That means that we didn't even have to try, because trying was futile.  We sprinted back to the medic and looked around.  Nothing.  We couldn't even see the patient.

Then it hit me.  We couldn't see the patient from the road.  There was nothing even slightly resembling a pedestrian around here, and we couldn't see her from the road.

""GET IN THE UNIT""  ""GET IN THE UNIT""  My partner was wheeling and I was healing, but my screams of concern weren't loud enough or fast enough.  He yelled, and I saw something that I'll never forget coming out of those woods.  They were everywhere, and they were surrounding us.  Their teeth were sharp, they were covered in blood, and they looked like some sort of hybrid between a little girl and a black hole.   We ran, but the only place to run was through the open gate.

We hit our little red Mayday button on our radios, which opened up the channel of our lapel mics.

""Medic 8, signal 40.  Medic 8, signal 40.""

""SIGNAL 40, SIGNAL 40!  WE ARE UNDER DIRECT PHYSICAL ASSAULT!  THIS IS NOT AN ACCIDENTAL BUTTON PRESS!""

""Medic 8, we are sending back-up.  Are you under fire, how many assailants?""

""I DON'T KNOW.  SEND HELP!""

At least Communications knows, but we were forced inside.  As we ran in, the gate closed.  This is not how I wanted to start my Friday morning.",Medic 8 (Series),8,nosleep
LadyVengeance0,2,,3,1rdv1z,,3,"I woke up, stretched my arms and got up.

It was mid-summer, already warm and sunny and the birds outside were twittering.

I don’t know why but I was in a very good mood. I took a look out of my window, a very peaceful neighborhood.

My neighbors were working in their beautifully manicured gardens. I used to greet them but around 2 weeks ago they started to give me this strange look when I walked by. It was obviously weird to them that I was trying to be nice to everyone. I’ve never been like that, but I think I finally realized that life is more than just regrets, lies and all that bad stuff that happens every day. I mean, I got a new job, after 5 years of unemployment.

I went straight to the bathroom and brushed my teeth. I caught myself humming which I normally don’t do. But whatever I did, I couldn’t miss the feeling that I forgot something and I couldn’t remember what it was.

""Man, you look awesome today."" I said to myself and I gave my reflection in the mirror a wink. Just like I said, I felt good. I went downstairs and headed to the kitchen. I decided to prepare breakfast for me and my parents, just because I felt like it.

""Good morning, everyone!"" ""Good morning, darling."" My parents sat there in front of the TV, watching their favorite show. They recently started doing that; getting up early and watch TV. I stood there in the kitchen and asked: ""Scrambled or fried?"" and they would answer ""Whatever you like, sweetie pie.""

""So what are you guys doing today? Will you just stay here and watch TV again? We should enjoy the wonderful weather as long it’s warm outside, but I’m really sorry. I think I can’t join you, guess why!""

""…""

""Well, I have a new job, as a barkeeper. I think it will be a lot of fun, but I have to hurry now before I’m too late for my first day of work. I know you don’t like this and you would rather want me to have a normal job, but I can’t change it. It’ll do it for now.""

I was really excited. I opened the door, took a deep breath and realized that Mrs. Cartridge from next door was watering her flowers. I waved to her with a big smile on my face and there again, she just responded with that distracted glance. I don’t know what this neighbourhood was up to, but I could tell it was no good. They didn’t even like me from the start. As soon as we moved into this house, you could tell that these people didn’t want you to stay.

I still can remember this one Halloween. I think I was about 12 years old and I’ve always been a big fan of horror movies. My parents wouldn’t let me watch them, but I did it secretly when they were asleep. So I wanted the best costume ever: I only wished for a hockey mask and something similar to a machete. I wanted to look like Jason from the horror movies. My parents weren’t really happy about it, but it was Halloween, so what? I really enjoyed scaring the other kids, even the older ones. There was just one problem about it; for one kid this wasn’t as amusing as it was to me. He was so scared that he literally pissed his pants and of course he told his father about the incident. He rang at our house and told my parents that they would regret buying me such a costume, they should better take care of me and my strange hobbies and that I wasn’t even close to normal. What a stupid thing to say when you don’t even know me. 

Guess what he did the Halloween after. He grabbed me, threw me in his car and drove to the nearest lake. It was at the end of October and damn cold outside. He ripped my clothes apart and I really tried to fight back but this man was about 6.5 feet tall and very muscular. He forcefully put my head in the water. I thought I would die; that he would drown me in that damn lake. But he dragged me up again and asked me: 'Who is scared now, huh?' and then he would continue this over and over again. He left me there, naked, freezing, gasping,… but I felt nothing. I was empty. I went back home, all the kids were laughing at me, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to get home and get some rest. I never told my parents about what happened that day, but I could tell that this was just the beginning of it all.

My relationship to my parents was never that good. We argued a lot, we insulted each other… They really pissed me off sometimes.

""Go and get a job already!"" ""Stop sitting around like a lazy bugger."" ""I wish I’d have never been pregnant with you.""

Harsh tones, rough times, but in the meantime I started to understand their worries and doubts. Maybe that’s why our relation was getting better now every day. I got up off my ass and did something. I looked for a job, I’m cleaning the dishes from time to time, because my mom started to rebel and stopped doing anything in the household. That’s also the reason why it started to smell so bad in the kitchen. I now was a busy man; I couldn’t clean the house all day long. I had better things to do. I don’t even know if my parents liked what I was cooking for them. They didn’t eat at all, sometimes they only tried one fork saying to me 'You did a great job, honey, but we aren’t hungry.' I know that my cookeries weren’t the best and they just wanted to be polite and nice. So I had to throw away almost all of the food. The leftovers started to moulder and oozed a disgusting smell. I’m a messy person; I don’t really give a shit if my room looks untidy or the dishes are dirty.

My first day at work was really exciting. I’ve worked as a barkeeper a few years ago. I was still good at mixing drinks and serving them. I really enjoyed the atmosphere in that bar. It smelled like old wood and some of the lights were broken and therefore it was quite dark in there. Most people who came in here were at least 50 years old. The few women that found their way in here were prostitutes, looking for a cheap jag. I envied them so much; you earn money having sex with other people. And they made good money out of it. You can judge me, but I have my own opinion about that topic. If I was a girl, I would do exactly the same.

""So, and you’re the new barkeeper here? What a hell of a man you are, such a lovely face. You shouldn’t even be here, darling"", one of the prostitutes hit on me. ""But I really like it in here. Dreary places always attracted me. And on top of that, I got to know you, my dear lady."" ""My name’s Adora. Pleased to meet you. So, what’s your poison?"" 

We really enjoyed each other’s presence and talked a lot; about her job, about her family in Texas, etc. She asked me to come with her after my shift had finished. One thing led to another and we ended up in her bedroom. I waited ‘til she fell asleep and sneaked out of her apartment. I rather sleep in my own bed than somewhere else. I was hoping that my parents were already sleeping, but when I got home I saw them sitting in front of the TV. It was 4am in the morning, did they seriously stay awake ‘til I got home? Just to shellac me?

""I’m sorry that I’m so late… I hope you’re not-"" ""It’s okay, honey. Don’t worry."" I felt relieved. I ran straight upstairs into my room and lay down on my bed with a big smile on my face. My life couldn’t be any better.

I woke up, stretched my arms, yawned and took a look out of the window. It was raining, but still warm outside. I strolled into the bathroom and brushed my teeth. I recalled what happened yesterday and a smile lighted up my face. Having finished brushing my teeth I headed downstairs to prepare some breakfast. I greeted my parents delightfully and decided to make some pancakes. The only problem with that was that all the clean dishes and pans were gone and so I had to scrape the mouldering leftovers off of them. I know that’s not really how you should do that, but I had to hurry, otherwise I’d have been late for work.

""I hope you don’t mind that I used the dirty dishes to serve the pancakes on. I’ve got an idea. Maybe we should go out for a ride tomorrow; you both haven’t left the house in weeks now. Dad, I know you hate your boss, but maybe you should consider going back to work next week.""

So, what’s the plan? Maybe we should drive to the lake and go fishing. That’s a good idea. It’s been years since Dad and I were going on a fishing trip together. I went to work and there again in the right corner sat Adora with her two friends.

""You nasty boy sneaked out of my bed last night. I thought we had a lot of fun."" ""We did. I just wasn’t comfortable sleeping in another bed than mine. I hope you’re not angry with me."" ""No, it’s okay, cutie. Do you have plans for tomorrow? Maybe we could stay all day long in my bed and do – you know – dirty stuff."" ""I’m sorry, but I promised my parents that we’re going to the lake for a few hours, but maybe you could join us! That would be great."" ""I don’t really know, honey. I’m not that kind of person you should introduce to your parents."" ""Don’t be silly. We’re just chilling at the lake for two hours and afterwards we can do whatever you want.' 'Well then, if it’s just for two hours, I’m okay with that.""

I was excited like a little kid on Christmas Eve. I helped my parents to get in the car. Adora said she would wait at the lake, so that my parents didn’t get to know where she lived because it was some kind of embarrassing for her showing her poverty. When we got there, Adora approached the car, opened the passenger door and bursted out with a high pitched scream.

""What the fuck is wrong?"" I asked her. ""Oh…my…god…"" With tears in her eyes she ran off. What the hell was that? I don’t know that freaked her out that much. ""I’m sorry guys… I really thought she was something special."" ""It’s okay, honey. Don’t be sad. For everything there’s a season. Maybe she wasn’t the right one for you."" ""Thank you, Mom…Dad. I love you."" ""We love you, too, son."" 'Maybe we should go home for today. I’m not really in the mood for fishing right now.""

I drove back to our house and now there was Mrs. Cartridge again. She was cutting her rose bed. When I opened the door to help my parents getting out of the car, she dropped her garden shears and clasped her hands over her mouth. She looked like she saw a ghost. People these days… just annoying.

We were sitting in front of the TV and watched one of my favorite shows. I felt comfortable spending time with my beloved parents. I can’t remember the last time we just sat there without arguing; being a family again. Suddenly, I noticed piercing sounds of sirens from outside. Police cars stopped by near our house. What happened? Was Mrs. Cartridge in danger? What if something happened to her? I would never forgive myself. I could have helped her.

""This is the police! Open up!"" They pounded wildly against our front door. What the hell was going on? ""Open the damn door! Otherwise we’re coming in!""

What? No. I gave in and opened the door just to check out what the hell they wanted from us. They bursted into our hallway and pushed me aside. All of them were armed. There were about 3 or 4 police cars parking in front of our house. What the hell was going on? Did Mrs. Cartridge call the police? Why? One of the police officers went into the living room and yelled:

""Oh my fucking god… guys… two dead people in the living room. Man, that’s fucking disgusting."" The police officer came back and gave me a disguised look.

'""You crazy motherfucker. Get him the handcuffs on. He might be dangerous."" ""What? No. I’m not dangerous. I was just sitting there with my parents watching TV. This is not a crime!"" ""'You have the right to remain silent when questioned. Anything you say or do may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right…""

All I heard were the sirens and all I saw where the lights everywhere. I felt like I was in a movie, that this wasn’t real. They can’t arrest me. I’ve not committed any crime.

""Estimated time of death: 3 weeks ago. That’s why the neighbors complained about the smell. The cause of death is currently unknown, but what we can say is that they died an unnatural death.""

I just wanted to have a normal family, without any rhubarb. I’ve never loved my parents that much as I did the last 3 weeks. It was so calm and peaceful…
",Just an ordinary day,6,nosleep
Lnzy1,2,,1,1rdoii,,6,"My Grandmother made porcelain dolls, filling her golden years and every inch of available shelf space in the modest desert home she shared with my Grandfather with small breakable people. They were all dressed in elaborate frills and lace, hand crafted bonnets and daintily painted faces. They never scared me as a child as you would think a house full of unmoving glass eyes would. Instead, they compelled me to play and to dream. For my fifth birthday, Grandma gifted me with a pair dolls I named Lilly and Lanis. They were twin baby dolls dressed in bright pink and blue corduroy overalls. I took them everywhere and they filled me with the assurance that I would be a fantastic mother. One day as I helped Grandma clean out her shed, I knocked over a piece of wood that smacked int the wall. A panel of the wall popped off the nails holding it in place and tumbled to the ground with a clatter. Through the dust tinted air, I spotted a large metal tin inside. I instinctively went to reach for the item when my Grandmother slapped my hand away and quickly replacing the misplaced board, securing in place with a heavy tool box. 

“Leave it be,” she told me sternly. The next morning as we readied to leave and return home, I slipped away and back to the shed. With some effort, I was able to push away the tool box and the board fell away with a sweep of my hand. I quickly pulled the tin box out and opened it, an unbridled urge to know pulling at me. 

It was a doll. 

Its dress was of a deep maroon lined with soft black velvet, ready for the deepest of winters. Its face, white and pale as any porcelain, was in fact made of wood. Her eyes had been covered with a red ribbon. Before I could examine the doll further, the sound of my mother's voice jolted me back to reality and I hastily shoved the doll my bag. When I got home, I sat on my bed with the doll, pulling my fingers through the wiry black curls. The red ribbon was tied with an impossible knot so I went to the kitchen and fetched a pair of scissors. Stripping off the ribbon, I beheld the deep amber eyes of the wooden doll for the first time...

...and I felt a twinge of unease. 

It was only after seeing the dolls face in its entirety that I realized...how wrong it looked. The eyes seemed to focus straight at me with unnerving intensity, not the vague dead gaze of Grandma's other dolls. The eyebrows were painted a tad too narrow,and the sides of its mouth drooped ever so slightly. The doll looked...angry. I put the doll back into my bag and set it aside. 

A few nights later we received an abrupt call in the middle of the night. Grandma has passed away suddenly of a heart attack. While I changed my clothes, I looked up and noticed the items my dresser had been disturbed. My pink bejeweled box of assorted costume jewelry and nick knacks had been pushed aside and in their place sat the wooden doll. I stared at it for a moment, trying to think back to when I had placed it there. My mind was a jumble with thoughts of my now dead Grandmother and windowed Grandfather. The doll was insignificant. So it was only later after I had returned from a long day of mutual grieving with relatives that I notice the expression on the dolls face did not appear as severe as I remembered it when I first beheld it. I chalked it up to being my own imagination and let the thought escape my mind.

A few days after the funeral, I came home from school to find Lilly and Linus, the dolls Grandma had made for me, broken on the floor and in pieces. Their brightly colored overall slashed. I wailed at the sight of them and tried to put the shattered faces back together, tears of anguish at finally having a real sense of my loss. It was not just the dolls themselves, but the glow of warmth from my Grandmother's touch seemed to have left them. She was not coming back. And I cried. Above me, I did not notice the vague smile on the wooden doll's lips. 

I cried myself to sleep that night. It was windy and the loss of my dolls had left me in little mood for food or entertainment. I cuddled up with my well worn Little Mermaid blanket and eased into a dark nothingness without dreams. I awoke abruptly during a particular powerful current of wind as it pushed the tree branches into my window. I sat bleary eyed in the dark for a moment when I heard a soft sound of what sounded like foot falls. They were soft and rapid, seeming to come from under my bed. I assumed it was my kitten, Gizmo. So I laid my head back onto my pillow and waited for sleep to return. A clatter startled me back to alertness only a moment later and I looked around my room. One of the doors to my closet, which always remained closed (because monsters, you know) was open a small crack. Immediately my little brain began to race with thoughts of monsters with teeth and long claws and wide black eyes. Almost as if to answer my thoughts, there came another clatter from the closet. I jumped out of bed, grabbing the nearest piece of armament available to me: a plastic princess light up wand. I held it close to me as I approached the closet. As I drew nearer, I heard a most discerning noise as the closet door began to creek open. 

A giggle.

I ran toward the door, slammed it closed with all my might, and rammed the princess wand between the handles of the closet doors just as they began to shake violently. I pulled away and bolted out my door and down the hall to my parents room. I slammed their door closed, locked it, and swan dived into the warm confines of their down comforter. While far from happy with me, they did not throw me out. 

The next morning, my Dad asked me what had scared me.

“There's a monster in my closet,” I told him. He smiled patiently at me and got up to dress for the day. He looked at the door and shook his head, unlocking it and stepping out into the hall and paused, looking down. After a moment, he looked back at me with tired eyes and asked, “Did you forget your toys?”

Confused, I looked over the edge of the mattress down to the floor where my father stood. Just in front of the doorway to my parents room were the shattered plastic pieces of my princess wand...laying at the feet of the wooden doll with her mouth stretched into a wide grin.

LadyCorvus,0,,1,1rcaqz,,5,"She’d always been the one with the smirk, biting commentary, and quick wit. She’d been called a verbal sniper by her closest enemies, for her tongue was double-edged and if there was a compliment, a tongue-lashing was never far behind. But here… o, here… here it was if she’d been struck dumb, her mind numb and tongue leaden, all that was left to her was the steady, forlorn moan that seemed to resonate; emanate from the very core of her being.


Having no idea of where she was… well an echo in the back of her mind gave her one that she pushed at, tried to reject though it kept at her, nagging like a small wound that would not heal. The idea finally escaped the confines of her will as her morale flagged, though it refused to be defeated just yet. 


This place was of no earthly plane, the landscape … surreal and terrifying. The cold, reasoning bit of her mind that fought to make sense of what she saw, and to remember what had happened up to this point; had brought her to this one conclusion, told her something she could not, would not accept. 

Rising from the ground where she sat… had landed?...she made herself walk, it had always helped her think things through in the past and she clung to the familiar in this unfamiliar place. Shrieks and inhuman laughter filled her ears, sulfur and ash clung to the inside of her nose, mouth, and throat. She wondered idly why she did not cough at the abrasive air even as she wrinkled her nose at the smell that was reminiscent of all she’d been told of Hades or a post-apocalyptic event. 

The trees here were bare, smoldering, though oddly still standing; branches reaching out from side to side like angels that had somehow become dracoliches with outspread skeletal wings. She repressed the small shudder as she passed under them, heading towards the sound of water with a growing thirst that would not be long denied. It was with no small relief that she neared the water. Sinking to her knees gratefully to partake and clean her face, she stared at the surface; it was covered in a dark crimson ash, unlike any she’d ever seen before. 
   

Trepidation filled her as she tried to lightly skim this from the surface, hoping the water to be potable underneath it. It was when she saw her reflection and what it was reflected in that she knew she was truly defeated this time; that this whole thing was out of her ken or else she was out of her mind. For what she saw upon her cheek, reflected in the viscous, mercury coloured water resembled a barcode that had been seemingly branded there. It read May 4, 2099 # 6498-066.


“What in the hell?” 


She jumped at the voice before realizing it as her own, albeit harsh, torn, and ragged sounding. Gone were the dulcet feminine tones she’d cajoled, taunted, and teased with. As she fell back from the water; this bloody excuse for water, the realization hit her hard. With growing horror she scrambled back from the bank, sobbing out a prayer in a voice as broken as her faith.

Dylando,2,,0,1rbgs5,,3,"Connecticut is a beautiful area. You can live a peaceful life out near the woods, or live in a somewhat busy city, both walking distances away, and both having perks. Out in the forest, you have neighbors, but they will almost never bother you. In the more busy areas, however, you can find whatever store you need in a matter of minutes. As for myself, I've always been fond of quiet neighborhoods. I love the fact that I don't need to be bothered by noises or people wherever I go. You can actually be in silence, just you and your thoughts.

Growing up where I used to be, however, proved to be unnerving. Most of the time, I could wake up in the night, and just be. There was no need to be doing anything, and there was less of a need to be hearing anything. One night seemed to be quite the opposite.

I woke up at a point around midnight, and listened to the silence of the night, and I liked to do. I usually fall asleep no problem after that, but I had trouble, almost as if something was outside, waiting. Then I heard it. I was quiet at the start, coming out from our living room, down to our ling hallway, where the bedrooms lay. What I had heard was the click of high heels on stone, excruciatingly slowly, coming down the hall. After a minute of this, the clicking stopped altogether, *right outside my doorway*. My scared self, knowing my door was open, clicked on the small light next to my bedside, and I calmed down. It had seemed to be the house settling, as I could only see the wall outside my room, and the shadows emitted from the light in my room.

As the years passed, my family had moved out of that house, and began to rent it out to people. Since we only moved up to the end of the road, we decided to keep our garbage barrels at that house, so that we had no reason to trudge up and down a hill to move our barrels weekly. During these passing years as well, I had suppressed this memory of the clicking, and other minor occurrences that happened during our stay at that house.

Two years ago, The usual routine happened. I would be the one to bring down any garbage bags down to the barrel, and walk back up. Normally, I'd do this after dinner, and it would still be light out, but because light is limited in November, it had quickly became dark at only 6:30. This day was no different, so I casually walked down our road, garbage bad in hand, to our old house. Before getting to the barrels, though, I stopped dead in my tracks. Something just seemed off about tonight, even though, just like every other night, everything was quiet. But this quiet wasn't one that seemed to be peaceful, but more of a deafening silence, as though some force is compelling everything to stay quiet. This fear quickly vanished, as I saw how silly I was. *Everything was fine*, I assured myself. Walking passed a porch light near my neighbor's house, I saw my fine, slender shadow dart across the ground and lay the end in the empty parking space for cars at this rented house. As I walked to the barrels that lay at the side of the house, I was greeted by the sound of clicking high heels on pavement, and the motion sensor light go off at the parking spaces. As I tilted my head up to say hello to the renter, I had realized that there were no cars in the parking space, meaning that the woman renting the house was out for the night. I had also came to realize that the shadow that was mine had tripped the sensor, and that the shadow coming from me did not belong to me.",Shadows,3,nosleep
InsaneFang,0,,7,1rbeal,,5,"It was any other normal day for him, walking home after school. Billy was old enough, his parents thought, to walk home alone, he knew not to trust strangers and all that. He walked along thinking about his friend hadn't been at school, and he was a little worried, he never missed one day. 

He was walking when he walked into a lady, she had things scattered across the ground, he knew he should help her pick the items up. He picked up the last of the items across the ground, and he looked up and got a good look at this woman. 

She was in her mid-forties or early fifties, she had black hair, was white, brown eyes, and her face was a little wrinkled. He didn't even realize what he picked up, when he handed it to her. It was a knife covered in what looked like fresh blood, when he saw that, he started to back away. 

She smiled, and said ""Now don't run dear, you'll only make it harder on yourself.""

He opened his mouth to scream, but no sound escaped. He turned and started running down the street, trying to escape the woman with the blood stained knife. He ran forward, never looking back, and he finally saw a house, and he ran up to the door, and found that it opened. Grateful to this, he bolted inside, and closed the door. 

He peeked out the window to see if she was following still, he noticed she had slowed down, and was laughing. ""Hopefully she's just a crazy old woman who likes to scare kids for a laugh..."" He panted quietly.

""I don't chase kids for a laugh."" He heard beside him. 

He looked up and there stood the woman, he opened his mouth to scream, but she quickly covered it. ""Now, now, dear, be quiet, it'll be easier."" He tried to shake her hand off his mouth, but she only clasped it harder around his mouth. ""I said to be quiet, dear."" 

He looked up at her, terrified, what was she going to do? She smiled and said ""There we go, my dear."" 

He closed his eyes, hoping, just maybe this was all a horrible dream. Please, please, oh please let this be a horrible nightmare...I don't want to die! Oh how he wanted to speak aloud, but that was not wise in this situation. 

She said ""Now I'm going to feed you some of my special soup. I never get any visitors often to share it with."" Now he was beyond confused, crazy woman with knife, who chased kids, was offering him soup?

She steered him to a table, and sat him down, she sat a bowl of steaming liquid with chunks of meat in his face. It smelled like chicken, but it had an odd smell that lingered in the chicken like smell. He made a face, and said ""I think I should go home, my mamma is probably worried about me, ma'am."" 

""Not till you get soup of my fine soup in your system.""  She replied

""My mamma told me not to accept things from strangers."" he said, getting up.

""Well then, my name is Linda. Now what's yours?"" 

""I ain't allowed to tell strangers anything about me, ma'am."" he said

""All you have to say is your first name.""

""I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't."" 

""Come on, please?""

He looked so nervous, and he finally said ""It's Billy, ma'am..."" 

""Well isn't that a nice name, Billy, well now that I know your name, and you know mine, we aren't strangers anymore.""

""I'm sorry, ma'am, I don't think it works like that. I'm sorry, but I really have to go."" 

""At least eat one spoonful of my soup...just one please, I never had anyone try my soup and be able to tell me if it tastes good.""

""Well I guess one bite wouldn't hurt anyone."" 

He went over to the bowl, and got himself a spoonful, the broth was a reddish color, the meat was dark like that of chicken or turkey. He put the spoon past his nose, and the smell that was lingering with the chicken like smell hit full force, and it was so putrid, he almost wanted to gag. But he had to be nice to this lady.

He forced the spoon into his mouth, the meat tasted like none he'd ever had. It didn't taste like chicken, or anything else. It had an odd salty taste with a metallic taste to it, kind of like blood... Wait, that knife! He tried to spit the soup out, but she forced his mouth shut, and said ""Now swallow, dear."" 

She forced him to swallow the broth, and he felt his eyes grow heavy, she put something in th...

Hours later, he woke up, the bed not his own, and the room was different. Please tell me I'm dreaming, where am I anyway? She came in, and the memory hit him. He tried to get up, but he was strapped to the bed. He tried to scream, but there was something knotted in his mouth, like a rag. 

""Well I've never had anyone to talk to, but I've always wanted someone to tell my secrets to, you know? Be able to be understood, and all that."" She sighs 

He couldn't talk, so he just laid there staring at her, silently pleading for her to let him go.

""You know that soup, I put special ingredients in that there soup. It has my special red broth, with my special meat. I have to get it in a different way than any other meat. You'll see how I do that later...or actually maybe very soon.""

He tried to fight against the ropes holding him down, but she merely chuckled softly. 

""Don't fight, dear, I just want to talk to someone. Now where was I, ah yes. During my days, I must have this special food ten times a day, it's so addictive. But with my running around to get it, I can stay thin, and not be fat like those lazy people who eat all day and night, and never move. Shame, such waste of ... oh never mind that.""

He felt like crying, and he felt salty tears start to form in his eyes. 

""Oh don't cry, you'll go home soon, well...to the home most of us are promised in the end, you'll have a new body..."" She sighed as if remembering something joyful. 

She lightly patted his knee, ""Well, I really can't say much else about what I do, it's time I show you."" She untied him from the bed, and said ""I shall lead you to your new living quarters."" She led him through the kitchen and into a dark room.

The smell inside was putrid, he wanted to gag, but the rag in his mouth kept him from doing so. The lights in the room turned on, and he saw the most gruesome sight. He finally opened his mouth, and screamed, though his attempts were muffled by the rag. 

The room was covered in dried red, there was meat hanging up, the freezer cool enough to keep it fresh like all other big freezers with meat in them. But this wasn't ordinary meat...it was..

He didn't finish his thought, because he felt a stabbing pain, and he fell down, and felt the world go black.

She later came into the freezer, grabbed one of the hanging meats, and went to the kitchen, and started to cut it up, and prepare some soup, while in the freezer, there was Billy's blood blending with the other dried blood, and there he hung, lifeless...like the others, the other dead kids...
",The Best Meat,12,nosleep
kailey16,0,,7,1r8ylh,,2,"So, about a year and a half ago my family moved into an old farm house that was built near the end of the 1800's. My whole family absolutely hated it there but I was oddly drawn to it and loved it, I have no idea why. 

On the first night we stayed there my best friend stayed the night with me, because the first night is always creepy no matter what. Now, supernatural things were drawn to my best friend. She could sense them and they always came to her. Once she stepped foot in that house she wanted to leave. But of course she refrained from telling me until after I moved out. She also didn't tell me about what happened while I was asleep. 

Before we went to bed, we decided to watch a movie. Then we just left it on the main menu and went to bed. I guess around 3:00 AM, she woke up to a bang in my room. From where, she couldn't exactly tell. But it was definitely my room. Then the tv went out to that gray and black fuzz and really loud for about 30 seconds, then went back to the main menu. She said she was shaking from fear. She refused to come over anytime I invited her after that.

Again, she didn't tell me about any feelings or anything until after I moved out.

I've always been interested with the supernatural, but nothing of the sort is drawn to me. I'm kind of happy about that, kind of sad. But I must've been the most interesting for whatever was in that house because it was drawn to me and it made it clear.

This house had two bedrooms upstairs, two bedrooms downstairs. It also had a living room that was recently built onto it so it had separate air condition and furnace.

It was mid-winter and the furnace on the original part of the house wouldn't work. At all. We got it checked out probably 4 or 5 times and they couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. 

My sister and I had the rooms upstairs but she couldn't handle the cold so she ended up sleeping in the living room with the separate furnace, so I was alone on that floor. 

Around the second week we were there, I was getting into bed with my 4 blankets and multiple pants and sweatshirts because of how freezing it was when suddenly I heard a huge BANG on my door. This freaked me out so I just grabbed my bible and prayed for whatever it was to go away until I felt better. Then it started happening every single night when I got into bed. Eventually it didn't bother me. Like whatever was out there was just wishing me goodnight or something.

In my room, I had a guitar and keyboard. One night, around 2:30 I woke up to the sound my guitar strumming. Assuming it had fallen over, I got up to pick it up then when I got there it was still exactly where I left it. Confused and a little freaked out, I just decided to go back to bed. Then, the next night I woke up to light. I sat up and saw my keyboard lighting up like it was being played. Then I got even more freaked out.

The bangs along with this demon ghost thing playing with my instruments happened almost every night.

During the four months I lived in the house, I went into a depression. Which is really only weird because I never have before or after. I didn't do anything, I slept all day, I didn't eat, I was mean to everyone, I really hated myself, and I contemplated suicide. Also, I had a migraine. Not multiple migraines. A migraine that literally never went away the entire time I lived there. I tried multiple different prescribed medicines and all of them just made it worse.

The weird thing is practically the day I moved out, it all stopped. I wasn't depressed anymore. My migraine went away. I was just happy again.

After realizing the coincidence, I looked up some stuff knowing that there was something in that house. Depression can be form of possession. Not as bad as all the stuff you see in movies with them becoming demons and doing back bends and crap. But I'm positive that whatever was in there attached itself to me. And by the way it made me feel, it seems like it wanted me to hurt myself. 

This story might not send chills down your spin like some others do, but I can't even think about it without being terrified. 

And the weird part is I have to pass that house everyday, and I'm still drawn to it. It feels like home. ",It feels like home,9,nosleep
aricat2000,3,,6,1r83z4,,2,"     I'm not going to say my house is old, because it's not. It's only 15 years old, so there is no reason to be hearing thuds coming from my ceiling downstairs. I understand that in a basement, you're going to hear the footsteps of anyone upstairs. But this noise is only around when I'm the only one home. My pets come downstairs with me whenever I go down there. 
     It started about a week or so ago. It just being a single, soft footfall. Everyday, it doubled and got louder. My pets huddle around me when the noise starts, scared of whatever is causing the noise. When it starts up, it's a soft footfall like it was when it first started then it gets louder and becomes two footsteps. It gets louder and faster as it approaches the stairs. Imagine someone speed-stomping all over your upper floor. It's pretty creepy. 
     I heard it come down the first step today. I sat here at my computer, frozen. I don't know what it wants, but I'm scared for the safety of my pets. My parents don't believe me and the thing is never out when someone else other than me is home.

xDrAlpakax,0,,6,1r3mwk,,3,"If it were any other day I would've just walked by, completely unaware and uncaring of what would happen if I approached this, what I percieved as a man. The simple chain of events that occured that day were miniscule and unnoticeable to the naked eye, but differentiated the outcome of my life. If you can call this life, it's a prison. My personal holocaust. Hell. Whatever you call it can not be descriptive enough to effectively describe the torture inflicted every day.
Let me start by saying I was just a normal kid from the suburbs. Imagine a white kid and you had me. 15 years old, 139 pounds, 5""9, need I get more descriptive? I was unnoticeable from the crowd of what seems like millions of other identities that were more important, more athletic, and more human. Not that I'm some alien in disguise, that's not what this story is about. Im just saying that.. well I didn't play nice with others. I'd always get into fights at school and in trouble at home. But I had a single core group of friends that I could rely on: Andy, Sam, and Marcus. 
That just happens to be where the real story begins, when all of us planned a trip up to a cemetery a few miles up the road from my house that had an infamous reputation around my neighborhood. Legend had it that there were a few unmarked graves placed in rediculous formations that no one could identify. No one knew if they were human corpses or not. So I guess thats why we were going up there, to solve the mystery; solve the puzzle. Why and what were these graves? When did they get there? 
We left on Friday evening and started walking north to the graveyard. The walk there involved the normal teenager conversations you'd expect from a couple of rejected kids with no one else to talk to. No weird signs, chills, premonitions, nothing. Just like we were walking to school. Completely normal. Normal... tell me again what that is? I havent caught a glimpse of normal in years. Help me..
We were nearly there and, of course, Andy has to stop to piss. Like we didnt just leave the house an hour ago. Why couldnt you hold it.. damn it Andy there was probably a public bathroom near the cemetery, we were ALMOST THERE. As he walked to the woods, the rest of us realized that we could see the cemetery from where we were, so we yelled at him and told him to catch up to us when he was done. As we approached the gates, some ravens flew away. Actually, they didn't fly away, necessarily. They flew towards us like we weren't as dangerous as what lied ahead of us. Of course, none of us thought anything of it, they were just startled birds right? Maybe they were, I don't know anymore. For all I know we all imagined it. An illusion created by some other being, form, your guess is as good as mine. 
We entered the cemetery and walked through the aisles, internally mourning for their familys' losses. Not that we knew the people six feet deep or anything but it was weird, its like I was dealing with the deal of a family member or close friend; they werent my emotions to bear but they were given to me regardless. After we seperately collected ourselves, we made our way the the main attraction, per say.  It was a giant stone monument in the middle of the open area we were stading in. It was an angel that was kneeling over a grave, and quite honestly it was creepy.  We walked up to it and inspected it. It's faded color, rain stained tears on its face, and sheer size were intimidating to say the least, but we set up our stuff in front of it because there were no other places to stay. 
After we got done, we decided to look for the unmarked graves we walked all this way for. We went left first and planned on walking counter clockwisr around the entire place until we found it. Left. Why left.. every choice was the wrong choice.. why not right.. 
We started walking past countless graves, and once we were walking for a good 5 minutes and couldnt find anything, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked at Sam and Marcus and they had the same ghostly shocked face as I did. They both felt it too. We all whipped around to find a man in normal black clothing: jeans, a black t-shirt and jacket, and a black hat. We came to the conclusion that he was an undertaker or groundskeeper or something, and we calmed down a bit.
""What do you kids think you're doing?"" said the man.
Sam replied, ""I.. err, we apologize sir. We were just looking around to find some weird stuff I guess.""
""Well you shouldn't be here, you're not safe at night. No one is."" 
""I think we'll be fine, there's just a bunch of dead people. What's the worst that could happen?"" Sam said
""You're looking for the unmarked graves aren't you?""
I said, ""How did you know?""
""Follow me.""
We all thought this guy was weird, but weird at most. He was scrawny and greasy. Not the kind of person you would normally carry a conversation on with. But we were all curious and had no idea where we were going. At that point something came to my mind; where's Andy? I told the man that we had to wait for my friend, but he said that he found him earlier and he was taking us to him so we can regroup. We hadn't seen him walk back in.. but we followed nonetheless.  
He led us to a secluded spot in the woods where we couldn't see the rest of the graves, where I surprisingly saw Andy standing unharmed, it seemed. As we approached him he murmured something which was undecypherable from the distance we were. We stepped closer, sensing a disturbance as if we were being pushed back mentally, but physically we were moving forward like a magnet. We got closer and closer and realized that his feet weren't... feet anymore. They were what can only be described as roots, binding him to the earth and not letting go. His eyes had turned to complete blackness, reflecting the darkness that now described his soul. 
There was nothing we could do, we tried and tried to get him out of the ground, but we couldnt do anything.  He was rooted too deep. What happened to him? We turned around to get help from the groundskeeper, but he was gone. Andy started to make noises from behind us.. we thought it was Andy. We turned around.. there was nothing. I mean nothing. Arid, dry, barren ground in the dark night. Andy was gone, the trees were gone, graves, everything. Just nothing. I turned to find Sam and Marcus and they were gone. Just me, alone. 
I began to walk to find some sort of shelter or safehaven or some sort to get out of this place. My shoes began to fall apart about an hour into the journey, forcing me to take them off and walk barefooted. I then walked for a few more hours on my raw, bloody feet just hoping for water, even a drop. So thirsty.. but I found nothing. The last thing I remember from the desert was laying on the earth, praying to whoever to get me out.  Then I passed out. 
I have no idea how long I was unconcious, but I woke up in a small grey room that had a single window on one of the walls. I mustered up all the strength that I had to somehow crawl over to it. I had will to find out where I was, and I did. I looked through the window, and there was.. me. On a medical table. Tubes running from my arms, some red, some clear, some green. All alone in this cold metallic room. A man walked into the room from a deadbolted door on the right side of the room. It was the same man I had seen in the cemetery. He walked up to my body and started inspecting me from head to toe, looking for something.. I dont know what. After he finished his search, he looked up and turned around. And stared at me. Through the window. 
""I am real. You will never be again. This is the reality, and you are trapped inside of your own mind, able to go wherever you wish, do whatever you want. But you will only feel when, or what I allow you to. Your flesh is mine. If I prick out your eyes, I may still allow you to see. But you will feel the empty, cringing pain constantly. If I cut off your leg, you can still walk. But you have to deal with the torture. Forever. Until I end your pathetic little life, which is what it has always been. Pathetic.  You should thank me, actually, for now I've given your life some purpose. You serve me now.""
And this is when I looked back at when I was at the cemetery. Me, Marcus, and Sam. This man touched us on our shoulders, we had all the opportunity to get away, but we didn't.  And by the way, how many arms do YOU have? Two? Or three...",My New Beginning,9,nosleep

I wake up in a cold sweat, my skin tingling with goosebumps. There is someone standing at the foot of my bed. I try to scream but the sound is stifled by a hand tightly over my mouth. I try to move, but I am being pinned down with a near crushing force. All I feel is pure terror and confusion. There are foreign thoughts in my mind. Reality seems vivid and dark.

The figure at the end of the bed comes into focus. It leans in, the featureless face right in front of mine. I try to scream again. The unseen hand clamps tighter. The being speaks in a slow, whispered voice. I cannot understand a word it's saying, but I can feel what it is trying to convey. Snippets of phrases come into my mind and emotions wash over me. I can feel the creature's disappointment and rage. I can hear the phrase repeated over and over again, ""You will die someday and it will mean nothing.""
It tells me that every soul is horribly alone after death. It tells me that hell is real. It tells me not to waste my existence, because someday I will not even have that.

It reaches a hand towards my face and presses on my forehead with its finger. The pain is unbearable. It feels like my head is shrinking and expanding at the same time. There is a sound louder than I have ever heard and then a silence more pure than in the vacuum of space. The finger presses harder for a split second. I catch a glimpse of the being's face. A lump appears in my throat as a realize who's face I'm looking at. Tears well up in my eyes. It's me. I'm wrinkled and my hair is gray. I look... dead. For a moment I realize something horrible which I cannot quite remember. Then I plunge into unconsciousness.

LittleMM,0,,10,1r2ocz,,1,"This story happened when I was in college.





My school is in another town so I had to live in student suites by myself.
My family is not rich and since I have a mild heart defect, I always feel weak and don't have enough energy to take a job after class. So in order to release at least some of my parent's financial burden, even though I'm a girl, I always chose the cheapest dorms to live in.





I've been living in four different dorms during my college days, all very old and small, one of them might even be actually haunted, but this story is not about any of them, at least not fully related. It's about something else.





On my way to school there's a juice stand, I always stopped by and buy a big cup of freshly squeezed juice after class. (Oh I forgot to mention, I went to night school and school ends at 10:00 pm.)
Since I buy juice from them almost every day even on my off days, I became quite familiar with the owner and will chit-chat with him while he's making juice for me.





One day when I was waiting for my juice as usual, I noticed that there's something on the ground at the corner of the road not very far from the juice stand.
It's a glass milk bottle with one single yellow flower in it. A five-petal flower with a very short stem and no leaves.
I was curious and asked the juice stand owner: "" Did someone died there? ""
He answered: "" I had the same question but, not that I know of. ""
Since it's not such an unusual thing, I didn't give it too much thought.





But after about two weeks I started to notice something odd.
The milk bottle was still there and the flower kept staying fresh!
But there's not even water in the bottle! It should dry out pretty quick without water.
I took a closer look and confirmed that the flower is not an artificial one.
That means someone's been changing the flowers frequently if not daily!
I got more curious and asked the juice stand owner if he saw anyone came to change the flowers, his answer was no.





It's actually quite sad to really think of it. It's probably someone very dear to the person who brought the flowers that accidentally died there. Maybe by a car crash, or maybe even a murder!
I talked about these wild assumptions carelessly and then I said goodbye to the owner with my fresh juice in hand. 





I went back to the dorm, my room is the first one on second floor, when I was stepping upstairs I could hear two girls chatting and giggling, they're my classmates, we took different classes so we didn't meet at school today, we were supposed to watch horror video in my dorm today and I totally forgot about it! When I reached the second floor I saw them standing in front of my door. The guy living next to me saw them at the entrance and let them in. They love watching horror videos at my place because the creepy environment offers an extra "" ambience.""




"" We were just talking about how creepy your dorm is! "" one of them said with a cheerful tongue.
"" Even this hallway seems haunted, why is it so dim? "" Added by the other.
"" Thanks guys for trashing my lair for me, like it's not a dump already. ""
I smiled.
Then we watched the video together, it's overall just another eventless night.





The next day after school, when I went for my daily juice, to my surprise I found that the bottle of yellow flower was gone. It was still there on my way to school!





"" Did you see who took the flower? "" I asked the owner.
"" That's odd, I didn't notice that it's gone! "" He answered.





I couldn't stop thinking about the yellow flowers on my way back to the dorm, I couldn't explain why I was so obsessed by it, I was so curious about the mysterious person who brought the flowers and why nobody ever saw him/her even when obviously the flowers have been changed so frequently? I was walking carelessly with my mind wandering somewhere else and the next moment a scene stroke me.





The yellow flower! It's there! Near the entrance of the park!
Someone moved it there, but why?
It's not likely that someone died there too, is it?
It's been curiouser and curiouser, but I couldn't think of it anymore.
The mid-term is approaching and I'm only half way done!
Can't waste my parent's money for a bad exam result.
( Yes, some of my classes still give exams. )
Thinking of it, I walked faster across the park.





There's no one in the part except me, and the street lights are so dim, they seemed dimmer than usual. One street light flashed when I walked pass it, I swore towards it: "" Great, now even you're trying to scare me, you asshole! ""
Then I turned back to the road,





That's when I noticed something near the bench about 20 feet ahead of me..... suddenly I felt a chill down to the bone..... the bottle of yellow flower..... why is it there???
Did someone put a bunch of flowers here and there on random spots? Or.....
I had to find out, so I backtracked to the park entrance..... no flower there..... that one was gone. So what does it mean? Someone's moving the bottle around .....for what? And most of all, how did I miss him/her? There's only one way in this small park!





It's not like I could do anything about it so I eventually carried on.
This time, the same bottle of flower appeared again in front of the convenient store right across the street of my dorm.
People were passing by , no one seemed to care, and I thought: "" Why should I? "" It's obviously none of my business.





So I entered the dorm building and went upstairs, but started to think how the bottle of flower seemed to "" followed "" me..... the chills came back, I almost reached the second floor, but I froze at the staircase. My body went all stiff I couldn't move, my pupils probably dilated like a panicking cat!





It's there.





The bottle of yellow flower, sitting there in front of my door.
A hundred thoughts flashed by, "" maybe someone's playing a prank on me, maybe it's a joke, but it's not funny. and by Whom and How??? 
I don't wanna know anymore, I'm moving out of this place! I know it's nothing to do with my dorm, my dorm is fine, it's not haunted, it's not the issue, but whatever!!!"" 





Before I realized, I already ran out of the dorm building and was on the way to my friend's house, and I didn't even remember how I got downstairs.





I couldn't stop mumbling to myself:
""I don't know if it's a prank or not, I don't care, I know there's nothing wrong with my dorm, it's the cheapest but nothing's wrong with it! and what kind of sicko would do such thing to me? Who would it be? Who could have known?
It's not possible 'cause I was pretty sure the dorm was empty that day, it's Saturday and everyone else went home except me! 
.....That cat..... it was an accident, I didn't mean it..... but it's not possible! No one could ever know! 
I don't care, I'm moving out right away. I'm moving out tomorrow!""

Motleigh,1,,5,1r09ur,,3,"I was about 12 or 13, living in a ranch style house in Southern California, when I had one of the creepiest experiences of my life. I was sleeping in my bedroom with the door slightly ajar. My bed was tucked into one corner of the room. The head of the bed was against the same wall as my closet door. The closet door was a large, sliding mirror. The door to my bedroom, which was an average door, was at the end of my bed. When entering the bedroom, one would have to walk past the end of the bed.

Some time in the night I woke up. I don't know why I woke up and I don't remember anything in particular waking me. The room was lit enough for me to see my bedroom door swing open about a foot. I did not see a person open the door. I did notice something crawl around the end of the bed and crawl up the side of the bed towards the head of the bed.

My first thought was that a dog was coming in, but when the thing reached the closet and slid open the closet door, I was certain it was not a dog. My best description of what I saw is a person crawling on all fours. I saw a dark silhouette, from the corner of my eye, crawl past where I was laying in bed. After the closet door slid open, the mysterious being crawled into the closet and closed the closet door behind itself. I was so terrified that I could not move. I laid frozen from fear on my back, in my bed, until I feel asleep. I was too scared to move or scream. I was awake for about an hour, unable to move, before I dozed off.

The next morning I woke up slightly confused, but I immediately slid open the closet door. I was not as afraid because the sun was shining outside and I felt that if it were going to harm me, it would have done it already. Inside the closet was my usual mess of clothes piled up on the floor. There was no monster or animal in there anymore. I did forget to check under the bed though...

oliviaclaire,0,,4,1r09ds,,4,"I apologize in advance for the length of this post.

The clock read 12:00. Not unusual for me to be up this late. I sat in my bed watching television and reading my usual horror novels. I, like many of you, are quite into horror and the paranormal. I began to feel hungry, so I sat down my book and began to descend down the stairs to the kitchen. I reached the kitchen and began to search for food. I felt quite uneasy with my back turned to the rest of the room. The feeling of someone watching me soon became overpowering and I had to turn around. That's when I heard it. Tap... Tap... Tap... It sounded like a finger tapping ever so lightly against the window in my kitchen. I was frozen at the sound. Though it was a light noise, compared to the deafening silence of the night, it might as well have been the loudest noise in the world. I shifted my glance to the window only to find... Nothing. I brushed it off and returned to my bedroom. As the night continued to drag on, I felt a growing unease in the pit of my stomach. Like something wasn't just right. I noticed my phone was dying, and reached for the charger plugged into the outlet next to my bed. I then heard something that chilled me to the very bone. Laughter. Very quiet. Very faint. But there none the less. I leaped from my bed and ran downstairs. I reached the living room and turned on the television, struggling to catch my breath and regain rational thought. It could have been anything, right? Eventually, I let the sound of the television push the experience to the back of my mind. Then it came again. Tap.. Tap.. Tap.. Louder this time. I was stricken with panic. I refused to let myself look at the window. 
""Just ignore it and it will go away""
Tap.. Tap.. Tap..
""Ignore it.""

This went on for 30 minutes at least. It began to drive me crazy. The tapping became incessant. I then did something I haven't done since I was a child. Retreated to my mother's room. I walked in with tears of complete and utter terror streaming down my face. Reluctantly, even though not much of an explanation was given, she allowed me to stay the night in her room. 
I climbed into the bed and began to let sleep take me. I felt safer in the comfort of my mother's room. Then, just as my eyes began to feel too heavy to keep open, I heard it once again. Closer this time.

It has been a little over a year since I last wrote - just over a year since the last nightmare.  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured, that, as Dr. Lough suggested, getting it out of my head and into a journal would help.

I read back over my last and only journal entry, as I tried to describe the nightmare.  It is so chaotic and scattered, yet I'm unable to find any other way to convey the details.  That is the terror of the dream at its core - utterly chaotic.  Jerking from one sensation to the next, the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be, to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion.  All of this, in layers of sleep - waking to the comfort of my mother's figure, only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out, with her eerie voice echoing through my body:

""You're connected now.""

Even now, in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages, I'm struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper.  Each detail seems to tie into the next, only to fall apart when I try to see the whole.  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr. Lough could make?  Is this what schizophrenia feels like?  I have no way to explain it.  It is as though there is a novelist's grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene, unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding.  I'm fairly certain this entry, and perhaps any subsequent entries, will be just as erratic.  I just cannot force these thoughts together.

So much has changed in the last year, it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me.  I have a son now, nearly 6 months old.  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote.  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace?  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father, the changes to my life, the responsibility, it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious?  I can't help but think it must have played a role.  It has been a blur, so many other things seem to have fallen into place.  Though they are exciting, it seems predetermined, somehow rushed.

Over the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in.  I knew I would live there once again - returning it to ownership in my family - though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly.  Rachel's grandmother died, leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together.  It was Christmas Day, the day she died - I guess her last gift to us.  Three months after my son was born, we were moving back into the mountains, back to the walls I had called home as a boy.  

One thing I feel for certain, this home is the source.  The nightmare started here, always took place here, was always fueled here.  I'm beginning to remember things, or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades.  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this house.

As a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase, which opened onto a hallway, always with my head down staring at my feet.  Left, at the end of a long hallway was a guest room.  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them.  Right, across a short landing was my bedroom.  I had trained myself to never look left at night - as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows.  If I would look up, I would become stuck in fear with the reflection.  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass.  My feet became rooted in place, the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me.  The nightlight would flicker in then out, each time causing my shape to jump forward, as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness.  I never remembered breaking loose, turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep.  I would wake up in my bed hours later, staring at my hands, inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare. 

I learned, I kept my head down and did not look to the left.

Our first night in the home, that muscle memory followed suit.  After turning off the main floor lights, I climbed the staircase.  My son was sleeping against my chest, his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder.  My head was down as I crested the top step, turning to the right, towards my room which was now his.  As I neared the bedroom door, his forehead left my shoulder.  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck.  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head.  I didn't need to look at his eyes, I knew.  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand, reaching down the hallway to the windows.  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle.  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door.

BLOODPIRATE,6,,2,1rdmz3,,4,"Fear is a strange thing

an unpleasant emotion caused by the belief that someone or something is dangerous, likely to cause pain, or a threat.

That's the definition of fear.

Everyone has it, but no one wants to admit it. People fear fear. Not me. I usually embrace fear, and openly invite it into my life. But, I usually get to control what scares me.

Not last night.

I was laying in bed, reading some stories on /r/nosleep before I went to bed like I always do. Like I said, I invite fear into my life.

I never believed any of the stories that were on here before.

My thoughts have changed.

My room has a bathroom with two entrances, one to my room, and the other to my sisters room. While I was reading some stupid story, I heard a noise coming from her room. I knew she was at work though so I just brushed it off and kept reading. 

I heard the sound again.

This time I decided to go check it out. I chose to use the door that leaves my room to get to the door to her bedroom this time, for whatever reason.

I opened up the door to her room. I could've sworn I saw something jolt to one side of the room. But, I went in further and discovered nothing. So I went back to my room.

The door to my bathroom was open. The light was still off which have it sort of an ominous and demonic look. I walked in and turned the light on. 

Nothing.

I turned around to leave when I heard more slamming noises. I turned back around to go to my sisters room when the light turned off.

I struggled to find the door knob, but when I finally did, the door wouldn't open. The other wouldn't open either. I started screaming now, but no one could hear me.

I sat down on the floor, hopeless. I've never felt fear like I did when that same shadow from my sisters room grabbed a hold of my neck. I couldn't even breathe because it's grip was so tight. I couldn't tell if I was blacking out because even with my eyes open, the room was pitch black. 

All of a sudden it let go.

I laid there, crying as my brother came bursting in the door. He turned the light on and shook me. I couldn't believe what happened. I got up and looked in the mirror. My neck hand bruised hand prints around it, and my back, chest, and arms were covered in scratches that formed weird symbols.

Ever since that day I have believed every story on /r/nosleep. You may not believe this but I don't care. I know the truth and that's all that matters.

This was carved into my back, I have no idea what it means:

dagronBorn,1,,1,1rcebp,,3,"For some reason or another, the paranormal loves my family. No matter where would move or what kind of cleansing ritual we would perform, something would make itself known. The earliest account that I can personally remember is from the age of five when my family and I had recently rented out an old house in desperate need of repairs. My father struck a deal with the landlord that if they were to bring the rent down considerably, he would fix up the place which would in turn up the property value.

The house sat on a few acres of land and had tool-shed in the back of the property which contained an old, sealed off well (this doesn't play into the story at all like the ring or some shit like that). The house was a small, single story home that was separated into two halves by dividing wall, but were connected via an old, red accoridon-style doors that had been faded with time. 

The left side of the house was cold. Always cold, even in the heat of the Texas summer we moved in. There wasn't much to the left side of the house except for large sitting room, and and old restroom that was filled with old junk that had been left behind by the previous tenants. I can still fell the cold upon my skin, and the invisible eyes that seemed to stare from every corner of the room. Needless to say, I never ventured into that room unless I was heading out the front door that just had to be on the left side of the house.

The right side of the house wasn't that bad. I never remember it feeling uncomfortably or eerily cold, and the feeling of being watched wasn't there. The right side of the house contained the living room, kitchen, my parent's room, my younger brother's (he was just about two years old at this time) room , my room, and the tiny bathroom we all shared.  For the first few weeks everything seemed normal, like this was going to be the first place in a long while we wouldn't have to pick and move suddenly (my family was like a roaming pack of gypsies when I was younger, never staying anywhere for too long). But, oh, did we have another thing coming.

The first unexplained phenomena I can remember was the soft, sweet voice of a woman who I would sometimes mistake for my mother calling my name. I would bound into whatever room my mother was in to see what she wanted, only to find out that she had not called for me. I brushed it off thinking that I was just hearing things that weren't there, just a case of a child's overactive imagination. Until it kept happening. Every. God. Damn. Day.

The second thing I noticed were my toys. I had fixation as a child to set up all my action figures along my room on whatever ledge was available. Window sill? Check. Dresser? Check. Makeshift step pyramid like display created from VHS tapes? You bet. Whenever I would leave my room to visit the restroom, or get a drink from the kitchen, and then come back to my room, my toys would either be facing the opposite direction I had placed them or they would be knocked to the ground with enough force to actually break more than a few. And, like the voice, I tried to explain it away until I eventually started to place my toys in a shoebox under my bed so that they would be safe. I still miss all the brave action figures that I lost to that house. Rest in pieces my dear friends.

The next few occurrences I witnessed firsthand, and they involve my younger brother. Cody, my brother, would be heard giggling and laughing and cooing in his room and if you were to check on him to see what was so funny, the rocking chair in the room would cease to rock as if someone saw you come in and stopped rocking. And if you attempted to remove Cody from his crib, he would scream and cry and reach for the rocking chair. When he was older, but still young enough to remember he once asked about the ""ugly lady with the pretty voice"" who would sing to him and make him laugh. 

One night when we were all sleeping soundly in out beds, my father gets in from a long day of construction work only to be greeted by a crying toddler in need of a diaper change. My father went into Cody's room, picked him up and set him down on the changing table. After cleaning up my brother and laying him back down in his crib, my father was free to go to sleep himself. The second his head hit the pillow though, he heard a commotion coming from Cody's room. He gets up, grabs his .38 and checks it out, thinking an intruder may have used Cody's room as their entrance point. Instead he is met with diapers strewn all over the floor. There was a shelf above the table that my parents placed the diapers and wipes on, and the diapers were stacked neatly enough were they wouldn't tumble. He thinks nothing of it, stacks them a few less this time and them proceeds to head back to bed. Then he hears it again. He walks back to the room to find the diapers on the ground again. My father stacks them up a little less this time, then goes back to bed. This same routine happens for the next hour and half; at one point he had put a solitary diaper on the shelf only to have it thrown on the ground soon after by some unseen force. It was them that my father knew it was time to move again.

That next week we rented a u-haul and began packing. We had just finished packing and moving everything to the truck and my dad was the last person coming out of the house. Everyone else was outside, myself included. My father had large box he as carrying out to the truck and was passing through the accordion door when something pushed the door shut on him hard enough that it took it my mom and myself to pry it open! He at first thought I was playing some kind of joke on him, but was even more fired up to leave once he learned I had been nowhere near that door!

The last I heard about that property was when I did a google map search only to find the parking lot of a Wal-Mart. I always wonder if they have a problem in the baby aisle. Specifically with the diapers. ","First they want us gone, they they don't want us leave...",4,nosleep

I hear the repetitive sound of raindrops crashing into my window.

A storm is coming.
 
My phone continuously vibrating, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, who liked what, who posted where, what they did, who they like, who they hate. 

Personally I don’t give a fuck, but for some strange reason I always check the notifications, I guess that’s just another reason why I can’t just fall into a deep, relaxing rest.

   I sit here laying down, staring at the darkness of what I call my ceiling, imagining shapes and creating figures in my head. I can’t sleep, this always happens. I get up from my warm bed and crawl to my refrigerator; “Midnight snacks are the shit.” I mumble to myself as I open the ridiculously cold appliance. “It’s not even midnight; it’s like 3 in the morning, so much for a midnight snack…” I mumble again. Something’s odd though, the fridge is super cold, like you know when someone opens a refrigerator in a movie, and the frosty musk slowly rolls out of it, covering the floor with smoke; that’s happening right now. I grab a bottle of water; it’s got a slick layer of ice just forming on the top of the water. --I’d always break the skin of ice with my finger when I was little, still do. I take a sip of the icy water, and I feel my tooth ring. Cold water always hurts my teeth.

   I begin back towards my bed. The rain has become worse and worse, almost violent now, it sounds like someone left a faucet running or something. I get to bed; it’s chilly, like the underside of my pillow. That little trip will just probably make it harder for me to fall asleep.

…

I’m running and I trip.

I hate waking up from a dream like that.

This rain is insane, I make my way towards the kitchen again, it’s almost 4 now, I don’t get why I can’t sleep, the kitchen is probably twice as cold as it was when I last was there. The fridge looks like has perspired, and the sweat around it has frozen over, I scrape my name into the frost.

M- I- C- T- H-

Should I make a frozen dinner…? 

I try to open the freezer door, but it’s frozen shut. 

I pull harder, and harder.

It won’t open. 

I grasp it firmly and thrust downwards, it flips open and I fall back, and I hear two thumps after mine.

I look over and there are my parents, frozen with an expression of fear.

My heart drops to my stomach, my palms soak, my eyes freeze wide, my face is blank. 

I can’t say anything, I try to scream/

ephique,5,,3,1r8wrl,,3,"It was Friday and myself being unemployed at the time, was up for something to do. You see, my girlfriend was invited to a party by her new friends from her drama-crew she recently joined and she wanted me to join her. This party took place on the other side of our suburban ruin of a town and it made common sense for her to message me the location whenever she knew the exact address; again, she didn't know these people that well.

Around 9 pm I left our apartment to head to the party, still not knowing the exact location I figured I could at least walk to the bus-station that had buses taking me to that part of town. Luckily I got a message from one of her new friends on the way there. Describing how to get to the destination. My girlfriend hadn't paid her phone bill and had to use a friend’s phone to message me, she has done this before. She hates her network company.

I took the bus, taking me as far as I could bus-wise. After that I had to get a taxi, the only taxi driver I ended up finding had never driven anyone to that location before apparently; I'm guessing the drama-people pretended they had taxi's whenever they needed one. Good practice.

The taxi driver, who I believe was Mexican dropped me off at the address and headed back for the city shortly after. I had no idea her friends was throwing a party out in the middle of nowhere, and it was getting really chilly so I didn't spend too much time figuring out the mysteries of the universe out there; I ran up to the door.

My first impression was that this must have been the most quiet party in the history of parties. I heard no music, no laughing, no tapping. Nothing. Before I knew it I was banging on that door, it had no ringer or anything, I had to pound that thing. No one opened.

I felt pretty confused at this point, I did still have my phone though. Although calling my girlfriend was no use 'cause I already knew her network always shut off inbound and outbound calls and texts whenever she hadn't paid. Out of desperation I phoned her friends number, but no one answered. I assumed they were partying too hard to hear the phone ringing and I found myself mislead by a tired taxi driver who took me to the wrong house. That's the only explanation that made any sense to me what so ever.

Now, I was out of options. I couldn't walk back into town 'cause not only would I not know the exact roads out there; but it was also ridiculously freezing outside. I tried banging on the door again and again, maybe an old couple lived there or something and they would wake up if I hit that door hard enough.

I ended up smashing the lever on the door accidentally, the door wasn't even locked. I looked around to make sure that no one was watching me because I did realize that being desperate or cold wouldn't really vouch well in court. I couldn't see anyone so I sneaked into the house. Whenever I had made sure no one was in the first room of the house I closed the door behind me. Not being sure what I was looking for, I walked around aimlessly trying to figure out if anyone was home or not; my mind started to wander off into finding explanations. I remember one being that they were playing a prank on me, which wasn't a bad theory since the door was after all left unlocked.

I didn't check much of the first level of the house before I started walking up a great set of stairs leading me in a spiral upwards. It was very creaky so if anyone was awake in this house they'd easily hear me at this point. I figured no one was 'cause the entire house was dead silent with the exception of the noise I brought into it myself.

Upstairs I found a bedroom just across the hall from where the spiral staircase ended. It seemed to belong to a girl, a small girl. It was an empty bed in it and paintings on the walls, you know the type kids do in pre-school that parents end up pretending are works of genius to make the kid feel better and gain confidence? Yeah, those kind of paintings.

I got shocked by my own text-message signal that I stupidly left on way too loud, it was from an unknown number; I was hoping it was my girlfriend or her friend explaining the mix-up or something. The text said:
""Alright, we are all set! I hope you haven't fallen asleep my little unemployed darling. Make your way to 24th Radcliffe Street, it's not too far from the super market by the bus-station.

Sunny day in Nevada. Families having lunch outside, fathers teaching their sons how to grill steak, playgrounds
filled with kids. Every year I plan a trip with my son. Nevada has really nice caves in it. When I was little,
my father always took me there and so did his father. I didn't want to break this chain. I told Jake, my son, about that
cave that I used to visit but I did not have enough time to take him there until now. He was still sleeping when
I stepped in his room.
""Honey wake up!"" Jake opened his little eyes and whispered:
""What?""

""We are going to see the cave I told you about!"" he instantly jumped out of his bed and become so excited that
I can't even tell about it. He got dressed and ran to have something to eat. About five minutes later he was screaming
from the garage door.
""Hurry up mom!""

One hour car ride. Not the longest one he ever had. He kept asking me about the place. I just smiled and told him to
be patient. As soon as I parked the car, he blasted out the door and ran to the back of the car to grab two flashlights. 
""You ready?"" I asked him. He obviously was so we started walking towards our destination.
It was dark in there. Darker than anywhere else. Flashlights on.  He just kept pushing forward. Sometimes I couldn't 
even catch up with that little kid. After a sharp left turn I saw him standing there. He found it. The biggest hall 
in the cave. Every wall was shining when the light of our flashlights reached them.
""Beautiful isn't it?""

""It is indeed!"" he answered. He turned his head towards me but it was only q light at a corner 
that he could see. He totally crapped himself. ""Mommy wait for me!"" He started running towards the light 
that he could see. It is a maze down there. - MOM! - he screamed.
""I'm here honey!"" He caught up with me. He just gasped there and started to be a bit relieved as he realized 
that he was not alone in that dark cave again.
""Hey calm down little boy! I'm not leaving you here!"" went closer to him and whispered:  ""Or am I ?

jonssijonssi,0,,0,1rilff,,2,"Hey guys, I just wanted to tell you about my dream which kind of freaked me out. I've been having a lot of bad dreams for the past 3 weeks, but i think this one tops all of them. Anyhow, I dreamt that I lived with my boyfriend in a big house, it was night and we both were sleeping. Suddely i wake up, and I sit up in our bed. I'm fully aware that I'm sleepwalking but I can't stop myself, lay down again or do anything about my actions. I start walking out in a big hallway (this is where the main door is located), then I enter a smaller, much more narrow and dark hallway, and in the end is a small wardrobe-like room which is truly pitch black. This scared me a bit since I am afraid of the dark but I just keep walking, I don't even consider NOT to walk in to the wardrobe. So I find myself inside this pitch black tiny room and I close the door and I lock it. Once I have locked the door i just panic, I'm not afraid but I simply can't stop screaming, I remember the scream so well, it was a true scream of despair, I screamed at the top of my lungs but I still was not scared. I started to bang the door, the walls, everything while screaming and crying as hard as I could. Finally my boyfriend comes to the rescue and the door was open now, he just grabs me and tells me I was sleepwalking and I just said ""I know"" in the sternest voice. He's scared out of his life and crying and I just looks at him like he's crazy and then i just go back to bed like nothing happened.

ephique,0,,0,1rikrx,,4,"I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom, dad and big sister. We were a normal family, neither happy nor sad, somewhere in between. I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano, practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs. It was also some sort of medicine for me; it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes. You see, my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting. I hated it; I hated hearing her yell at my poor mother.

During a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad, making sure that I didn’t have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible. My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up. I remember jogging most of the route home, since my dad sounded so serious. It gave me the creeps to say the least.

I jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house. The kitchen was the first room you’d see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs. As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably, something had definitely happened. My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch, he told me to sit down as well.

I was scared and curious at the same time. Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didn’t bother caring too much about any of my sisters business, so I could figure out that this wasn’t about my sister. I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible. My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say, as if he didn’t know how to explain something to me.

Finally, after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time. He said: “Your mother…” and then he needed to grasp some air, and he continued: “Your mother has passed away.”

I was eight years old and I couldn’t grasp that concept. I didn’t understand death, or that my mom was eternally gone. I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards god-knows-what, I remember thinking how unfair this was. I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly, he didn’t know what to do and he was in shock at the time.

My sister continued crying, she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didn’t actually care to know at that precise moment. She was just being desperate and no one could blame her. I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there, I thought that was why she was crying so much. I didn’t shed a single tear; I kept it all inside. Of course that didn’t mean this incident didn’t haunt me for years, I never stopped thinking about my mother. 

The aftermath of my mother’s death is what has been shaping my life the recent years. My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane. My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital. Something I didn’t even think existed when I was eight. This resulted in that I didn’t get to meet my sister very often, my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge; but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was. I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it, and I didn’t blame him. 

I was guessing that my sister wasn’t doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by, something that troubled me; I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad. It felt so dead, and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died. We didn’t do anything, I literally spent all time at home in my room, making or playing music. Me and my dad didn’t even greet sometimes when I came home from school, it was depressing. My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mother’s death, something that I’m about to get into.

You are probably wondering how she died by now, and it’s a legit question to be asking. The best answer I could give you is that I don’t know. My dad has always told me she died of liver-failure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me. It didn’t add up, my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didn’t drink. I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasn’t mature enough to hear the truth. In addition to this, whenever I asked my dad about this matter he’d get heavily upset. Nowadays I never ask about my mom’s death, nor do I even bring up mom as a topic.

Years went by and I ended up being fourteen. It kept going like I just described, I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house. My dad did work, he had the night-time shift at a local bottle factory, I’m not joking, he actually made glass bottles for a living. He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister, they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job. You guessed it, the bottle factory.

I was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen. My school was the type that had an after-school library that didn’t close till 11 pm. I didn’t need any of the books or supplies that the library offered; I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa. Either way, I hadn’t seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldn’t see her again for another two. 

When I arrived at the house the front door was open, “This is odd?” I thought. Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mother’s old jars. It’s never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door, number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys. It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it. The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door, around the lock. I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone, ready to call the police. 

This is when I heard something coming from inside the house. I was dead scared to say the least, this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse, I didn’t know. It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor, trying to move it. It was so dark as well, I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door, technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights. I started to slowly pace into the house, walking towards the noise. This is where I had to make a decision, was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark? I picked the former. I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window. It was my sister, naked. My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation; it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital. 

I switched on the lights in an instant. She had redecorated the entire kitchen, in the dark. Of course it all looked hideous and random; she didn’t know what the hell she was doing. I remember being in a slight discomfort, I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life. I also hadn’t seen her for a good couple of years at all. She didn’t look very comfortable either, she looked like she didn’t know who I was and was wondering what I was doing there.

I uttered “Linda?” out loud, that was her name. She didn’t respond, she just continued standing there looking at me. “Don’t you remember me, I’m your brother.” I still couldn’t get any feedback out of her; it was as if the wheel wasn’t spinning at all. I wasn’t sure what the protocol here was, not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured I’d try to call dad, before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered: “Don’t call dad.” This is when I realized she couldn’t be completely empty inside after all.

“You don’t want to call dad.” She continued.  I had no idea what to do, I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place. Luckily my dad got home at that point, not coming from a finished shift at work. He had a good five hours at least left, I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation. My father ran into the house as fast as he could.

This is when something I didn’t expect happened, he told me to leave. He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house. I asked him where I was supposed to go, he told me to wait in his car. Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didn’t think twice about it, I ran out to the car. As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times, I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts. I had no clue what the two of them were discussing, although I never saw my sister move her lips so I’m guessing my dad did most of the talking. 

After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car, he joined me inside. I remember asking why he didn’t bring Linda with him, “Don’t call her that name!” he shouted in response. I was so confused at this point. Dad started the car and drove me to my only friend’s house; I didn’t see him very often though. I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point, I didn’t really create any friendships. I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friend’s doorbell, his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused. I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight. I didn’t even know what was going on to be fair.

Whatever he told them worked, I got to spend the night at my friend’s place. Tim’s place, to be exact. It was pretty awkward I remember, I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish. We got to be desk-mates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester, so we weren’t very close. 

It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after; I guessed that made it easier for my dad, leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to. He did, but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tim’s parents, both trying to justify me as Tim’s best friend. I don’t know. Tim didn’t have many friends I guess.

On the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me, as if I was mocking him. I remember how desperate he looked, as if he had no fire left in his heart. He uttered the words: “Do you think I wanted any of this?” as he grabbed his hair in regret. “All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances, and I’m not blaming you when I’m saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours.” Is what came out of his mouth next. I tried to comfort him, telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not; I really didn’t have a lot of cards in my deck at this point. I mean my dad was basically losing it.

When we got home he told me that he was sorry, and that I should go up to my room. I did go up to my room but I got to tell you; I was starting to get very anxious about my dad. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on. I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online, I couldn’t sleep so pulling an all-nighter was my only real option. I was reading “A Brief History of Time” for a science project in school, I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes. I figured I’d go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway. I saw my mother standing just outside, looking right at me for a fraction of a second. Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane? It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink. 

The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night, I kept thinking about it as I couldn’t sleep. She looked deranged, scared and raw. The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white 50’s movie. I kept begging for the sun to rise up, I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what you’ll see. I might have been fourteen, but I can openly admit that I was dead scared.

It finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs, still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway. I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice. I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said: “I think I need help.” While holding the glass of juice as if he wasn’t sure he was going to drink the rest of it. I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasn’t sure, that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately. He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf, he thought that could give him some relief. I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea, jokingly adding that it’s better than hanging around the house doing nothing. He looked offended when I said that, something I didn’t really understand since he obviously worked all night, so that would justify him sleeping through the days.

I understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died. Well, it’s hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times, and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liver-failure. I mean it was possible. Imagine if it was true, and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me. That’s the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thing.

Having that explanation out of the way, I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time. It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf; I just walked into his room unexpected. A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room; it looked similar to an office which is nothing he’d ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory. He was actually sitting at his desk. Not only that, but the desk was flooded with paper-work of some sort, maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day, something he could manage from home. I didn’t ask; I had a big enough question for him as it were.

I dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured I’d sit on it. It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable, better than standing up anyway. Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying: “You want to know about your sister, and what happened the other night. Don’t you?” This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt, bringing up mom here would have been a car-crash. I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister. He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me: “Your sister is not right in the head; she’s in a mental hospital.” I couldn’t believe he hadn’t figured out that I would have known this by then. Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didn’t know. He explained the context, telling me that she couldn’t take our mother’s death. A tear started climbing down his cheeks, and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine, and then I left the room.

I realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business. I had no idea how I’d ever get the truth about my mother out of him. When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again, the image of my mom started crawling back to me. The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway, was my mind playing tricks on me? I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere. I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had, not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before. 

Night landed again, I hadn’t spoken to my father again that day. I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night, I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought I’d see my mother again. We all know you can imagine things in the dark, kids do it all the time. It’s as if your mind fills in the gaps, but that incident the other night was different. I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that I’d open the door to the darn hallway, and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer. I’m not going to lie, I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out; there was no sign of my mother. I turned on the lights and went back into my room.

Still not wanting to go to bed, not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured I’d listen through some of my older songs. I had loads of them; most of which weren’t very good however. I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good, especially not at writing my own songs. I guess I was decent at playing other people’s songs. I basically went through my songs in chronological order, it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years. 
It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs, and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine. I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before; it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs. Knowing that this wasn’t an overworked track yet, it was made just days ago and I hadn’t gotten around to mastering it yet, I figured I wasn’t going to give it more of a thought. That was until the neurons fired, that track was made the day I couldn’t sleep, the day I saw my mother in the hallway. Being a bit gullible I figured that I’d give it a go using my acoustic headphones. I tried everything. I played the song backwards; I cut out bass, middle frequencies, high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples. I couldn’t hear anything suspicious, just that white noise. 

I was a bit disappointed, at the same time relieved. Although that white noise shouldn’t have been there, nothing in my room could have made a noise like that. I didn’t want to over-think the situation, so I ended up hitting the bed. Later that night, as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before, slowly dozing off to sleep. I hadn’t been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when you’re in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you. I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere. Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise, it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder. I continued lying in bed, trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred, this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room. It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work. It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice; very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian. 

It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from, I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar. I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights. I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch, for the blink of an eye, just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again; just as the light went on. The same stare, same face, still that black and white filtered look from before. I got so shocked I fell down on the floor, the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant. I wasn’t sure what to make of this, and I definitely didn’t want to tell my father about what I had seen, knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital. 

I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldn’t let me sleep, I just couldn’t sleep at all. I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up, these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter. I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become. Whatever this all meant, and needless to say; I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

I met my father in the kitchen the next day, he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him. He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his work-crew later that afternoon. I was happy for him; he deserved some time out of the stress. After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added: “Have you been thinking of your mother lately?” As if he could read my mind. I told him that I was always missing my mother, and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately. He stated that he thought I had. I had no clue why.  Short after that he left for playing golf.

I kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night, I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing. In fact, I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed, how could it have been on? I had no idea. 

Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers. I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours. I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk, it got me a slight reminder on how he hadn’t gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet. The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort, as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company. I don’t know how I’d describe it better than that. After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address, I remember wondering why dad wouldn’t show me something like this: 

“Daddy, why didn’t you visit me last weekend. I thought you were coming back, I was waiting for you. I’m sorry if I made a scene, I thought something had happened to you! I ran to you because I wanted answers, no one has answers here. I’ve been getting visits lately, why can’t you come to me at the same time?”

I fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you, my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five year-old in this state. On after-thought I guessed my dad didn’t tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasn’t in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges. Although thinking about it, that doesn’t sound ridiculously different than a mental hospital.

The rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of work-related things and records of local police-investigations. Why would my father be looking into cases of murder, pedophilia, rape and almost anything you can think of? It wasn’t really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up. I knew he had a friend in the police force, that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them. I didn’t even want to know at the time, I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadn’t slept in far too long.
I apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that I’m dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there, I’m only taking precautions to make sure that I’m telling it right. If I’m finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right. 

My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work, which made complete sense. It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room, I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar. This time I wasn’t using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again. My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before, something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time, I wasn’t worrying about that. I was thinking about my mother showing herself again. Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itself.

Not too long into that night I started feeling sick of being in-doors for so long, and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing. I remember being on the sane side of the fence, thinking critically and trying to find solutions, not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell. I figured I’d take my bike down to a local gas station, not more than ten minutes from my house; I wanted some chips, candy and maybe a couple cans of soda. 

I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off; I got there faster than I thought I would. It wasn’t cold outside either; it was a pretty smooth night. After grabbing some generic brand of chips, Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left. I didn’t spend much time in the store, but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen. With no bike, feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home. 

Something out of the ordinary happened after this, and I wasn’t even sure if I was seeing things at first. I was walking on this huge open road; I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road. It was tied together with the forest behind our house. It was the type of road that didn’t have any traffic other than truck drivers, passing once every couple of hours at night. I didn’t want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what you’d imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear. I assumed she was looking for me; she was definitely staring at me. 

I continued walking, not necessarily fearing my sister. It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her, that she would never have done anything to hurt me. As I approached her she didn’t give me any response what so ever, she was just staring at me in a light-blue scrub-coat, looking lifeless. I had reached talking-distance; I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like one of those scenarios you can’t be prepared for in real life. She had started to shake a bit, I couldn’t tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous. I asked her if she was looking for me out there, and if she had escaped the hospital. She didn’t respond. I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me, as if I was a threat to her. 

After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back. I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon, or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it. She started to slowly bring it forth, it was a plastic bag. From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasn’t heavy, or dangerous for that matter. I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag, then she started to stretch it out to me: “I took this from your house the other day, I’m sorry. I think this belongs to you. Jonathan.” 

I do realize that I never told you my name, it is indeed Jonathan. I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even; she seemed to be so out of it. I remember grabbing the plastic bag, she wouldn’t let go of it too lightly either, it was as if she still wanted it. After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence, she wouldn’t stop staring into my eyes during these. Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad. Shortly after she started walking towards the forest; as if she knew where she was heading. 

I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister, whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit. I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dad’s car, acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch, as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister. I didn’t even know if I wanted him to catch her or not, she was purposely running away from him. He dragged her into his car and they both drove away, heading the direction he was originally going. This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital, and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times? Something wasn’t right, I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasn’t anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her. Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school, but that doesn’t change the logic of it. He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister, since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thing.

I ran the rest of the way home, trying not to drop anything; I still had all the items I bought at the gas station. I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did; I had no clue whenever he would get back, and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me. I couldn’t spot my dad’s car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house. I didn’t bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything, I made my way back to my room as fast as I could. I don’t really know why but I locked the door after me, as if there was something to fear. I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on. I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside; as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me. 

I never really thought of something until now, and that is how my sister could have found me. It must have been a coincidence, or she had been following me for a while; knowing she couldn’t approach me in the store. I don’t know.

I looked into the bag, it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room, and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen. After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever, for example there was a roll of tape in there. I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items. The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos, most being after mom died. The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks; they weren’t even dry, I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag. There was only one thing left in the bag, an usb-stick. 

I took the stick out and threw away the bag. Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house. The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasn’t sent to the hospital yet, but it was pretty much pending already. In fact, most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away. On one of them it’s my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing, she actually wasn’t acting too badly the first couple of weeks. I guess she didn’t process our mother’s death until later or something. Another photo is of dad’s old car, he had to sell it in order to compensate for our family’s financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had, my mother’s candle business. He loved that damn car with his entire heart; we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car. 

There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter “x” behind them. It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me. I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking. I figured my sister must have had done this, for what reason I was about to find out. I kept staring at the first picture; it was the one I told you about earlier, the one of my father’s old car. It was a Pontiac from the early 80’s and it must have cost him a fortune. I never had any particular memories of the car; I remember it spending most of its time in our garage.

I kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadn’t use the car more, he obviously loved it. The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper, for selling it of course. I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat. It wasn’t very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent. She had the same drained-out appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room, and this was taken after her death. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. I remember dropping the photo out of shock; so many thoughts started circling inside of my head.

dinofinger,0,,1,1rie11,,1,"    17^th May 2007.
I followed my dad went to Grandma's house. My cousin who lives with grandma, had a suspicion that something had happen to Aunt L &gt; *Her initial would be appropriate here* &lt; Aunt L was never in her sound mind but she prefer to live alone which is the best option avoiding the troubles she would cause to others. Grandma has a problem of [nagging](https://www.google.com/search?q=nagging&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a) disease which makes more Aunt L better suit live far from her lectures. 

Back again to my cousin, who received a call from Aunt L's neighbour. Her respond was *there was a sudden silent for the past four days*. Aunt L was never a social person who goes anywhere she wants and always out. She prefered to live in her tiny apartment secluded only her herself and herself she enjoys being with. But her neighbour help us to watch for her just in case for anything. So we respond to go and visit her house. My father, my cousin and I, the three of us went together with nothing held us back. 

As we arrive by the door, we knock and knock. From the window we can see noise screen from her small tv at the corner. But there was no sign of her. Somehow her grill lock and the door were changed, the key my cousin brought didn't fit at all. Maybe she doesn't want us to barge in anytime we want. My dad took the liberty to call the locksmith while giving positive thoughts to my cousin that everything was fine. 

30 minutes pass. The locksmith do his magic and opened the door. Such stench came out in full loaded right to our faces. Right in front of the door we can see Aunt L laid still in the toilet facing the floor. A 15 year old me shocked and I just watched her body in strip condition only a towel covered her other half and her faeces was right below her and all over behind her. Yet she is still alive, blinking and gasping.

My dad pull me back allowing my cousin to go in. I can still feel my father clenches my arms so tightly when he saw his sister. He said ""*[I better call the ambulance](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-an-Ambulance)*"", so he did and left. My cousin call me out to help pick her up. But she was too heavy, we can't even push her to the side. So my cousin rinse her with water to clean her off. I was told to took a towel and wipe her face. I could say her face was in a total blankness. 

25 minutes later the ambulance arrive. They took her with a stretcher. Both of us went down to send her off. I can remember certain vision of some neighbours pry on their window looking out what was happening. My dad went together with Aunt L, so left me and my cousin. Soon my mom and sister arrive bringing cleaning equipment. We spent whole 3 hours cleaning her house. Based on what I heard my cousin said ""*The man who always deliver her food got no respond from her for three days. That's when he ask the neighbour if she had gone somewhere. I bet if we were too late, she might have gone by any minute unconscious on the floor*""


    18^th May, 2013
We had her funeral in the day after the day we thought she would died 6 years ago. Funny the coincidence of the date just *one day after* we laughed. My cousin gave a speech said she was a fighter. Indeed she was. I think her life is better after that 17^th May living in the retirement home. She was more happier than before she was a shut-in. R.I.P Aunt L, our auntie we always concern hereafter. ",Brief moments,2,nosleep

As I was doing this, the big rocking chair next to his litter box was swaying, and I gave him a quick glance. I felt him sniff at my ear. He then jumped off the chair and walked into the kitchen. I thought nothing of it for a few seconds, then froze. ""Oliver!"", I called. I then walked to the door and looked outside, he was napping on the steps.

echoes007,4,,2,1rhee9,,2,"I’ve always been a non-religious person. I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything. To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily. But I’ve always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff. I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this “religious experience” we all want, but I never got it. So, after a while, I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God, or spiritual experience, or anything that’s real, that will make me see life in a whole new perspective. Naturally, this got me down and depressed a bit. It was then when I started seeing 11:11 everywhere. It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines. I remember vividly, my heart stopped, and I remember a sound, like a blender going off in my head. When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me, I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box. It read 11:11. This stuck with me for a long long time. I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was 11:11 in the morning and 11:11 at night. As if reminding me that it saved my life. This was going on for a while, when I went as far as Googling what it was. Unfortunately, the 11:11 thing was associated to some spiritual stuff, things I thought were bullshit to begin with. But still, 11:11 was always there. Slowly I stopped thinking about it, and my 11:11 experiences were less and less. It wasn’t until last week when I was driving home (I was butt sober) from an event when it started raining. My tires and brakes were messed up and I didn’t get a chance to change them, and besides, it hardly ever rains in this town, so this came as a surprise to me. As I was driving up a hill, I lost control of my car completely on the wet road, and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car, but I couldn’t. This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road. Again, when I snapped out of my panic mode, the first thing I looked at was the time, and it said 11:11. I’m not one who believes in coincidences, but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me. Even though I don’t believe this stuff, there is NO way that could happen. Has anyone else experienced 11:11, or has randomly been “forced” to look at a clock when it’s 11:11? Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSD/DMT I took? ",11:11,4,nosleep
Jerbsybear,0,,0,1rh5g6,,2,"There are tales of a man committed to Central State

Who killed his wife and children while he asphyxiates

His doctors with the bloody spinal cord

Of his fat nurse, who cares if she was old

When the guards rushed in, it was no problem at all

bashing their brutish faces straight into the wall

Bursting through the heavy front doors

He killed everyone on the first floor

No one would stop him, no, not this time

5 years of waiting, no stopping on a dime

He had to get out on this night

To meet his lover, one at first sight

Taking his science class, year after year

Convinced that she loved him, held him dear

Called her ""favorite student"" and all

Had her parents give him a call

To invite him to dinner, on a cold winter's night

Slaughtered her family, their faces were a sight

In the judge's court, he mercilessly pleaded insanity

When, in reality, it was egotistical vanity

If he couldn't have her, no one can

To kill her new parents was the plan

Standing outside of the house that was soon to be theirs,

Looking to seek justice, to seek what's fair

So as he broke in and brandished the knife

She knew he was back to take a life

So quickly she fled into the night

Leaving behind more victims, as she took flight

She ran two miles straight to the highway

Waving for anyone to stop, to go her way

As hand grabbed her from behind the bushes

His knife drives deeper and deeper as it pushes

Past her vitals and deep into her heart

All flashbacks of her life seemed to fall apart

As he whispers ""This...feels so right""

Her mind tries to escape into the night

The fires of his greed are not yet doused

As he tries to get back to the house

He plans to take another life

While sharpening his serrated knife

""Am I next, is he coming,"" you cry with fear

InsanityInABottle,0,,1,1rgw03,,2,"“Extra, Extra! The Piggy killer is at it again!” Yelled the paperboy, holding a darkened paper above his head, screaming the same phrase over again, as if it was no big deal. I walked towards him and asked him “How much?”
“Only ten cents sir.”
“Ha. Must be a pretty good story then.” I said, as I fumbled for a large dime. I handed it into the boy’s hand, it’s gleam bouncing the light of the sun, veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes. I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper, quickly turning from the boy, hearing “How about a tip sir?”
“How about you wipe your ass with the metal I’ve already given you.” I said back to the boy, who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers. As I walked along Hero’s Avenue, I kept the paper open, reading it over again. In large font, shouted “Piggy killer’s new victim!” with a picture of a woman, apparently known by the name of “Jessica Turrow.” She wore a large smile on her face, as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast, I presumed.
	The article read “The psychopath, depicted as a man with a pig’s head on worn over his own face, has struck again. Witnesses described him as large, while wearing a reddened trench coat, then finally, a bib, which read the term KISS THE COOK, slathered neatly against his chest in gore. He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual, was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn. We had identified the victim, through a ring found on the hand of the woman, who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church. If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description, contact the police immediately, or you may be his next victim.”
	I laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands, all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another, threading the needle on the two way street, not large enough for two cars to fit on.
	I walked towards the police station, which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop, a brothel and a printing office. A police car drove by; it’s loud horn sounding, flashing red and white, reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes. I walked into the station, the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose. A man screamed from across a large waiting room, looking down at the paper, then looked up and said “Oh. It’s the wonderful Flynn. Of course my dear, come, come.” I walked past him, glaring at his smug face, and then opening the door into my office.
	A man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me. He smiled and said, “Well hello sir, I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killer”
“The pig one?”
“Y- wait, there are more?”
“I believe there are, just they might not like attention as much as our friend here.”
“Well… thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept, but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer, coming out of his lair.”
	The man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk, arranging them appropriately. “So, if you look at these pictures, it was for when he first got into the business, holding small weapons, all identifiable, all related to the cutting of meat. Then as you look to the left, these are the later pictures, which are of him coming out, holding bodies on his shoulders, sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up, putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself, all the while in his pig mask. But, he seems to be getting careless. He cam outside, barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo, his face seemed veiled in… something. Something sticky, something gruesome. But if you look closer, you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face. Large, hooked nose, eyes, clouded in blue, teeth, sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouth.”
“Ha. So you’re basically implying that you’ve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it? I beginning to suspect you’re the killer!”
“But that would be silly. Why would a crazy give himself away?”
“I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”
“I believe this conversation is getting a bit heated. I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought I’d tell you where I’ve seen such events. Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on 1800 Bellcove Street? Well there’s your place. Sir!” said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag, which smelled of defecation and nickels. I watched as he slammed the door, then sighed and sat down on my desk, rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter, updating the information I’ve received from the man.
“Mysterious man visits police station, says he has a lead on the piggy killer. As you all know, the notorious killer has crossed the line now. Enough to even be called a serial killer! What a sick bastard he is.” I continued being as pessimistic as possible, updating the paper, then grabbing my camera as I finished the article. Typing in my name, finishing with my name, saying “Written by: Flynn Covetail.”
	Darkness was beginning to shroud the air, perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment. Light rain was spattering against my window, racing down to the bottom of the screening, only to fall against an umbrella below. As I left my office, throwing on my coat, I screamed to the man in the front desk, “Going out to…oh, let’s see...1800 Bellcove Street? If I don’t come back, Phone someone.” I said with a laugh, while walking outside.
	Instantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on “Western Lagoon highway” as the frivolously worthless people would say. I walked down towards the street, which was naught but four blocks from here. I passed by Dontell’s Donuts, Redgar’s Rotisserie and Salam’s Spices, all involved in the fattening of desperate cops, as only fattening diners were located near the station, so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against us.
	I reached the butcher’s place, which had been looted to hell by the anarchists, who were just a group of thugs that didn’t do shit to overthrow the government. The door had been pried off it’s hinges, yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains, hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe. Within the butchery, the first thing I noticed was a bed, a homeless man sleeping on it.
	I simply ignored the bum and walked around, searching for anything considered suspicious. I walked through the door, smelling the bum’s shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could. I looked through the shop, behind the counter I found several rusted knifes, which were corroded to the counter, which was a wooden rotten thing, with three cutting boards lining it, all of which nobody needed. The front of the shop seemed completely normal, but I listened to the bum waking, instantly screaming, “Who’s there! I will kill you if you’re trespassing on my property!” I laughed and screamed to him “I suggest you run out of here, or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes.” I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor, running towards me.
	I quickly turned, backing up against the wall, my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!” I shot to the side of the man, who quickly bolted for the door, a rat following closely behind him. I sat for a minute, catching my breath, while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion. As I stood, I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my head.








	Ha. Damn fool didn’t even know what he had coming. Shouldn’t have fucked with my grandpa… shouldn’t have yelled. My ears hurt. Are they ringing? Why the FUCK am I here? I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air, the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face, the pig’s blood leaking down my neck, warming me, keeping the cold away. I looked at my setup, which was simply the back room of a butcher’s shop, a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a room.
	Blood dripped into wooden bowls I’d gotten from the shop, the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling. Pigs, cows, chickens, even a few deer, but the most stubborn of prey, the pigs. The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling, their wrists cut, their feet missing, their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths. The damned pigs that walked the streets, reading their stories about who? About me! The beautiful man, who is dealing righteousness to the crazies, to the rich. Though they think that they’re so safe in their leather homes, they should be the ones making chairs; their dried hides need to be a part of furniture!
	Oh, what an inventor I will be! But the best part is, nobody looks twice at the photographer. Nobody looks at who’s behind the camera; they only care about the picture! And I am finally the one in the picture! Flynn, the little anus that believed he owned the whole world, because the police were backing him up. NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCH!
	I whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express. I raise him in the air, catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck. This self-conceited asshole needs one thing. A hook curving through the cheek, wrenched from his cheek. He thought I was the killer? NO! THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORD!
	Oh! My friend is waking up! Finally a new toy to play with. Oh, what a joy he will be! Oh no! What will I say to him? I guess I’ll just wing it. I guess I’ll just talk to him.  Where will I display this beauty? Ooh! The police station! Mmm, how delectable would that be? To show the pigs that even their weapons can’t defend them from me. THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME! I am a hero. I love being a hero and don’t try to talk me out of my heroism! I AM AMAING!








	My eyes slowly opened, to find a man in a pig mask, the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on it’s face. I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts! Why does my leg hurt? Where the hell am I? “Oh… you’ve awakened!” spouted the pig; it’s squeaky voice ringing through my ears. I screamed, “Help me! Help! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” 
“Now that’s not how you treat a guest, is it?”
“Fuck you.”
“Oh… language, language my dear friend. If you even try saying something like that, I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend Mr.Squeaks over here!”
	I looked to where he was pointing, which was a large column in the room, a decomposing rat nailed to the pole. “Somebody is going to catch you. They know where I am!”
“Oh, I believe they do, if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say!” said the phsyco with a smile. He pointed at the ceiling, which had two hooks on it, chains hanging from them and a headless man, blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness, into a wooden bowl. “Why are you doing this to these people?”
“Okay, okay, story time. Oh yay, stories! FUCK OFF GREG, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!”
	I looked at the pig with doubt, pain shooting up my leg, throbbing slowly into my brain. “SO, let me tell you why I love my job, okay? Okay. So, when I was twelve, I thought, I’m going to take pictures of weddings! I’m going to take pictures of people in love, because everyone else’s happiness, is mine.” He said this, while pinning his right hand against his heart, which contained an extra few layers of flesh, sewed against his own, along with a tattoo, stolen from his victim.
	“Okay, so anyways! What do ya know! I’m doing that now! I am a photographer! I love people being happy. SO, I one day, was at this one glorious wedding, full of lovely people. I had started talking to a woman and a little, oh what is it called? Fetish of mine was developed. As we were in bed, I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know, I have a few other… kinks. I wrung my hands around her delicate throat, stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth! I felt the rush as eventually, she started to fuckin’ bleed! WHAT A WHORE! She began to cough up blood, she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat, landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched, did I realize how wonderful blood tastes. Rich, creamy, delicious, blood, coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps. I invented ways of sucking people dry, licking them dry! Well, at first I was only an amateur, but, as I got better! Oh BOY did I start to love my job! Every wedding became a slaughter, every wedding gave me a new friend, because after all, nobody cares about who’s behind the camera! NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITS!
	So, pretty boy, I believe it’s time; you… started looking into my eyes, whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body.” He said this as his hand slid down from my chest, slowly down to my cock, grinning, spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed, slid a blade against it as chopped it off. I screamed out loud, blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled, then I fell asleep, never to wake again.

ReiKoroshiya,0,,0,1rgsca,,2,"Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life. Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me out.
how about I start at the beginning that seems easier. Well back in elementary, I was that kid the kid that really no one liked. I had a friend here and there but that's about it. I was basically a social outcast, 
I never really got my work done, I still don't. Note that I was a very, very angry child and no I was not spoiled if that's what your thinking, im the oldest of 3 kids who had been and are growing up in poverty, but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheap.
I had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head. I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the 3rd grade I found an author by the
name of R.L.Stine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interests.
A few of the simple things had scared me, and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind, I don't remember much about my childhood at all.
I don't know why I can't but that's just how it is. I do remember bits and pieces though, not anything like birthdays, mind you. Here Ile give some examples, I remember
when I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes, I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away. Years later I went back and found it, and of course it wasn't scary anymore. Another example
would be when I saw a ""witch"" in my closet, but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there, I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back on.
Once he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again. I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the room
and they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently 
about it. I can't remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly. Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldn't understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys, I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bed(I got top bunk). Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years, not much really
they don't seem to want to talk much about when I was younger. I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church, and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of me.
keep in mind I don't remember that about going to church, as a matter of fact I don't remember going to church at all. hmmm.... well skip forward to middle school where I had
actually made friends. I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny. I could barely even go a week without at least one detention. Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too, now
drugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that, but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I mean
certain ones that is, the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do, smoke, drink, etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and there
is no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I can't afford it and because of that im drug free. Not to much
happened in middle school, only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams (oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so if
say I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it, I also talk in my sleep) which sucks ass, The vast 
majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be home
free. I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won, even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldn't consider it a nightmare. I got my own room in the basement which was nice, and well my brother he was, how do you put it? 
Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that. Electronic malfunctions had started occurring, like waking up to my radio playing static, my alarm clock started to malfunction, etc. I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock 
went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear. Skip forward to highschool in the 9th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a change.
I read the hell out of creepypasta's and found some really cool narrators for them, listening to those was very enjoyable I didn't read scps often and I found a very long series called the holders.
Near the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didn't have a bad feeling to it, the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any sense.
Jump forward one more year, I had flunked my freshman year because I don't do my work. On those professional tests that they make you take S.A.T's or some shit I did 
insanely good on those like I should be an A- student overall. Now i reside in alternative ed. Im 15 right now. I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead of
Baptist a few months ago. Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymore.
That thing I actually saw it, I fucking saw it, it was short like about a foot and a half tall. I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleep
with my blankets over my head. Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away 
from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me. I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it I
think it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day. It might have seen me and it might be watching me type this.
It is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really, really dark, everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around it.

highchairchildren,3,,1,1rgqmu,,2,"I'm looking for any input. If anyone has had experiences like this, is there a way to stop it?

So this started about two years ago. In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling, like something bad was going to happen all the time.  I was anxious, always alert and never at rest. I hardly slept, primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer. 

Then, I started seeing things.

When I say seeings things I don't mean like hallucinations, well not really. I'm not crazy. There were never any voices and there never have been. It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes. 

Mostly accidents.  It happened once while I was sledding.  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about 20 ft. or so where it met a busy road. Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes, people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill. A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened. I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by. There was blood everywhere. I snapped back to reality and looked around. Everything was fine. There was no blood, nobody was hurt, just kids sledding around having fun. 

I continued to have random ""visions"" for the entire year. They varied in severity. The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards.  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner.  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove.  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash.  As I was seeing it, I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove. In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed, begging me to stop.  I snapped back and couldn't speak. I teared up and thought I was going to puke.  I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, sat down on the ground and cried. I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life. I got up and reentered the kitchen, finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened.  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness.  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldn't come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me.  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldn't afford. 

Then it stopped. As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than I'd had before.  It stayed away for a while. I mean really a long time.  I was vision free for an entire year.

I was prompted to write this because I had another one the other.  The first in over a year but I am scared. I don't want it to start again.  The most recent one was more subtle.  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg, somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere.  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain.  Then I flashed back and it wasn't there. I hadn't even cut myself.

I know this must sound crazy, like some Final Destination bullshit.  I swear to you I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't have hopes that someone could help.  Any input is welcomed.",Can anyone help?,3,nosleep
gogo345,1,,4,1rdw2r,,0,"You know when you are really young you're afraid of the dark? You get a night light to make it better but there is always that sense of fear. Is it simply because it's dark? maybe there's a monster in your closet, or maybe it's just in your nature. Sure your parents tell you it's nothing and when you get older you grow out of it but there is always something in the back of your mind that makes you afraid of it. 


Maybe your claustrophobic of the thought of the darkness surrounding you, consuming you to the point where you are trapped not seeing the light again. Maybe your afraid something is watching you sleep. Someone who you don't know just watching waiting for the right time to do whatever he or it wants to do. Kill you?

cavs8,7,,2,1rd3m8,,1,"The following is a recount of a dream I had last night.  This is my first time posting here and writing something like this so I’m sorry if it’s poorly written or riddled with mistakes.  Also, I’m awful at titles.  Thanks for reading. 

I struggle to stay awake at my desk.

“Go home, cavs8, there’s nothing going on today.”

*Thank you.  Why was I even here today, it’s Saturday*.

Grumbling to myself, I drag my feet to the car, get in and turn the key.  Nothing.  Just great.  Well, at least it’s only about a three-mile walk home.  I pocket my keys and think about grabbing my rescue knife for just a fleeting moment.  It’s not the best of neighborhoods but I should be fine walking home.  *Leave it*.

As I make my way down the street, passing one unspectacular building after another, I notice an attractive woman walking a few steps ahead of me.  I smile to myself and try to remember the last time I’ve been with a woman.  She glances back, notices me leering at her like an inexperienced teenager. She slows down.  

*Is she smiling at me*? 

“Hey there, you’re looking a little down.  What’s wrong?”

“N-nothing.” 

It’s a wonder I was able to stammer out any sort of reply.  She’s gorgeous, why talk to me?  Soft face with bright blue eyes that I could only stare at in wonder. Plump lips, coated in pink, oily lip-gloss.  Her jet black hair billowing lazily in the wind.  That damn smile.  

“Well, I was looking to have a good time and you’re more than welcome to join me hun.  For a price.” 

*Oh, now it makes sense. Well, screw it, why not*? 

I nod my head in reply and agree.  I follow her, mind wandering onto more…primal needs.  I should have been paying attention to my surroundings, noting the darker and more abandoned area where I was being led.  We’re walking up old, brittle concrete steps that must have been laid down decades ago before I think clearly again.  Too late to take note of my surroundings now.  The iron railing I grasp is cold and worn down but rough from all the years of exposure.  The air is thick, heavy and smells moldy.  *How can someone even breathe in there*?

We enter the loft.  *Was there something on the door*?  *Did she give me a name*? *I can’t remember anything*. *What was I doing here again*?  My view suddenly shifts to something out of an old video game.  I get a bird’s eye view of the place. It’s all pixelated 8-bit graphics.  One other woman was walking around but I can’t make out any of her features.  *This is…odd*.  I feel a light touch on my shoulder and the whisper of soft words, stealing my attention away from everything else to once again focus solely on her.  Her breath was warm, causing shivers to tremor throughout my body.  My view violently shifts back to my own eyes.  I look to the beautiful, mysterious woman with nothing but a blank look in my eyes.  

""Make yourself comfortable on the bed over there.  We’ll have to wait for our bodyguard to get her before we can have any fun.  He can’t make it until the night so until then, relax."" 

I should have found that last statement weird.  *What time was it*?  *Wasn’t it dark out when we were walking here*?  *Why do we have to wait for a bodyguard now*?  *I’m already here*.  *If I were to do something, wouldn’t I have already done it*?  *Forget it.*  I flop onto the bed and lay down on my back, right leg extended while the left is pulled up as if I’m mirroring the number four with my legs.  The other, indistinguishable woman joins us.  She cuddled up next to me on my right side further emptying my head of what little rational thoughts I had left.  That sweet voice was back in my left ear, talking to me as if I was the most important person in the world.  *When did she make it onto the bed?  Wasn’t she just standing by the doorway?*  

She drapes her unnaturally soft leg over my left leg and blithely draws random designs onto my chest with her fingertips. 

""Alright baby, relax, we’ll be having fun before you know it.""

I can’t wipe this stupid smile off my face.  I close my eyes for what seems like a moment.  When I open them, something is wrong.  Very wrong.  The room that seemed so inviting is now dark and cold.  I can’t see a doorway, just an empty shadowy space that seemed to stretch open like a hungry maw twisting my vision as the room seemed spin uncontrollably.  My heart pounds in my chest.  I look to my right where the other woman once was.  She's gone.  The familiar weight is on my left but I can’t move my leg.  I need to get up.  I need to leave.  I can’t be here anymore.  Get off me!  

The form next to me shifts, straddles me.  Her arms are straight, each palm flat, firmly planted next to my shoulders.  The long, black hair is in my face.  I can feel it faintly brush against my skin.  I try to move her off of me but she won’t budge.  I’m pinned down like a helpless prisoner.  She slowly begins to raise her head.  I notice her once beautiful eyes are now shut.  Bulged, gray eyelids are all that I can see.  Her entire face is now dull, pocked with blemishes.  I start to breathe heavily, close to hyperventilating.  The head continues to rise.  Wake up!  Oh God, wake up! Sometimes wrong!  I try to move again.  My legs won’t work.  My arms won’t work.  I can’t tear away my eyes from her dead, leaden face.  I start to scream.  

My eyes snap open.  I’m home in bed.  I still can’t move my legs.  There’s heavy pressure on my chest and I can’t stop breathing heavily.  There’s a slight outline of a woman above me, face now unrecognizable.  I can still feel her hair on my face.   *Get it off*!!  *Was she laughter at me before I woke up*? *Roll over*.  *Turn on the TV or light or something*! *Anything*.  *Relax….relax…I’m never sleeping on my back again*.

Johnvincent1,0,,2,1rbvri,,1,"The closest thing I have ever documented to a legitimate ghost is a photo that my aunt took last month. My family (mother, three aunts, five cousins and six or seven second-cousins) went to visit my grandparents on their farm in Cairo, New York. The little sparsely inhabited town is about 100 miles north of NYC and about a three hour drive from our home on Long Island. I've been visiting my grandparents up there for years now and have been visiting the farm every summer since I was born (and winter too since my grandparents moved there permanently after they sold their home on LI about 8 or 9 years back). I'm very comfortable up there, even though nights are sometimes a bit eerie due to the streetlights being either nonexistent or widely spread and the nightly barking of wild dogs in the woods surrounding the house.

Anyway, I'm going to try to keep this brief. To the story now.

My aunt and her boyfriend are recently engaged and my aunt used this little opportunity to bring up her boyfriend's parents (who are Italian immigrants) with them to meet my grandparents. This was the first time they ever met in person and the two couples seemed to hit it off quite quickly. It made sense because my grandfather is Italian and pretty much thought that my aunt's boyfriend's parents were really nice and intriguing people, I suppose. 

The time passed quickly and before anyone knew it, it was 2:30 AM. My aunt and her boyfriend decided it was time to take his parents down the road to their rooms at the Bavarian Manor. 

The Manor is a 150 year old Inn that spans many acres and boasts gorgeous lakeside rooms and a peaceful atmosphere. As well as some pretty spooky vibes now and then when the hour is late.

So my aunt and her future husband took his parents down the road, walked them to their rooms and then back down the stairs and started to head back through the lobby when my aunt's boyfriend stops. 

""Hey, this is weird. Did you feel that?""

My aunt looked at him, puzzled. ""No. What are you talking about?""

He shook his head, ""I don't know, I think I just felt something pass us. Something cold.""

My aunt said at that point, she actually did feel a little cold and this scared her. She wanted to leave.

""Wait,"" he said. ""Let's just take pictures. Just one each, me and you, of the lobby and if we don't see anything we'll get out of here. I just have this weird fucking feeling.""

My aunt just looked at him and agreed to do it because she just wanted to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. So she took a picture. And then he took a picture. He looked down at his and frowned. 

""Nothing,"" he grunted. ""What about you?""

He looked over at my aunt and her face was utter stone.

""What? What are you looking at?"" He moved closer and peered over her shoulder. He shivered as he stared down at the phone and saw this...

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/3SAE9Of)

They then sped home and showed everyone who was still awake the photo. Everyone seemed to have the same reaction: Complete and total shock. No one could believe their eyes, and as a family of believers (in the supernatural) we all felt a little shaken to have this (even if it is but a shred) proof from a source in our own family who we know is honest and has no reward to gain in something like this. She just snapped the photo... And that's what came out in it. I still get the chills thinking about going back up there again, which I'll be doing next week (the day after Thanksgiving and for the whole weekend). I'd be lying if I said I wasn't preparing to venture over to the Manor to do some... ""Hunting"" of my own.

Last summer i got a job working at a local car yard. I would usually just strip cars of their parts. It was a nice job but the heat was unbearable. I remember having to go inside every 30 mins just to take a break. one day i was at my station pulling apart a rear end. i had left my tool on my table when i had left to go inside. when i came back out i noticed the tool was gone. i looked every where. i gave up and borrowed another tool from my co-worker. later that day i was locking up what we called the backyard. the backyard was basically a large field where we placed all of are cars. when locking the opening to it i found my tool near when of the cars. i thought maybe the guys there were pulling a prank. i asked them but they said they had nothing to do with it. as the days went by, more and more odd things took place. while at work one day i had noticed the gate to the backyard kept opening and shaking. i thought it was just the wind but something in my mind knew it wasnt. i went to go check it out and see what was making it go back and forth. as i approached the gate something moved behind the car. i yelled out but nothing happened. i stood there for a few minutes, my heart was pounding in my chest. soon i saw movement again i stepped back and without warning a tall dark figure rose up. i stepped back not knowing what to do. i ran back to my station where i had kept a gun. i grabbed the gun and ran back but nothing was there. the next day we put motion sensors just in case the intruder came back, nothing happened that week. the next week i was driving home late and noticed someone was behind me. this was very unusual, since i took a dirt road home. the car soon stopped and turned out its headlights. once i got home i noticed my front door was opened. i sat there in disbelief staring at the opened door. suddenly a dark figure came out of the door. we made eye contact and the figure fled back into the house. i ran inside with the same gun i had at my work. i searched the house for the next hour. the house was a reck, everything had been torn. i was in complete shock not knowing what do to. i called the cops but they weren't much help. the next night i woke up heard banging out side my window. i turned on the porch light and outside there were three men in dark cloths whispering. i soon as they saw me they all looked at me and said something i could not understand. i ran outside but they mysteriously vanished. the following morning i noticed two weird symbols on the wall they had been near. ive tries washing it off but i wont go away. i have since left my job and have never seen them again

ChainerSummons,0,,10,1r79o3,,0,"First, allow me to assure you that I am certain of my sanity and of my cognitive abilities. My name is Zachary Wilhelm.

My logic- whether it is flawed or otherwise, leads me to believe that each person knows fear. Viewing these fears in those I observe shows that it is safe to say that each person has rooted, elemental fears.

More accurately, we are afraid of the unknown within the dark, or more commonly the uncertainty of the future or that of death and what lies beyond.

It is said by some that at one point such irrational fear was more than a leftover disposition from the dawn of mankind. I believe that this collection of fears served our ancestors well, and that they continue to serve us.

I assure you, this phobia is not some obsolete racial trigger. We need this now as much as ever.

There are some of us, maybe even a few of you reading this, who are aware of the presence of the unseen. Aware that existence continues in darkness and that it is possible for that existence to expand beyond our initial perception. Maybe, like me, you feel a pressure in your head and hear a light, squeaking ring just barely audible to you, whispering that the world has changed around you. Others I have met and spoken to say that their first sign of these dangers is a smell of ozone, as if a massive electrical charge had been displaced nearby, rending the air.

I would speculate that we all feel these things from time to time in some form or another, but that it does not register on our conscious level. For those of us that have this sense, that unease may be keeping us intact and connected to the world we know. 

Ask yourself how it is possible in such a modern age of technology and advancement to simply disappear when we interact with so many people on a daily basis. Every day, more people just seem to cease to be. Sure, some... Hell, I'll be generous- MOST of the missing are eventually found either dead, alive, or however they may be found. We'll give it a nice big optimistic percentage of 80%. These pretenses seem solid, even hopeful. Four of five isn't bad at all, right?

What about the other one in five who blinks out of existence, never to return? Every town has that ""One in five"" disappearance that is just... gone- simply gone. It's as if the mist just swallowed them right up, isn't it?

This is just so. That is exactly what is happening. All these obscuring veils appear naturally throughout the world, with no exception. Every continent, nation, town, village... And they are created under predictable and natural conditions. Certainly there is no harm in the morning mists, but have you ever seen fog when the air was too dry and cool to hold it aloft and reason dictates it should simply not be? 

Within these otherworldly variations of nature, the world around you may slip away, and everything outside your vision ceases to be. Sound and light fall away, and you stand utterly isolated in your waning bubble of perception. You may have felt this, as I have. I would prefer to think we all have, but may have suppressed our  fearful senses.

These veils are like the curtains of a stage; heavy and thick and not meant to be crossed by us, the audience. Behind them lies the workings of our world and what may lie further beyond them still- into the epitome of our concept of the unknown or unknowable.

Allycat662,7,,8,1r67oh,,0,"Have you ever ran into *those* type of people that just fucking grate you the wrong way; the arrogant ones who get away with tons of shit and know they can get away with it?  Not the instances where you rise above it and claim your stake... but the more helpless cases.

You just want karma to intervene and give that little prick what's coming to them.

Energy work is something that I've been doing for over half my life, and there are ways to speed karma up on certain individuals who you feel have done grievous injustices to yourself and others.  There are definitely other ways to handle things of course, but I'd rather not have to kill people.  There are important lessons to be learned of karma and the desire to do harm to others.  There's a creed out there stating that whatever energy you put out into the world, you will get the same energy back threefold.


The first time I used energy against a person was when I was 14.  I did a stupid harmless love spell to get a crush of mine on a date.  He did agree on the date, but of course he got back with his ex.  Total energy backfire.

The second time I used energy against a person was a year later as a sophomore.  There was a really cute upperclassman I talked to all the time.  He told me that his long term relationship was crumbling and he just didn't feel it anymore.

His girl at the time was a likeable person, but she had an air of snottery about her I found irritating.  One day she walked by me while I was at my locker, and I threw my energy at her aggressively.  I didn't wish anything specifically, but the following Monday she walked into school with a broken leg in full cast.  Holy fucking shit.

Now, this may be just me, but I felt horrible about it.  And I got hurt too in return that same day in gym class.  I didn't break anything but it was an embarrassing situation since the cute upperclassman happened to share that class.

At this point I stopped using my energy against people.  I can do without the concequences. Until recently of course.  

I happened to stumble across a jerk-ass individual who was offensive in so many ways, it made my blood boil.  I don't use my energy against people anymore, so I did the next best thing:  I invoked the power of karma on their ass.

I collected the energy around me and made a silent plea to karma to give this asshole the karma coming to them.  I made the same plea another 12 times or so for good measure.  And karma answered in the form of physical pain against the offender.

Fml, what a frightening gift to have.  At first I gave in to karma and did nothing, but eventually I made another plea to karma that this person has had their karmic obligation fulfilled and to cease all further efforts (with a polite thank you).

The pain did subside, but gradual and slowly.

Now, I'm not going to say that this will work for all of you, and I'm sure it won't have much affect on situations much bigger than yourself, but I know that there's got to be some redditors out there that have done similar things.",Karma can be purposful. Can you use it?,8,nosleep
chocate,2,,5,1r5o4c,,1,"Cold nights, always cold.It gets really hot and you can actually feel the sun burn your skin but always always cold during the night. I was 10-11 years old at the time. I never met my father and my Mother left me and my brother with my Grandparents so she could work and give us a better future. Cold always cold. Constantly reminding myself that i was alone felt really cold. I had began to do bad in school, my grades were not the best. My mother had worked so hard for us, and all i could ever think was about how lonely i felt. I had my brother at my side but it always fell lonely. My heart had become a cold hard rock, always wanting to be loved but unable to.  10 years had already pass and i still remember how it felt, cold and yet so comforting. It felt like it understood me, and yet it felt so cold. 

I had always being a rebellious kid, always speaking my mind out. Never accepting what others thought is the right thing. I had developed my own acceptance of reality, i had to grow up fast and i was surprised at how childish the decisions of other kids were. i laugh at them, i saw them as lowly living creature. But those were my supposed friends. Always lonely no matter where i went, i was always fell left out. That feeling trigger my hated, and made me realized how superior i was to them. My heart was cold and i didn't care anymore. i just want to grow up fast and become something worthy of someone's live. 

i had done something real bad that night. Me and my brother were locked up in my old house. It was a flat with 3 rooms, it was old and falling to the ground, there were cracks all around. the windows were holding up somehow. My ant was really angry at me and my brother, she had always threaten us, saying that she would lock as up in that place. The place was were i was born, it was the place where i had grown up, it was the place where i saw my mother cry every day. Since the new house was built there was no need for me to go to the old house. There was nothing there after all. All empty and always so cold.  This night was no different everything was so dark, the only light you could see was the moon light. i could feel a chill going down my spine, i could feel my heart feeling been comforted, i felt like i belonged. Since we moved to the new house i couple of years ago, that place always scared me. Every time i went there i always left running,i always felt like something was always looking at me from behind, calling me, wanting me to stay there. There was always this malevolent presence, it didn't feel right. 

This night somehow was different, there was no presence, i couldn't feel anything. It was just cold. My brother was everything i had, a year younger independent as me, always looking strong as if nothing could ever hurt him. GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!! i heard him scream, his screams hold so much fear and so much loneliness, it sent chills down my spine. Every time he screamed i felt like if someone was patting on my back, rubbing his hand on my back. Cold, cold as my heart. I couldn't bear to see my brother so vulnerable, GET US OUT OF HERE!!!!! i could hear my self screaming. So much anger, it felt so good to scream my lungs out. It felt so good to finally scream my lungs out with no restrain. we scream for hours with no stop. 

I had some matches in my pocket, we lit up a fire with it which didn't last long. We had a metal bucket and some old would that had stay there. The fire didn't last long, as if there was not enough oxygen around. Even the burning fire felt so cold. we kept scream, asking to get us out of there. We been locked up for hours, it was already past midnight. You could see the moon and the starts, thousands of them. yet it was so dark and as always so cold. 

We screamed so much we felt as if our energy was being sucked in my something.  I felt week and light headed.  It suddenly got colder and colder, it was past midnight after all, it only gets colder. Suddenly we hear something scratching the door, as if it wanted to get in, and couldn't. It fell desperate, my aunt had the key and only her could open the door. There was no other way of opening it. There was no key sound, nothing everything fell as if space had been altered somehow. No key sound and the door just opened. No words, nothing, no one said anything. Me and my bother was left the room as if nothing had happened, as if it was something we been used to seeing. 

We were walking side by side and he stayed behind. I cold had touched my shoulder, i touched its had and i felt a cold metal around his finger. I never got to hear his voice, but i new that he told us to just go and he will come later after he closes the door. 
The night was cold and my heart didn't feel cold anymore, i just fell so much sadness, i no longer felt lonely, although i always kept wishing to have someone who would love me for who i am. 
We walked down to the new house, it was two story house, the biggest house in the whole town. It had big windows. As we saw walked down, we looked at the window a shadow rush upstairs, the night was quiet and we never heard doors being opened or close. I didn't fell scared, it was as if i knew who it was, and i knew nothing wrong or bad would happen to be or my little brother. 

Me and my brother were the only guys living in that house, and my aunt was staying there that night, it was her turn to sleep over. her sister and her used to take turns everyday to take care of me and my bother. There were no men living there. and there never was. I never gave it much thought. All the entrance doors in the house were locked, he had to climb our way up to the second floor to get in the house. When we went into the room where my aunt was, she was sound sleep and didn't wake up till the next day. 

After 5 years i finally met my mom, and finally met my dad. I told them what had happened that night. I told them about the ring, i told them about him.  At first they told me that it was probably my aunt trying to teach us a lesson, but she wasn't that tall, no one can be that cold, and no one in my family wore a ring.  later on i asked my mom again, and she finally told me that, i while ago my one of my uncles used to sleep there, when he was drunk. He was tall man, was married and never had any kids of his own. One day, i still remember hearing that they had found him death in his room. He had hanged him self living everyone of his family wondering why he had done it. No one knows till now. Without knowing me and my brother had called him, had woken him up from his sleep, and by taking our energy was able to take his human form and free us from that room. He said that he would come back, i had never stopped waiting. ",Cold Shadow,6,nosleep

My brother got into an argument about it. They were upstairs while I was downstairs at the completely other end of the house. My brother just shouted ""theres no demons in the house"" when I started to notice a rattling sound. We have these French doors that we hung stain glass pictures and animals on. My dog started growling under her breath looking at the door. I walked over to check it out. The only one rattling was a stained glass picture of Jesus. As soon as I got to the door the picture fell to the floor at my feet. I jumped back and a chill ran through me. The picture did not break. I put the stained glass back up and tried shaking the door in different ways but I could not even get it to rattle an inch.

So, a little over a year ago, I posted a couple of different things that happened to me back in 2005. There were a couple of things that happened between here and there, that I never got around to posting too. Anyway, here I am. Over a year later in the hopes that someone can help me, because something similar has recently happened.

So, while the other stories took place in NC, this all happened in MD. It happened about a week or two before Halloween. And all of this was very close together, and it all happened at my girlfriends house in Baltimore, Arbutus area for the locals. Her mom and younger brother have been living with her for almost a year now, until her mom can get back on her feet due to some unrelated, personal issues. I'm only bringing this particular thing up, in case someone may find it relevant. Her brother is 14. Mom, she's over 50, if not right at 50. Now...
After dinner one night, we were all sitting around the table talking. I excused myself to go shower. I have to get up at 4:30 in the morning, and generally just shower the night before work so I'm not in a groggy rush. So, I'm in the shower and they're, doing whatever it is they do as far as I know. I remember, and never will forget probably, the feeling of something tap me on the shoulder. It didn't necessarily feel like a finger. I pushed it out of my head almost immediately thinking I had brushed the wall or a towel or something. And that was it. That was all that happened in there. I got out, dried off and put on some clothes and left the bathroom. It was quiet in the house. No chatter, no tv and no video games. I just assumed everyone went to bed and headed upstairs to the attic bedroom my girlfriend sleeps in. It was dark, minus the flickery light that turned out to be a bunch of candles in the middle of the floor. My girlfriend, and her mother, playing with a Ouija board. They asked if I wanted to play, and I simply refused. Part of me wanted to leave because those things make me uncomfortable as it is. But I just layed down on the bed and tried to sleep. Mostly watching them. Mostly feeling uncomfortable whenever one of them giggled about it, or laughed and said it was stupid, which bothered me quite a bit. They were done when, after the second or third try, mom turned the disc, or whatever it's called, upside down and said she was done. They put it away and that was that. It dawned on me later that whatever I felt in the shower, would have happened about the time they started with their ouija seances...

So, a few nights later, I'm back at her house. I haven't heard of anything and honestly put the whole thing out of my head. That night, I woke up, at almost the exact same time she did. I looked at her, while she looked forward to the head of the bed, and immediately screamed. And not like a jumpy, something at the movies jumped out at me scream. Pure terror. I pulled her close and cradled her, and didn't see or notice anything. I turned on the light. Nothing was there. What she described to me was so horrifyingly familiar. She said, at the head of the bed, not 3 feet away, stood a figure. Not actually standing though. More like, bending over and reaching out for her. She told me two days later what actually woke her up was she heard something talking in the room, that said in a whisper ""what should we do with her?"" That's when she looked up and everything happen. I did make a mental note that it was after 3 o'clock. The only reason I noted it is because after calming her down, realizing I had less than an hour until I had to go to work. She got up and left when I left. The reason I say this one in particular is horrifyingly familiar, and wanted me to come to you with this in the hopes someone may be able to help me figure something out, is if you'll read the story at the top ""2005"", it's almost the same thing.

Now, I'm an atheist. I haven't prayed in years. And my girlfriend knows this. I'm not against it. I'll pray along to be respectful if the family is praying at dinner, or at a funeral. But one night, she woke me up shaking. Telling me that the room didn't feel right. And she was scared. She asked me to pray with her. Like, she wanted me to say a prayer for protection. I didn't know how to react, but this was extremely out of the ordinary for her. So I went with it. And after a minute of reaching into the back of my head for things to say, she started breathing slower. Calmer. She let me finish, then thanked me and said ""I think it worked"". She laid down and eventually, we both fell asleep.

The only things other than little squeaks and creaks, which could honestly just be the house being a house and making house noises, was when she was downstairs trying to sleep I guess. She didn't sleep in her room for a while unless I was there, and as I just recently moved to night shift, that's been a lot. Anyway, she said she heard her brother upstairs leaning in the chair, which he does while he plays on his laptop. So she sends him a text. A simple ""stop leaning"". Not a minute later, the text comes back and says ""I'm in bed"".
That's all I know or have heard for right now. I've spent fewer nights there since all that happened. Her mom burned sage in the room, or whatever the cleansing plant is (sage right?). Said some prayers. And I'm hoping that's it.",So this recently started happening again,1,nosleep
JohnFrostNeruda,0,,5,1r1agn,,1,"I stalked my prey carefully from a distance.  He was large, and somewhat clumsy, the perfect target. The fact that he was a bully made this even sweeter.

I had just moved to a new city after my sister's ""tragic"" suicide.  Adjusting was tough for all of us, especially for me since I had a hard time connecting with people.  Hell back then I didn't even want to. I preferred to be solitary.  Back then was tough because I felt empty inside. Nothing I did seemed to fulfill me. I was my own abyss. 

This kid started to pick on me one day. Don't even know why, he just did. I never took the time to learn his name. He walked passed me in the courtyard during lunch and casually referred to me as a faggot to his friends. They snickered and kept walking.  I couldn't tell you why that made me so angry. Perhaps I...how would you say it...snapped. A small voice told me in the back of my head to extinguish him. It was minuscule at first, like a small piece of gravel in my shoe.

The next day it got louder.

And louder.

And louder.

The voice didn't bother me that much. I was intrigued by it. I wondered what would happen if I carried out its request. I acquired one of my mother's kitchen knives. A small one, as I didn't want to overdue it, and sharpened it a little. I then put on a black hoodie and began the hunt.

When I found my target, he was enjoying a smoke against a wall next to the school.  He was alone. I made careful strides towards him, listening to the voice inside my head grow louder with anticipation. I firmly gripped the knife handle, and as my target was walking to his car, plunged it into his side. I felt the blade slowly drive into the kid's soft flesh and his blood came oozing out onto my knuckles. He wheezed and gasped for air as blood filled his mouth. I stabbed him again, and he fell to the ground watching me watch him die. It took a couple of minutes but he finally stopped moving. I will admit that the rush of euphoria I received after the kill still makes the hair on my head stand up. For the first time, I had actually felt something. My legs quaked as I walked back home and cleaned of my mom's knife.  I grinned stupidly as I put it back on the rack. Ah, what a rush.

But then the feeling was gone,and I was back to my familiar emptiness.  There was only one solution to that. The voice agreed.

I grew up in a pretty cool family. They wanted my brother and I to stay 'innocent' as long as they could so they always told us they believed in all that stuff as well. Anyway, every Christmas Eve, we went outside and looked up into the sky to see if we could see Santa. We usually saw nothing, but this one Christmas was different. We had been outside for about ten minutes, seeing nothing but stars. We were getting ready to go inside when I noticed something. It seemed like nothing at first, but then I noticed it was moving. It looked like an illuminated line flying in a zig zag pattern through the night sky. At the time, I figured it was proof that Santa was real.

I saw a man in a hood, I couldn't see his face but it looked liked he was focused on me. I went home and I saw my dog Oscar. He crawled up to me as usual but then I close my eyes and I see him with no fur, no skin and no visible pupils. He barked at me in such a monstrous way I screamed in pure panic and when I opened my eyes again he was normal again and he was confused by my scream.

I saw my family sitting on a bench smiling, but then the hooded man came from behind them and shot them all in the head.

You might remember my journal entries from last month. Last month, I can't believe it's been that long. Days and weeks run now in an endless loop. Where I am now time doesn't matter. It's a nuisance, it's a hinderance. 

A lot has happened. I just wanted to let those who cared, who reached out to me, know that I am alive. Very much so. And I have met some friends. Real human beings. There is so much I want to tell you. So much I want to explain. But I can't. Not now. 

Just know that the monster under your bed is real. That shadow in the closet exists. And those voices, the voices you hear in the dead of the night are not your imagination. All your life you have been told horror stories. And now you seek them out, on this subreddit. To be entertained, to be thrilled. But these stories exist for a reason. Every story has a truth. A small bit of reality wrapped around trigger words and exaggeration. 

That truth is what lurks in the shadows of your house, just at the corner of your eye. The truth is what is waiting for you when you close your eyes to sleep, hoping for a peaceful night's rest. But nothing is peaceful in the dark. Where the light is eclipsed by the slithering, rotting presence that knows you oh so well. One day you'll know. You will wake up and know. All those stories. All those scary tales. All those fears.

bass_slapper,0,,2,1rh8lh,,0,"*You think me cruel. No. I’ve only learned to act on what I’ve been given. I’ve learned to deal with my problems in my own way. No one understands this but me it seems. This is for ME, I don’t do it for them. But they can’t understand my need. He can’t either. I must make me. Make him understand. How did he get here? I wish I came back. I want him back. WHY WON’T I COME BACK WHY IS HE HERE ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SOR-*

Past this the note is unreadable, spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people. Not that I’d really want to read much more anyways. I already know what happens. Well, not really “know”, but I can feel it. Who wrote it? I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson, if he’s even my uncle. What is this? No clue. A note, obviously, but beyond that speculation reigns. Where did I find this? My new house, in a drawer. Nothing is inherently terrifying about that – Oh, except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there. I just missed it before, I keep telling myself. I half believe it. A few pills later and I’m not worrying about it anymore.

Before this, I didn’t even know I had an Uncle Drewson, let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely, but now enacted, demise. With a heavily estranged family, growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility, one loses track of aunts and uncles. It was in a familiar neighborhood, a spacious three bedroom, so I was in no way eager to turn it down. As a poor, regularly unemployed person I’d been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldn’t afford anywhere else. I thought, it’ll all be worth it one day, the day I make it in the world. I can pay all these people back tenfold. “The day I make it”, yeah right. A consistent – and more pressingly, free – living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes. So I was moved in within a couple weeks. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life, I was content.

You know when you think back to something embarrassing, stupid, or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger, brasher days? Once you recall it, it starts eating away, regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts, till you would give the world to go back and change it, or at least erase the memory. Imagine that, only you can’t remember what it was you’ve done. It’s simply gone from you. The more you try, the less you realize. The less you realize, the more you regret. The more you regret, the more you try. That’s what’s happening to me, ever since I moved here. But it even goes past that. It’s the sudden feeling you’re being watched from barely out of sight. And at the same time, a crushing loneliness in that feeling. I pop a few more pills. Of course, I’m not being watched. There’s no one else here. If you think you’re being rather clever, figuring this out, oh-no-someone’s-been-in-the-house-with-you-all-along, I was most certainly the only one here. Anyway, this was about the time I found the note. If it was this Drewson, what is he talking about? Who does he want back? What is his need? Do I even want to know the answer to any of these? Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do, personal preference notwithstanding. Putting it all to the back of my mind, I chop up steak for dinner. I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef, particularly where matters of slicing and/or dicing are concerned. I once worked a sushi bar, as a side job to pay the bills, and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe, like you see in commercials. Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customer’s eyeball. Maybe I’m not quite as proficient as I thought… I grab the bottle of pills and take a few. I don’t really like thinking about that time in my life.

I’m digging through my drawer later, that same drawer, when I stumble upon another discovery. Instead of a clue, it only deepens my mystery. A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board. I carefully remove it, and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find, my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses. I think, this will perhaps answer some questions about the note, and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusion’s implications. As per your previous assumptions, I couldn’t be farther from the truth. I secure the stick in its dock. View files. Two folders: “Reminders” and “Media”. Reminders is empty, media contains one subfolder: “Vids”. I open the folder. Two more: “memories” and “triggers”. Memories is empty. I open triggers. I’m confronted with one video file: shotinthedark.wmv. It’s 0:40 long. I press play.

Before I continue, if you’ll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this. I’m a massive horror movie fan, and I like them brutal. The more blood and guts, the better. I like truly graphic, heart wrenching stuff, and I very rarely squirm at it. Three seconds into shotinthedark.wmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out. The scene I’m immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs. There is a single light source on the chair, but I can faintly make out a figure in the background. Then, without a word, the man’s brains are ejected out his face, accompanied with a thunderous bang. Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground. Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt, accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life, likely flooded by fear, but life. I don’t have too much time to process anymore; I’m preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket. I think, it must be fake, but I know it’s not. I’ve got to tell someone about this, I think, the police, someone. Yeah, I’ll talk to the cops. Then, over my subsiding retching, I hear a familiar voice utter “Are you sorry now?” in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler. Something in that voice is chilling. Something… I return my gaze to the computer screen, where the barely visible figure now stands in full view, smiling.

I recognize the smile too.

It’s me, smiling back at myself, gripping a smoking sawed off.

The computer screen goes black. My head spins. I lie down.

He was caught with drugs and his school wanted nothing to do with it. He moved, now resides in york, Pennsylvania and now goes to William Penn High. He moved to a house which was quite old and just had some renovations a while back. The rent was quite cheap so his mother said ""why not?"". I was one of Jordan's first friends, since moving to york he told me things about that house really strange things. He soon moved away a little after I moved away so I have no idea where he is now. If any of you happen to live in york I'm talking about the old burned down house on market street across the street from the kindergarten/daycare. This story takes place about 2 years before the house burned down. 

A month since school started and about two weeks since I started talking to Jordan he invited me over to his house. Jordan said ""cmon dude come and stay the night my moms gone and im pretty sure wont give a shit"". So I thought why not I haven't spent the night at a friends house in a while ""yea sure ill spend the night man"". We went around town skated for a while, went to McDonald's with a few other friends then it came around 10 or maybe 11 everyone was ready to go home and i was ready to just go to a place and chill, play video games, and maybe eat some more. We got to his place, sat down in the living room, and lit up a blunt. Playing grand auto 3, high off our asses, we ordered some pizza. We ate and everything was fine till I felt like heading over to the bathroom. As soon as I opened the door I notice under the sink there was like a small cabinet and the doors slammed shut. I was high so I didn't really questioned it much. I used the bathroom and then as I exit I suddenly hear a giggle coming from under the sink. A child's giggle, as if there was a kid under the sink playing hide'n'seek or something. Again I did not question it because I was high and didn't really wanna bother finding out what made the noise. Jordan passed out on the couch, I went to his room and tried to sleep on his bed. I remember waking up around four in the morning hearing footsteps and a child giggling I'm pretty sure it was a little boy. I couldn't really tell his age but he was young; I would guess around six or seven. He was running around the house and he stopped at the door I did not see him, I only ever got to see his outline. He said "" I'm really happy I got more friends to play with now"". Suddenly after that he vanished faster than I could blink. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I had goosebumps for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually I  calmed myself down by eating pizza and watching TV.",Hide 'N' seek,6,nosleep

The trees moved in the night air, and made the shadows in my room move, and form together, and look like monsters. I watched the shadows, which actually do not help to watch, for they only offer uneasiness to the human soul, and you find no comfort. If I hadn't watched those shadows I wouldn't have noticed the slight movement that didn't go exactly with the shadows. It was dark, and I felt I was probably seeing something. But I thought I saw a dark shape in those shadows. It moved like the shadows, but it moved slower, and I thought I heard the soft scrape of a boot. I watched the shadows ever moving.

I wanted to hop out of the bed, and rush out the door, but I feared that if my feet touched the floor, then that thing, or something else would surely get me. I heard a sound from behind me, and being in the frightened state I was in, I about fell out of the bed. Clinging to the side of the bed, tangled in the blankets and sheets, I felt like I was about to die. I looked up for the source of the sound and it was just a tree branch scratching the window. I felt relieved at this, and I kind of relaxed, forgetting about the thing in the shadows. I pulled myself back into my bed, turned and saw a darkened shape at the end of my bed. I felt the fear shoot through me again. I felt no thoughts, nothing, only the cold dark fear. I watched as the shape moved ever closer to my bed. I felt paralyzed, as if I couldn't move, speak, or let alone do anything. The shape moved ever closer. I felt a sound coming from the back of my throat, but it never escaped my lips. My mouth did not open, nor did the sound fully come out. The shape soon climbed slowly onto the bed, and moved closer to the lumps under the blankets, my legs. I felt myself start to tremble, but I still felt like I was super glued to my bed. I wanted to close my eyes, maybe it was a dream. It kept climbing up my bed, and I felt something off of it lightly slid against my leg. I felt myself tremble and shake even more. Soon the face was just inches from mine. I felt its hot breath on me, and the smell that emitted from its mouth wasn't that great either. I wanted to turn away, maybe get some fresh air, but I felt still frozen. It took one of its hands and pointed a finger at me. Though I could not see very well, it looked like instead of nails, it had sharp claws. It took the claw and lightly probed my face. The pain of the claw protruding my skin was unimaginable. It didn't feel like a cut from a knife or such. It felt like someone was burning my face. It took the claw and ran it down my whole face, and the fiery feeling intensified. Then I woke up, trembling, and drenched in cold sweat. I was thankful that it was a dream. But something about that dream made me still sit there terrified for my life. I looked out the window, at the cold moon shining its equally cold glow into my room, making shadows. Those shadows made me dwell more on my dream, and I closed my eyes, but all I could see in my mind was the dark shape crawling up my bed...and then the unimaginable agony that came from that claw cutting a gash into my face. I suddenly had the need to feel my face. I reached up slowly, my hand slightly trembling, fearing that it wasn't a dream. My hand finally connected with my face, and from instincts, I flinched, but there was nothing there, but cold sweat stained smooth skin. I shuddered a sigh of relief. I knew there was no getting back to sleep, so I decided I might as well go downstairs, and at least drink some tea or coffee, maybe even milk. Maybe it'd calm me down. I slid out of the bed, and headed slowly down the stairs. The silence was a little unnerving as I walked down the creaky steps. The dream still haunted my mind. I tried to shake the feeling that it gave me away, but it just wouldn't fade from mind. I finally reached the kitchen, and turned on the light. I opened up the refrigerator, and pulled out the jug of milk. I poured some into a glass, and slid it into the microwave, and heated it up. Once done, I pulled the warm glass out, and I headed into the living room, and turned on the TV to try to forget the dream. The TV's light washed over the room, and I watched as people spoke about things not at all important in this world. I took a drink of my milk, and watched the people on the screen. I soon felt myself falling asleep. I woke up, the TV was off. I didn't remember turning it off. It was still dark out, I looked at the clock, it read 1:46 AM. I swore it had to be later than that. I pulled myself from my bed, and I headed up the stairs to my room once more. I laid there in my bed for what seemed like hours. I rose up and looked at the clock, it said 1:46 AM. I blinked, was the clock broken? I walked over, and unplugged it, but it did not turn off. It remained shining lightly in the dark, reading 1:46 AM. I backed into my bed, and fell on top of it. I heard something from the window. I looked over and saw a face. The features were inhuman, I felt the fear paralyze me. I couldn't look past the face staring at me. Where its eyes should be, were empty looming dark sockets, the nose, a pig snout, and the teeth like a saber tooth tiger, and it had black curly messy hair on its head. It reached a hand up to open the window, and I saw the unmistakable clawed fingers. My nightmare had come to life. I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound emerged. The window opened slowly, and the creature quietly hit the floor. It moved slowly towards me. I heard its heavy breathing as it drew nearer, and nearer still. I closed my eyes, hoping it'd go away, but fate would not help me there. I felt a weight on my bed, and my eyes shot open. I looked into those looming sockets, and then my mouth opened and I screamed. The scream was not heard though. It was as if the world was dead. The creature took its claw up, and slowly sliced my skin, carefully, and only in certain places, as if it was a planned process...for some reason. It finally crawled off me, and left the room, and closed the window softly. I laid there in the bed bleeding slowly, the pain ebbing out of my body, feeling like hot hell fire. That's when I noticed my clock was off now. I laid there, relieved that it was gone...but those eyes...those dark looming eyes, would burn my mind forever.",Dark Looming Eyes,2,nosleep
xcalubur,0,,6,1r9pfe,,0,"This story takes place about 8 years ago.

I was working as a data entry clerk at the local newspaper.  My hours were 9-6, but I would stay after 6 in order to complete my duties.  I would also come in one Saturday a month to complete my month end duties.  Often I was left by myself in my department.  Nothing strange, but I would always feel like I was being watched.  Could never shake that feeling.  I never felt that i was in danger, and if I focused on the feeling long enough I would freak out a bit.

I finally came clean to some co-workers about that feeling.  Of course they mocked me, and asked the types of drugs I was using.  Nothing major, I knew they were having fun and just continued my duties.  Later that same day, my co-worker Toon who was mocking me the most came to my desk.  Mind you we had open cubicles, two desks on one side, 4 desks in the middle, and three desks on the other side.  I was part of the 4 desk area.  She asked me to describe what was watching me.  I explained to her it was a feeling and I never saw anything. 

6 o'clock came around and everybody was gone.  I was waiting for my 700+ page end of week report to finish printing so I could drop them off on the desks of all the department heads.  I was waiting at the 2 desk cubicle where the department printer was located.  This was G's desk.  She had a whole bunch of pictures on her wall and I was just looking at each picture.  Again, that feeling of being watched came over me, but stronger than before.  I turned to my head and saw it....rather her.  5 feet away from me, there was a head floating in the air.  She was some sort of gray color.  I was able to take in her features.  Medium straight hair, round face, the hair kind of hugged her face.  She popped, like a bubble pops in the air.  I was so anxious to get out of there so I could go home and get ready for my date with my girlfriend.  I grabbed the report, distributed them, and I was out.  On the 25-30 minute drive home, I was reflecting on the day and playing it over in my head.  Half way home I realized I came face to face with a ghost.

Basically, this is a very scary apartment. Shortly after I saw the girl, things got quiet. I stopped watching TV alone in the house and started going to church more. When my mom, who didn't have a job, would leave the house, I would often tag along or go in my room where my sister and I both slept. she was 5 so she doesn't have any recollection of anything.

One day, it was a rainy day and my sister's friend had a birthday party. I was invited for some reason. It was a rainy, gloomy day but the festivals were making everyone happy so I guess I was happy as well. The party was very expensive as they were sorta rich and there were tons of events and foods and things to do. But enough of that story.
After we left the party, my parents decided to go to church. Naturally, as a energetic 9 year old, I was reluctant to leave so I told my parents to drop me off at home with my sister. The house was dark and it was raining so I was a little scared. but, once my mother had tucked me into bed, I fell asleep and I thought that was the end of that.
I believe I slept until night time because I heard the front door closing. I thought it was my parents so I yelled to mom, telling her I was hungry. But there was no reply. Instantly, I was awake and my pulse was pounding. I was suddenly paralysed (with fear? I don't know) and I could only watch as I heard footsteps come up the stairs. My sister, I could hear her breathing underneath me (we had a bunkbed) but she didn't seem hear a thing.
             
Then a creak, and moan as my bedroom door opened. I watched as a shadow grew between my feet and hovered over me. I believe I passed out with fear or something cause the next thing I knew, I was waking up and it was later at night and my parents really came home.

A couple days later, my sister came home with a drawing. i asked her what it was as I shivered in fear. She told me that she had seen the thing I saw, except it spoke to her while I was sleeping that day. It told her that it was related to her, that it knew mom. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I never told mom, who was still having nightmares about her miscarriage. But could it be the sister I never had?

The happenings that have lead up to Tuesday night. I don't remember everything that happened to leading up to it. I tried to go to sleep early because I moved out of my house last month and I had been getting terrible sleep because I am forced to sleep on an air mattress. I am also staying at a friends house till I am able to move into my next house. I went to sleep around seven at night and them woke up at eleven that same night. I couldn't get back to sleep no matter how much I tried so I decided to start watching tv. After a while I got really thirsty so I went down stairs to get a drink of water. After I finished the water my stomach started to feel up so I went into the bathroom. I finished up in there and as I was leaving I started to get a feeling like a was being watched. I can even remember having the same feeling in the bathroom but I ignored it and just tooled around on my phone. Nevertheless I hurried up stairs and it felt as though I was being followed. I decided to ignore it and just lay down with my eyes closed and calm down. I did this for the next roughly thirty minutes and drifted off to sleep. With in minutes of me sleeping I again had the feeling of being pinned down and could not move. It had been months since the last time this happened but it almost felt as though it was going to happen. I cannot better explain the part other than I just new it was going to was coming. So after that I was a little freaked out but it had happened so many times in my past that I would get more annoyed than anything else. I then had a hard time falling asleep again. It took me hours to fall back asleep but nothing happened after I woke up I just would stay there in the bed annoyed that I could not fall back asleep. I am not sure if this is being triggered by the stress of me moving or what is happening. Alls I know is that I want it to stop.

""My grandmas glowing! And my dad!"" He said, coming back in the room.

 I frown. ""Your grandmas been dead for years."" I say, chilled. 

I wake up again with my husband hitting the bed. ""I just got in bed."" He said. That was odd. Why would he say that? I heard the footsteps again. I gasp, then scream and push away.

 But I can't scream. Not properly. It will barely come out. I hit my head and I wake up, with another gasp. My husband gives me a weird look.

I climbed the stairs and entered the bathroom and after certain events happened that I am not going to describe because I am not gross, I got up then washed my hands and went to the door which is when I heard a BANG! right on the door so I did what all manly people do..... locked the door and hid in the bathtub. Soon I began hearing foot steps but not just any footsteps but boots like combat boots on a hard wood floor. After about 5 minutes of marching I heard whistling of a man and the faint singing of a woman. This went on for about half an hour.

We were watching Toy Story 3 in my downstairs, and we have 2 pillars downstairs to support our house and the framing on a the one behind the couch is loose, so sometimes it snags on clothes and makes a loud noise when it hits the pillar. So, we were close to the end of the movie, and we heard the loose framing hit it like someone pulled it away from the pillar. We all automatically stopped and looked at each other for about a minute, then we got up and ran to my room. We had to go past the pillar to get to my room so it snagged on my blanket and made the snapping noise again, which made everyone go faster. The rest of the night, we all kept hearing footsteps walking around like they were looking for something. It hasn't happened again since that night.",Just a normal night,3,nosleep
Hors2018,2,,14,1rbmky,,0,"John held me close as I cried. Again, it had happened again. I broke and my family had ridiculed me for it telling me to go hide in a cave and die. I was weak, that was what was hurting the most. I failed.

""It's okay,"" John whispered in my hair and I continued to sob, my entire body violently shaking with the force of them.

""No it's not,"" I whispered, ""I can't be like this anymore, I don't ever want to do this again!"" John pulled back and searched my face. His black eyes probing. He slowly nodded.

""I want to show you something,"" He said. I looked up at him quizzically, my face showing my confusion. I trusted him though so I slowly stood up from the log I was perched on. He took my hand and led me to the picnic table that was in our woods, my family rarely ever used it for anything, it just sat there for throwing sticks on. But now there was definitely something on it.

""John?"" I whispered. He glanced back at me.

""Trust me, this will make it easier for you to control your emotions,"" I nodded and stepped up closer behind him. Navanod was standing over by it and glanced up as we got close. I peered around John and saw what was there. A man, tied down, I glanced at Navanod who silently stared back before I looked again at the man.

He was bleeding already, a small trickle that formed tiny puddles beneath him. A small smile crept onto my features and Navanod turned his attention to John, ""She's ready,"" Was all he said. John nodded and pulled the knife he always had in his belt out.

Going over to the man he barely pierced the skin before glancing at me. I had moved in closer, fascinated by what was happening, the man on the table fought against the straps screaming. I glanced at the house to see if anyone heard before looking back at John. He stopped making small cuts and finally pushed the knife deep into the man's skin. The man screamed and I was suddenly all the way at the table, perched on the edge, staring wide eyed at the thick stream of blood spurting out and pooling beneath the man and the table. The thick red liquid sinking into the leafy ground.

""Can I?"" I whispered. John looked over at Navanod before flipping the knife in his hand and giving it to me. I looked at it then at the man, ""How do I skin him?"" I barely saw the smirk on John's face because I was so focused on the blood, it was shooting a satisfying feeling through me that I had never felt before.

John came up behind me and held his hand over mine, ""Like this,"" His hand guided mine.

My head jerked up when I was finishing to someone screaming my name. A piece of me crumbled as I slowly gave the knife back to John, ""We can do another tomorrow,"" He said. I perked up at that. I was covered in the man's blood and I smiled at that. John stood and took me inside.

""Where have you been?"" My mom demanded.

""Just out in the woods,"" I whispered.

""Stop that mumbling,"" My mom ordered, John rolled his eyes next to me and I suppressed a smile, ""You know how much I hate you playing out there alone!"" I glanced over at John whose grin had now grown.

""Tomorrow,"" He whispered before disappearing into my room laughing.





Edit: So, I probably should say that John and Navanod were 2 of the 8 demons following me around when I was younger. No one but me could see them which led to some interesting situations if they decided to remain in the room when something was going on.

I was 8 years young when I first started to see these mysterious ""black figures."" Specifically one dark, autumn night I had miraculously awoken from my small 8 year old body to find a beautiful silent room. After looking around for 10 seconds something had walked into the door frame of my room. I remember it perfectly to this day. It stood 6 feet tall and looked like an average sized human, except was not covered in skin. This figure was pitch black, the darkest color black I had ever seen. It was wearing a blissful white robe. The robe immediately stood out to me because its polar opposite color compared to the figures skin. This picture still haunts me to this day. There is never a moment where I cant stop thinking about this. After I had realized that this thing was stuck staring at me in my door frame, we both made extreme, extensive eye contact. Even though I could not physically see his eyes, as more time went by I could feel a weird feeling growing inside of my body. After I could not bare the feeling anymore, I asked it ""what are you doing here,"" ""what do you want from me."" I got no response from this being but a slight head turn. This scared me even more. When I got no responce back to any of my questions, we made this scary eye contact once more. The second eye contact was much longer than the first one, but after a while it simply just walked out of my door frame. That was the first and last time I had ever seen this thing. I told my mom the next day, and she told me it was something that ""god"" sent down to earth, but I have always doubted it, especially now... 9 years later. When I went to boarding school for my freshman year, I went to a supposed haunted boarding school located up in santa barbra. I've heard the ghost story thousands of times, and decided to go ghost hunting around the campus, but was unsuccessful. Later on that week, my things started to disappear and I would awake with scrathes and bruises on my arms and upper body. In the middle of the night when I would get water in the hallways, I would feel the same eerie feeling I did when I was 8 and would also see dark figures from the corner of my eye. The same darkness the being had when I was 8. The next week these same experiences started to happen in my personal dorm room, except this time it felt more malicious. The first time I saw something, a scary looking black figure, was when it walked towards my room mates side. I thought I was just dreaming, but the next night my closet door slid open and I saw the most terrifying thing ever. A gargantuan black horned figure slammed open my closet door and rushed strait towards me with its arms pointed strait at me. Before it was about to grab me it disappeared and the lights came right on, thanks to my room mate. AFter this happened I returned back home to LA. Luckily everything had calmed down. How ever now I am 17, I still see these black figures in the corners of my eyes. I need to know what is this?! IS it an evil spirit, are they angels, are the lost ghosts? I've been doing research and said possibly it could be shadow people? I just need to know what your opinion, so I know I am not slowly maddening. PLEASE IS THERE ANY ONE OUT THERE THAT CAN HELP.

That's when the heart starts to beat and so does your responsibility in life, shaping the right future. Well, I don't mind that.

The only food on the table was microwaveable TV dinner or a call for delivery from any nearby restaurant. Chinese? I always have that for brunch.

And yet my so-called father tend to ignore me always. The only time we are together alone was when my 9th grade PTA meeting. That was when mom had her ladies night off, so she called. My father and I are rarely together because he always disappoints with my grade, his eyes blinds with my greatest-proud big brother in big business world who always provide him this material world of joy and such. I bet he is too overjoy to even remember that I exist. My big brother always said that I may think too much. Maybe I did.

In any case, why did I not act now? Why do I imagine I sit down properly on the road watching fire burn glazing right in front of me? My mind is shrouded with thought on my mother and father good points. We are on our way celebrate Thanksgiving at Aunt Maria's house. My parents are quarreling in the car while I was the one handling the steering wheel. Too loud, just maybe because of that if I may lost my focus we might crash right at the middle of fork road. In the bonnet I secretly hid fire crackers where me and cousins are planning to lit it tonight at Aunt Maria's. If we did crash, we will be fireworks. 

I'm nearing the fork road. If we did crash, I'm not sure that if I'm trying to prove God that I don't like his choice. I'm not sure if I'm happy if I ever let this happen. Just what if, what if I'm the one who choose my parents for all this time and I can never reset this ever.",I let this happen.,8,nosleep

what i realized the gold and the creature with the eyes of blue are both like guard dogs and their masters are in control of them blue acted out of instinct. it has no final destination like visions where i see realities different from our own(theroy from first post in series). 

 changes since last post -moving didn't help much just bought me more time. i also purchased some throwing knives since my last update not due to the creatures just because i was losing my sense of home and slight sense of security from moving from the house i grew up in.

warning: i may ramble a bit with exlpaimations due to me having high funtioning autism and it causes me to have longer explainations than most people. i also have slightly bad social skills  due to it. also sorry about spelling and grammar i am on a mobile phone and it is half an hour until midnight for me i wasn't feeling well today so i am a bit tired and half of this was typed 4 days ago i just fell asleep before typing certain parts out that only i would have understood and i fixed and  made readable sense of itso you are lucky for now that i formatted what i did i will do a spelling and grammar edit tomorrow.

The thing that marked the change was the blue creature appeared just after i shut my eye lids and they felt stuck shut. I didn't bother trting to open them i knew it was no use and that the blue one was safe but not the gold one. So i kept trying to switch into a dream but none would take the creature started to make a half choking half growling sound over and over like it was choking on a word before it choked out the word protect then left.

i normally can start my dreams off then fall asleep into them but i haven't been able to gaurd my mind. i can normally just pick a theme eg. horror story abandon building and spy  every so often i will get an odd dream that my mind can't draw on my most recent dream because the normal ones seem to make a storyline like last spring a t-rex and i were talking and it was wearing a monacle and top hat while drinking champane in a ruined section of a city  and then from down the road walnuts got fired at me i ran forward and cracked them with my bare hands until they stopped. this time though it was they hacked in to a dream i had recently.

the recent dream i had fallen asleep while emotions i had were swirling so it randomized and it was that people on my list of people i trust that was pulled from my memories.
I would be getting ready for a formal dance at the school i went to before my dad moved yet in the dream i had moved to the  town the high school i went to is in. i could see the school in the dream from the house i was in and it was a bright neon green house with a picket fence and elegant hand carved wooden gate there are no houses like that near the school though and a cop knocks on the door of the house and my mom answers it and the cop asks for me and mom says i am getting ready to go to a school dance. the cop explains why he is there is to get me to come with him to talk out a hostage situation because the person with the hostage asked to see me. 
So i slip a throwing knife of the new set mentioned above into each pant leg pocket. then say that he can enter my room. i then ask if i can bring either a throwing knife or a wooden stake for defence should i be used as hostage depends what person from my trust list it is being held hostage already in the dream.

(I have trust lists because my lack of social skills makes it hard to make friends so i classify them as aquaintences with varying levels of my trust whether i am friends with  them or not is there call but in the dream after the dream completes it restarts and gets the next person on the lists.)

I get the ok from the cop who says hopefully it won't get to that. fast foreward dream the person with the hostage has the most defendable place in the school and the only possibilities for escape is the window behind  him or at least the body shape looks male. i will refer to him as chompers due to him having pure gold and silver teeth alternating so it goes silver-gold-silver-gold-etc. i first percieved chompers as a being to represent stress then i would be called to go stand near by, chompers holds a glock 26 pistol a common pistol in military games eg socom in each hand (right hand against hostage's head and the left one points at me) then i offer a hostage swap and hand the other hostage the defence weapon i had up my sleeve. then i stand so my back faces chompers while he demands certain politcians be eliminated and vast sums of money as if i was a powerful bargining chip the cops can't complete his ransom with the assination call. so he threatens me saying any last wishes i say i wish to hear a song from my phone and ask if i am allowed to reach in my pocket to get it. chompers says yeah so i grab a throwing knife and stab back wards near intestines with the left throwing knife and jab his thigh at the same time as i dropped and ducked the cops took thier chance to shoot him.
Each time he would normally fall and i would see the bloody muscles of his face when his head hit the floor the only difference now is his eyes have been like snake eyes bright red with gold pupils instead of just turning to empty sockets.

Could it be stress but what if it is two entities battling in my mind one being instinct and one being stress because the walks i would take around the block were to eliminate or at least vent off stress and the slight paranoia during the encounters let them cross into reality and be anchors for their masters if so could it be only my own brain is the only one with a frequency and pattern they can survive",weird walk around the block and weird dream weird cat thing common factor in both (update 2),2,nosleep

I have never seen the movie myself, but from what they told me it's about a haunted house, and the time 3:07 AM is of importance. Anyways, they went to bed that night, and my first cousin woke the other one up to get her alarm to turn off. Thinking it was her regular 6 AM alarm she went to turn it off. But it was 3:07. First she got pissed and told her sister it wasn't funny. She swore on her life it wasn't her. This got them scared shitless. Now on her phone you have to create an alarm, then  save it, then turn it on. When she went to the alarms app, there was no alarm created for 3:07. Cousin #1 did not sleep the rest of the night. They also asked their mischevious friend, M, if he had done it. Needless to say he didn't. They're still pretty freaked, and cousin 1 left her phone in her car while sleeping last night.

I research biological warfare. December 20th: I have thought of an idea to make a strain of influenza that instead of killing the body it will actually improve it to make a stronger German fleet.


December 21st: I have heard of a substance that can make the body stronger and more in rage but it is all the way in South America I will have to call a superior officer to request for it. December 22nd: I am so eager to start maybe the Fuhrer will recognize my genius and I will be known across Germany. January 6th: I have now just got the substance but strangely the officer who delivered it to my quarters told me when he got it a man from the village begged him not to use it that it was horrible. January 9th: I have finish mixing the strains all I need now is a test subject. January 10th: A officer presented me with a American spy who was held captive in a concentration camp. He handed me him and helped me sedate him. Before he walked out the door he told me: ""Make mighty Germany proud.""




 January 11th: I have strapped the subject on a operating table, I have filled a syringe with the substance and injected it in his right arm. January 12th: The subject is not moving as if he is deceased. Maybe he is in a coma but when I touch him he makes no reflexes or reactions.
January 13th: I woke up in the middle of the night in horror as I heard a great scream. It was the subject struggling to get off the table. A officer came to my quarters hearing the noise. I told him what had happened. I tried to sedate the subject with a sedative drug and injecting it into his arm but it didn't work. The officer hit the subject on the head with a baton and even that did not work so we moved him into the closet and locked it. I bribed him not to tell anyone. January 14th: I saw through the window of the door the subjects eyes were getting darker and his skin paler. January 15th: The subject keeps making these horrifying screams that is eating away at me. January 16th: I heard the strap of the table finally snap and I quickly covered the door with a shelf.



January 17th: I have had it, I grabbed a revolver to kill the subject, I opened the door and when I did he lashed out at me and scratched me on the arm. I dropped the gun and the subject got on top of me. I noticed one of my surgical tools and I stabbed him in the eye killing him. I didn't think of getting medical help after all it was just a scratch.
January 18th: I feel ill, I am coughing and I cannot see straight. January 19th: My skin is getting paler and my eyes are getting darker. January 20th: I am starting to get sores on my body like a allergic reaction of some type. January 21st: I started to cough up what appears to be blood but it was black. January 22nd: My body is starting to take a more skeletal appearance. I feel too weak to call for help. January 23rd:My mind is starting to deteriorate and it is hard to think even now as I write I am having trouble focusing. January 24th: Why don't I just end it?

chanvargas,5,,7,1ra33y,,0,"we've been experiencing weird stuffs from this house ever since it was built and renovated. we heard voices, footsteps, some noise upstairs when we were all downstairs and vice versa. these creepy things always happen at 3:00 am onwards (not till 4am). yeah, i'm still trying to convince myself that all were just coincidences that they occur at 3 in the morning.. lucid dreams, nightmares and other stuff will wake you up at that time. and i was thinking that there would be any scientific explanations about those. anyway, the creepiest experience i had was just this year. i can't recall what day or month it happened. but this is how happened. 

it was a long day at work, i came home at 2am in the morning since i was in a late mid shift of a 24/7 starbucks branch here in our country.. i ate dinner alone (i got used to 3am weird shits so its not a surprise for me if something creepy happen again.) then gone upstairs to check on my emails, and read some blogs on some site. it took me a while and later that night i felt sleepy so i got ready for bed. as i enter my room, i went directly to the closet to change clothes. surprisingly i saw my 4 year old sister standing there. she even tried to hide at the dark corner of the closet, staring at me. i asked her, ""hey, why are you still awake? is there something wrong?"" 
she didn't answer.|
i backed off and felt confused. there were no creepy feelings that moment actually.. the time i came back to her, she said ""i'm going too sleep.""

she then walked to my parents room, after she left the room, i decided to follow her, i found her hiding again on an old TV rack that has been there since. i looked at her and she was staring at me with her face not showing any emotion, she told me the same thing again ""i'm going to sleep.""

she entered the room and closed the door. i went back to my room and lied on my bed. i'm still on the state of asking questions of WHAT THE FUCK WAS SHE DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ON THE CORNER OF MY CLOSET. then it came to my senses, the first time i had this lucid dream or nightmare (whatever you call that.) was at the same room where i was lying that time. the dream was an upside down star painted on the wall with a sentence written at the center of the star ""see the center of the face"" i stared at it in my dream then old faces of some people including those that i think i've seen in some history book and some old dollar bill. as the faces change, i suddenly woke up and realized that my body was numb. only my vision was active that time, and i have this feeling that someone is staring at me. it was a strong force. a strong force that gave me such fear. and that force came from the window that is where the closet was put to cover it. the same corner where i found my sister standing..

(back to my sisters incident) 
i thought it was over.. i was lying in bed at that very time when i felt someone staring at me from behind (i'm having goosebumps just by typing this story right now) it was her. again. she then ran back to my parents room after noticing that i saw her. that was the time that i felt fear. i can feel evil existence. but! i was too sleepy that time so i didn't spend much time thinking about it or being curious about it..

the morning came and i told my mom about the incident. she was shocked.. she told me that my sister didn't leave her side all night long. nah.. maybe she was just in a deep sleep so she didn't notice.",little sister incident.,4,nosleep
Mindlesssavage,4,,8,1rhawv,,0,"I have a Where's Wally book. Well, had. Why? I'll tell you.
So I was just searching for Wally at night like I usually do, and I heard a noise.
It was sort of a scratching noise, scratching with a walking cane maybe.
I went to investigate. I went out of my room and...
Nothing.
Maybe it was just me. I went back to my bedroom door. I saw something written on really drippy red paint.
It said ""Find me if you can"". I thought it was just my little brother Mike painting on the walls again. ""Where was Mike anyway?"", I thought. Then I remembered he was outside playing with our pet dog Molly. ( Don't ask me why he was playing in the dark, because I have no idea).
I went inside my room. That's when I saw it. The book was lying on the ground open. I picked it up. This is what the title said:
""yllaW s'erehW"" Now THIS was weird. I also saw the same Wally picture except his eyes were gone and blood was dripping from them.
It was possessed, I thought. I ran outside to bury it, and I stepped on something. It sounded like it was glass because I heard it shatter.
I looked down.
A pair of broken, black rimmed glasses. I ignored it and ran even faster than before.
I ran to my dog Molly's kennel. I always feel safe when she's with me.
She was whining in the corner. That was typical, though. But wasn't she playing with Mike? I shouted out, ""Mike! Mike! Can you hear me?""
No replies.
I ran to the middle of the yard to bury the book.
I stepped in another thing. It was squishy, and slimy.
I looked down.
Blood. Blood and guts.
And Mike.
Lying on the ground.
Stomach open.
With a walking cane through his heart.
I wanted to cry, but then I saw a little Post-It note on the cane.
A poem.
This is what it said:
""I can run, and I can hide.
Tear you apart from the inside.
Waiting in the darkness, with my cane.
Used to be for children, now insane.
Red and white, in the grey fog.
Running around with my little pet dog.
With my girlfriend Wenda, with her camera,
And an old man with a white beard.
The prisoner who escaped from jail, murdering people with no fail.
That's my gang, with no doubt.
When you're in with me, there's no way out.""
This was way too bad to just BURY. We had to set it on FIRE. Or RIP IT APART. Just destroy it in whatever way I could.
So now in my backyard, a grave for Mike, some burnt and ripped pages, shattered glasses, and a walking cane.
And to this day, I never read another Where's Wally book again.
And every night, I still hear the sound of a scratching walking cane against my bedroom door.

horriddaydream,90,,175,1r338n,,669,"My mother left when I was four.
Normally, that wouldn't mean anything, but I suspected for a long time that the porcelain dolls were coming from her, like some pitiful little attempt to show me that she loved me. 

My father; he worked overtime to keep things going in the household even if it was just the two of us. His hands were always worn from working the machines at the shop and he slaved even more when he got home and had to make supper for himself and I, and go through my nightly routines before I hit the sack. I sometimes woke up in the middle of the night and he was still awake, cleaning a room in the house, and I thought to myself, ""This man is dedicated. Has to be awake in only a few hours…and here he is."" I love my father, and I always have.

One of his most trusted friends from high school, Alexander, was my babysitter from the time my mother left, to the time I was about seven years old. We trusted Alexander. He worked night shift and so he was able to work babysitting in around his hours, and he would have done anything to help out my father to make that work. My father paid him even though he asked for nothing; he said he was just 'doing his good deed', ""and I like it anyway!"" My dad used to come home from work and Alexander would pick up his bags full of toys that we played with; he always brought the best toys and trinkets with him. His daughter had passed away when she was ten years old, and I think it brought him great joy to now share her old toys with another little girl. He would say to my dad, ""She was great for me. She ate well, and she took her usual long nap. I'll be back tomorrow!"" And he always came back. 

Well, eventually times changed and my dad's work schedule changed with them. We didn't see Alexander anymore because we didn't NEED Alexander anymore. My father thought that they lost touch permanently and when I asked about him he told me truthfully that Alexander was a very busy man. And he understood that, and I did too. 

For my eighth birthday, the first porcelain doll arrived. It had beautiful, blonde curly hair and a painted on face. She was wearing what looked to be an expensive, velvet dress with an attached tutu. She came inside a stuffed envelope with nothing else on the package to identify who had sent her. Just my name, that was all. The first thing that my father did was call my grandmother, who said, ""No, I didn't drive by and place a present on the porch. I'm not her coward mother; I would have given it right to her."" That gave my father the second idea: my mother. Only thing was, we had no way of getting in touch with her and finding out for she had literally taken off and abandoned us both. And over the next few weeks, nobody came forth and said they had gotten me the doll, so we assumed this is who had sent it.

They showed up every year since then. Each unique in their own ways, each more beautiful than the last. I thought it was a little odd, yes. Especially because my mother made no outreach to me so if she was sending me gifts but not bothering to even so much call me and check up, then that was just plain rude of her and her gifts meant literally nothing. But I continued to set them up on my shelf in my bedroom and they looked nice there, I suppose.

The year I turned nineteen, I was moved into college and was taking courses on my birthday. My father called me from home and asked me when I was coming back home for a break, and I told him that I had time this weekend, but I only said this because I sensed some urgency in his voice. I could make it work. He told me not to worry about anything but that he would really like to see me. Then he stressed that I always lock my doors and always have somebody walking with me if I was out past dark, which I already knew.

I returned home that weekend and my father said there had been an accident.
My porcelain birthday doll had arrived, my nineteenth year doll. When my father brought it inside the house, it had smashed into a hundred separate pieces.
Inside, there was a diary entry on a piece of paper.
We spent the entire day smashing open every porcelain doll, and the entire night speaking with the police.
Alexander had written diary entries for every time he had drugged and molested me, each more explicit, admitting that he had done the same to his daughter up until the time of her horrible death. My father and I hadn't a dry eye in our house that entire night, and I continued to have problems throughout my college career knowing that Alexander was somewhere out there, probably assuming a new identity and doing the same thing to other girls.

Now I know why he had always commented on me taking such 'usual long naps.'

honeymoonatthefalls,61,,144,1r0fus,,616,"The falls have a pull, according to the locals.  Something dark and unearthly like a siren’s song, sweet and somehow terrible.  It draws people “of a certain intent”.  That’s the polite way to say a lot of people end up crushed on the rocks below, their limbs torn apart by the unending rush of water, the brains that made them who they were nothing more than bits of foam and meat floating to the surface.  20-40 a year, in fact, depending on who you ask.

We were happy.  Weren’t we?  I thought we were.  I thought maybe we were different from everyone else, that we’d actually make it.  We wouldn’t end up in that 50% statistic.  We’d grow old together, laughing at the same stupid jokes, knowing what was going to come out of the other’s mouth before they even had a chance to say it.

Was it the pressure of the wedding?  The fact that I’m still “between jobs”?  Young 20-somethings in one of America’s bleakest economies, doing what we could to get by.  Scrambling for every scrap as the magazine covers reminded us how worthless our generation is, the snide remarks about our smartphones and Facebook and selfies.  Maybe getting married wasn’t a good idea.

But we were in love!  We were in love and we knew deep down in that secret place in our stomachs that she was the one for me and I for her.

So then why did it happen?

No.  I’m not supposed to ask that anymore.  I’m supposed to accept that she’s gone.  I’m supposed to accept the fact that she’s her own statistic now, one of 20-40 people a year.  Another tumble of bones on the body count that’s reached over 5000 since the falls became an attraction both for tourists and people with death on their mind.

But it’s hard to accept when I can still see her face so clearly, that sweet heart-shaped face with the little crescent-moon scar on her left nostril, the way her big blue eyes lit up when she showed me the fantastic deal she scored on Groupon, a Niagara Falls getaway for our honeymoon.

If only I could go back.  Tell her that the price was nice but I’d rather go to a beach, or Ireland, it doesn’t matter, anywhere but those cursed falls.

It’s impossible to describe how it feels to stand at the crest of Niagara, the mist peppering your face like cold little kisses, drinking in the smells and the sound and the remarkable way the water rushes down, down, ever down.  Your existence seems like a cosmic joke in comparison to this almost hauntingly beautiful feat of nature.  For a moment, it is.

The locals say you can tell who has a death wish by how close they’ll get to the edge.  Those who shy away, who shake their heads and insist nervously that they can see just fine from where they are, thank you very much, those are the ones who can’t trust themselves to get too close.  If they get too close to the edge, some little part of them knows they’ll jump.

She didn’t shy away.  She went right up to the railing.  She was smiling.

That’s the worst part.  She was smiling.

It was early in the morning, one of those damp gray dawns only possible in the new spring of upstate New York.  We had the sight to ourselves.  It was a little spooky, being out there alone, the kind of spooky you get from being in an empty shopping mall after hours, all those metal gates pulled down and the lights turned off.

She was standing there, a little too high on the guardrail, leaning just a little too far over, smiling as the mist touched her lips and made her hair curl in damp little tendrils on her cheeks.  She was beautiful.

I’ll never know why I pushed her.

That’s something I have to accept.

Jaunt-701,54,,147,1rff5i,,537,"I wrapped my dollie in her prettiest red dress, looked into her cracked eyes and whispered I love you.

I held her tight. I love you. I love you. But I started to cry, because dollies don't love back. No, my dollie wouldn't do, not anymore. I wanted something of my own to care for. Something soft I could nuzzle up to at night when I was lonely. Something that needed me. I wanted a real baby.

I asked mama how to make a baby. She slapped me across the face and made me drink dish soap to wash the devil's talk from my mouth. The red mark still burned on my cheek when I got to school, but no one noticed. They never noticed me except when I fell and spilled my lunch, or when Jenny and the other girls made fun of the holes in my dresses. They only noticed me to laugh at me.

That night after I said my prayers, I looked at the stars through my window and spotted one I had never seen before. Big, bright and ruby red, it seemed to get bigger the more I stared at it. It was beautiful, so I sent it a wish. Bring me a baby, I said, bring me something to love.

The star grew bigger and bigger until ruby red filled the room and turned the air thick and rusty. Something was there with me. Black and formless like a storm cloud, it floated above me. You want a child, it said, speaking into my head instead of my ears. I will give you a child, but you must promise to love and care for him no matter what.

I promise.

Wisps of black wrapped around my wrists and pinned them to the ground as sure as steel rivets. My nightdress was lifted and my legs pulled apart. Gritty black tendrils, rough as sandpaper, opened me and slithered inside. They scraped my insides, slowly at first, then faster and faster. It felt like I was being shredded to pulp from the inside out. I tilted my head back to scream, but black filled my mouth and nothing came out. Shhh, it said, to love your child you must suffer for him first. A final push in, and shards of splintered glass exploded inside me.

The thing loosed its grip, and I reached down to feel sticky red goo oozing out of me onto the floor. I was shaking and cold, and the room was falling away. Will I die? I asked.

No. You must care for him. It is your promise.

I woke the next morning without a scratch. Was it a dream? I touched my belly. No, he is there. I can feel him. Tiny and vulnerable and perfect. I would keep my promise.

He grew every day. Soon my belly was round and full underneath my dresses. Everyone noticed me now, especially Jenny and the other girls. Slut, they said. Whore. Trash. One day Jenny fell in front of a school bus as it was pulling away. You could hear the tire pop her skull open from across the parking lot. When the police dragged the driver away he stammered that he had seen something push her, something small and black like a living shadow.

Mama cried. She held me in a scalding tub and scrubbed my body until my skin cracked and bled. Not clean, not clean, she said. She pulled me out of school and swore that I would never leave the house until it was over and done, because what would the neighbors think. I didn't mind. As long as my little boy was safe inside me, I didn't care where I went.

I dreamed of him. He told me his name, but it was a sound I couldn't pronounce, a sound like a cloud of flies buzzing through the air. I couldn't say it, but I could hear it in my head, and that was enough. He told me that he would accomplish great things, but he needed my love to make him strong first. In my dreams I held him tight, looked into his dark eyes and whispered I will love and protect you always.

Mama dreamed of him too, I think. She would lay in bed with sweat soaking into the sheets whispering Please, Please help us God. She ate less and less until she was sunken and pale like a skeleton.

I was drawing pictures one night when it happened. I reached up for a red crayon and *pop*, yellow liquid gushing out of me. He's ready, he's finally ready. I called out to mama and told her it was time. She phoned the doctor, begging him to be discreet to hide it from the neighbors. He arrived and offered to inject me with something to relieve the pain. I refused. To love my baby I must suffer for him first.

Pushing, screaming, breathing, pushing again. Hours and hours. I was weak. I was tired. But the thought of him kept me going. After so long, we would finally meet. I would hold him in my arms for real and give him the love I kept in my heart just for him. I pushed again, with the last drops of strength I had left. I emptied out and collapsed down onto the bed, sighing with relief.

I am sorry, dear, but the baby didn't make it.

No. No you're wrong. I kept him safe this whole time. I protected him and loved him and spoke to him in my dreams, I was going to care for him and make him strong, he can't be, he can't be, he can't.

I am so sorry. Here child, you can say goodbye.

I held him in my arms. He was limp and motionless, his skin a pale gray, his eyes shut tightly. He looked so peaceful. I had never seen anything so beautiful in all my life. I clutched him to my chest and cried, tears dripping onto his head. Goodbye, my love, goodbye. But no, wait. He can't be gone. I can hear him. I can hear the flies in my mind.

His eyes snapped open and his head twisted around to look at mama and the doctor. Mama fell to the floor and screamed. Her legs scrambled to press her into a corner of the room, and her eyes bulged as she shrieked and pleaded to God. The doctor stood frozen for a moment before walking into the bathroom and quietly shutting the door.

My baby's head turned back to me, and I looked into his eyes for the first time. Two huge pools of midnight black that seemed to suck the light out of the room itself. I looked into those cold, dark eyes, and I smiled. My son. My beautiful son. I am so happy to see you.

I stood up while mama's jagged screams scratched my eardrums, and I carried my son to the bathroom. I opened the door, stepped over the spreading pool of red underneath the doctor, and turned on the tap. I bathed my son in the icy cold water as he stared up at me. He was perfect. He was everything I had hoped for. And he was mine.

-------

I saw things in my dream that night. I saw great buildings and monuments ground to dust. I saw waves of fire washing clean the cities of man. I saw clouds of flies so thick they blacked out the sun. I saw red. Mists of red, rivers of red, chunks of oozing red heaped high in the moonlight. And in the middle of it all, I saw my son, my baby boy. Mama's so proud of you sweetheart. I will always be there for you. I will make you strong. I will make you the man you're destined to be. I will love you and care for you and protect you, no matter what.

*Hello, Daniel. Haven't seen you for quite some time now.*

*No time for formalities, though. I need you to do something. Remember that old house we used to hide out in down by the farm? I need you to go there. When you approach the house, try not to make any sound. Go up to the loft and you will find a trunk. In it you will find a small vial, a razor blade, and a folded piece of paper. Take the razor and prick your finger. Touch your forehead and make a dot of blood. DO NOT touch the vial before you do so.*

*Open the vial and drink it. When you do so your vision will go blurry, but you have to stay calm. Pick up the paper in the trunk and read the first paragraph. It's in German, but I know you won't have trouble with  pronouncing it. At this point, you MUST stay calm. You will start to feel closed in and you will start hearing voices. DO NOT listen to what they have to say. Tear the paper into the smallest pieces you can and scatter them on the floor.*

*When that's done, go downstairs to the ""kitchen"". You will find a gas can and a lighter. Set fire to the house. No matter what the voices say, you HAVE to set fire to the house. After it starts going, the voices will go away. Then you need to get away from that house as fast as you can.*

*Good luck,*

Exxile4000,97,,154,1rbws0,,389,"Hello reddit. I'm a killer and I have no problem admitting that. Many people have fallen victim to my gruesome attacks and I live life regretting none of it. I'm only sharing my story on here  so that someone out there can know about it. Whether or not you choose to believe it is up to you.

I was a normal child, but normal is relative so who am I to make that call. What I should say is that I grew up how you would expect a kid to grow up. My parents treated me properly, I did great in school, and I had many friends. It wasn't until high school that I started feeling the need to kill. 

It was all so spontaneous. I was just sitting in class one day staring at one of the students when the image of him dying popped into my head. I zoned out and focused on the image, his body lying in a pool of blood leaking from his head. His arms were snapped behind his back  and his feet were missing the big toes. A few weeks later that daydream became a reality... and I got away with it.

Everyone in the school was whispering rumors to one another as I walked to classes. Some were saying that he joined the army, others were convinced that he just moved like so many other kids did before him. I was the only one who knew the truth and I had to hide my devilish grin from the rest of the school. That was my only murder in high school but it ignited the flame.

When I reached adult hood I landed a successful job and had plenty of money to obtain the tools I had always dreamed of using on my victims. That's when I began to develop a signature style. I would always sever the big toes but I no longer snapped the arms behind the back. Honestly, the sound of the bones breaking didn't sit well with me. Every day I would watch the news expecting to see that one of the victims had been found, but they never were. 

Years went by and I targeted another twelve victims. They were no one in particular. Women, teenagers, it really didn't matter to me. A dead body is a dead body in my eyes, I don't care who it belongs to. Very few of them would put up a fight and that was fine with me. I wasn't trying to drag out the last moments of their lives, I just wanted them to die. I wanted to savor the warmth of their blood on my hands as I slit their throat.  

About a week after I killed my final victim, I met a girl that I ended up falling in love with. She doesn't realize how close she was to becoming just another undiscovered body. She wasn't able to have kids which was fine with me, I never really saw myself as a father. Neither of us believe in god so we saw no point in getting married, I was okay with this as well. I felt like my life was finally going to be normal again. 

After we had been together for a few years I decided to tell her about my past. I made a special dinner for her to lighten the mood. However, when I told her she just laughed and thought I was being ridiculous. It turned into her treating it like some type of role playing fantasy I had and she ignored me as I told her it was the truth. I didn't know how to prove it to her... so I killed someone in front of her. 

One night I brought her with me on what she thought was a date. When we got to the spot I opened the trunk so she could see my victim. She still thought it was a joke and asked me how I got my friend to agree to this. I think she finally understood that it was no joke as I sliced the mans throat. Her face turned pale and she reached into her purse to get her phone. I was prepared for this though and I knocked her unconscious. After I finished with  my signature killing pattern I drove back to the house. My secret was not safe with her but I loved her too much to kill her.

Right now she's kept in my basement. I don't treat her like a prisoner mind you, she has everything she could ever want. I'm hoping in time I can start leaving her untied at night so she'll quit trying to escape. I know one day she'll accept who I am. Maybe one day she'll help me fulfill my new fantasy of killing together. Or perhaps you guys won't believe me either and you'll brush this off as just another made up story. But that's the funny thing about being a killer...",The funny thing about being a killer is that no one believes you if you tell them the truth.,543,nosleep
AmbiguousGopher,31,,83,1r5xlc,,359,"For most of my life, I've been drawn to a certain room of my house. A bedroom at the far end of my basement, which used to be a guest bedroom. I can't really explain why, but I just always wanted to sleep there. Until the age of 8, my older brother and I shared a room right across the hall from the bedroom of my parents. When he was 13, however, he moved into that bedroom, and over the years, the room become even more interesting. The room is now filled with posters of The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, an authentic Spanish sword he bought hangs above his desk, and loads of other bits and pieces which captured my imagination when I was younger. To top it all off, there was an air vent connecting his room and mine. Almost directly below my room, I could hear him some nights talking to his friends on the phone while playing video games late into the night. I envied his freedom. If I had tried that, my parents right across the hall would hear me and I'd be grounded.

When I was 13 myself, my brother and sister (twins) left for college. Now the only child at home, I called my brother up one weekend and asked, 
""Can I have your room?""
My brother paused for a long time before responding
""No.""
He gave no explanation, but I didn't really care. I could understand that when he came to visit, He'd want his own room to sleep in. For 4 more years, i didn't ask to have the room again, but when i was 17, my brother bought a house. To me, it seemed like he was pretty much beyond the point of having any reason to care about his old room, so one day when he called to check up on things, I asked again.
This time he responded more quickly. His voice sounded casual, but at the same time, It kinda freaked me out. He said,
""Nah, let mom make it a guest room again. Besides, your room is super classy! My room isn't that great.""
And so, yet again, I let it go. I stayed in my room and didn't really think anything of it... that is, until last week. 

This summer, I started having severe anxiety attacks coupled with spells of incapacitating depression, especially at night. I've been on different medicines to help, and have been going to therapy to help work on relaxation techniques. Last week, my therapist noted that sometimes the brain can form associations with certain rooms or areas. She suggested that my brain, due to the recurring spells in my room, may have formed a negative association with it. She told me that switching rooms may help me relax when I start having an attack.

That night, I did it. I switched to my brother's room, and it was amazing. Since my basement always stays around below room temperature, the sheets and pillow stayed cool, which was just to my liking. I slept better than I'd slept in weeks, and thought that perhaps this room was going to turn things around. But the second night didn't go as well. I woke from a nightmare, and felt as if there was someone watching me. I shook the feeling and went back to sleep. This kind of thing happened for a few more nights; each time, I awoke more worried than the last. 

Then came the big one. I fell asleep as usual, and I began to dream: another nightmare, but this time it was more vivid. In the dream, I saw looking at my brother, when he was only 13 or 14 years old. He was sitting on his bed, talking to something. I couldn't see it, but he was looking at an angle which suggested something much larger than himself. Tears were flowing steadily from his eyes, and he was pleading, BEGGING the thing to go away, to leave him alone. The power in the room went out; I heard a horrible screeching, like a pig being tortured. The lights turned back on and my brother lay there, unconscious. A large black bruise had appeared on his ribs. The clock in his room recovered from the power outage, blinking the numbers ""00:00"". My brother then jerked upright and walked over to the only poster in his room at the time, his Hendrix poster. He took a pen form his desk and put a tally mark on the wall behind it.

I jerked up in my brother's bed. I turned on the lamp and looked around the room. I noticed every poster. Sweat started pouring from my forehead, burning my eyes. I looked at the clock. The numbers blinked ""00:00"".

TheeMikeG,21,,73,1r4fsf,,333,"Dear Mike,

They’re letting me write a letter so I figured I’d get my story out there.

It was a routine night drop, nothing different from what we’ve done countless times before. The steady hum of the C-130 as it tore through the clouds was the only thing keeping me calm. Yeah, I’ve done this a lot, but you can never get rid of the nerves before a mission. We had an idea of what awaited us down there, but we couldn’t be a hundred percent sure. People are unpredictable, and that’s scary. The plan from higher was to have our five man team infiltrate by night drop a small village I can’t pronounce to search for and capture or kill a HVT whose name I also can’t pronounce. The gunship would rise up and provide overwatch until we were extracted. Airborne all the way, hooah. 

The LT joined us again, which he decided to do from time to time. Nice enough guy, I respected him. Was supposed to be having a baby girl soon, he would always talk about it during PT. Good for him, I could never hold down a relationship for very long. I figured it was just because I’ve seen too much shit to be normal and cuddle or whatever the fuck it is that couples do. The rest of the squad was the usual guys. Mitch, Craft, and Burroughs. All experts in their craft. We were a solid group and I’d take a bullet or hell, even two, for any of them. 

“Thirty seconds!” shouted the LT from the bench, a few spots to my right, closest to the door. The jumpmaster heaved the door upward and the familiar sound of air whooshing past the plane made my heart jump. There was always a kick. “Hook up!” he shouted. We all stood up in unison and clipped our static lines to the wire that ran through the plane above our heads. I tugged on my static line to make sure it was attached. There were no reserves for this one. The jumpmaster held up his hand. Five seconds. The red light turned green and the LT positioned himself by the door. The jumpmaster smacked his rear and the LT jumped out and was whisked away. My stomach turned in knots. Over a hundred jumps and I still hated this shit. I was last to go out. I tucked my head, took a hop out of the plane and suddenly there was the rush and I felt myself getting tossed. I heard my chute above and I breathed a sigh of relief. 
Looking up to check my canopy I saw a fully inflated chute and I thanked the Lord once again. I looked down for the rest of the squad and saw their chutes inflated too. Past them, I expected to see the ground, but there was only a thick smoke, or at least that’s what it looked like. A storm cloud? Why didn’t the jumpmaster hold off the jump until the bad weather passed? 

“Staus check” I heard the LT ask through the radio. 

As I watched the other’s canopies disappear into the black cloud I began to worry. I heard the squad all check in though so I felt a little better.  I held my hand up to my ear to activate our comms. 

“Sir, what’s the situation down there?”
	
“Zero visibility guys. Pretty foggy. Can’t see my own canopy,” he said.

Then I entered the black cloud and couldn’t see a damn thing. I heard something nearby. Flapping? My radio clicks before Mitch starts talking. “I heard something. Flock of birds?”
	
“We’re too high,” replied the LT. “Eyes and ears open.” I tried to look around but there was no point. I couldn’t even see my canopy. What if I was falling to my death right then? Heavy flapping got my focus. It sounded large, whatever it was. 
	
“Sir, something is up here with us,” I say.
	
“Simmons, stay calm, what’s gotten into –”
	
“Fuck!” Craft interrupts through the mic. Then I hear a long, painful scream far below me. 
	
“Jesus Christ!” yelled the LT, “Craft! You there?!”
	
Silence. Not even static. 
	
“Guys, stay calm. Get ready to hit any minute. I can’t see the ground in this shit but we’ll sort this out on the DZ.”
	
I checked my watch. It takes maybe two minutes to hit jumping from a mile up. It’s been six minutes and I know this wasn’t a HALO jump. Was I caught in a thermal? I pulled on my risers and felt myself drifting through the air. When I released, I didn’t notice any change in descent speed. The LT must have noticed the same thing because I could hear him cursing through the radio. There’s a loud screech; unlike anything I’ve ever heard. After it ended a few seconds later the LT had to shout over the commotion we were all making on the radio. We were scared. 
	
“Guys! I don’t know what the fuck is going on but stay calm! Weapons on amber.”
	
My combat gear was in a large sack between my legs, but my USP was on my belt. I took it out and held it ready. I didn’t know for what, but I was ready to go. How had we still not hit the ground yet? Then I got an idea. My combat load. We are supposed to release it before landing, and it slides down a twenty foot rope so we don’t break our legs when we land. I thought if I could cut it free, maybe I could hear it hit the ground. I asked for permission from the LT who quickly approved. He must have been as freaked out as me to allow me to abandon my combat gear. I pressed the handle on my hip and the gear slid down the rope and out of sight into the darkness. I took out my knife and sawed at the line until it snapped. I waited and waited but couldn’t hear a thing. 
	
I heard the flapping again, and someone fired their weapon, two, three times. Then silence. “Jesus Christ,” whispered the LT. “Status check.”
	
“Burroughs.”
	
“Simmons.”
	
Nothing.
	
“Sir, what the fuck is going on?!” I knew he wouldn’t have an answer, but I was desperate. 
	
“I have no idea.”
	
We drifted through the air for ten more minutes. Then I touched down. I didn’t hit hard, it was like I was just set down. Didn’t even have to fall over. I still couldn’t see a damn thing though. I heard quick steps and then Burroughs burst into view and tackled me to the ground. He was frantic. He begged me through tears to follow him. We wandered around until we came to the LT. He didn’t have a right half of his body. He was barely alive, sputtering through bloody lips for us to run. 
	
“My baby, my baby, my baby,” he whispered over and over until he didn’t say anything anymore. The cloud cleared from the area behind him and there was this thing. All I saw before I turned and ran was large leathery wings. I heard the screeching and the flapping of those awful wings again. Burroughs screamed as he was ripped backwards from beside me. Somehow I burst out of the cloud and I saw headlights. I nearly got hit by the jeep but dove out of the way just in time. Out got two guards who spoke a language I didn’t understand. Burroughs was the translator. They prodded me with machine guns and kicked and beat me until I was barely conscious. How did they not see the thing behind me? They dragged me into the back of their vehicle and drove me to their camp. 

I’ve been their POW for nearly a month now. If you get this letter, please get my story out there. I’m not crazy, I promise. I can’t explain what happened any better than that. We’re not alone. Something terrible is going on over here. Time to go; they’re beckoning me to come outside. It’s awfully dark out there. Is a storm coming in?

courtneymadison,33,,83,1r2j24,,253,"I'm just a normal 18 year old that lives at home and goes to class. I've never really had any unexplainable experiences but I had one today. I woke up and started getting ready for class, I thought I saw my mom in her room so I started having a conversation with her while I was getting dressed. She was responding as per usual so I thought nothing of it. (Quick sidenote: Nothing felt wrong with the way she was responding. Whatever this was it sounded just like my mom.) After a while she stopped replying to me. Being curious I decided to go see why. I went to her room and it was empty, looked in the kitchen and it was empty, She would of had to have walked past me to leave the house so I knew she hadn't left. I decided to call her to figure out where she'd gone and when I looked I had a text from her that was received at 5:27 a.m. saying ""Got called in to open. Be home at 11 so you can take the car."". I called her to see if she was messing with me but she was actually at work. I don't know who I've been talking to all morning and I'm really freaked out. Can anyone help me? 


EDIT: I asked my little sister if when she had had anything strange happen when she was getting ready for school and she looked at me like I'd lost it. For all the people that asked about the conversation, the previous night my mom had found a ouija board (unused and still in the packaging) in my closet and she had thrown it away, ""She"" was talking about how ouija boards are dangerous and I shouldn't mess with them. She was very persistent that I don't get involved with things like that but she's always saying stuff like that so it wasn't a very out of the ordinary topic for us. The conversation was about an hour long and I was fully awake when it took place. We checked the house and nothing was missing or out of place. We live in an apartment and all the windows were locked and the screens were intact, so someone couldn't have gotten in or out through them. My mom is really into the weird/paranormal stuff so I told her everything and she has no idea what it could be.

I work in a recycling center. I am the guy that weighs the truck when it comes in with scrap metal, watches it unload, and then weighs the truck when it comes out. That difference in weight is used to calculate the value of the scrap and how much the customer receives for his load. it’s a well known place in my town, city actually. There’s a pretty steady business and it’s good work. I started out in the yard sorting and a few years ago moved into the office. I still have to wear a hard hat and safety vest, but only when I have to watch a truck unload in an area that the cameras don’t cover. 

A few days ago, we started getting loads from a demolition job about a hundred miles from town. It was an old Air Force base that didn’t survive the latest round of budget cuts. The base was being scrapped to make a nature preserve. The plan is called Nukes to nature. The contractors brought in mostly structural iron, copper wiring and office equipment. I was watching a contractor ( who was mostly likely drunk) tip his truck when a old metal desk caught my eye. It landed right side up twenty feet from me. Because I was bored I walked over and opened the drawers.

 One of the drawers a metal lock box. I took it back to my desk and set about picking the lock. Working in a scrap yard we sometimes come across old strongboxes or small office safes. My boss has a deal that if you can open it, then whoever finds it splits the contents 50/50 with the scrapyard. You can see why I’ve gotten pretty good at picking locks!

The box opened after a few minutes of concerted effort. Inside was just an old piece of computer equipment, an inch high by 4 inches long. The closest thing I could compare the size to was to the box that your bank send you your checks in. It had a small bar code on the top part, and handwritten in permanent marker was the words “ MJ-12, Containment “ An orange sticker proclaimed “ Erase and Destroy, ref FM 3-36 USA TRADOC”

I showed what I am now calling the hard drive to my boss, who was VERY unimpressed and gave me the number for a IT guy who might want to buy it. I am going to see if he wants to buy it, but I’m going to ask him if he can see what files are on the drive. Secret plans to bomb the Soviets? Blueprints for a new jet fighter? Who knows? It’s a mystery worthy of /r/nosleep!!!

I’ll post when I hear back from the IT guy

PeckerPoker,43,,85,1r58lt,,238,"Ok, so this isn't a long story filled with twists and turns, but it just happened about 15 minutes ago, and I'm a little uneasy now.

For reference, my husband, son, and I moved into an apartment in the top-half of a century-home a couple months ago. The doors all have old knobs and the doors don't always close easily - you really have to pull sometimes.

Anyway, I just put my son (almost two years old) down for his nap. I told him night-night as I closed the door. As I always do, I pulled the door shut firmly and made sure I heard it click. I swear I heard it click.

I walked away and into the bathroom to go pee. As I sat down on the toilet, I heard my son start crying, which isn't that unusual, but normally he doesn't do more than fuss for a minute before falling asleep. I even kept him up a little longer than usual to make sure he fell asleep. He seemed pretty ready to go down... thumb in mouth under his blanky, he rolled over onto his side and put his blanket over his head like he does when he's really tired.

I finish peeing and walk out of the bathroom and his door is wide open. I see him standing in his crib crying. I go in, feeling uneasy, and lay him back down and cover him back up. He lays there and just keeps crying as I check his closet... like there would be someone hiding in there or something. Kind of dumb, I know, but I couldn't just shut him back in his room alone without checking.

Even if I was wrong and the door didn't click shut (which is possible), it shouldn't have been wide open. When I haven't completely shut it in the past, it will open up about 5 or 6 inches. It's never opened up all the way like that.

I checked the rest of the rooms and closets, feeling nervous, but kind of stupid. Of course, there wasn't anything unusual anywhere. Still, I'm kind of on edge. I wish my husband was home.",Nap Time,323,nosleep

Thats some crazy stuff, am I right?

Let me know what you think.



","Found Hard Drive, wtf?",315,nosleep
tellmewhatiswrong,52,,59,1reivz,,213,"Arghhh. I have no idea what to make of this situation I find myself in.

I started off 2013 as being in the most amazing relationship I've ever had. I married the girl of my dreams last year, after being together for 5 years prior to that. She is the most beautiful, intelligent, interesting person I have ever met, and I knew that as soon as we met each other. Immediately, the chemistry between us was electric.

Don't get me wrong, we are extremely different in a lot of ways, but up until this point, that has only helped to make our relationship stronger. I'm an atheist, a kind of scientific nerd I guess. She, on the other hand, was more....new age? I guess you could say. Not particularly religious, but interested in the paranormal, philosophy, anything that can't really be explained. It would not surprise me to see her out hunting for UFO's, however for the most part, this side of her was really just limited to reading about such events and watching the odd documentary.

Having said that, she is so sensible and smart. She's a very curious person, that's what I put her hobbies down to, really. It's never been more than a passing interest of hers. She works as a personal assistant to the CEO of a law firm in the city. Everyone says she should study law because her talents are wasted as a secretary. But she seems content enough at the moment....well she did.

The reason I find myself in this mess is because she has changed her mind about something we used to agree on - kids. When we first got together, we both agreed that we did not want to have children. We based our entire relationship on that premise. We were content with travelling the world, expensive wines, and sex on the kitchen bench. All that would change if kids came into the picture. I have never wanted children, and don't feel like I ever will.

She used to feel the same. Until her sister had a baby. She started to get a little clucky, she said. She started to see us with a baby of our own. At first I thought it was just a passing comment, but the longer time went on, the more I realised she was serious. That's when the fights started. Fight after fight, every week. Her crying and yelling and begging me to change. To compromise. Me, dumbfounded and annoyed that one of the foundations of marriage is suddenly being challenged. Things have been said in the heat of the moment, and both of us have been deeply hurt by the other. She makes me feel like I can't give her what she needs, that I'm denying her her happiness. I make her feel like she's not important, she says. That I'm being selfish.

Maybe I am? I don't know.

So we found ourselves in a stale mate. She posted something on Reddit asking for advice and most of the suggestions directed us to attend couples counselling.

I was reluctant to say the least. But I was willing to give it a shot.

Sandra, our therapist, was actually not what I expected. She seemed rational and quite straightforward, not the Einstein-esque shrink that I had imagined. She advised that we really we had two options : either she could stay with me, and be without a child. Or she could leave me for someone who would give her a baby. We seem to be stuck in secret option number 3: staying in the circumstances we find ourselves in.

Disregarding all the fighting, she was still her normal self, and we have been managing to keep it together, and still spend some quality time together. We have still been going out with friends, and going for walks with our dog, and I know we still love each other.

I stopped going to couples counselling. I sort of felt like she couldn't give us a real answer, she was only there to listen. My wife kept attending on her own though, I think she takes some kind of comfort in it.

She came home last week and told me that she's going to be attending a ""Self help"" seminar, and would I like to go. I said definitely not. I couldn't think of anything worse than to be honest! Even the counselling sessions were too much for me. She asked if I minded if she went. She said it was with some famous psychoanalyst, and that her therapist would be in attendance, on the ""Assistance Team"". I said whatever she felt would help. She said she feels it will help her clear her head on the baby issue. I'm all for anything that could help us get back on track, so I told her to go for it.

The seminar seemed pretty intensive. It was 14 hours a day, Friday, Saturday and Sunday of last week. It was also very expensive, but I bit my tongue. 

She got home last night and just seemed exhausted. I haven't gotten many details out of her, as every night when she arrived home she went straight to sleep and we barely had time to speak. Today we both had the day off, which was recommended by the people who organised the seminar.

Today we woke up, and she was....intense. I woke up with her clinging to me for dear life. She was stroking my face and staring into my face. It was quite nice actually. Nice to have some affection. We cuddled in bed for a long while. She seemed.....ok. Her eyes definitely looked brighter, but she didn't say much, just was very intensely affectionate. 

She got up to have a shower, and I went out to have some breakfast. After about half an hour I knocked on the bathroom door, telling her to leave some hot water. She must have had it on so hot, steam was pouring out of the door into our hallway, and the walls were dripping with condensation. I knocked a few more times, and yelled out to her, but got no response.

I opened the door, and waited for the hazy steam to clear, to see her standing there, fully clothed and staring in the mirror. The shower was on full ball, and extremely hot, and I reached over the turned the tap off. She didn't take her eyes off her own reflection. She was very vague when I questioned her, and sweating profusely. I managed to get her dressed (out her pyjamas) and she's in the other room now watching TV.

I assume this weird behaviour is something to do with the seminar? I don't really understand all this new age crap, has anyone else ever been to one of these seminars? Or know someone that has? I've tried googling more information but can't see anything about this specific group. 

Any advice would be appreciated, I'm a bit weirded out right now to be honest.

","Need some advice. My wife seems to be in some weird trance/zombie like state? Not sure what to do, or if I'm over-reacting...",272,nosleep
PlotThickener,13,,44,1r0aj7,,202,"This is a story I've never discussed with anyone aside from those people involved. But I figured it belonged here. For the longest time I chalked it all up to pranks, my imagination, whatever...but hopefully you'll all be able to make more sense of it.

I was driving in a rural part of Wisconsin (which, if you live there, you know is much of the state). Lots of flat farms, country highways named for letters, empty back roads, etc. It was 10 p.m. or later--I don't really remember when, but it had been dark for some time and it was the middle of summer, so it must have been late. 

It was the time of night cars stop moving on the rural roads so it's just you and your headlights and the world around you starts getting really creepy. Plus you're always watching out for deer on these roads, which can just pop out at any moment, so you're kind of on ""yellow alert.""

I'm driving north on a long section of road. There's a big flat farm on my left, mostly empty-looking, probably planted with soybeans which don't grow high. I'm concentrating on the edges of where my headlights meet the darkness to watch for deer, and I think I see one walking out of the farm toward the road.

I tap the brakes, not sure of what I see, but soon I realize it's not a deer. It's upright, something walking on two feet, and it's HUGE. And it's all black. It's still moving, but it's not moving with any kind of walking movement; it's just sort of gliding across my vision.

At this point I've stopped the car completely--in the middle of the road, just watching. One instinct was to hit the gas and drive past, because I could have easily passed it, but I'm not sure if it was about to jump out. I'm not really afraid yet, I'm just frozen; you know those moments where you can't figure out what something is so there are no real emotions? That was me.

Then it comes into clearer view in the headlights. Well, that's not very accurate to say, because it didn't seem to reflect any light. It was like the light moved through it, if that makes sense. But I could see the outline of the figure against everything else that was lit--the road, the trees, etc.

The figure looked like Death. I mean EVERYTHING you imagine when you read the stories--the scythe, the big black hood. It was exactly what you think when you think Grim Reaper, only unnaturally tall and thin. It was so tall and thin it looked a lot like this guy's halloween costume when he wears it after about five minutes or so: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8PoCkNKDGk Especially how tall it was. I mean, ten feet minimum. I think most people think of the Grim Reaper as being as large as a big person, but it wasn't really like that.

But that was my first thought. A halloween costume. It was still summer, though, so not Halloween. But, I rationalize, maybe it's just a prank. But then I pay attention to how it moves to the middle of the road.

It just GLIDES. I see no feet, no hint that this thing is doing anything but flying off the ground, but you can't see feet or anything because the robe hits the ground.

Then, in the middle of the road, maybe ten feet in front of me, it stops.

The hooded face turns--toward me.

It's so slow and smooth, and just plain UNNATURAL, that I completely freeze in the car. My hands are locked on the wheel. The face is turning to me, slowly, perfectly smoothly, and I'm scared out of my mind. Even if this is some prank, this thing clearly means business. Maybe it's some psychopath scaring people, and not just an innocent prank.

It sees me. I don't see eyes, no glowing eyes or anything, just black, but somehow I KNOW that it's looking at me, making eye contact. I got goosebumps even on my scalp; I remember my hair feeling like it stood straight up. I feel like I was literally looking death in the face. My stomach sank like someone just told me a loved one had died. I mean, you do not want to feel this feeling. Ever. The thing stood perfectly still, too, as if considering me or weighing me. I felt really judged, if that makes sense. Like I was being considered.

Then he glides off so fast I don't even see where he goes. The roads are clear again, and then I heard the engine running as if all of the world's sound had suddenly been un-muted.

I drive back home, still frozen, still rationalizing what I saw. A prank, I figure. It had to be a prank, some overzealous Halloween lover setting up rumors of the Grim Reaper walking around the farms. I tell my parents about it, and they're sure it's a prank. So sure that I eventually rationalize it away, and the memory is filed away as creepy, but nothing supernatural.

At about the same time, I heard that a farmer who owned that soybean field had died that night. But it took me a long time before I put two and two together, when I realized that I saw something that looked like THE FREAKING GRIM REAPER on the same night that farmer died. I remember when I first had the thought, and my stomach sank.

It was like the rationalization I had used to remember the story of the Grim Reaper was suddenly stripped away, and I had to confront the fact that I saw something very, very scary.

But what else can I do but live my life?

I went back to college--every time I came back home at night I took an alternate road just because I got the creeps so bad. Had a good semester, mostly A's, had some good times with friends. I drive back mostly during day or evening time so I don't have to revisit those unpleasant memories.

Then my parents tell me that there are more ""Grim Reaper"" stories going around lately, all pretty similar to mine. When you live in a  small town it seems like there are a lot of funerals for old people that you know or at least heard of going on all the time. At one funeral, an old lady's granddaughter cried because she saw she said a big black figure over the casket. My parents heard that story and thought of mine, but they still just treated it as a joke.

I would stay up a lot later than the people in my house (parents + younger brother, plus an uncle aunt and cousin who were spending Christmas with us), and slept in a room upstairs on this little side road in a rural subdivision. No streetlights out there; just the lights that other people kept on their garages all night.

One night I went up to my room at about 2 a.m., and of course the whole house is quiet, and I go to my room and turn out the lights so I can go to bed. I usually throw a glance out the window and you can see most of the side street because the neighbors kept their garage light on all night.

This time the whole scene looks a little different. There's a big shadow looming in the front yard, and it's blocking a lot of light. Then I look closer and I realize it's not a shadow--it's something black that's cutting THROUGH the light.

Then I feel my heart practically stop as I realize…it's back. The Grim Reaper figure.

It was just like before. It cast no shadow. The scythe was there, and the tall hooded cloak, with no face.

The breath went out of me when I realized that, unlike before, this reaper was not looking to the side when I discovered it. It was looking right at our house.

II stood there, frozen again, my finger still on the switch from just having hit the light. It was a windy winter night, and you could see some snow move, but the creature's robe didn't move at all. The same way its movements before had been unnatural, now it loomed like a statue. No flailing around in the wind. Just standing tall, scythe up high, staring at our house.

I looked away, then looked back again. Still there. Looming. I didn't get the sense that it was looking at me, but I still couldn't stop staring.

Then I looked away, and looked back again. This time I KNEW it was staring. Again, it was hard to see--there was really nothing that I could tell that suggested it was looking at me. No evil glowing eyes or anything. I just felt it. Felt the same feelings as before--a rotten pit in my stomach, the feeling of being measured and weighed and considered.

I heard a squeak, and realized it was me. My breath was being squeezed out of me, simply from the fear. Keep in mind I had no idea what this thing would do next. What, fly up to my window? Suddenly disappear? Rip off its hood and reveal a laughing skull?

After a moment, its gaze departed from me, again. I felt good enough to go to my brother's room and wake him up to show him something in the window. It took him forever to get out of bed, but it may have only been a few minutes. By the time he woke up, rubbed his eyes, and listened to the panic in my voice, a few minutes had at least past. I showed him the window but, of course, the figure was gone.

But still, that was it, I knew. The night I saw death.

That was the night my uncle died.

chimera_phantasm,44,,52,1rbg7n,,185,"My name is Ramiel, and I want you to read this right before you go to sleep. Trust me, it’s better this way.

 If it’s the middle of the day for you or perhaps you’re not quite tired yet, bookmark this and read it when your eyes are starting to itch with tiredness, but you’re not nodding off yet. I don’t want you to forget what you’re about to read. 

I’m on the tall, skinny side of my arabic family, I guess I take after my mom in that respect. Though i’m pretty sure she didn’t have this much facial hair. She named me after an angel that is responsible for “divine visions”. I wonder if she knew how right on the money she was.  	

Why does my name and physical features matter? I suppose it doesn’t, but if I’m going to share something this personal with strangers for help or some kind of catharsis, i’d rather you had a good idea of who I am and not just a blank slate.  	

I don’t want you to forget me when this is over. 
	

Before we begin, here’s an interesting fact to wrap your head around: Your brain produces extremely high amounts of a psychedelic compound called DMT (Dimethyltryptamine) two times in your life; Once when you are born to help cope with the pressure it puts on your fragile, infant body during the painful process of birth and once again when you are seconds from dying to ease the burden it puts on your body and mind as they both shut down for the very last time. This is often why people claim to see their loved ones who have long passed on by their side, bright lights from the sky or feelings of elation. 

This process is so strong that it has the capabilities to erase everything in your mind, like a mass wipe of your hard drive. Now you might think that isn’t too important if you’re just starting out your life or simultaneously moments away from it coming to an end, but I ask you to entertain the notion that you possess a soul or an inner essence of sorts; what if that soul, that consciousness, that essence of you simply continued on without the knowledge of a past existence? What if at the moment of death, you saw something so undeniably horrifying and inconceivable, something you’d only seen in fleeting dreams and nightmares throughout your life, that your brain compensates in the only way it knows how, by erasing any prior memory of it before allowing what makes you “you” continue onto the next stage of whatever is out there. Your brains last failsafe, a defence mechanism to ensure you won’t carry the burden with you. But like any kind of defence mechanism, there’s always a bypass...and there’s always a black box.  
	
DMT is a chemical produced by your pineal gland and it is responsible for us dreaming every single night. Not the reason, however. We have no idea why we dream, we just do. As soon we enter REM sleep, our dreams become their most memorable and malleable. It is at this point we have dreams which take proper form, that we feel most real and perceive to be the most accessible, though we seldom ever remember the dream itself. Because like a drug trip, our brain is determined to protect us from that experience...but what if that wasn’t the only reason?

Consider this; The older we get, we sleep considerably less hours. As babies, we sleep for up to 14 hours and by the time we hit 18 years old, it’s half of that amount. What if this is a defence mechanism our brain develops so that we don’t spend too long in “that realm”? No, i’m not talking about “the further” from Insidious or some kind of Nightmare on Elm Street knockoff, before your already horror obsessed minds make some kind of parable to an existing franchise for comfort or relatable aspects. You’re still very much within your own mind, but there’s something else there with you.  

Now I ask you to suspend all beliefs or non-beliefs and read on to hear my story and why I no longer sleep and why, despite being an Atheist, I pray to something, to anything, (hell even Hypnos would be a welcome evil right now) that should my mind succumb to sleep and my body fail me, that I don’t dream. 

I’m a counsellor at my local university, I took on the job in September of last year as a ditch effort to bump up my resume and to reduce rent through living on the campus. It was your usual run of the mill kind of work, talk to terrified 1st years who’d never lived away from home before and were simply not used to their newfound freedom, dealing with homesickness, new friendships, one night stands etc. The 2nd years were dealing with social troubles within their houses/apartments, deadlines mounting and the occasional unplanned pregnancy. The final year students were typically near breakdown over their dissertations and end of year exams, so you’d offer them all the appropriate advice, your own experiences at the university as an example and then ultimately hope it all sinks in. If not, well there’s always next week and beyond that, a private therapist. 

But, like all forms of employment that deal with face to face interactions, there’s always one encounter you never forget. For me, that was Milo Moraga, a 2nd year student studying Psychology &amp; Philosophy. The first time he came into my office, he struck me as a little bit gaunt, his striped long-sleeve top hanging off him like it’d stretched in the wash. Strung out, but shy. That would have been my first impression. I think he sensed my preconceived notions, avoiding making eye contact with me as he shuffled inside. He was apprehensive, sleep deprived, his hair greasy under a black beanie and his eyes laden with heavy dark bags underneath like someone had put on eyeliner while he slept. He sat down, glancing around at the windows and leant forward, cracking his knuckles and rubbing his hands over one another hastily.

*“Hello Milo, how can I help you? I understand you asked for this appointment because of...anxiety? Do you want to tell me about that?”*

 I looked through the brief set of notes the receptionist gave me and tried to study as best I could while he spoke. Nothing that would ultimately help me ascertain the problem, it just gave him time to compose himself. 

He didn’t respond, just kept shuffling in his chair, I guess he wasn’t 100% sure he should come here.  	

*“Your lecturer sent you here, didn’t they?”* I said bluntly, feeling a slight headache come on as I felt an awkward 30 minute session rearing it’s ugly, monotonous head. 

He nodded, but I noticed something in that moment that made me think there was more to it. His expression was almost like he was pleading for his life as he quickly nodded.  	

I leaned forward, placing my hands under my chin and up to my lips as I observed him, I had to be very careful with how I handled this. If he was suicidal, one wrong statement could leave him with a noose round his neck.  	

*“Milo, what happened in the classroom to get you here? Can you tell me that much?”*

He mimicked me, leaning forward as well, though his posture was the furthest parallel from my own, it looked like his spirit was broken. 

*“The lecturer...Ms Armstrong...she was talking about solipsism and I just got...lost within it. Do you know what solipsism is?”*

I did, but I shook my head. I didn’t want to interrupt him when he was being so open. 

*“It’s a philosophical belief that everything an individual perceives is only in his own mind, it is a construct of his own psyche. There is no other human beings, no other individual thoughts, just his or her own...I guess I found the idea kinda comforting and I broke down.”*

 I raised an eyebrow, that’s certainly not a usual response. 

*“Comforting, Milo? You mean to say you enjoy being alone &amp; isolated?”*  

*“No, the opposite actually, I have a lovely group of friends, a loving family and a fiancé, but it was comforting for another reason...if It’s just me, then what hurts me is just me, I know what i’m capable of and it makes any kinds of threats a moot point. It means that..that...”*

 He put his hands up to his mouth and began crying silently, the picture of this situation was getting uglier and murkier the more he explained. 

*“It means that I might not die after all.”*

 I rolled up my sleeves, my flannel shirt was already beginning to chafe me. First signs of stress, I suppose. I looked down at my charm bracelet my wife brought me and took in a deep breath. I knew this was going to be rough. 

*“It’s...it’s my dreams, doc. There’s something in my dreams. I can’t sleep anymore. Each time I do, it’s like I can sense i’m going into that place again, journeying deeper into the void with every evening. I’ve tried taking coffee, shit loads of red bull and any cheap ass energy drinks I can get my hands on...I even took those pills truckers take so they can stay wired for 18 hours, but...well you know the problem, right doc?”* He looked down and started rubbing his hands together again, his knee bouncing as he struggled to keep it under control. 

Withdrawal symptoms combined with sleep deprivation, this kid was getting more tweaked by the minute. 	

*“The problem being that we all have to sleep eventually, no matter how long we put it off.”* I exhaled. *“Milo, I want you to start at the beginning, I know you’re anxious to get some kind of help, but if I don’t know the route of the problem, I can’t give you the correct advice, okay? Now I want you take in 3 deep breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. Can you do that for me? And you don’t need to call me ‘doc’, i’m just a volunteer counsellor. You can call me ‘Rami’ if you like?”* 

He nodded and did as instructed, his demeanour improving slightly with each successive inhale, though this was hardly a permanent solution to his paranoia. I didn’t want to ask at this point how long he’d been awake for, but I could tell it’d been more than a handful of days. Once an individual goes past the 3 day mark, they will begin to lose their grip on sanity and brain cells will start to die. I was silently hoping I could find out the problem to this sooner rather than later.  	

*“Alright”* I picked up my laptop to take notes. *“Go ahead, tell me what started this all off.”*

What follows is the unedited conversation, this is verbatim what was said between the two of us. If I can find the audio recording later, I will attach it to the post.  	

*“Do you know much about lucid dreaming, Rami?”* 

 *“I know a little, just that it’s something practiced and allows for complete control of the dream by the dreamer.”* 

He nods before continuing. 

*“There’s a learning curve to it, you need to lie in bed and shut out all outside sounds and impulses. The typical things really, the sensation to scratch your arm, to roll over, to block out the voices.”* 

He stopped and stared at me with fear. *“I didn’t mean to tell you that...”*  	

*“It’s alright, we’ll get to it later, let’s just focus on the why and not the how for the moment. What made you decide to lucid dream in the first place?”* 

 He shifted in his chair and suddenly looked very timid. 

*“I kept seeing him in my dreams, at first he’d just be a random appearance and then he’d start to try and approach me, friendly smile and hand outstretched like he was greeting an old friend. Never threatening or hostile, just attempting to make contact with me. Though he’d never get to. Every single time, i’d be distracted by something at the last second or my dream would veer off in another direction.”*

He shifted in his seat and closed his eyes before continuing. 	

*“I remember in the first few dreams we had, he’d just be lingering in the background. If I was walking through a street, he’d just be standing with the crowd my brain created and not really reacting to anything but me. I’d see him watch me, but then my dream would shift and I guess i’d just ignore it and carry on...after a few weeks, I began getting better at controlling my dreams. I’d start to mess around with the world I was inhabiting, like Inception I guess but more...personal. I’d turn myself into a member of X-Men or i’d go on a date with my perfect woman, y’know...things that you can only dream of, literally...well that’s when he started to become more apparent. I’d usually wake up before he actually got too close, but I’d always remember the look on his face before I did.”* His eyes widened. *“He always looked so angry...”*

*“Former abuse victim?”* I thought, adding it to the list of potential issues and solutions. I didn’t want to stop him while he was on a roll. I nodded to show my attentiveness and he continued. 	

*“I still remember the first time he managed to speak to me. I was in a park i’d visited as a child with my mother. It was a small piece of heaven in London back then, a mental safe haven when things got too stressful I guess. But this was nothing like I remembered it, the trees weren’t trees, they were corpses stacked on top of one another, some overlapping and...meshing with one another in unspeakable positions to form branches. I could feel the atmosphere almost turn to pure disgust as they noticed me, unable to move or even speak to me. But their eyes, their eyes said everything. Because at first they fixated on me with hatred, then quickly away in sheer terror. They’d seen something far more terrifying than the fate they were already suffering...so...I...”* 

His eyes welled up with tears, unblinking as they streamed down his face.  	*“I looked, Rami. I looked and saw him standing some 40 feet away down the path, his head bowed. He wasn’t moving and yet he was. His body was almost...rippling. The closest way I can describe it is the way a signal on a TV channel in the old days used to bend and flicker when the signal was weak. Every time I blinked, he came closer. I tried for the longest time to not blink, really...I did. But the brain betrays your conscious impulses. The more you try to put off a basic function, the more your brain wills you to do it. When he was 10 feet away, he simply vanished. By the time I had registered that he was gone, I heard a whisper in my ear...he was standing right behind me, I could feel his breath on my neck. Rami...it didn’t feel human.”*	

There was an awkward silence, he took in some deep breaths and shuddered. Obviously reliving the memory wasn’t going to be something pleasant for him but...the way he reacted, it was like he truly had experienced this. I stared at him, nodding and silently encouraging him to continue. When he didn’t, I leaned forward and quietly asked him what i’m sure he was waiting me to ask; 	

*“What did he say to you, Milo?”*

Milo shook his head. *“I’m sorry, I don’t remember. That was when the dream ended. I didn’t see him again in my dreams for a while.”*

We talked for a little while longer, mainly about his anxieties in crowds and eye contact, then our time came to an end and we scheduled an appointment for the following week. 

This would be our last session together.  	It was a Monday morning and i’d just come back from a friends wedding, my wife and I had been drinking so by the time I got to the office I was nursing a hangover, my flannel shirt covering the bruises i’d sustained falling over and my best pair of jeans smeared in alcohol. It was a day my mind was not in the work, I suppose. I just wanted to get home and go to sleep.   

 Milo came in earlier than planned, he looked desperate. He was pulling at his hair, biting his fingernails and pacing constantly. It didn’t look like he’d seen any sleep at all. I sent a text to my colleague asking for security to come over as soon as possible. He was going to need to be sectioned for his own safety. How on earth he’d managed to go this long without his friends or fiancee doing something is beyond me.  

*“I remember what he said, Rami. I remember it clearly now.”* He said between pants and more nail biting. 	

*“Okay, Milo. Well why don’t you take a seat and we’ll talk it out?”*

 He ignored that, but stopped pacing and stared intently at me.  	

*“I’ll be right here, always.”* He put his arms around himself, a self defence mechanism when a persons personal space has been violated. 

*“That was what he said. I heard it again and again every time I closed my eyes.”* 	

He started bashing at his temples. *“IT WON’T. FUCKING. STOP.”*  

All I could do at this point was try to keep him talking and calm until security got here. 

 *“Did this make you afraid to dream, Milo?”* 

 He started laughing, his face showing the complete opposite of his vocal expression. Pure incredulity and fear on his face against the guttural sound of his manic laughter.  	*“You don’t get it, do you? He didn’t mean just when I dream. He meant always. Now I know...now I know for sure.”* 	

He took a deep breath in and his demeanour shifted, he suddenly looked like a man almost at peace. Not content but willing to let go.  	

*“Thanks for listening Doc, sharing this with someone was important to me...and to him. He’s going to have his work cut out for him i’m sure.”*

 And just like that, he got up and left. I followed him out, naturally concerned for him. I watched him leave the building and cross the road.  

Then he did something I won’t ever forget. 

 He turned to me, smiling and outstretched his hand, crying openly as a vehicle struck him. I didn’t even see it coming, I was so captivated by his expression.  	

I couldn’t even bring myself to go over to his body, I gave my statement and went straight home. All I could do was look in the mirror, wondering what it was that was bothering me so much about how I looked and why Milo outstretching his hand was so disturbing to me. When I looked at myself, I didn’t see a 6’0 150lb brown coloured hipster. I saw someone troubled, someone who didn’t look like they’d slept much lately, someone like Milo...

I got a phone call from the hospital later on that evening, Milo was in a coma and on life support. He was non-responsive and likely brain dead. His family were choosing to keep his life support on in lieu of their religious and moral views. I think deep down, they just didn’t want to let him go. I’d been asked to go into his apartment with a member of his family to see if there was anything to indicate why he would willingly stand in front of oncoming traffic.

I won’t bore you with the traveling details, but his apartment was surprising. I was half expecting a filthy, run down place filled with half eaten food and human waste given his obsessive and unstable state. Guess I just watched too many detective/horror movies growing up. 

His place was immaculate, everything was extremely clean and organised, he’d already packed up a lot of his material possessions into boxes with names on the front, this was already beginning to look like premeditation. 

He had a desk beside his bed, this was the only place in his room that showed any signs of his lack of sanity rubbing off on his living conditions. Books on demonology, the science of sleeping, DMT, some sleeping pills and a journal. 

His brother went through the boxes while I took a look at the journal (i’ll include photos later if I get permission from the family, names have been changed and anything too personal will of course be blurred out). It initially contained legible, competent insights into his nightly journeys as he began to lucid dream. But as this other entity began to make himself more known and aware, the content shifts and the writing becomes hastily scrawled, certain words appear larger than others, he questions himself on numerous occasions and draws the mans face more frequently as the journal comes to it’s end.  	

The final entry is barely legible, but it details a conversation he had with the man in his dream and that a reminder that he would be with him always.  After this, there is just a single word on the hardback of the journal, rewritten over and over, almost like it’s been carved in. 	

**“DREAM.”**

Which brings us to the final part of this story; the present. I’m sure you’d all love to discover i’m actually cursed or that this story will follow some typical archetype of horror shorts and i’m moments away from death, passing on a final message. But as i’m sure you’re all coming to realise, that is not the case.  	

I just woke up from a lucid dream, i’ve never had one before nor do I know how I had one, but it was definitely a lucid dream. I was able to control my reality, my own physical form and everything around me. It was here I saw Milo. He approached me slowly and before I could even say anything, he asked me a favour;  	

*“Pull the plug, let me die.”*

I was so taken aback that my rational thought process dissipated and for a moment, I wondered...was this perhaps a shared dream? 	

*“I can’t take the torture anymore, Rami. Please tell my family I love them, but I need to be let go.”*

*“It’s okay, you don’t need to suffer anymore in the real world, i’ll do what I can to convince them.”* I croaked, placing a hand on his shoulder. 

Milo’s smile faded.  	

*“I’m not talking about the torture there, Rami. I’m talking about the torture here...without being able to wake up, he has complete control. I’m his new puppet and he wants to play forever. He has no physical form, this is where he resides. This is where he plays.”*  He looked over my shoulder and back at me, with a sad smile on his face.   	*“Now, he’s chosen you as his new playmate. He knows you’re going to take my place. Look at my journal again, look at the drawings, you’ll need to remember.”*

He turned to walk away, leaving me feeling completely helpless in my own lucid dream.  	

*“Oh and Rami...don’t turn around.”*

I didn’t, but my entire being was willing me to. It’s that same feeling of anxiety you get when you’re home alone at night and you have the feeling something is watching you. A crushing, horrifying feeling. I woke up in a cold sweat and did as he said, I looked over the journal and in addition to scanning the drawings, I found a theory Milo had documented in between the pages of his journal; 	

*“An idea is manifested through suggestive stories and cultural signifiers, we can plant ourselves, a character or a concept into our subconscious and our dreams with enough hints both subversive and subliminal. An idea, be it malicious or noble, can grow and manifest in one mind before being shared to the masses through any kind of information supplement.”*  

The second section detailed a supporting theory;  	

*“Within every story told, fictitious or semi-biographical, exists a universe that we have created that is as real as our own. For how can we truly know if our reality is more valid than the one we have created? How can we truly know we have not just been added into a story of our own by a neutral writer we know as “god”? This reality is as malleable and relevant as the one within which we dream. Our dream world or “coma world” it can be argued, are the realities and our concept of reality is but a dream in itself that our brain creates to escape the chaos, uncertainty and pain of our dreams.”*

You’re probably painting a very good picture of what is happening right now.

I’ve attached an image of the man in this story and i’m sure you’re all familiar with him.  If you are, you’ll understand why i’ve done this.  Why i've made you aware.	There is no Ramiel, that name is a subliminal plant in itself, it means “Dreamer” in Arabic. I described him perfectly for you as a defence mechanism against what is going to happen in the coming weeks, months and years. I gave you plenty of physical aspects for your brain to put together, you only know a basic layer of who he is so that your brain can put in the key elements which will make you trust him. 

You know, it's funny, but I found out what Milo meant by ""Dream"", it's an acronym. 

""**D**ream **R**ami **E**vil **A**lways **M**anifests.""

That's where I got the idea for Rami.

He exists now to help fight off *“him”*.  Because now you’ve read this, read my experience and Milo’s, you're aware on a subconscious level...and he needs new playmates.

 This is no warning, that implies you can do something to change it. You can’t, your dreams are his playground, not yours.  	

You can shrug this off as another horror short if you like, if that makes you feel better and sleep easier. But he doesn’t just strike the night you fall asleep, he strikes when you allow your dreams to become more open and easier to mould. He only enters when the reality is in flux.  But with Ramiel in your head now too, you have a guide, a protector, to help you.  I didn’t. 

At least Milo is at peace, hopefully I will be soon too. I've been putting off sleep for days, I can't keep doing it much longer.  

 I’m beginning to feel drowsy, I took a large amount of sleeping pills before writing this last section, I can’t put off sleeping forever. I don’t know whether i’m going to wake up or not, but at least you’ve all been warned about him. Feel free to reverse google image search the hosted image, learn about him and if you do feel a sense of familiarity, please be careful.

Dream of Ramiel, you will be safe. 

I wish you all the best, you might not know my name or my face, but do not forget my story.  I will do my best to answer any of your questions in the comments later. 

Do not forget about him. 

Because believe me, he won’t forget about you when you fall asleep.

The worst thing about all this? I'm not sure ""he"" stays in the dream world anymore. When Milo looked at me, I think I mistook his expression and his gesture. At the time, I thought he was crying and happy, stretching his hand out to shake my hand.

 Now, I think he was terrified to see his worst fears manifested in the real world and he was stretching his hand out to stop ""him"" getting to me in the real world. 

Why say this now? Well, i've been getting steadily drowsier, and I've felt something breathing down my neck for the last 20 minutes. 

Who knows, maybe it's just my paranoia... 

Sweet dreams.

afewsmallrepairs,11,,49,1rff0q,,185,"There's always some chipper real estate agent waiting at the door with her flyers and her too-big smile and her nails painted to match her pants-suit.  They're nosy, and smothering, but today I see that this one is busy with a bright young couple, pointing out how much eastern light the kitchen gets with one perfectly-lacquered finger, the same goddamn shade of melon-red as her smart little blazer.  I still take a flyer from the cheery wicker basket in the front hallway, out of politeness more than anything.

The house smells like cookies.  It's an old realtor trick; make someone think that they could be happy in this strange new place, picture yourself cozied up on the couch with a plate of fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies and a mug of hot cocoa and suddenly the price doesn't seem quite so steep.  People want to feel like they're home.

It's a candle, I think.  Smells sour-sweet and artificial.

I realize suddenly I've been standing alone in the foyer for a few minutes, staring aimlessly into the house.  Where to begin?  The living room, I guess.

There's a big ugly faux-leather couch along one wall.  The cheap kind you find at Big Lots.  It doesn't serve much except to fill up the space.  It's flanked by two particle board end tables, little doilies on top of these.  Miss Melon-Red Blazer doesn't have much of a sense of style if this is her handiwork.  The room looks like a scene straight out of a 1980s Sears catalog.  I can feel one of my headaches coming on like the low rumbling of summer thunder on the horizon.

There are little dimples on the walls, paint covering old nail holes left behind from family photos that once hung there.  Scenes of summer vacations, children playing, smiling happy faces.  You only put up pictures if the people in them are smiling, right?

Well, the realtor hasn't put up any pictures.  The room feels empty, skeletal without them.

I move into the bathroom.  Nothing special here, more mementos from Walmart in the form of a seashell-shaped soap dish and a tacky plastic shower curtain, but I've found the cookie-scented candle so I blow it out with deep sense of satisfaction.

There are two bedrooms.  One at each end of the hall.  I choose the one to my right, feeling faintly like Alice in Wonderland as the real estate agent babbles away in the sunny kitchen's eastern light.

It's a small bedroom.  The baseboards look brand new even though the house is several decades old; whoever replaced them was an amateur.  This looks like a shitty piecemeal job done by someone without nearly enough time or care.  It's a shame, is what it is.  This would all have to be redone.

They've set up this room as a home office but it should be the children's bedroom.  Where the thrift-store desk and bookshelf sit I can picture two tiny pink beds with matching flowery comforters, sweet shiny stickers placed haphazardly across each headboard as little girls sometimes do.

The headache is no longer approaching, it's *here,* spidery sensations of dull pain spreading across my brain.  I tap my knuckles against the space between my eyes but it holds fast.

Focus.  I brace myself against the doorframe and there it is, the telltale trace of someone's childhood, tiny little tic-marks carved in the wood to indicate height and its progression through time.  I run my fingertips along these marks, still so visible through the fresh coat of paint.  It even looks like someone tried to sand them off -- who would *do* something like that?  Who would try to erase the remnants of someone's *life?*

If I don't leave I might faint, all the blood is in my head with the headache so I do leave, I move down the hall to the other room.

This one is the master bedroom.  Looks like they couldn't afford a bed to properly stage the scene, so this one feels even emptier than the den.  The walls have been repainted, a cheerful robin's-egg blue, but it's wrong.  It's all wrong.

They did a fantastic job covering any sign of the fire but this color, I *hate* this color, it clashes with my bedspread and I would've never slept here beneath this hideous shade of blue -- though there were many nights I suppose I didn't sleep, I lay awake for hours trying to comprehend what had gone wrong, where he was and why he thought he could fool me.

I drop to a knee to touch the outlet in the wall.  It's new, of course, they would've had to replace it.  Faulty wiring that causes fires, well, that just wouldn't do.  When the bank takes a house it can't sell one with such a serious problem.  Sometimes things need to be replaced, resold.  A “fixer-upper”, that’s what they’d call it.

The headache is in full force now yet a small smile tugs at the corner of my mouth when I remember everything he'd promised to do to this damned house, all the little projects he swore up and down he'd finish someday to make this place perfect for me, things that went forgotten when he decided his energy would be better spent fucking any secretary at the office that looked his way.

It wasn't hard.  I went to the library two counties over and did research on arson.  I was careful, used the private browser on Google Chrome and still cleared the history, wore a wig.  I'd seen enough about Casey Anthony to know how careful you have to be, even if she *did* get off -- but no one will ever truly believe she was innocent, she'll be a pariah forever and that's simply not how I planned to live the rest of my life.

I'm really sorry about the children.  My daughters.  I truly am.  I didn't know they'd be in our bed that night.  They were supposed to be at a friend's house but they came home early, someone had pulled someone else's hair and that set everything off like a line of terrible fateful dominoes and the headaches were getting worse and it was probably all for the best anyway.  I didn't do anything that couldn't be fixed with a few small repairs, both to the house and my life.

It makes me so *angry.*  He was still acting like father of the year when every night for months he slipped under the sheets beside me, reeking of some other woman's sex?  He couldn't even bother to take a shower and rinse the stink off his dick but he was still being a model dad, letting our daughters snuggle next to him when the boogeyman came in the dark and mommy wasn't there because she was away at her own mommy's, the perfect alibi for when the police came to tell her I'm sorry ma'am, there's been an accident, could you please come with us?

I'm still crouched next to the outlet when I hear Miss Melon-Red Blazer behind me, inquiring politely if there's anything she can help me with.  The bright young couple has gone and it smells like she's relit the candle in the bathroom.

I straighten, tucking a strand of the long blonde wig behind my ear and smiling in the way that makes members of the service industry smile back at me.

I explain I'm just looking.  The price on the house is so *low,* though, what could possibly cause such a dramatic drop in this recovering economy?

The real estate agent's smile falters and she hesitates.  I know she's bound by law to tell me, to explain what happened here and why the pricetag on a little creampuff in a nice neighborhood is next to nothing.

I know the old saying about returning to the scene of the crime, how dangerous it is and how not careful I'm being right now, but something in me can't resist because I can still see the little matching beds, the stickers across the headboards and the tic-marks on the doorframe and something inside me *needs* to hear her say it, to quantify each and every step I took to get here.

""Well,"" she says slowly, ""about a year ago, there was a fire...""

I nod and smile and as she tells me my story in her own words and somewhere in the back of my skull the headache lets go, the pain in my brain dissipating at last, leaving behind just me and the real estate agent in my old bedroom, standing in the same place where about a year ago my plan went into motion and I set my husband and children aflame. ",I hate open houses.,234,nosleep
lynzo,20,,67,1r79t5,,179,"Through years of failed attempts to have my own kids, I yearned for children of my own, well, used to. 

I would travel for hours just to baby-sit my nephews while Helen (my sister) goes for their fortnightly romantic dinners to ""keep the flames of passion going"", in her words.

Playgrounds and parks were my favourite hunts. Toddlers old enough to walk would sometimes totter their way to the bench I'm sitting on just to smile at me. Young children would come up to me and play 'pretend' with me. It's quite a strange phenomenon, but without my trying to, children takes a liking to me. Of course, I'd gotten strange looks from parents, as though I dangled a carrot in front of their children's noses to lure them to me. There were carrots, but just not fr.

I met my BF, Luke, (now husband) some years ago. In the beginning stages of courtship, he would just look at me and smile, and I just thought he was just smitten with me. He's gotten me smitten quickly enough too, with his honeyed tongue. He always seem to know the right things to say. He'd still continue to look at me, and then just smile.

It was only some months into our relationship that I found out he could see spirits. His childhood was shaky when he first realised no one else saw the paler beings. He had since gotten used to them as they would either wander aimlessly or just stay rooted to a spot. Apart from seemingly looking at him, they don't try to communicate with him.

One day, a few months after finding out about his ability, he told me he has something to tell me. For one, he isn't the secretive or romantic type so I guessed it wasn't to propose. He held my hands and looked at me straight in the eye, and said, ""Umm... How should I put this..."" After a few false starts, impatient me started losing my cool and he finally got it out, in the crudest way he could put it (I know I deserved it), 


""You have three little ones following you since the day I met you and that's the reason why I looked your way and smiled at you. I've been wondering, but why are they following you?""


He went on, with a matter-of-factly tone, to explain that the children at the playground were not approaching me, but the little ones following and sometimes playing around me, and that the little ones aren't like the usual spirits he have seen but are much smaller (thus the name ""little ones""). Whenever he just looked and then smiled at me, the little ones were playing with each other and dancing around me. He had never seen other beings interact with one another before. Despite it being a hot day, the chills and the cold in my chest made the weather more bearable.

Before this, I had a failed relationship with a man who loves children as much as I did, but just upped and left, the day after I was discharged from the hospital for my third miscarriage.

horriddaydream,16,,65,1r68c5,,177,"My father always taught me to be kind to everyone.

There was this garbage dump close to my home; I can't say anybody got a thrill out of living closely to the wretched thing, for it stunk all to Hell and the trucks constantly entering and exiting could be an extreme annoyance. I walked on the outskirts of town frequently past midnight, which you may say is stupid, especially if you saw my build and how small of a person I am, and just how difficult it would be for me to protect myself from anyone. 

A few times as I passed by the always-opened gates of the dump, I also passed the man who would enter their limits every single night.

As shady as he was, he had a lot to say.

His name was Terrance and he had been staying in the dump at night ever since it had opened back in 1980. He had long, straggly hair and he claimed that ""this area was just too dry; the job shortage was unbelievable."" He would probably never have his own house. I felt the upmost of pity for him and sometimes I even welcomed him to walk with me. Everybody always seemed to know Terrance. He was like the friendly neighborhood hobo. They would nod to him, wave, give him a few dollars, thank me for being so kind to him even though I would shrug it off and whisper that he was simply good company. 

I asked him where he went during the day and he just said ""everywhere."" He had a huge, black satchel that he slung over his back that probably contained normal homeless materials like paper towels, maybe a few little scraps of food. It always smelled but he smelled in general, though I was too nice to say anything. He claimed that there was a hollowed-out truck near the far side of the garbage dump and he would stay there at night because it was warm, and it was shelter. 

It made me want to cry; just the situation that this poor man was in.

I lived with only my father and so on occasion I would invite Terrance home to have a warm meal, and my father was more than happy about this. He was a kind man as I was a kind young adult, and he completely understood that my heart was in the right place. Terrance knew everything about our family in only a short amount of time and he never once took advantage of us. He was just a man who had no direction after losing his way.

Terrance disappeared for a couple of days. I peered in through the gates of the garbage dump, thinking twice about entering. 

I walked to the back and noticed that there was nobody inside the shell of the truck that he had described to me a many of times. But as I peeked inside the windows, I saw many black satchels just like the one that Terrance was always carrying. Most of them were empty, but others were still shut tightly and looked full. 
I reported the scene.

The cops had found small children of all shapes, sizes, ages, and genders inside the bags. He had been living off of them for years. 

There was a lack of missing children in the area, though some were found to be local. Nobody knew where they had all come from.

He had been inside our house. He had been inside my head.

Now he was nowhere to be found.

horriddaydream,15,,57,1razjr,,151,"A new job with a bad boss with very little pay with customers that I didn't really like. 

That was the make-up of my new job at the bookstore.

We were called ""The Book Chefs"", a little shop on the corner of 6th &amp; Weston Street, whose name I didn't quite understand aside from the fact that, as employees, we were permitted to prance around in these aprons that wore the name of the store, and help customers find the books that they were seeking.

One day as I was stocking the shelves I felt a tug at the back of my apron and I smiled as I whipped around, figuring it was probably one of the other employees attempting to get my attention so they could tell me a funny workplace joke.

There stood a man in front of me, short, hunched, with thick glasses and a balding head - and he appeared to be mentally challenged. ""Hi, Pretty.""

""Uh…"" I caught myself, wondering if I should say hello and ask him what he needed, or respond to his compliment. ""Are you looking for anything in particular, sir?""

""You're pretty,"" he snorted again and then he walked out of the aisle, never taking his eyes off of me. It took a few seconds for me to process the fact that he had walked out of the aisle completely backwards. I watched him walk from aisle to aisle and he watched me, too. A half an hour later and he still hadn't left.

I did what any normal person would do; I told my boss at the back of the store.

The conversation was short and sweet. My boss picked up on the fact that the man was a bit slower, and she reasonably questioned him, ""Are you with somebody, sir?"" He said, ""No, I am by myself"" and she said, ""Are you looking for anything?"" ""No."" ""I'm sorry but you can't stay here all day. If you don't need anything, would you mind leaving?"" 

He crept out of the store, backwards again, and he gave me a wave as he disappeared around the corner. I felt barf in my throat.

That night as I got off of work, my eyes darted all over the back parking lot as I went to fetch my bicycle from the rack. My boss was arranging things inside the building but there were no windows along the back and so suddenly I felt eerily alone. It didn't take long for me to notice that somebody had cut the wires where my bike was located, and it was missing. I groaned and felt the urge to cry. That was a brand new bike and now I had no way home. I immediately panicked and decided that I would have to ask my boss for a ride. She was in the backroom, so I strode over to the door and began to rap on it slowly.

""Janet?"" I asked, hoping she would hear me from inside. Then, louder again. ""Janet!!""

The sound of my bike spokes being kicked could be heard from the woods behind the bookstore. My head jerked around and there stood the man from earlier. 

My heart sank in my stomach.

""Don't come near me.""

He took a few zig-zaggy steps in my direction, holding a small bag out in front of him as he worked his way across from the parking lot. It took him quite a few seconds to get to me from where he had been located and I froze in place as he came within feet of me. 

""I want to show you something,"" he said in his slow, soft voice.

""Please go away.""

He placed his hand inside his brown, leather bag and pulled out a book. Then he pulled out another. He stacked them on the ground next to himself and he nodded toward them. ""I like books.""

I played friendly, afraid he would hurt me if I didn't. ""What series is that?""

""Skin,"" he replied.

He grabbed one of the books off of the pile, and he neared me until he was within such a close distance that I could feel his breath on the front of my face. Then, he shoved the book into my hands.

It was still warm.

It was bound with human skin, stitched with real stitches, still bloody and damp.

My terrorizing screams had scared him away. I'm not sure that they ever found him. 

He had left one of the books in the parking lot in his quick getaway. There were no words written on the pages, but the police suspected that he had been using them as journals.

Odyssey_The_Crip,45,,47,1r4dm5,,150,"Fuck me.
I was told to come here by a friend of mine, having never heard of nosleep. personally I'm not really on board with the idea of having a community of people read my story for personal pleasure, but hey, what ever. 
I guess a little bit of back story is needed here. I live on the nice end of Vancouver city, with my grandmother. I'm in secondary school, and that school is in my general posh-ish neighborhood.  

2 days ago I was Getting home from a long-ass boring day at school, I decided to Fuck around on DayZ until either I died, or fell asleep at the keyboard. At around 11:30 my Dog, Buddy, Decided to be the most annoying little shit possible. So i turned my computer off, and put the little fucker's leash on. At this time of night, the whole block was lights out. I Could barely see 15 feet.
10 minutes of walking later I began to feel a bit paranoid, street light's were flickering, fog was getting thicker. Buddy, on the other hand, was  trotting along rubbing his little schnauzer face in the frosted grass. 
Then, he stopped. Dead in his tracks, then buried his head in my calves. I urged him to keep moving, and after much encouragement he reluctantly followed.
I rounded a corner, going back toward my place, when i spotted a figure in the fog, a big one. Thinking nothing of the fact, just someone else enjoying the fucking weather or something. 
As we got closer buddy started barking, crazily. I urged him to shut up, lest he wake the neighbors. 
Then I got a good look at the figure. It was a man, 6'7 about, pale, He had a brown tweed waist coat, a brown tweed fedora and some brown baggy suit pants. 

As we neared him Buddy grew more and more frantic.
That's when I noticed his smile. The scariest fucking smile you will ever see. He looked like he won the lottery, got laid and inherited a mansion within a period of 2 minutes. It stretched from ear to ear, a yellowed, fake smile.
God, i wish i could have unseen it.
I was within about 3 feet of him, then the smell hit me, It was a mix between pure decay, shit, aged cheese. 

Then, he stopped right in front of me. and said in the most strange voice, like an elderly man trying to be smooth.

""You have a cute dog there, boy.""

""Uh, yeah, thanks.""
I guess something in my voice must have pleased him. or something, cause he chuckled a sick, smokers laugh. I began to move away from him breaking eye contact. Looking back on it, I should have just fucking ran.

He grabbed my arm

""Do you want to see my dog?""
I looked down, and i realized he had a leash too. He yanked on it, and trailing blood, Came the corpse of a maggot riddled dog.
I threw up in my mouth, This thing that was once a dog was missing patches of white fur, it's skin was turning green, bits of skin were missing, it's ear was ripped and an eye was gone. I couldn't even tell what the dog's fucking breed was.

Through his smiling teeth he said.

""Pet the dog""

My dog was oddly quite this whole time,i missed his barking.
I tried to get away, he tightened his grip on my arm then he dug his finger nails into me.

""Pet the dog""

""Please, No"" was all that came out of my mouth.
His smile drained instantly. Into an angry twisted frown, teeth still showing. 

""PET THE FUCKING DOG"" He screamed. yellow spittle flying from his mouth. my arm was turning red from the irritation his brown fingernails were causing me.
I had no choice but to pet the dog. I reached down slowly and ran my free hand along its back. The fur and skin began to peel back as maggots crawled along my palm. My hand was covered in a clear, slimy film. 
He let go of my arm, then shoved me. I landed flat on my ass on the pavement, Then i took off running. My dog was sprinting along with me. Then i heard him laugh, then scream.

""NOW I WANT TO PET YOUR DOG.""

My blood went cold.

I heard pounding on the pavement behind me, and a dragging. 
He was coming after me, pulling his dog along with him. Running 2 straight blocks, i ran down my alleyway, my house was at the end of the block. I flew down the alley, still hearing his laughter and slamming footsteps behind me. I got to my house, ran up the stairs and fumbled for my house keys. As His laughter grew in volume to an unbearable height, i got the door open shoved my dog in then slammed it, and locked it. not even a full second after I locked the door, there was a slam on it. 

He had ran into the door. 

This slamming continued for 20 minutes and then, silence. I waited 5 minutes then called the cops. in less than 10 minutes, they were here. I told them exactly that what happened, they told me they'd book the guy. Until then they told me not to leave the house.

not 5 minutes after they left, i was asleep on the couch with my dog.
I was awoken to the sound of a door bell ringing. I practically jumped off the couch, ran into the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife, and went to the door. thinking to myself, 

""I'm gonna kill this bastard.""

I Flung open the door knife in stabbing motion.
No one was there, Nobody.
Then I looked down, And threw up. 
The fucking dog corpse was sitting there, in a pool of blood.
Nailed into the dog's head was a note

""I don't like it when they run.""

Right now I'm sitting in my house, With no one but my grandmother, who is too sickly to get out of bed. My parents and my little brother are out of town at a dude ranch in the interior of the province. 
Fuck dammit.

EDIT: I'm sorry if there's any spelling mistakes, grammar errors, or punctuation issues. I'm shaking right now

UPDATE: He was standing outside my window today. just standing there, unblinking. i was frozen, and a minute after still eye contact, his head started violently shaking. Like only that part was having a seizure. I ran to grab my camera and he was gone. That spasm his head was having, paired with the smile. was utterly terrifying.

acidmutt,40,,38,1r1qip,,136,"I have a problem and a fear, I fear I am not from here or am even human. 


Ill start with the basics and excuse me for spelling mishaps for I am writing this out via mobile device. I am supposedly a eighteen year old female. Currently living in Canada, although I hail from Debrecen, Hungary. I moved to Canada when I was ten years old. For as long as I can remember I have questioned what I am. Certain signs have always been there. I feel things I'm sure others do but most don't, I see things and I talk to things. 


First weird occurrence, I do not remember life in Hungary at all. I only remember from the age of ten and up. It feels like I've only been alive for eight years. Second I don't know where my parents are. I lived with a woman named Tina and a man named Marco since I moved to Canada up until I moved out a couple months ago. They tell me they adopted me, and that my Hungarian parents went missing and were never found. 


I feel cold all the fucking time. My feet and hands always feel like ice blocks, to the point where my boyfriend can't take the chills he gets when I put my hands around him at night. In the summer even on the hottest days I am always wearing a sweater and avoiding the shade. I love the sunshine. In the winter months it is ten times worse. I can feel my bones aching from being so cold. 


I can't swim, I float but I can't swim or ride a bike. People are either left handed or right handed, I am niether. I can't write worth shit with either of my hands. I try to only eat food I don't have to use silverware for. 


A polar bear follows me. I see him everywhere I go, tried to touch him once but he disintegrated into the air. I see dark figures that roam the streets at night, I see people in my mirrors that aren't there when I look behind me. I've gotten so used to seeing things I'm not even scared anymore. A few have spoken to me, they mainly ask for help. I helped one once but he burned me. 


I feel pain, and I bleed though. I pass out when I hold my breath, I have emotions. I look normal I think. Sorry for the male readers, I don't bleed once a month like I'm supposed to. I don't even have the organs I am supposed to, to reproduce. I have baffled x-ray techs and doctors everywhere. 


My dog not only hears me but he understands what I am saying. He can do all his tricks without hand motions, just my voice. No big? When my boyfriend tries to get him to do a trick just by speaking to him he doesn't know what to do until my boyfriend gestures along with the words. Tina and Marco tell me Oz (my dog) has been with me since and during Hungary. 


I've gone a week without food before I started feeling light headed all the time and gained hunger pains. I didn't lose any weight, I never do. And I never gain any. My teeth were so sharp they used to cut into my cheeks and cause discomfort, but last year the dentist filed them down for me. Baffled. 


I don't think I can see as well as a cat can in the dark but deffintly better then most other people. I've never had friends, people have always avoided me or left me out of activities. 


Tina is a ethologist and Marco is a paleontologist as their professions, why can't I remember.

Sleepwalking_t,34,,55,1r7w1t,,131,"I have been having sleeping problems for about 6 months now. I have troubles falling asleep and staying asleep. I also have issues with sleep walking, serious sleep walking issues. I live in a dorm, on the first floor, and right outside my dorm across the street is the smoke pit for my area. I once woke up sitting at the smoke pit in my pajamas sitting on the picnic table with my elbows on my knees, face in hands.

 
Please, hear me out, I know this doesn't seem supernatural, but I'm terrified and I don't know who to tell. I am going to continue with my sleep walking issues. 
I will not get into specifics on where I was but let's just say I was not in an area you would want to walk around alone at night. It was a community sleeping area, massive tent and I woke up sore, bruised, and covered in dirt. I figured I must have slept walked outside and fallen down. I have woken up standing in the middle of my dorm room, woken up sitting up right on my couch when I had fallen asleep in my bed. 


A few months ago I could not sleep for 2 days straight; no sleeping aids or cold medicine would work. Frustrated, I finally made a doctors appointment for my sleeping problems. I left out my sleep walking because I could loose my job if they knew I slept walked, and was prescribed Ambein. 
The first night on Ambein I still had troubles getting to sleep but they finally kicked in after an hour or so laying in bed. I woke up refreshed but a bit groggy, and got dressed for work. 


The next night on Ambein the pills kicked in quickly and I had , what I thought , to be a deep dreamless sleep. When I got into work my co worker laughingly asked me what the hell I called him for last night. 


"" What are you talking about?"" 


"" You called me last night, crying hysterically."" 


""What?!""


"" Yeah... I was about to get dressed and come over to check on you. You said , ' It's here Myke, it's here!'. Then you started snoring sooo... yeah figured you were just dreaming...""


Completely bewildered I apologized. I checked my call history and sure as shit, I had called him at 0447. 


Strange. I just played it off as a side effect of the Ambein. 
A few weeks went by and nothing else strange happened. I continued to take the Ambein. 


Sometime during the work day I went to show another co worker a funny picture I had saved on my phone when I noticed I had a lot of black photos on my camera roll. I selected the first one and it was my  dark room lit up from the flash. The next one of a different part of my room again lit up by the flash. This went on for 12 different photos: different parts of my room, dark, lit up from the flash. I downloaded an app so I could see the time stamp from the photos. I was definitely asleep; great, sleep me was taking pictures in my sleep.

 
I have started waking up with bruises, cuts, and feeling sore for no particular reason. 


I was staying the night at my guy's house and he told me the next morning  I sat up out of bed and asked him: 


""Do you see it?"" 


""See what?""

 
Silence from me, then I laid back down.

 
He jokingly told me that was the last night he would sleep with me. We laughed but I felt terrible creeping the hell out of the poor guy. 


It's escalating, Ive started seeing things when I'm awake. I see a black form walking into my bathroom while I'm getting ready in the morning. I ignore it, there is no way in hell I'm going to investigate that. Things disappear from my room then show up in the same spot days later.

As I grew, i spent more and more time watching T.V., playing videogames on my Super Nintendo. And when the Sony Playstation came out, my parents couldnt pry me from the screen. As a consequence, my eyesight suffered. Slowly at first, but as i got older, it became an issue. It was never so bad that I couldn't see without glasses, but it was bad enough that i needed them to drive when i turned 17. However, as senior in high school i quickly lost my glasses and proceeded to drive anyways. No wrecks, no tickets. I thought that maybe my eyesight had improved over the few months that i had actually worn my glasses. Oh how I wish I had been right. Halfway between being 19 and 20, i picked up a job as a delivery driver. Easy at first. Until i had to start driving at night. The night I almost ran off the road because I couldn't see through the oncoming cars headlights, was the night I knew I had to get a new pair of glasses. The next day I made an appointment, and 7 - 10 business days later i had my new glasses. Nothing special. Just a simple blue metal frame with slightly skinnier than average lenses. I Wore them all day. And whenever someone asked how it felt to have new glasses, i smiled and would comically sing ""It's a whole new world"", you know, that cute little song from The Little Mermaid. Oh how right i was. As I prepared for bed that night, getting changed, taking a shower. It all seemed normal. Until I wore my glasses into my darkened bedroom. No light was on in my room. And i had foolishly turned off the hallway light before entering my bedroom. Now in total darkness, I realized just what real fear was. You see, with my slightly blurred vision of not wearing glasses, any shadow could be brushed off, simply because i couldn't focus and see what was just beyond the outer veil of darkness that covered them. But now, with those infernal glasses. I could see them clear as day. The creatures from monster stories. My own personal Boogiemen. All sitting around my room watching, waiting, inviting me to lay down and fall asleep right in their midst. Right in my own bed. I stood stunned. Terrified. Not Knowing what to do. When suddenly, one of them spoke. The most terrifying voice I had ever heard. ""Why not run away again child? It amuses us to watch you at night, oblivious to our very existence. Unaware that you lay right where we want you. Each and every night."" I stared blankly, and felt confused. Again? How could i have seen these creatures before and not remember it. Surely I would have some memory. But none came. As if to answer my question, it spoke again. ""Perhaps these will jog your memory."" It brought up its gnarled hand and un-clenched its fist, palm up, to reveal my original pair of glasses. A pair now almost three years old. That's when it hit me. I hadn't lost my glasses. But thrown them away. Into a river. Nearly twenty miles from where i lived. Now more afraid than anything, I did the only thing I could, I laid down in my bed. Removed my glasses, and watched as those terrible Boogiemen, again returned into those empty, featureless shadows, that surround each and every one of us every night as we lay down to sleep.",Glasses,206,nosleep
Dusteratops,14,,29,1r8rf4,,125,"It was a long day of work, and my face was covered in oil and grease of all sorts. I suppose I looked like a coal miner or a hobo as I walked down the road. It was evening, so the crowd wasn't too large. There were groups of ladies, making their way home and spouting the latest gossip. There were solitary people making their way with their head down and their ears plugged in. There was a peculiar man walking adjacent to me with the strangest clothes and a mullet. He wore a robe with a sweater tied around his waste. Then there was Rachel, ahead in the distance. She was my ex-girlfriend who didn't know how to cope with seeing me, so it always turned out extremely awkward. I immediately turned around and talked to the first man I could start a conversation with, who just happened to be the man in the robe. 

""Hey.""

""Hey..""

""Whats up."" 

""Just walking around. So you like to read?"" He spoke in the thickest accent, and I couldn't figure out exactly what is was.

I was carrying a book, and I do like to read. ""I suppose so, I want to be a writer."" I replied, and then we jumped into the thickest conversation about all of our favorite books and the way the world works. He was able to question all of my ideas, and had a detailed answer for each and every one of my questions. Its safe to say I learned a lot from him. 

When Rachel walked by, she simply waved and smiled. I nodded back, but I couldn't help but notice that she felt like something was funny. It must have been the dirtiness of my face though this weird secret humor just continued to resonate off the face of every passerby. It was unsettling.

Mid conversation he asked me what my name was, without even breaking from the previous sentence. I told him my name and reached out my hand to shake. He left me hanging and slammed his palm into his chest and proudly proclaimed ""I am Moko."" 

Then we jumped right back into our conversation, which went on for quite some time. The sky became dark, and we were the only people in the road. I asked him where he was from and he never told me. 

A large chunk of our conversation was about sanity, and the works of the insane. He seemed to know everything about them, and it was unsettling the way his knowing black eyes drilled into my soul. Yet I learned and thought and learned some more. 

He pulled out a napkin and refused the pen that I offered him. He wrote down my number after searching for his marker for about a minute. He promised to give me a call when he got home, for he did not have a cellular. Then we went our separate ways. Oddly though, he went back the way he came. 

There were two girls laughing when we split apart, and I figured it was because of the thick accent my new friend had when he yelled his farewell. 

""He has a funny accent, doesn't he?"" I asked the two girls.

They responded by looking at each other and laughing to some secret joke, then one of them said, ""Who does?""

""You know, that man with the mullet I was just talking to.."" they gave each other another look, but it was without humor. The skin on my neck began to stand on end. They walked away.

I know he has a loud voice. I know they heard and saw him leave. I know I am not crazy. I know- My phone rang. I answered.

Before I go to bed, I turn on my laptop by my bedside table, run any pending downloads I still have, open Banshee (my music player), press play and leave it as I drift off to sleep. At times I would wake up, groggy and sensitive to the sound so I would stop the music and go back to sleep. Two nights ago however, what I woke up to was not music. Instead it was the voice of my mother. Telling me something with the sweetest motherly voice I have long been familiar with.

Was I afraid if hearing her voice? Of course not! Everyone at home longed to hear her again. Everyone at home longed so much to see her again. I missed that sweet voice, and boy was I happy to be able to hear that again. Of course, I understand that it was just a dream. A dream in the most familiar of environments, with the voice of your late mother talking to you. I'm happy for just that.  

What she told me in that dream though, did make me scared. Her words, though in the most caring and motherly of voices, were:

I used to be on NoSleep every day. I'd be sitting at work refreshing the page, and hoping for another “Flawless Frank The Fallen Angel”...but when the Boothworld Industries...fiasco...went down I checked out. If you were an ex girlfriend you'd be snickering and telling your friends I've come crawling back; begging for your help. 

I'd be embarrassed, but I haven't felt much in the past few days. I don't care anymore. I just need to tell this to somebody; I need to feel like a person again. 

Have you ever wondered if there was anything more out there? I mean literally, out **there**; above the sky.

Sunday night, maybe 2am.

I had just shut down my computer after my nightly gaming session.  I was laying in bed, browsing reddit on my phone, and debating whether or not I was hungry enough to eat another can of spaghettio's, or if it would even be worth the trouble of walking downstairs and waiting for it to heat up. I'm not sure what made me notice it, what actually snapped my senses to the realization...but it was suddenly too **quiet**.

Granted it was 2am, so its not like I was expecting any sort of noise in particular.  My roommate had fallen asleep hours ago, but it was just so *still*.  I'm not sure if any of you know what I'm talking about, but it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  I felt like I was in a vacuum; it was utterly oppressive. 

I'm not sure how long I sat there, waiting for something, before the glow.  A deep blood red light had flooded the hall and oozed under my door, and it was slowly pulsing.  I wanted to call out, to tell my roommate to fuck off, but I knew it wasn't him. I just knew. I don't think I could've formed words if I tried.  The vacuum sensation I had felt was gone, and now, sitting in my tiny bedroom I felt like I was under a microscope. That terrible “like you're being watched” sensation I read about so much hit me like a brick.  I can't explain how exactly I felt, a mix of horror, dread, and confusion.  I wanted to bolt, but I wouldn't have been able to force myself to open that door if I tried.

I managed to shuffle off my bed, and to the floor.  I opened up my nightstand, reaching for my revolver. I needed to feel that cold steel, and the heft of it in my hand. As soon as I picked it up, I was at a loss because for the first time, it just felt like a toy in my hand. I looked back to the door to that glow, and felt completely powerless.  There was a shadow now, someone was standing outside my bedroom door, and I felt like I might as well have been holding a nerf gun.  

When the long scratch started, I felt nauseous.  Like I was 17 again, smoking weed in my room when I thought I had the house to myself and my mom knocked on the door asking why the fuck it smelled like burning leaves in the hall. That sudden weight in my stomach, the sudden dryness in my mouth.

It was like a nail being dragged down the door, from the top of the doorway to the bottom.  I followed the sound with my eyes, and when it stopped, I heard a voice.  “Hear” might not be the right word, because it came from inside my head.

*Michael. Please put down the weapon.  We do not want to harm you, and I do not plan on doing so. Your weapon would be useless anyways, but I respect your autonomy. May I enter?*

This had to be a dream; a nightmare. If every waking moment since I...heard that voice hasn't been an eternity in a waking hell, I might be able to convince myself that it was.

*I wish to speak with you, Michael. We have much to discuss. May I enter?*

There was no fucking way this was happening.  I'm...lucky I didn't need to, because I couldn't have spoken if I tried.  Whatever it was must have known there was no way I would have let it in, because it answered me anyways.

*No matter, you will see us in due time.  We would like to invite you on a journey, Michael.  You will come with us, and see everything you have always wished to. We've known you for a long time, you would say “years”.  You have a week to decide, we will not force you. You will require no luggage, no currency. You will want for nothing.  You will not see your family or friends again, but in time you will cease to worry about them.*  

 *We respect your decisions. I do think however, you only have one real choice.  I will see you soon.*

__________________________________________________________________________________

Then it was all just over...I might have sat there for hours. At some point, I got up and sat on my bed.  When I finally mustered the courage to look out the window, it was already dawn. When I heard my roommate get up and go to work, and finally figured it was safe to open my door.

I am a shell.  I don't know what to do you guys.  I haven't slept. I forced myself to eat something yesterday, but everything tastes of cardboard.  I booted up my computer, but now my *life* just feels like a game I'm sick of. 

I forced myself to talk to my parents the other day, and smile at work, but any interaction I have feels forced and artificial...like I'm just going through the motions. There was no way I could mention what happened Sunday night to anyone. 

He was right...I have only have one choice.  If I don't go with him...with *them*, I'll be trapped in this empty hell. My life feels like a hamster in a cage.

Who the fuck knows what will happen if I **do** go with them...?

kimmiekissies,13,,30,1rgt5c,,119,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before????????? Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out, and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her.

ephique,32,,31,1r5tqd,,93,"Me and my brother were spending some quality time playing old video games from our childhood, just chilling on the couch in my upstairs bedroom when the electricity in the entire house went out. It was just us two home at this point, and it was pitch black outside. In desperation of finding our way through the house we used our phones to take flash-shots, giving us a small update of where in the big upstairs level of the house we were; trying to make our way to the staircase leading down.

We finally did, and from there it wasn't ridiculously hard to manage ourselves to find some candles and what not. We did what we could to drain out the time while waiting out the electricity-problem. Eating sausage rolls, gossiping and having conversations about what games to play once the electricity was back.

It did come back after a couple of hours. We already found ourselves in the kitchen, positioned in the lower level of the house so we brought some snacks and drinks before we inevitably decided to continue our journeys into Donkey Kong: Country, Super Mario World and Castlevania 4 on the Super Nintendo.

Upon starting our Super Nintendo my brother asked me where the remote for the tv was, since we both were too lazy to actually use the power button on the tv. Although the remote was nowhere to be found. While looking for the remote, which we both swore has never been anywhere else than on the coffee-table next to the couch, the electricity ran out again.

My brother expressed as he sighed: ""Oh come on, are you kidding me?"" Being slightly more prepared the second time, we picked up our phones and started taking flash-shots again. After a couple of shots the memory on my phone ran out. I never thought we had taken that many pictures. Either way I entered my image library on my phone to delete the old photos from the first time the electricity went out.

slightly2spooked,45,,21,1re11f,,90,"NoSleep, I need your help. 

Where do I begin? I started working volunteer shifts at my local community centre about 6 months ago. I love my job, I get on well with all my co-workers, but something's been bothering me recently. More than bothering me, actually. 

There's been an attack on a child. 

Well - I can't call it an attack, exactly. Everyone's calling it an accident, but I can't believe that. 

Let me start over. This whole thing began when the centre began to hold saturday clubs - an hour or two, every weekend, when kids are given pretty much free reign over the place. We put on activities - cake baking, crafts, that kind of thing - and just generally keep an eye on the place.

We're also there to keep the kids out of the basement. I'd like to say before I start that I've never heard of anything being up with the basement before. I'm not a particularly superstitious person (or at least, I wasn't before all of this happened) and I don't scare easy. 

Basically, the kids have to stay out of the basement because there's a lot of junk down there that could topple over onto one of them, or otherwise get them in trouble. Just to reiterate, this is the only reason I was ever given for keeping them out of the basement.

But kids aren't satisfied by a simple 'it's dangerous down there'. They wanted to know *why*. 

Well, I spun them this cock and bull story about how I'd seen a monster down there once. The other volunteer that day, Julie, joined in on the fun immediately, and soon we had them all believing that there was something dark and horrible in the basement that would snatch them up and eat them if they ever went down there. We're talking about 5-10 year olds here, so the stories weren't particularly gory or scary - but they believed us pretty much right off the bat. 

Maybe that's why things went so weird. I'm sure those of you who've been around children know that they see the world in a different way to the rest of us - what seems to us like childish fantasy might as well be real life to them. 

Anyway. I told them that story three or four weeks before the incident. Every Saturday we'd have these kids in, and every Saturday the veteran members of the group would take on the duty of informing the new members of what horrific fate awaited them should they wander into the basement. With each telling, they'd add details. Some of them were actually very grim - they came up with one about a 'Victorian boy'  (bearing in mind that the community centre was only built in 1954) that had been eaten by the monster and still roamed the halls, crying out to go home. The details got more and more gory - they came up with the idea that the monster would 'mark' its victims with three slashes of its horrendous glistening claws - this was the same week we were showing the Zorro movies on the old projector. 

In short, it was beginning to seem as though 'Saturday Club' had turned into 'NoSleep Junior'. We had complaints from parents about their children being too scared to come in, and so my boss decided it was time to put a stop to the monster talk. We tried everything we could to get the kids to stop talking about it - we played non-monstery games with them, we made apple pie, we even passed the caretaker off as a 'professional monster hunter'. That kept them quiet for a while, and we began to hope that they'd lost interest altogether. 

In the meantime though, I began to feel more and more uneasy locking up the centre at night. I had no reason to be afraid - Julie or one of my other co-workers was usually waiting at the front desk for me in case there *was* trouble, and the Zumba fitness group usually hung around outside until we locked up anyway. In short, nobody could get in without one of us noticing. 

I mention that because the night before the attack I could have sworn I heard someone  - a small someone - crying, all through my lockup. It always seemed like the voice was coming from the next corner, but when I looked, there was nobody there. I even got Julie out to have a look - she said she couldn't hear anything, but I could tell she was concerned. Maybe she just wanted to get home early. I don't know. I told the police I hadn't seen anyone for definite, anyway. 

I wasn't working the next day, but that's when the attack happened. I don't know much about the details - the police told me that Julie heard crying and screaming from the basement, and went down to find two of our regulars, Tommy and Rosie, spattered with blood and crying. When she rounded the corner, she discovered a third child - I wasn't told his name, he was new - lying unconscious beneath a shelf. She confided to me later that while she'd told police the shelf must have toppled onto him, it looked more like he'd been hiding beneath it. 

What sent me to you guys, though, is the other thing Julie told me. Her first instinct, being a mother herself, was to pull the child out from under the shelf and make sure he was okay. He didn't have any of the injuries she'd expect in this kind of accident - no broken bones, not even a bruise. Instead, he had three bloody lines carved into his chest. Three large, horrible claw marks. 

When the police asked the other two children what they'd witnessed, they'd only say 'The monster got him'. The Centre is closed until further notice - I think they think there's some sort of psychopath living there. That's the logical explanation, but somehow I can't help questioning it. When I pass by the closed Centre, I swear I can hear a child crying inside - crying to go home. 

The boy is okay, by the way - apparently he's recovering at home, but he won't name his attacker. He'll only say that 'some*thing* got him'. I take a little comfort knowing that he's alright, but how long will it be before something else happens? Something worse? 

I'm afraid, NoSleep - what have I done?

I don't know if I'm the only going through this. I can't stay here long. The quickest way to explain what's happening to me is with a recap of my day(s)? I woke up in my bed as usual, but the second I blinked, I was in the local train station two weeks ago. My clothing changed accordingly. I looked around and people were giving me puzzled looks. I looked in the passing train's glass and saw that I was bleeding from my mouth and eyes. 

I blinked.

I was in my childhood home, watching my childhood self enjoy a bowl of cereal. He[?] saw me and ran off terrified. My father, who recently passed, ran into the dining room and shot me in the chest. Pain surged from my chest to my brain.

I blinked.

Due to the stress of the situation, I can't really remember where I've been. I just remember fear and pain.

I don't know what's going on, but when I blink, I get ripped from where I am and I open my eyes to a new setting.

Right now, I'm trying my absolute hardest to not blink. I'm at a Best Buy on one of the laptops. My eyes are welling up with blood, and I don't think I can do this for long. I don't know what's going to happen to me. If I leave, I will check back when I can, if I can. My memory is slowly fading.

The only thing that I know for certain is that there is a man wherever I go. I can't see his face, but he looks to be in his late sixties carrying a duffle bag. He's here in the store. Watching me with a smile.

I don't know what will happen if I don't open my eyes. If I keep them shut, will this fix itself? I've gone to over a thousand different places today, and I need anyone's help. If you see a man bleeding from his eyes and mouth, it's me. Restrain me and don't let me go.

I don't exactly know where to turn, like the majority of the sub I'm assuming you share the same interest as me in the supernatural, the other side. I've always been intensely fascinated with it, usually the furthest I went was browsing /r/nosleep or heading into abandoned houses to sate my thirst for the creepy, although, the same routine things quickly became dull and eventually, I slowly got desensitized, bored. This was about the time I started reading 'recipes' for paranormal experiences.


The whole thing seemed awesome, the Midnight Man, One Man Hide and Seek, The Shoebox Telephone. All gave me chills, but I remained quietly skeptical the whole time. Fuck. Why did I have to be so blind. I still can't find the place to blame myself, I mean reading scary stories on the internet posted by a bunch of anonymous people, it would be stupid to take it all for fact, right?


Of all the rituals, one caught my eye, The Three Kings. I'm hesitant to post the link but I feel like it would be naive to think that no one would give it a quick search. http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wbo0u/please_dont_actually_try_this/ A blunt explanation of it would be a recipe where you can contact the dead, and ask them questions through two propped up mirrors.


After reading it I felt like I had to do it. I quickly spread it to a few friends and it wasn't long until hype was built upon the whole thing. Me and my best mate (For his sake i'll call him, Darcy), organized to do this when we had a few friends over for a small gathering whilst my parents were out for the week. Funny enough, at the time the thing I was worried the most about was it not working. We had tried a ouija board once at my request, and nothing happened, we all just sat there fingers on the cup for 10 minutes blaming each other for pushing it whenever it moved in the slightest. They all probably thought I was an idiot. So I thought I would give it a kick, my bright idea would be that we would all get absolutely hammered beforehand so that when it (surely) didn't work we would imagine that it did or at least get really scared in the process. Well at least we had the 'really scared' part down pat.


So everyone came at around 9:00pm yesterday, and it was all pretty normal, caught up, bitched about a few people, had some laughs and it wasn't until around 11:00pm that we started to set up. The atmosphere then was so... amusing of all things. We all giggled the whole time in our stupor, acting as if we were kids in primary school kids about to pull a really lame prank. It all seemed fun then. Of course I had to be the one who volunteered to be the one who sat the throne, eager to show my courage off to my friends. My lifeline was Darcy, if anyone was to hold the key between my life and death i'd gladly hand it to him.

For the sake of the story I'll skip all the tedious setting up and get to 3:33am. We were all fighting sleep by then and I think Sarah and Alistair were already gone, though we were sitting outside that door for so long it was hard for us to miss the time. When I had walked in I was immediately hit by the cool air, though this one wasn't the ghostly cold, it was literally fucking freezing from the fan that had been buzzing on for a few hours. Though something did feel off, it was either the fact that I was in a pitch black room holding a candle to my chest with a chair and two mirrors propped up adjacent to it, or it was that all of a sudden everything was quite. As if the world around me was devoid of life bar the constant drone of the fan. 


I sat down clutching the candle tightly, persistent to not let it go out, suddenly very aware to what i was doing. I remember shifting in my chair uncomfortably for a while but what follows that still remains hazy. I remember trying to call out for answers, ""Who's there"" ""What are you doing?"" ""Is there another side?"". None were answered, just silence, and the buzzing of the fan. I then said something stupid and heard giggling, assuming it was my friends outside I started cracking jokes. The more jokes I made the harder they laughed until I said ""Why arn't you responding, too scared to show your faces?"" and looked into the mirrors. Now, the huge cardinal rules of this recipe is not to look in the mirrors and around about this whole thing turned to fucking shit. The worst thing about looking into the mirrors isn't what I saw but rather the absence of it. I saw nothing, i saw the chair, the fan, but no me. I quickly looked to the other, and greeted by the same emptiness. Then the rumbling began, have you ever been in a house when a plane has flown overhead and the ground slightly shakes? It was like that except the sound emanated from the floor rather than the sky. It continued to get louder and louder until my eardrums felt as if they were going to burst and then I peed myself. The mirrors shattered and sent shards of glass everywhere and my candle was quickly snuffed out, and I screamed, boy did I scream, I legged it out of there like nobodies business and slammed the door behind me. Of course everyone was fast asleep but woken up with a few of my screams and sharp kicks to the ribs. They attempted to calm me down but i was flailing and screaming, I told them we had to get out of my house, but where do seven 17 year olds go at 4:00 am in the morning? Eventually I calmed down and tried to pass it off as a drunk hallucination which i knew was very impossible but it made my mind sort of at ease. 

We decided to get everyone up and camp downstairs in the living room. I felt safer with all of them around me and after much apprehension my tired state got the better of me and I drifted off to sleep. Last night was some of the worst nightmares i ever had, I saw my friends hanging and mutilated, I saw my childhood cat lay gutted on the floor, I saw myself smiling at a mirror. When i woke up, i was upstairs in the room. In between both mirrors, which had been shifted to face me lying on the floor. All my friends had left, when i called them they all gave me half ass reasons and some just avoided the question altogether. 


I'm scared. It is now 6:27 and starting to get dark again and I haven't been into the room since I woke up this morning. Help me, please. I don't feel alone in my house anymore.","Please, help. I screwed up.",109,nosleep
TheeMikeG,13,,34,1r8w1k,,83,"Let me introduce myself. My name is Mike Gordan and I exorcise demons for a living. Yeah, work is hard to find, but I get by. I was born into a normal, loving family, but everyone kind of went their separate ways a while ago. I have an older brother who joined the military, and my mother and father are both pilots, so they obviously travel a lot. After I graduated highschool and was in college for a few years I tried my hand at law. But after I failed the LSAT I got pretty down and didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. I dropped out of school and found myself struggling to get a job and even more so struggling to pay rent. 


Then I found Jesus. And by that I mean I was dumpster diving and found a KJV little orange bible inbetween a moldy sandwhich and a spent tube of toothpaste. When I got to the part about the end of the world and that 666 stuff I got interested, really interested. I’d go to the library and do hours upon hours of research. I learned about the Devil’s crossroads and the Grimorium Verum and the Lesser Key of Solomon and demonic sigils and how to summon them. I watched all eight seasons of Supernatural in two months and got a license online to be a priest. With my trusty orange bible in my pocket I scowered Craigslist for people who needed saving.


At first all I found were people that wanted their homes blessed, their babies baptised, or someone to perform a homosexual marriage. But I had a wealth of knowledge of demons and I wanted to do something a lot more meaningful. Then I found her. Her post was desperate. She claimed to be waking up with bruises and in different rooms or even places than where she had fallen asleep. I messaged her explaining that I was a priest who specialized in demon removal and that I would be happy to exorcise her home. For a modest fee of course. 


She replied immediately that she would pay me whatever I wanted, she just wanted to get rid of whatever was doing this to her. When I got to her house I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. No weird smell, no demonic symbols or texts, nothing. And the girl looked fine aside from some minor scratches and bruises. But she cried and cried and begged me to help her. It was pretty awkward because I’d never done this before, but I played confidence and expertise. I had her sit down in one of her wooden kitchen chairs and I bound her arms and legs to it. I took out my bible and began to read from a page I randomly flipped to. 


“All nations whom You have made Shall come and worship before You, O Lord, And shall glorify Your name, For You are great, and do wondrous things; You alone are God.""


And then she started to scream. Not a normal scream though, a deep, dark sounding scream. I dropped the bible. Mustering up my strength, confident in my knowledge, I snapped out of my state of shock and fiddled in my deep pocket for the plastic bottle of holy water I had purchsed online. I splashed some on her face and was horrified. Her face sizzled and burned. I’m talking like third degree. And that smell, my God that smell; like sulfur. By now she was thrashing wildly in the chair. I bent down and quickly retrieved the bible, then started again.


“And He changes the times and the seasons; He removes kings and raises up kings; He gives wisdom to the wise And knowledge to those who have understanding, He reveals deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, And light dwells with Him.” 


By now shit was falling off shelves, furniture was sliding around, the whole shabang. It was awesome. In my element now, and comfortable, I improvised.


“Jesus I ask that you cast out any and all evil spirits in, around or attached to this woman! Lord,  sanctify this follower of your word, and help me to command all demons to leave at once! I bless this woman, and damn you back to hell!” 


Then she vomited and passed out. Everything stopped moving and all was quiet. When she woke up, she had no memory of what had happened but said she felt much better. The color returned to her face and I knew it was gone. After I untied her she went to her purse and handed me a blank check.


Since that day I’ve been performing exorcisms, and I’ve done so many that things have slowed down almost entirely. I haven’t had a job in months, and rent is getting hard to pay again. So, I used my knowledge to make a deal where everyone wins. I’ve actually got a new customer right now. She’s struggling against the straps, but it’s useless. Once I put the demon in her, she’ll pay me anything to take it out.

BensonHedges1,4,,25,1r2xlz,,77,"I heard the coffee pot drip before my alarm even went off, bizarre, I don’t usually set a timer. I like to go to the gym before I have my coffee. Maybe it was my boyfriend being nice. He typically works the graveyard shift, and sometimes he comes home in the early morning to leave nice surprises. 


“Might as well get up” I said aloud to myself, since no one else was home. 


My cat was absent from the bed, which is also weird, he’s usually by my head in the mornings. As I stretch my legs and arms out, I notice an odd chill run up my spine. Surely it was the weather, New England has a way with inconsistent temperatures, and the blanket over me was not quite fit for winter. It’s November, that sixty-degree weather is bound to disappear sooner or later. I haven’t quite figured out the thermostat, we just moved in, and the heat only seems to kick in on times when I’m not home. Must be the reason we bought this place so cheap...and why people keep selling it. New England is not the place to have a busted heating system. This has been the biggest point of arguments since my boyfriend and I started co-habitating. 


“Get out of bed, you’re going to be late to your class…” 


I said this to myself a few times, in hopes to have motivation to get to the 5:15am class at the gym. I had no idea what time it was, but if the coffee pot is going off, it’ was creeping close to sunrise. I haven’t unpacked the alarm clocks yet, so my phone’s been the only thing reminding me what time of the day it is. 


I thrusted my arms to the floor and pulled my phone to my bed — 2:11 am. 


“What the fuck?! I’ve still got two-and-a-half hours of sleep…and why is the coffee pot on?”


I slipped out of the bed from the left side and stumble to the kitchen to turn off the coffee pot. I’m a coffee lover, but nothing smells worse than burnt-coffee. As I went to flip the switch to off, I realize the time isn’t illuminated on the pot. Directly above on the microwave - nothing. Damnit. The power went out! The drip-sound of the coffee pot was so loud, and it was too early. I was confused. I could even smell the lingering scent of fresh brewed coffee…but it was 2am, my mind must be playing tricks on me. 


I headed back to the bedroom, a little freaked out, but convinced it was just all a coincidence. This hallway seems so much longer in the dark, and I still haven’t gotten used to the layout of this condo. As I pass the bathroom, I notice a shadow out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head and didn’t see anything, except the shower curtain pulled all the way open. Since we’ve moved in, we haven’t used that shower…we’ve got a shower stall in the bedroom…much more convenient. Though, I am sure there was a logical explanation for it. 


When I get to the bedroom - another chill down my spine. This was uncomfortable, it was a winter chill I was feeling. I was sure of that. Something was wrong, but i couldn’t figure it out. 

I need to go back to bed.


I hop in the bed and pick the blankets from off the floor. As I turn on my side, I hear the heater click on. The electricity is back on…fantastic! I start counting sheep in my head to fall back asleep, and keep thinking…”how did the blankets end up on the floor?”


What feels like an hour later, my alarm finally goes off. The smell of burnt coffee has filled the condo, and now I’m frustrated. I should have just unplugged the damn thing. And where is my cat? I have most definitely woken up on the wrong side of the bed. I moved to the kitchen to pour some coffee - and it’s dry. Nothing. I must be imagining things. 


That chill again! I could feel the hairs spike up on my neck - absolutely razor sharp. I decided to skip the gym and start my morning. I remained timid, but continued with my normal routine. As I rummaged around the kitchen, I noticed my cat out of the corner of my eye. He was twitchy, and obviously anxious. 


A few years ago my cat had major anxiety problems, and he developed what my vet called - “Rolling Skin Syndrome”. When my cat got anxious, his skin would roll around his body, it looked almost as if he had a small gum ball moving around beneath his fur. Today that ball was most definitely moving.


He paced back and forth around the house with me now, seeming more comfortable now that I was up with him. Every time I moved to another room, he cautiously peeked around the corner, almost as if he was looking for something. We moved to the bathroom, I started to floss, and then I heard it…drip drip drip. I am sure it’s not the coffee pot, and the house starts to smell again. As I analyze my senses the smell become more pungent. Less of a coffee smell and more of a rancid scent. 


Drip drip drip…


I follow the noise, it seems louder now, and it seems like it’s coming from the bedroom. Surely I would have heard it loud and clear when I was in bed earlier…it seemed so distant then. I enter the bedroom, and my cat stopped dead in his tracks. His skin is rolling again and he appeared more on edge, tail straight in the air and it’s hairs following suit. And that chill, of course, it was back. And my sheets and blankets, on the floor again.


WHAT THE FUCK? 


I’m working from home today, and every time I walk by the bedroom, I get the chills. I’ve resorted to closing the door until I’m not alone. It sounds like the wind is blowing up against the windows in that room, but from where I’m sitting, the trees are as still as ever.

TheGroovyTurt1e,12,,22,1raatv,,76,"So I'm not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told, if only for my own piece of mind.  I'm an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously under-served community.  The hospital itself is old, its been standing since the late 1800s, it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium. 
I've never really encountered anything supernatural, but I haven't written off the existence of such phenomena.  That being said, a shadow in the night isn't enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the night.
So when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty well.  I'd have my admissions, I'd take care of the current patients without issue.  Then one night I got an admission, I'll call this patient Jerry.  Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital, to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any would be physician that trains at this facility.  He has a whole boat load of medical issues, kidney problems, diabetes, high blood pressure.  He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia. 
Before meeting Jerry I was told he's actually a really fun guy, he's always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here.  So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen, I was a little anxious.  The admission was done, the orders were placed and I didn't think more of it.  He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night.  It was around 2 in the morning when I went back to see Jerry.  I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up.  When I went in there, Jerry wasn't in his bed.  Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet, his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor. 
I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying... not crying, but rather whimpering as if he didn't have the stamina to make it a full cry.  I tried putting on a brave face and said ""Jerry whats going on?"" For an old guy, Jerry was quicker than I thought, and stronger than I would have believed.  He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him.  ""They won't leave me alone, they won't let me sleep, they won't let me eat."" 
 He continued on in this line of things the phantom ""they"" wouldn't let him do.  I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home.  As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this, I still needed the blood and this wasn't the first time I'd dealt with a confused older patient.  I helped Jerry back to his bed.  Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK.  Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better, maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient, it was something familiar.  I tied the tourniquet in place, then I cleaned his arm, found my vein and went for it.  I'm not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing. 
I was filling up my vial, it was about half way full, when Jerry started screaming, ""LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE!"" He began to jerk violently, somehow the needle stayed in place, but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerry's body was pulling it back.  I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm, but the needle didn't budge.  In shock I pulled harder, my efforts still could not budge the needle.  In response, I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing.  The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being 3/4 full to maybe being about 1/4 full.  After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerry's arm, leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise.  Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me ""Can you see them?""  I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room.  I walked back to the nursing station, one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming.  I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill.  With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep.  I made my way to the on-call room, which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital.  I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes.  All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerry's eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them. 
I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing, and a senile sick old man.  The only trouble is since then the shadows I've seen in dark rooms seem darker, the lights unable to pierce them.  The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings.  I'm not really sure what to make of it.  In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker, the tapping louder and now I can't shake a feeling that I'm being watched.  ",Night Float,98,nosleep
floydnimrod,21,,22,1rhxtb,,116,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Of course, that's when I woke up.",I just dreamed of the apocalypse. I probably won't sleep for a few days now.,138,nosleep
Charlies_friend,20,,7,1rhapg,,81,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,88,nosleep

Terzis28,17,,38,1r6la8,,61,"So, a while ago (about a year ago now) I was sitting on my bed with the laptop on my lap. Next to me was my desk with my lamp on it. I was using an MSN video chat with one of my female friends. 

After talking for a couple of hours with my friend she messaged me (we both did not have microphones) and asked ""What is that kid eating? haha"" i simply replied ""What are you talking about?"" She stated that there was a kid sitting next to me with his hands at his mouth, as if to be chewing and gnawing either on his hands or something that he was holding. Chills ran through my body, but i soon realized that she was most likely messing with me.

I replied ""Seriously, stop messing with me"". She seemed like a pretty good actor considering she wasn't laughing or smiling at all. ""I'm not messing with you, I was just curious as to what he was eating"". At this moment I was getting a bit worried and decided to put her to the test. ""I want you to swear on your life that right now, you see a child next to me who looks like he is eating something"" I requested. ""I swear on my life, that is what I see"" she replied. I was pretty worried at this point and just when I thought I couldn't get much more creeped out, my lamp turned itself off.

I know it wasn't a power surge because my alarm clock was still on, and the standby light on my TV.

This could just be a strangely timed sequence of coincidence, but it sure did freak me out. I left the room immediately.",Child Eating,99,nosleep
Maniac_Mortician,8,,15,1r4jq5,,59,"I am surrounded by death. Mr. Jones on the prep table, currently expelling the blood that gives us life. Mrs. Loughlin is dressed on the side table, waiting for the casket to be delivered. The 4 year old Ryan awaits my oven in the walk in fridge. And the 23 year old, Jill Brewer, is lying in the casket, sitting silently still, waiting for her family to pass by, look upon her pale, lifeless shell, and weep. 

Jones finishes pushing the blood out of his system, and I set to work. I use the needle injector to put the wires into his upper and lower jaw. I pull tight, and twist, like sealing a loaf of bread. He looks at me, with his eyes partially opened and his mouth firm. I grab 2 eye caps, lubricate with Vaseline, and grab my tweezers. One tug of the top lid, one placement of the bottom, and then again to the other eye. He no longer looks at me. He now looks like hes sleeping, if sleeping involved 2 hoses connected to the arteries and veins of your neck. His naked corpse is covered in purple and blue bedsores. They come with the elderly, and especially the cancer patients. Most of these dead who pass from cancer are older, and the older they are, the less they have moved in the months that the infliction slowly ate the remaining life from them. 

A quick threading of the needle send me into cleanup. I baseball stitch his neck, scrub him down, and rinse again. Some skin is slipping on his left hand. Nothing the embalming fluid shouldnt take care of. If it continues, I resolved to just wax it before putting him in the last suit he'll ever wear. 

I look up, just in time to see my colleague wheel in the dark blue casket. The younger worker is  guiding it through the door. He looks pale. *Id probably use the pink dye for him rather than peach. Would make him more lifelike.* I plan the embalmings of the people I meet. Some call it morbid. I call it early planning. 

We grab Loughlin, get our arms around her frame, and place her in the casket. They wheel it to the parlor, and set up the chairs. I take off my gloves, remove my apron, roll down my sleeves, and grab my jacket. As i shut the door behind me, i hear the door buzzer go off. The Brewer family has arrived. The service goes normal, and I tag out with another director to go finish up Loughlin. I prop the door open, get on the gloves and apron, and grab my trocar. I stick the pointed metal pole into his stomach, and vacuum him out. With the plug in place, i rinse him again. I glance to the clock, and a figure invades my vision. 

A little boy in his suit and tie. I panic, and immediatly stop what I'm doing and throw a sheet over the body. I ask the boy his name. He just stares at me. I ask if hes lost? He smiles, and walks away. I follow him. He goes into the first room, and circles back through the office. I get back to the hallway, and hes back in the prep room. I tell him he cant be here. He looks at me, sadness in his face, and looks back to the walk in. He begins to sniffle. I walk next to him, and say ""Ryan, it's okay."" He looks back at me, and stops sniffling. Instead, he holds out his hand to me. I reach for it, and... Hes gone. I open the door, and hes sitting on the tray, in his little suit, waiting for my oven.

TheGraveSin,10,,17,1rdci1,,58,"So I grew up on a farm, cows, chickens, horses, you name it. I usually got stuck feeding and watering the animals while my brothers ran the tractors and threw the hay bales. Dragging the water-hose to each and every animal's water pan was a pain and sometimes I'd catch my younger brother sneaking at the other end of the pasture watering some of the animals I hadn't gotten to yet and it would always make me smile to myself. Sometime in the summer our ducks started dying off, I'd find them smooshed and assumed it was an incident from them trying to breed one another and split some of them up in different pens and thought nothing more of it.   

Then three days later, I found a calf with its body oddly angled and no sure sign of what caused it to die. Nothing else happened for about a month or two. Then I found the horse laid out, freshly dead with sweat beaded all over it as if it had been running all night, it was a young and healthy horse, one of my favorite, and my heart shattered to pieces. I was reluctant to go back the next day, forcing myself to look at my sweet animals and focus on them instead but they were acting oddly, the pigs in particular, who were hiding in their makeshift huts and houses, not even coming when I did my usual call or dumped out the food. I got worried and walked in the pen, getting on hands and knees to look inside their little houses, as soon as I saw their snouts with a squeal one of them ran into me, biting at my arm and face. I toppled backward, kicking it away and dashed over the top of the pen, hurt feelings because they were almost always happy to see me. I didn't tell anyone, just let it go, assuming that at losing so many of my precious pets I was wigging myself out.   

The next time I went out, (at this point it was around winter) because of the cold I asked my mom to help me with the animals. As we were dragging the hose to the dairy cows she stops suddenly and asks ""who's that?"" I look over seeing the usual figure of my brother and just say ""oh it's just Derek Momma"" She shakes her head. ""No, Derek's at Paul's."" A weird feeling crawled down my spine as I glanced over my shoulder at the young male figure. Dropping the water-hose, I stepped in his direction. I could clearly see his dirt-smeared jeans and the back of his hair had the same blond curl of my brothers. ""Derek!"" I yelled, running over to him and reaching a hand out to put on his shoulder. He turned his head in my direction, his bright red eyes meeting mine as my hand fell through air. I passed out then. My mom says that by the time she reached me the figure was gone. After later discussion, my brother swore on his life that he had never once been in the pasture with me. ",On the Farm.,75,nosleep
MissMonstrosity,25,,30,1r5z11,,57,"Hello everyone. I told this story to a friend who told me I should post it here in Nosleep. I'm sorry for any grammatical errors or bad commentary, I''m not much of a writer.

About four years ago I was a troubled thirteen year old, who like most teenagers, didn't get along with my parents.
It was just me and my little Brother, our Mother who spent more time on the computer then being a real Mother, and our Step Father, who in most cases, acted more like a frat boy room-mate then a parental figure.

Anyway this all started one day when my and my Mother got into an argument, only god knows what it was about since we argued all the time  back then. 
All I remember is that I stormed off, taking a backpack of clothes and some food with me, and ran into the woods.

We live on a huge property in the country, and the woods go on for miles and miles in every direction, with only a small creek running through it to break up the never ending amount of trees.
Alot of people might be freaked out by the ominous looking place, but I loved it. I went exploring out there everyday and I knew those woods like the back of my hand.
I ran to the south west, down a large hill that had the creek I mentioned earlier at the bottom of it, the creek itself went on even farther than the woods, cutting through several private properties and stopped just outside of a town over fourteen miles away.
I decided I'd follow to town, where I'd find somewhere to stay the night.
Why not just take the road to town? well we lived in the country, there were alot of crazy people out here, drunks, hill-billies, prostitutes, and a combination of all three. I figured if I took the road I'd only be asking to get raped or robbed.

I'll fast forward a little, about 2 hours later I finally came to the edge of our property.
The property after ours belonged to an old man, we met him in church a couple times. Despite several threatening ""No Trespassing"" signs  I wasn't worried, If he did so happen to come all the way out here and somehow find me, I could just claim to be lost.  I was sure he wouldn't be this far out in the woods anyway. 
Here the woods thinned out a little, and there were several small fields tucked between the trees. I came here before, but never went any further then the edge of the fields.
At this point   the sun was only an hour or so away from setting and I started walking faster to hopefully get to town before nightfall, I ran through the creek that separated me from the field, and slipped on something causing me to fall.
It hurt like hell, later I found out I had broken my toe. It was bleeding badly and I had to limp the rest of the way through the creek and fields.
I came to the end of the fields several minutes later, where a small path, either for ATV's or a tractor, led through the woods.
I never went this far before, but I knew if I kept going straight I'd get to the town within only an hour or so, so I went on.

After what felt like forever of following a twisting path that seemed to go nowhere It finally came to a small circular clearing. There was a fence surrounding it, with a large sign once again threatening anyone who crossed. I thought it was strange, we were hours from any house, why bother putting up a fence blocking off where no one would ever be likely to go? Then again I was going through, so maybe it wasn't all that uncommon. I crawled under the fence, foot still hurting like hell and went on through the clearing. I knew I wouldn't be caught, theres no way there would be anyone out here.
I walked, or more less, limped, through the clearing, on the other side there was another small field, and just my luck, there was a old tree stand in one of the trees surrounding it. 
We have a large hunting community, and hunters often hide out in the tree stands that were often camouflaged in the trees.
I thought it would make a great place to stay the night, since the town was still a long ways away and it was already starting to get dark.
I went up to it and poked my head inside, it was perfect. Just enough space to lay down and sleep if need be. 

I climbed back out and headed back to the clearing, There was a large hill to one side of it, I figured if I climbed up it I could see just how far away the town was. 
Ignoring my aching foot, I limped over to the hill, and right in that moment something hit me on the back of the head. It felt like someone angrily poking me, or throwing a small  pebble
I turned around quickly, expecting to find an angry farmer or hunter, no one was there, it was probably just an acorn or nut falling from one of the surrounding trees.
I laughed at myself for being stupid and rubbed at my now aching head.
For whatever reason, I decided to not try to force my way up the large hill, and instead went to the opposite side of the round clearing, I dont know why, it just felt like something was pulling me there.

About half way across the clearing I stopped dead in my tracks and gasped. I literally uttered  the words ""Oh my God"" Before quickly shutting my mouth in fear someone might have heard me.
There before me, were several grave stones. All ranging in height and design. 
The ground in front of some of them was lower than the rest of the ground, almost as if the coffins underneath had caved in.
I stumbled over to the graveyard, and bent down to try to read the head-stones.
Most were unreadable. Only one of them had enough words I could make out, it looked like two head-stones fused together.

The one on the left read ""G.A Keaton -date unreadable-
The one on the right said ""Harriet Keaton 18?? - 187?""
at the bottom, just visible, was ""Our angels, together in heaven""

At this point, I turned and ran.
I blacked out for most of the time I was running, I ran through the clearing, ran along the path, ran across the fields until I was finally back on our property. 
I only slowed down because it was pitch black outside, and stupid me forgot to bring a flash-light. It was so dark I could hardly see in front of me.
Once again, I'll fast forward, I finally got home after my step father had found me, apparently he went out looking for me, not to ensure I was safe and guide me home, no. 
Only because he wanted to drag me home to make me apologize to my mother.
I didn't care, I happily followed him home.
After finally getting there I found my brother, looking like he was crying, and my mom sitting at the table eating dinner, looking like she didn't have a care in the world. She glanced at me, made a face. And left the room.
Over time I ended up telling her about the graveyard, she found it interesting, and soon enough all my family knew about the weird graveyard in the woods. It became quite a conversation topic in our family, before over time, being forgotten.



One thing I never told anyone though, And the reason I went running out of that place like a baby-
 Was because, shortly after finding that cemetery, I started to hear whispering, and among the trees behind the graveyard, I could've sworn I saw something moving.

 Then, right after reading what was on the one tombstone, what felt like a long boney finger,
Started tapping on the back of my head.

iwillneverbefree,8,,20,1r1p8k,,51,"I'm just your average everyday guy with a job. I cook, I clean, I drink; hell, I even had a girlfriend before all this started going down. If you saw me on the street, you'd walk right by me without a second glance. It's just that I have a job. I'm a Paramedic.

I don't do anything important, I just help those in need. I started doing this because I didn't feel great about myself. I always loved helping others, and I always loved A&amp;P, so I saw this as a logical step. I loved every second of it when I first started. There was no greater high than when your adrenaline kicked in and your hands moved faster than your mind could think. It was ecstasy. This went on for 8 years. Every day I fell more and more in love with my job. My calling. The only thing that bothered me was that overwhelming sense of being in a battle. I thought it was normal; after-all, I was fighting for someone else's life I thought. If only I knew how true that statement was.

It started off with a shadow when I walked onto a scene. I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Maybe it was my constant concern of someone attacking me. God forbid I got shot while working. I should have known something wasn't right when my partner looked in the same direction when I did. I should have known better when he just shut down and barely spoke the rest of the night. This went on for a while, every so often seeing the shadow. Things started to get worse, however, when the whispering started.

At first, they were nonsensical. Sometimes I wondered if they were even there at all, if I was just going fucking nuts. But they were... They WERE there. It only took me losing my first patient to hear them clear as day. They were congratulating me. They were telling me how great of a job I did. I didn't understand then. My mind had been turning on me, it had to have been. ""It's the stress... It's the stress of losing someone"" I told myself on my way home. I sat at home and hit the bottle. Hoping that my next shift would be an easy one... one quiet shift.

It wasn't quiet. I should have known better than to use that word. It's bad luck. The voices didn't go away. They only got louder. Every patient I had I could hear them. ""It's their time"" ""She's ours now"" ""Let her rest"". I thought I was just compensating for losing someone. I thought I was just preparing myself if I lost another one. The more people I lost, the more they got more sinister. ""You're almost ready."" ""I haven't seen one this talented in eons"" ""You can't change fate""... ""Come join us"". I didn't understand right then, but I understood it all soon.

It was a 5 year old male. His heart stopped. I had to save this one, he was just a child, I HAD to save him. We got him to the back of the ambulance and I started my work. Things felt... odd. I felt as if I was in a daze. My vision was blurry, the lights seemed faint against the road. I tried not to think about the voices, I tried to block them out, I did a damn good job until it screamed my name.

""JOHN"". I heard. I stopped, and slowly raised my head to look at the bench seat across from me. It wasn't what you would expect death to be. It wasn't a man in a robe with a scythe. It was just a man in a suit with black eyes. I froze. I had to have been insane. I needed to tell my partner to drop my off in the psych ward when we got to the hospital. His smile was... calming. It was the kind of smile you'd expect a great car salesman to have... calming... but also sinister. His hair was well kept for a man his age, I'd have to say 50's or 60's. His eyes like a void of everything that makes us human, as if they were a black hole that sucked all feeling out of whatever had the poor misfortune of getting caught in their path.

""Haven't you been listening John?"" He said with a caring tone

""You know what you must do... You know who you'll become... Why are you fighting?""

I started screaming at him. ""Who are you?"" ""What do you want?"" ""Why have you been following me?""

He ignored all of my questions. He simply put his hand to the child and started rubbing his head.

""You fought for so long John. You know this is your fate. How much more pain can you endure?""

""What are you talking about?"" I yelled at him as the child's rhythm became worse and worse.

""Don't you understand John, we've been with you since day one! We are who you fight every day... We are the ones who you ignore to do your job... We are you.""

I began to understand.

""John, you must know something."" He said looking at the monitor as it flatlined. ""This will also be your fate. You will die just like everyone else. There's nothing you can do about it""

""Don't you think I fucking know that?"" I yelled grabbing the epinephrine out of my bag.

""JOHN"" He yelled again knocking the epinephrine out of my hand.

""You need to understand the forces that be. When you die, John, you will become one of us""

""The fuck I will"" I said, standing up, but was forced back down by some unknown force.

""It's not something you can change, John. You have so much potential... so much promise... We've been watching you from the day you were born... and we are very, very, excited to meet you""

I stopped fighting. I looked into his eyes and I felt something. Something I wish I never would have felt... I felt at peace. It was if all the stress of saving a life was gone. It was as if I didn't have to fight anymore. It felt like I was being held by my mother again, like all was right with the world.

I sat there and placed my hand on the child. I felt death pass through me. I felt the coldness of the nothing reach my heart and sit there. I understood now. I understood why I am who I am. It was as if everything made sense to me...

iampatheo,11,,15,1rcqug,,47,"  This is my first Reddit post so please excuse my mistakes. I live with my parents and my grandfather, who is my father's uncle actually, so basically not my grand""father"". 
     I am going to jump straight into the problem here because there is something definitely weird going on in our house. There have been this series of events which have occurred throughout my childhood which I have always put them at the back of my mind, maybe because as a child I didn’t look into it enough, but I never forgot. But with the most recent event I can't help but ask you guys for advice.
     The first event occurred when I was around 10 I guess. I was probably getting ready for school or something and the only people in the house that morning was my mom and my grandfather. Mom was helping me put my tie on ( we had a school uniform ) and I remember glancing towards the living room which is visible from my room. I saw my grandfather walk into the living room after which he proceeded to go towards the balcony and out of my sight. I got out my room and I was walking towards the kitchen to get some water. Now, the kitchen is right next to my grandfather's room and it’s on the other side of our house. As I reached his room I saw him sitting there reading the paper. I got a bit surprised because I clearly remembered seeing him in the living room just a few seconds ago and there is no way he could have gotten back here before me or without bumping into me. I asked him about it and he said he had no clue what I was talking about. So, I just put it at the back of my mind.
The next incident happened a year back or so. It was after 11 p.m and I was locked up in my room listening to really loud music through my earphones while doing some reading( I like doing that, getting a whole background score feel for the things happening in the book). After a while I heard my parents banging the door and shouting at me and I figured they must have been knocking for some time. When I opened the door I saw them both standing there with concerned looks on their faces. I asked them what happened and they said that apparently they could hear me crying out  for help from my room in a really panicky way and they thought had probably slipped and had broken a bone or something. I obviously had no clue what they were talking about and they swore that the voice they heard was mine and no one else’s. It freaked me out a little. But even then I didn’t put it together with the incident from all those years back.
     And now something has happened again last night and this time I am pretty freaked out. I was having my dinner in my room as I was watching a movie on my laptop. As I finished I got out of my room and headed for the kitchen. On the way I noticed my mom, dad and grandfather in the living room watching TV. As I walked past my grandfather’s room I saw him. Sitting on a chair by the window. The room was dimly lit but it was enough to see everything. I did a double take. I looked towards the living room and he was still there with my parents!  I looked back and he was still there sitting in his chair by the window. He was looking at me but for some reason I couldn’t see his eyes. Not because they weren’t there or anything but it was as if I was feeling this weird force which was trying to make me look away from there. I also got this head rush which you get when you stand up too fast. As soon as I recovered from that and my head cleared he was gone from his chair. My parents and grandfather were still sitting there in the living room chatting amongst themselves as they watched the TV. I told them what happened but they obviously did not believe me and thought I was making it up.
I really need to know what this is. Is this a doppelganger? And if so what should I do? Is this thing going to be harmful? It hasn’t done anything harmful so far.

WontThinkStraight,12,,11,1rcy69,,49,"I just had a long overdue catch up with Brad, and to check on how [Emily's family were doing since their tragedy](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p22cl/notes/). In some welcome news, they are now expecting a new child to join their family.

Brad had another story for me though; one that has kept me awake  the past couple of nights. I've captured it below to help get it off my mind.


-------------------------------------------

In a universe filled with choices, but with only one life in which to make them, regrets become inevitable. Regrets for things done or left undone, for words said or left unsaid.

At that moment when our life is fading, and we see it all over again... how would we feel about those decisions we've made?  Would we be proud of those moments that defined us? Those moments alone when we think no one else is watching? How we treated those we loved, and those close to us?


Brad was not the only child in his family. He also had a younger brother, Paul. They could not have been more opposites to each other.

Where Brad was brash and wild in his youth, Paul was introverted and contemplative. And like many siblings, their childhood was one of constant warfare with each other. 

Looking back, Brad admits that he was an arrogant, possessive and obnoxious brat. Any of those traits alone would already have given him an excuse to hate on his little brother.

But it was really the fear of the Burnt Man that really started it all. 

As an only child, Brad enjoyed the attention and adulation that brought him. That changed when his brother Paul was born three years later.

At first, Brad had loved the idea of a brother to play with. He imagined they would play together and be best friends. That idea disappeared when he discovered Paul was a useless baby that only cried, smelled bad and demanded constant attention. The second year wasn't much better, with Paul starting to get a larger share of Brad's toys and presents.

It became really bad in the third year when Brad had to give up half his room and share it with Paul. He found they had nothing in common.

Where Brad liked being loud and attention seeking with others, Paul just babbled and talked with himself. Brad loved being outside and active, Paul preferred to stay indoors and draw with his crayon set.

What unsettled Brad though was what Paul would draw. There would be the usual things every child draws - houses, animals, trees and family. What was unusual was every drawing of their family always had an extra person.

Their parents would be there, and Brad and Paul, all drawn in rainbow hues. Right next to Paul would be a mysterious figure drawn in black and red.

The family faces all had big smiles, but the stranger was a disfigured mess: two big black circles for eyes and a shapeless mass for the mouth. In every drawing of the stranger, he was missing an arm and had red streaks running through all over.

Over time, this stranger began to feature more and more prominently in the drawings. Brad and his parents would no longer appear in them - just Paul playing with the stranger inside the house, or outside in the yard.

At first their parents thought it was just a phase, but eventually became concerned enough to ask Paul who that was. He told them it was his friend ""the burned man"". He had always been there for as long as Paul could remember. He never said anything - he just stood there, watching and listening.

They concluded it was just an imaginary friend. Granted, it was a bit more unsettling than having a dinosaur or elf for a friend, but at least Paul wasn't drawing some real-life predator.

One night (when Brad was 8, and Paul was 5), they stayed awake after their parents had tucked them in. Brad wanted to know more about the Burnt Man.

Paul said that he had been in an accident, a fire that had burnt his entire body and face. It had melted his eyes away and made his arm go missing. He was very sad.

Paul didn't find the Burnt Man scary though. He had always been around, and never did anything. Just watched and listened.

Brad told him he was stupid for having an imaginary friend.

Paul yawned, and simply replied that he wasn't imaginary. He was in the room with them right now. In fact, he was standing right next to Brad, watching and listening, as he did every night.

Brad felt a chill go up his spine. He had always been a brave child, but for the first time in his life he felt fear. He looked around in the darkness, not sure if the shadows were his imagination or the Burnt Man waiting for him to go to sleep.

Brad didn't go to sleep that night, and concluded that he needed a room of his own.

He could no longer share a room with his annoying brother and his creepy friend. But he couldn't admit that he was afraid either, so his 8 year old mind came up with an idea.

His plan was simple - to make it so painful for their parents to keep them together they would be forced to keep them in separate rooms. So began their adversarial relationship.

They fought over everything for many years, and often physically. Each prank they played each other escalated into new rounds of retaliation, all to the chagrin of their parents. 

It would take six more years until they moved to a bigger house and they were able to have separate rooms at last before the feuds started to die down. the Burnt Man had been all but forgotten by this time, replaced with pure animosity for each other. 

But on the first night in their new home, Brad remembered waking in the middle of the night and seeing a figure sitting on his bed, watching him. It stared at him through hollow eye sockets, and moaned at him through an open jaw. It reached for him with a horribly burnt hand, the other hung uselessly by its side with the lower half missing.

Brad screamed so loud it woke the house, and the figure had disappeared by the time he blinked. When Paul came into the room to check what all the commotion was about, Brad told him he saw the Burnt Man.

Paul laughed, and said he hadn't seen him in years. In fact, he could hardly even remember him. In any case, he couldn't see him in the room now. Paul closed the door as he left, then reopened it quickly and shouting ""Boo!"", before laughing again and walking back to his room.

For Brad, the memory of it seemed very real though. It wasn't just the terror, but the overwhelming sense of sadness he felt from the encounter.

Another incident was when Paul was 17 and involved in a hit-and-run accident. He was rushed to hospital in a critical condition, and the doctors weren't sure if he would survive. Paul was lying in bed with a coma, with his parents crying around him.

Brad could could see a figure through the corner of his eye standing by the walls. It was the Burnt Man, watching Paul intently.

""Just go already! Why are you still here? You're not wanted. Just leave us!"" Brad remembered shouting at the figure. He got a severe reprimanding from his parents, thinking that he was shouting at his brother.

""Paul is dying, Brad! It's time to put your stupid feud behind. We're family for god's sake. Act like it!"" his father had rebuked while his mother cried.

The words stung Brad, especially since he couldn't explain that he wasn't shouting at Paul. He quietly fumed, then stormed out.

Paul did recover two days later though, and was out of the hospital a week later.

That last incident was 15 years ago. The Burnt Man was never seen again by either of them since. 

Brad had become a serious and buttoned down computer analyst since then. Paul married, had two children of his own, and had saved countless lives through his job as an EMT. They had developed a grudging respect for each other, though their lives had drifted off in different directions over the years.

The Burnt Man was just another long forgotten childhood memory, filed away and never thought of again until recently. Only a recent tragedy brought it all back into sharp focus.

A few months ago, Brad learnt that his brother had died while on duty. He was on scene with other emergency services dealing with a factory fire.

A chemical storage tank had unexpectedly exploded near his location, dousing him in burning chemicals. The flying shrapnel had sheared off his left arm at the elbow.

Paul was 32.

---------------------------

In a life of many regrets, Brad now has one more for the list. He never did let Paul know how proud he was of him, and that despite their differences, he loved him as a brother.

He regrets that his last words to Paul weren't goodbye, but a text message which read ""You suck. I've shat better excuses than that."" It was said in jest about why Paul didn't have time over the weekend for a beer, but it was devastating knowing it would be the last memory both had of each other.

So every now and then, Brad talks to the silence in the room hoping that his brother, the Burnt Man, is still around to hear. Now much older and wiser, he no longer fears the Burnt Man - but fears that the only one listening might just be himself.

One that can only observe in silence, powerless to stop whatever fate awaits him, judging him with regret for the decisions he's made, and is yet to make.

Scared6,13,,47,1rb0kr,,45,"Has anyone heard the of the creepy tale ""That's not your mother""? Well, my family has told me about it from time to time, and we made jokes and pranks out of it.


Here's a example, one day, my mother called me into the kitchen to fix something for her. As I was walking through the hallway, my dads hand pulled me into the closet and whispered ""That's not your mother"".


These pranks freaked my out and my little cousins too. One day, my cousins mother told me about this story. I will tell this like how she told me.


*So, I tucked my five year old son into bed, and he went to sleep. When It was time for him to go to school, I called him to get up and come to the living room, I was reading the newspaper while I came across this one article. ""Missing children"" It read. My son then ran to me screaming and crying saying ""A man pulled me into the closet telling me not to come to you!*



No one was in the house she told me. We don't pull those pranks no more.",That's not your mother.,92,nosleep
ohthankheaven,5,,16,1rbpkl,,46,"I don't have an exciting life. I wake up each morning at exactly 6:30AM, and by 7:15AM I'm starting the engine of my poorly kept up with vehicle and begin my venture to work. I'm late every single day by about fifteen minutes, to be precise. I don't care, they could fire me if they wanted, but I'm the kind of guy who comes to the office, keeps his mouth shut, and gets the job done. They also figure that the fifteen minutes of tardiness isn't so bad, compared to the hour and forty-five minutes of unpaid overtime they sentence me with every day. I would describe my job as dull, repetitive, and relentlessly boring, and correspondingly, so is my life. My house isn't particularly lavish. Living alone as a male really doesn't give your residence that home feeling. I'm not your average lonely, I lack companionship. I do not have a family, I do not have friends. Every day is the same. It's winter time and the days freeze together. 

My alarm goes off, I hit snooze. Again, the obnoxious ringtone I set on my phone crackles out of the tiny speaker, I hit snooze. After a third ring, I'm out of bed and on my way to work. It's freezing this morning and the heat in my car does not work. My weather-beaten jacket doesn't provide that much protection either. I scrape through the day, counting the minutes. 
The drive home from work offers my only source of human contact, and this lies in the sports talk radio station I listen to. Their snide remarks always make me laugh, and I sometimes call in to dispute some of the commentary they are making. It also feels good to have somebody to talk to, especially when you're as solitary as I am.

I don't choose to be this way. I am a single child and my parents died three years ago in a car accident. It was a tough loss, it put me in a downward spiral until I hit bottom, which just so happens to be where I still reside. I try to socialize and be friendly but it seems like I'm lost in the masses. Maybe I should be more interesting, or funny, or wear nicer clothes. I'm not good with these things. I started taking comfort in the internet. For me it felt safer, more secure from the harshness of the real world. Not that the internet isn't any less relentless, the only difference is I'm hiding behind a screen and a handle. I do not have a Facebook. I don't know if it's because I don't see the point of having one or I'm too scared to deal with the fact that I would lack companionship on there as well. I visit my favorite sports websites, browse Reddit, and enjoy YouTube. None of those things could ever satisfy my primal need for a physical partner in life, so eventually, I started using a dating website. A website that I don't feel the need to name. They are all the same anyway. It was slow at first. Slower than it took me to fill out my profile and eventually take a picture anyway. I didn't know what to write about myself, and even convincing myself to finally publicize my life in an attempt to get anyone to talk to was an effort in itself.  Months went by and I received no glimmer of hope. Suddenly, a chat prompt appeared on my laptop.
""Hello"", she said.

Her name is Julie, and she is beautiful. I don't know what she saw in me, but for the first time it is real, it is there. We spoke for years. Endless chat logs, phone calls, video chats. We shared tears, laughs, and something I never felt before, love. 

Two days ago I asked Julie to meet me for the first time, and she said yes. I was nervous at first, but extremely happy. I asked her if she wanted to have dinner, but she said she would rather just come to my house instead. Yesterday she came over, she really is a special girl. We hit it off so well that she decided to spend the night. She really is excited to have me now, I can hear her calling for me now. I have never felt so happy and so confident. There is one thing that is for certain, she will never leave me. Even if we fight, even if we argue, she still won't leave me. We are going to have a great time together, and we are going to play. Even if it turns out she doesn't like the games we play she still won't leave me. 

There is that chance though, that small chance that things won't work out. That chance that the love will fade and that abominable lonliness will come back. It scared me at first, because I can't go back to being alone again. I won't go back. I don't worry anymore though, because Julie loves me and the games we play, Julie loves to be with me, and Julie isn't strong enough to bend the bars of her basement cell.

DickBanditDoneLanded,11,,65,1r1zac,,42,"As a kid, I grew up singing songs of joy with my friends. Fun songs that made me feel like a child. There was one song that I never really liked, for reasons unbeknownst to me, but that one song would become a living hell during my adult life.

My wife packed my son's lunchbox with a pizza lunchables; It was always his favorite one. I had the privilege of walking him to school that cold October morning, holding his hand the whole walk. We talked about toys, games, and then the topic of songs came up.
""Hey, dad...how come you never showed me the song about Josh Jacob Jinglehyper Smith?"" he asked. ""Haha, you mean John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt? I never liked that song, kiddo,"" I replied. ""I thought his name was Josh, like mine!"" He added.

 We got to the school about half an hour earlier than the entry time, so I suggested we go to the playground located around back; Josh agreed and followed me. The air felt relatively dense that day, I could barely see fifty feet away and asked Josh to stay in sight and have a little fun before school starts. I look away at the birds in the trees and I'm startled by the piercing cry of my son, nowhere in sight. I call his name and he says ""Sorry, dad! I fell off the monkey bars, I'll be fine!"" I sighed and laughed a little knowing my kid was such a warrior. I notice Josh riding a swing and laughing with another little boy who also came to school too early. I see his father standing on the side, laughing and I worry about not being a good enough dad to Josh. I start to walk toward the boys and that's when it hits me; I wasn't watching Josh play, none of the two boys was mine. I tried to keep calm but felt the need to yell out his name to locate him. I look around the playground and the school bell rings, announcing the school's opening. The dense, foggy air dissipates and I'm able to see everything clearly. I find a note in the second floor of the jungle gym, it reads: ""I know how hard you tried to avoid me, I wouldn't want the same thing happening with Josh.""

My heart sank and my eyes widened as the note dropped on the mulch and made a thud. I felt every possible emotion at that one point in time. I didn't know what to do, where to go, who to ask for help, so I walked into the school, where I come across a corkboard with pictures of kids on it. All of these children were abducted by a strange man who walked into the forest beside the school. I knew what I had to do, I ran into the woods, clenching the note he had written. ""John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt!"" I hear a high pitched voice scream from the bushes, as I fall to the ground in fear.

 I noticed a building on a hill about a mile into the wild. It was a greenish wooden house, much like the ones mystery inc. would investigate, but this was not a game, this was my son's life and possibly that of many other children. The smell of rotting was emitting throughout the air, and I feared the worst for the status of the kids. Not willing to be detected, I snuck in through a window that was left open and creeped about the dark house with nothing but my signal-less cellphone and my dedication. I was in the basement floor and couldn't see anything, so I turned on my flashlight app. I had no idea I was about to come across one of the most horrible sights anyone could've seen.

 There were mutilated corpses, not just any corpses, but children, kids who I had met through class pictures my wife bought and showed me. The kids were decapitated, burned, sliced, naked. I was scared for my life, I almost threw up one too many times but swallowed it back along with my will to flee. I found a wooden staircase that was old and rotting. The first step I took on it made a loud creak and there was a groan in the distance. I hid behind a giant flowerpot as a huge figure approached the area I was in. I could barely breathe as I noticed this man had blood between his fingernails, as if he mutilated the children with nothing but his fingers. He returned to the room and I followed him from afar. The smell I picked up earlier was much stronger than before and I heard muffled cries coming from the room the man walked into. 
""Say it with me, now, kids!
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt! 
His name is my name too! 
Whenever we go out! 
The people always shout! 
There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schm-"" A kid bit a hole through the duct tape on his mouth and was able to scream while he sang. I heard the kid's name; It was Gary.

The children were all able to remove their mouth bindings and cried in unison for about ten seconds. Then I hear a loud laugh, followed by a ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" At this point, I was enraged. Nobody has the right to scream at kids like that, nobody. I barged in, grabbing this freak by his back-length hair and slamming his face into a table with limbs on it. ""What did you just say to those kids, you motherfucker?!"" I yelled, oblivious to the children in the room. ""You're gonna pay for all your shit, you son of a bitch!"" I said ""Well that's just too damn bad!"" He added ""I didn't know today was the day I'd be found! It's such a shame you've missed your playdate with your son...he was SUCH a nice boy!"" He said, laughing his head off at the sight of my expression. I was cold, I was numb. My son was dead.

 I unleashed my fury on the man, not holding back at all. I knocked him unconscious and tied him down to a giant piece of metal. I broke both his legs and made sure he'd never walk again, then I released the children, many starving and ready to go home. I tugged the slab down the hill and walked alongside the children toward the school. The police had previously raided the woods, but never came across the house in the entire year he had been performing the kidnappings. I called the school and notified the authorities of the serial killer I had slayed and I wanted to make sure he was arrested and would suffer his whole life for what he did to my wife and I. She was hysterical, unable to perform for almost a whole year. We cancelled any holidays and vacations and mourned a year away. We finally concluded that our son was happy in a better place with the rest of his friends. Although my wife and I never had any other children, I became teacher at an elementary school in another state and was happy knowing I had kids who were fun to be around and nice to me. 

One Monday morning, we have a new girl come in and I ask her to introduce herself. She's laughing and she's shy and she wants to whisper something in my ear. ""I'll introduce myself if we can just play today."" She says I promise her, along with the class, that we'll have a free day and she introduces herself and makes friends. I start to like this girl because I never had a chance to have a daughter and always wanted one. She was very sociable and was the class clown.

She stopped coming to school for a week, and out of curiosity, I called her parents to ask about her sudden disappearance. Her mother was crying and I couldn't understand her, so her father came to the phone. I told him about how the class missed her and he told me about a note that was left at their door one afternoon. It read: ""Go through her drawings"" I asked the dad to give me a minute while I did just that. *HE* was in the pictures. Every drawing she made had *him* hiding in the background. There was a folded piece of paper that was thicker than the rest. Little did I know, it wasn't school paper, it was skin; Pressed and cut to replicate a note. ""I thought, by now, you'd figure out I was never human"" I got on the phone to tell the girl's father the news, but all I heard was a demonic, maniacal laughter. I felt a hole in my chest, as the phone line went dead, followed by three beeps and elongated static.","His name is my name, too.",107,nosleep
Brodiche,28,,13,1ra24j,,41,"The Eighth Crusade

On the outskirts of the large city known as Canto; a small cathedral stands unscathed by the horror happening not twenty miles away. There were some smaller towns outside of the city, but most of their residents fled as soon as the vague news reports of “cannibalistic” citizens came flooding in. In the end, those who were smart enough to run at the first sign of trouble were the only ones who made it, the hesitant died along with the rest of the city. 
However, this small cathedral was different. It was located in the middle of nowhere and had been long abandoned and forgotten by everyone, aside from the city itself the closest town to it was almost an hour way and a small dirt road was the only thing that even hinted that there was another world past the miles and miles of flat plains. The glow and black smoke from Canto can be seen in the distance.  
Short flashes of lightning filled the air, just long enough to illuminate a figure on top of the cathedral, his legs swung over the edge of the roof and head leaning against the lighting rod. The faint glow of a cigar intensified as he put it to his mouth. With a small grin played on his lips, he gazed dreamily at the city.
“What a sight. Obliteration has never looked so divine.” He whispered to himself. Images of a crumbling Jerusalem played through his head, “Well, I guess you can’t get much more divine than that.”
Feeling a little foolish for talking to himself again he took one last drag of his cigar and flicked it behind him. The man noticed that there was a thin layer of ash that had settled on to his body. Slightly irritated by this, the man glanced at his watch while getting to his feet, ruffling his short black hair in an attempt to get as much ash off his head as possible. His long black coat blew in the wind as he brushed it off. 
The temperature was dropping fast, it wouldn’t be long until the rain began to pour. The man wondered if it would be enough to quench the flames of the city. The Vatican ordered complete destruction; they wanted nothing standing of what they thought to be a “heathen city”. The man wouldn’t feel accomplished if the flames were so easily disposed of. Glancing at his watch again figuring he had roughly another half hour before the he was picked up and debriefed. He leaned back against the lightning rod, and lit another cigar, daydreaming of the day before.
****************************************

One bite, one citizen, and his work was done. His mission was to just get the ball rolling, nothing more. Being as potent as he was, his victims often became immensely strong. They were puppets, sure; but also unstable. The more of them that were roaming the streets the more dangerous the mop up was for the church. The man was frustrated that he only got one snack, he was tired of the left over’s from corpses and the donations from Italian blood banks. He was craving prey with more… life to it, one he could enjoy stalking before the kill.
The Vatican dispatched him and a helicopter to the abandoned cathedral. Along with being the drop point, the house of God was also were he was supposed to rendezvous with the evac crew. His orders were to simply enter the city, light the spark, and watch “God cleanse the Earth” from the cathedral. 
“You zealots are no fun!” he would tell them “I’m doing “God’s work” for you lazy ass holes, the least you could do is let me off the leash!”
The hungry man could not help but feel disappointed when they were offended. They preached how the last crusade was such a failure due to the fact he had so much “freedom”, the mobs of the powerful undead nearly completely consumed the Holy army.
It pissed him off that they never got over that.
He resolved that it was never really his fault, humans were frail, weak creatures. They are easy to corrupt in every way. None of them could handle the thirst, and they tore everything apart. Turning their victims into, for lack of a better word, zombies. 
The Pope himself preformed the unnecessary but “ritualistic” blessing before he set off.
“Vai quarto Locke e fornire i nostri nemici a Dio.”
“Deliver them I shall.” He sarcastically whispered to himself with a smirk. The helicopter was taking off; it was time to go to work.
Locke could not stop thinking about his one victim, regardless of whom it was he planned to savor every last second of his feast.
****************************************

The man found himself seeking a challenge. In the back of his mind he knew he wouldn’t get one, but the fantasy of a dangerous prey kept his thoughts occupied as he made his way towards the glistening city. 
With the pace he was traveling at it wouldn’t be long before reached the edge of Canto, his long strides covered more distance, faster than a high-end sports car going ninety on an open freeway. The cool night air was refreshing to him, it’s not often he is allowed to roam out in the open like this. He slowed down a bit to prolong this finite feeling of freedom.
Being cooped up under Vatican City for so long had begun to take its toll on Locke’s sanity. Other than living off nothing but the scraps of Roma, he had no real connection to the outside world. It’s not like he longed to live amongst the humans, no, the thought of that made him sick. The only reason he could stand the “Men of God” back at the Vatican was because they were as far away from human as possible. He’s seen them put on human masks, sure, seen them absolve the masses with a crooked smile, seen them preach peace and the word of God to a thousand ignorant faces. No, no, behind their masks, they are every bit a monster as Locke.
The city was drawing closer, massive sky scrapers were lit up in a brilliant fashion. A sense of intrigue radiated from surrounding, smaller clusters of lights. What were the humans doing at this hour? Were they working overtime, tucking the children in, late night binge drinking at the local bar? They were all so very ignorant of the malevolent fury of God that was about to rain down upon them. Sure, it looked pretty from a distance, but Canto was the antithesis when viewed up close. The Vatican made it clear to Locke that this was not a city that deserves pity, even though he never considered giving it anyways, he asked to be briefed on the city’s situation.
Canto was dying, almost all who’ve entered abandoned all hope for it when they saw what a hell hole it has become. Corruption plagued the city’s central government, all of the representatives’ power focused on how to make the wealthy more capable of shitting on the poor. As a result, crime was abundant. Drug trafficking, prostitution, child labor plagued the down town streets. Whole families were often caught in cases of “indentured servitude” as the wealthy put it, where even the children would have to be at the beckon call of the privileged, doing strenuous and dangerous work that led to more than a few deceased children. Anyone who cried foul ended up dead too, it was just the way it went. 
And it was reason enough to cleanse it.
Locke reached the edge of Canto, he could now hear the grumbling sounds of the suffering city, a siren blared unceasingly somewhere among the throngs of buildings. Looking at his watch the man whispered to himself.
“Time to light the match.”
****************************************

Upon entering the city, Locke found to his disappointment, that there was no shortage of easy prey. The homeless aimlessly wandered the streets, practically half dead already, prostitutes looking vulnerable as ever. He was slightly surprised, however, to find a couple of security guards having a smoke outside of a large ominously lit building. A young woman dressed in rags, stumbled past them, she was appeared very exhausted and in need of medical care. The guards just looked upon her and laughed, asking the woman unrepeatable questions. When she didn’t respond to their cat calls one of the men grew frustrated and ran after her. She let out a quick yelp of pain as he put his cigarette out on the back of her neck.
In a very swift motion the girl whirled around, grabbing the guard’s wrist and pulling him close. The man’s face was within an inch of hers, his expression showed that of pure pain. She had broken his wrist. In a split second she revealed a small revolver, put it to the man’s chin, and pulled the trigger.
There was a bright flash, then a spray of crimson red. The man’s body crumpled to the newly painted sidewalk, with a softball sized hole where his skull used to be. The woman was already on the other guard before he was done unhooking the strap to his sidearm. Landing knees first on the guard’s chest she pinned him to the ground. Grabbing a firm hold of her prey’s head, with both hands she lifted up his skull and brought it back down to the concrete. Over and over again she did this, until the guard was pulverized into the sidewalk.
It was all over that quickly. She stood up without a sound, her face expressionless except for a small smirk that crept on the edge of her lips, she bent over to pick up her revolver that lie next to body of the first guard. She shot Locke a quick glance and disappeared around the corner. While the look she gave him was quick, it was more than enough to excite him. She had piercing brown eyes that screamed strength, and short, dirty, black hair that was almost just long enough to veil her left eye. Locke knew her just by that single, short glance. He knew her struggles, knew her strength, and knew her will to survive.
He knew he had found his prey.
The building the two guards were once protecting let out the piercing wale of an emergency siren, snapping Locke out of his mystified state. It was then he noticed the streets were completely empty, not a piece of human filth to be seen. Whoever the guards were protecting called for backup and he had mere minutes to escape. A thought crossed his mind, and made him almost consider revealing himself to the approaching authorities before pounding them into dust. Not wanting to risk compromising the mission, Locke reluctantly retreated into a dark alley way. He scaled his way to the roof tops from there and began the hunt for his new found prey. 
****************************************
The mystery woman’s scent was still live and growing stronger as he strides across the apartment building rooftops. Locke’s mind wandered back to the two guards, how efficiently and violently she dispatched them. Two full grown, armed men could not handle the slender girl half their size. Where can a human learn to kill like that? Without mercy or emotion, just pure unadulterated instinct. After searching for a short time he came across her entering a dimly lit liquor store, only to return moments later with a bag clenched in her fist. 
The hunger was starting to get to him, it was a ravenous gnawing that made his whole body tremble with anticipation. He knelt down on one knee and gazed down at her from the roof tops. Across the street from where Locke sat perched he saw her lean against a brick wall, and begin chugging whatever was in the paper bag. Locke felt his heart sink, he had to stop her quickly or that alcohol will kill all the fun. What was the fun in feeding from intoxicated prey? He let out a small sigh and leapt off the building, and descended to the street below. 
The woman let out a small yelp as Locke landed safely in front of her. A small cloud of dust and filth from the city escaped from under his feet, leaving a small clear circle around where he landed.
For a moment she just stared at him as he rose to his feet. Only a dim street light illuminated the empty street, the only thing she could make of the man was a pair of piercing red eyes that glowed like the moon.
“There is something magnificent about the moment you make yourself known to your prey,” spoke the man. His voice had a crisp, raspy tone to it, full of anticipation and a hint of sensuality.
The woman’s eyes widened at this, not out of fear however; it was more like she just received a jolt of electricity, the grip on her bottle tightened. She put on a smirk and spoke with an authoritative tone. 
 “Listen, I’ve had a long day. I already have had to deal with two assholes today,” she lifted her hands almost defensively, to reveal that they were caked with dried blood. 
“I caved both their heads in before they learned their place, maybe I should take my time with you so I can really make a statement around here.”
The man cocked his head a bit to the side at this threat, amused and intrigued by her intensity. He opened his arms wide as if to bow and took a step forward. The woman reacted quickly and swung the bag at Locke’s head. The sharp crash of the class mixed with the sound of cracking bone traveled all the way down the street. 
The woman expected the perfect stranger to be on the ground bleeding, begging for his life like she has seen so many other “men” do. 
However, the man was still standing. Aside from a small shard of glass that was lodged in the left side of his face, he was completely unfazed by the vicious attack. Locke licked his lips as the remaining alcohol from the bottle trickled down his face.
“Hmm, I’m not much of a whisky man. I prefer a more... ,” he paused for a moment as he watched the panic in his prey begin to rise “… exotic spirit.” 
He began to chuckle to himself, in all reality the whole situation was darkly humorous to him. This is the most pain he’s been in in years, and that is saying something. His chuckle escalated to a howling laughter.
The woman wore a look that held a combination of shock and excitement. Even though she was beginning to panic, a smile spread across her face. Not once in her entire time in Canto has she met a man who could last more than 2 minutes in fight with her, much less one who could so easily brush off a whisky bottle to the head.
She watched as the man’s laughter grew, his bloodshot eyes screamed madness.
“It’s time to put you down you crazy son-of-a-bitch,” she said with a smile. 
She slowly removed the revolver she used to kill the security guard, the aged blood glistened in what little light was available. The sight of the gun just seemed to incite a stronger laughing fit out of Locke. The woman extended her arm and placed the barrel of the gun into the man’s open mouth, and pulled the trigger.
Again, there was a quick flash. His head snapped back with full force, but he remained on his feet, never ceasing his laughter that grew into the howling of a demon. He lowered his head, fixing his blood red eyes on the woman.
He was able to stop his laughter long enough to respond to the horrified look on his prey’s face. 
“What’s the matter baby doll? You seemed surprised you can’t dispatch me as easily as those two security guards,” Locke began to laugh again “Honey, they are nothing compared to a true monster.”     
Locke took one last look at his victim, then opened his jaws to reveal several sharp teeth. The hole left by the bullet can be clearly seen as he made the final move on his prey.                           
****************************************
The man wiped his mouth and looked down at his meal. The woman’s eyes were glossed with fear, but there was an eerie smile that still crept on her lips as she stared blankly into the night sky. 
Locke allowed the woman’s essence to dissolve and flow throughout his body. Fresh blood from a living victim holds a piece of that person’s life and personality. Anyone who takes that essence inherits a part of that person’s life. All their thoughts, feelings, information becomes a part of the predator’s body and soul. 
“Veronica,” He whispered
The woman’s body began to violently shake. She was beginning to reanimate. 
Locke felt a slight pang of worry in the back of his mind. A human of her caliber would be a serious threat as a vampire, everything about her will be augmented and enhanced. 
Locke looked back at the shaking body. 
“Give those zealots hell for me, Veronica.”
Turning around he began to make his way to the edge of the city, the sun was going to be rising soon it was in his best interest to get back to the Cathedral as fast as he can. 
He had lit the match 
“Canto will be devoured by flames by tomorrow night.” Locke finally said with a smile.
                               ****************************************
 The enveloping darkness cascaded across the night sky. Leaving the silhouettes of clouds drift overhead, like veils of moving sentinels, suffocating the very light out of the stars. The scent of moisture and smoke hung thick in the air. The sound of distant thunder boomed across the sky, echoing into the midnight horizon. A light from below slightly illuminated the world, trails of thick black smoke were dressed in the light painted on by miles of inferno. It was as if the gates of hell opened under the earth, releasing and delivering throngs of angel’s utmost nightmares unto God’s domain. The pounding hearts of a million terrified saints could be heard as the sky boomed again. 
Below the heavens, true evil incarnate devoured the world. Sky scrapers wore flames from head to toe, fire danced on the water under decimated bridges, streets were in chaos, destroyed vehicles littered the crowed avenues. Exposed hands and limbs peek out from under of overturned cars, burning corpses are contorted in horrible positions behind the wheel of their tombs. Police stations show no sign of life, a constant siren blares somewhere in the city, with nothing living left to answer. The city, its souls, everything was devoured by chaos.
Well, almost everything.

TheeMikeG,20,,10,1rdk7o,,42,"Hey, all, I’ll try and make this quick because I don’t know how much time I have. My name is Cliff and I live in a nice two-story house in a suburb in California. I have a loving wife and an amazing little princess of a daughter. Today I woke up and went downstairs to see her watching Sunday morning cartoons on our small, discolored TV. She turned up at me and smiled, jumping to wrap her arms around my leg. 

“Daddy! Mom wanted me to tell you that she left a note for you on the counter.”

I rubbed my fingers through her bleach blonde hair before turning to retrieve the note.

Morning honey, it read, have fun today on your father-daughter day! She is really looking forward to spending quality time with you. Maybe take her to that new movie she won’t stop talking about? 	

I set down the note and crept up behind my daughter who had returned her attention the the TV. I sprung, tickling her as she laughed and laughed. Stopping, I gave her a kiss on the back of her head and smiled. 

“So what do you want to do today?” 

She shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t know, can we get icecream?” Her eyes lit up with excitement and she nodded enthusiastically. 

I chuckled, “Yeah, that sounds great. Do you wanna see that movie too?” 

She clapped her hands and giggled cutely. “Yes!” she shouted.

I smiled and pocketed the car keys I had left on the counter the day before. “Ok, go get ready, I’ll be down here waiting.” 

“Ok daddy!” she smiled before bounding up the stairs. “I love you!”

“I love you too!” I shouted after her. I walked towards the TV and shut it off. Yawning, I walked through the eerily quiet house to the fridge. The silence was almost unsettling. I glanced around, looking out the windows for nothing in particular. 

“Almost ready!” yelled my daughter from her bedroom upstairs. 

I shook my head with amusement. I could remember the first time I saw her in the hospital. I promised I would care for her like no one else. So far I had kept my promise, and we’ve been inseparable since. Guilt struck me as I recalled how much I’d been working lately and hadn’t been home to spend time with her. My wife had been telling me late at night when I’d finally come home how our daughter would spend most of the day crying in her room asking for her daddy. Today I was going to make it all up to her. Right after I grabbed a snack. 

I smiled to myself and opened the fridge. The decapitated body of my wife tumbled out and knocked me to the floor, covering me in blood.

I screamed and scrambled backwards until I slammed into the cabinets under the sink. My daughter came skipping into the kitchen holding a knife in one hand and my wife’s head in the other. Her face was distorted as if she was screaming when the blade fell. “I’m almost ready!” she giggled before smiling real wide. “There’s just one more thing I need. Then we can spend the whole day together.”

I got to my feet but took a nasty cut to the leg. I managed to get past her and upstairs, and into my bedroom behind a locked door before she reached it. I can hear her slowly dragging the tip of the knife against the door. She keeps saying “Daddy, please come to the door, I miss you!” She might even be crying, she sounds so sad. I already called the police, I just wanted to leave a tangible record of what’s happening. But I’m sure I could handle this on my own right? I mean she’s a little girl! I might just go to the door now. What do you think?

youngsterjose42,3,,10,1rd8lb,,37,"My mother once told me a story, her sister had an encounter with the paranormal that eventually lead to her suicide... this is that story.

My mother had a sister once, I remember my earliest memories of her, she was always so depressed and I always asked why was she sad. She never had an answer. My mother told me it all started one night when she came home from work. She was walking the streets around midnight heading home when she noticed a man walking behind her. It wasn't the first time she had been followed by this man, Only difference was... this time he tried to talk to my aunt. He asked ""are you happy with your family? aren't you tired of living in a house of religious fools?"". She was scared and asked ""who are you?"" and my mother told me as soon as he stepped out of the shadows my aunt saw his face he looked rather normal except for his long hair and ember red eyes. He smiled and said ""your people call me the devil"" and she started to run. She ran as fast as she could. Eventually my aunt got the house of my mother and she explained what happened. My mother tried to calm her down, my aunt was breathing heavily and could not control herself. Soon enough she passed out.

A few days pass by and my mother sees that my aunt has a serious problem. She didn't go to work for about a week and she felt as if she was not safe at my mothers house. So she moved back to my grandmothers house. They were extremely religious and for some reason my aunt felt safe at her house. The same night she moved back in to her mothers house something happened that drove her into being institutionalized. It was around 1 in the morning and my grandfather and grandmother were fighting. My aunt knew she was awake because she could see her mother. she was in the kitchen and she was looking through the crack in the door. she suddenly felt something brush up against her arm. Her breath taken away, her eyes wide open, she turns around and sees the man claiming to be ""the devil"". He says ""tell me whats wrong. I know, I know something's wrong let me take you away from all your troubles"" she screamed as loud as she could until her mother and father came into the room, they turned on the lights and she kept staring at the empty space next to her bed. My grandmother started yelling at her ""are you crazy?! do you have any idea how late it is?! why are you screaming?!"" she kept going and going until my aunt finally screamed ""the devil, he's after me mom!"" my grandmother was religious, still is, but for some reason she did not believe my aunt and they put her away in a hospital for about a month or two.

While in the hospital my aunt told my mother what she saw in there. They had to put her on several medications before she stopped seeing the man. Every now and then she would try to fall asleep in the hospital while the man watched she said she heard him bragging ""you know they'll never believe you"" or ""you know they cant see me"". When the lights went out she closed her eyes. She could hear his threats, she could hear him mocking her life. She always kept her eyes closed she did not want to see his silhouette even less his ember red eyes. She described him as a physical being yet at the same time he did not exist. At some points she thought she was arguing with herself until she realized the voice was overlapping her voice, her thoughts. She had nightmares almost every night in that hospital. Around 2 month goes by in there and she pretends to be fine they let her out a week or so later. 

My mom did not hear of her for about 3 months after she got out of the hospital. My mother was worried and she sent out search parties she called cops. Yet she never found her. Turns out she was hiding in the woods. She didn't want see anyone, my aunt told my mother that she never gave in. I don't know the way my mom told me I can only assume she was lying. She told me how she lived in the woods for a few months living off whatever she could find. She explained to my mother how he never left her side, he was always there talking to her, he did not want to let her go. My mother told me that the last thing my aunt told to her was something this man, ""the devil"" said to my aunt "" i want you"" she ended up killing herself a week after. She was weak and brittle and was basically a walking corpse. A few members of the family came to her funeral, not many though that's what my mother told me. My grandmother did not go. She was embarrassed of her daughter and the fact that she killed herself.

A few months later after the funeral my mother gets off work around 8pm its still light out so she thinks ""why not visit my sister she needs it"" so she walks to the cemetery. It was almost sunset and my mother told me she sees a man placing flowers on her gravestone. My mother has never seen this man before and she starts running towards him as he walks away she starts running faster. He disappears into the woods and just before he did he looked back and my mother saw his ember red eyes.

We often spent the night at each other's houses, but when we spent the night over at his house I would always try to get him to agree for us to sleep out in his huge treehouse, we would stay up till dawn eating candy, chips, and playing playstation until our eyeballs hurt. I always asked him if we could sleep outside because the first and only time we ever slept in his house, I saw this ghost. The ghost himself was a tall man wearing a black coat with a big black hat that sort of looked that that cool hat that Hugh Jackman wears in Van Helsing, and he didn't have a solid or not solid form, I know that sounds weird, but it was like he was there, but wasn't at the same time. I guess the best way I could describe it would be like really thick black static in the shape of a really tall dude wearing a cloak and hat. Well my best friend's little sister would always talk about this guy in the hat, I think the exact way that she referred to him was ""The guy in the hat"", but we were to busy doing our own thing to ever listen to her, to us she was just my friend's annoying little sister that wanted to follow us around and do what we were doing. Well that night while we were playing video games, I glanced down his hallway and at the very end of it there was the man in the hat, but I had only glanced, and when I did a double take, he was gone, so I just ignored it. That sort of glance and disappear thing happened like 2 more times before we went to bed. Now what happened next is what made me never want to spend the night in his house again. We fell asleep just fine, no nightmares, no spooky visions before closing our eyes, but around 3am, no, not exactly 3am, I was young and scared and didn't look at the time, so I'm just guessing it was around 3am, every single radio in his house turned on at the same time and at full volume, and it wasn't music or even just static that played, it was this really deep and low pitch rumble that came out at full blast. It didn't say anything, I don't even know if it was a voice or anything, all I remember is that it scared the living shit out of me. His mom got up and shut off all the radios and yelled at us cause she thought we did it as a joke or something, and wouldn't listen to us when we said were where both sleeping when it happend. My family moved away about 6 months or so after this and I haven't heard from my friend since, I don't know anything about the house or the land or if there was a murder there or whatever, it's just something that happened to me as a kid and something I'll never forget.",I was about 13 when this happend at a friends house.,59,nosleep
childrenofsamhain,9,,6,1rhdoj,,34,"My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Until recently, he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters, Sarah and Emily. Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three. Within the first two years living in the house, Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't until his daughter Sarah was around two years old, that he started to notice she talked to herself. Jamie thought nothing of it, she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself. 

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""Is she your imaginary friend?""

""I guess."" 

Amused, he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall, whispering quietly. ""What's your friends name?"" he asked her. 

""Her name is Helen Mary"", she said. 

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

blkmagick,8,,6,1r8old,,32,"My father was in the military, which meant that we moved around a lot as I was growing up. One of the places we moved to was Pensacola, FL. We moved there right before 8th grade started for me, and we lived in military housing so we got to live in a two story house for the very first time. I was excited; I got my own room and my own bathroom right across the hallway. 

Things were great, until after a year of living in the house when things started to get strange. I was home alone talking to my boyfriend on the phone when I heard a large crash in the kitchen. I slowly walk in to see what happened, and one of the cabinet doors were wide open and bowls were all over the floor. I quickly pick up the bowls and put them away, freaking out. I was in there just five minutes earlier and everything was closed; there was no way for the cabinet to open on its own. I ran up to my room and locked my door until my family came home. When they returned, they asked why bowls were all over the floor in the kitchen. 

A week after that incident, I woke up suddenly out of a deep sleep, gasping for breath. I looked at my doorway and I see a girl standing there. She was wearing an old white nightgown stained with blood, and she had long black hair. Her throat was slit and hastily stitched up, along with her lips being stitched together. Her eyes were gouged and missing, and her hands were chopped off. 

Thinking it was just my imagination, I closed my eyes and reopened them, only to see she had moved closer. With each blink, the closer she would get, so I threw the covers over my head and prayed that she didn't touch me. I ended up falling asleep and awoke in the morning with her nowhere to be found. 

Over the next year, she would appear every other week, just watching me. I got used to it eventually, because I thought it was just a chronic bad dream and she didn't do anything to hurt me. It wasn't until after we moved to back to Michigan did I get really scared. My sister and I were talking and sharing stories about our house in Florida, and she told me something troubling. She mentioned that if she had to use the restroom in the middle of the night, she would always use my parent's bathroom in their room instead of the one across my bedroom. I asked her why, and her response was:

""Because I would always see a girl in white standing outside of your door and it scared me.""

Knowing that I wasn't the only one that saw her terrified me, because I knew it wasn't just a dream. I still wonder if she appears for the new family that's in the house and who she is and what happened to her. I have to say though, I'm just glad to be out of that house.

I’ve never had suicidal thoughts myself, I’ve been depressed but that’s just life, you can’t be happy all the time. 

**Most** people don’t think of the repercussions that can happen when they have suicidal thoughts as they just think that no one cares about them so they assume that they don’t have a reason to live and just want to end their lives.

My dad had a great friend (no names) once who was amazing, he had a job that he enjoyed a lot which was him being a train driver.

My dads friend was driving a train to Glasgow when out of nowhere, a person jumped onto the tracks and died instantly. When this happened, my dads friends life just stopped, I can’t really explain it myself as I wasn’t the driver, he was. 

But can you just imagine driving a train, not seeing/seeing a young person jump in front of a train whilst not being able to stop the train from hitting that person? With their blood splattering the window and tracks. I mean the average speed limit of being hit by a car going 30 miles per hour can kill you, just imagine being hit by a train going like 5 times faster than that.

After that happened, my dads friend was just at a loss, he felt like it was his fault as he was the driver.

I invited my sister, Nicole, over. We poured a couple glasses of wine and got out photo albums, scrapbooks, whatever we could find. It was nice having a change instead of my boring routine, but I'd definitely pick that over what happened next. 

After a couple drinks, a few laughs, and tons of pictures, we started to notice something. There was a man in every picture I was in. Just standing there, in the distance, smiling. At first I thought it was just a coincidence, but the more I looked, the more I recognized his face. I've seen this man before. He looked like a normal man, roughly 6 feet, brown hair, bright green eyes. The one thing that was off is that he was always smiling. I didn't think too much of it, it was getting late. Nicole went home by then so I decided to head off to bed. 


I usually never have nightmares, a few in a year at most. Tonight was different. I don't know if you'd call it a nightmare, but it was enough to scare the shit out of me. I was in a dark room, with nothing but a chair and a window. The window didn't open. I could see that man. He was behind a tree and just looking at me, mouthing some words I couldn't make out. Soon after, he started walking towards me slowly. He walked right through the window, he was just about to walk up to me when I woke up in a sweat. I wasn't sure what this meant, or why I was so terrified by it but I shook it off and went back to sleep.

The next day was rather normal. I was out running errands, as usual. It was when I was in Best Buy that I saw that damn guy again. Just smiling at me, staring at me with those bright green eyes. I decided to go up to him. 


""Excuse me, sir. May I help you?""


Nothing.


""Sir?""


Again, nothing. 

After what seemed like forever, just as I was about to walk away he said something. 


""I've been waiting for this.""


""Um, waiting for what?""


""This, you."" 


I got really uncomfortable, and felt it was best to walk away. On my way out the door I heard him say quietly ""Have a nice day, Jennifer."" Okay, how the hell did this freak know my name. I just wanted to go home and sleep. I left the store and continued on my way home. 

As I walked up to my door I found a photograph. It was of me, getting into my car at Best Buy. I was hoping this was just some prank because I didn't want to think of the alternatives. I looked on the back and one sentence has never scared me so much


""I've waited too long."" 


I had no idea what the hell this meant but I was getting sick of it. I didn't know what to do so I decided it would be best to just go to bed and get some much needed sleep. As I laid down and got comfortable, I heard a scratch by the window. 


I looked over, and all I saw a was a bright pair of green eyes. ",Photographs.,33,nosleep
sgtatarms123,1,,13,1r20rb,,30,"I have been getting singular phantom door bell rings at my house, that only i am able to hear, my mum and dad don't hear anything.

The first instance was about 5 months ago, i heard a singular door bell ring at 7am, it woke me up, and i didn't think much of it. Later that day i asked my mother if she heard anything and she said no you're dreaming.

Now im not a crazy person, i am probably the most sane person you would ever meet, in addition i don't do drugs, or drink

So i don't think much about it, thinking my parents their old im young, young people have better hearing than old people.

But this keeps happening around the same time 7am, and im thinking who the heck is this, is this some joke is this the delivery man?

No it wouldn't be a delivery this early ever

Whenever im home alone i have the habbit of whenever the door bell rings i don't answer it, so it was about 4pm one day and a singular door bell ring happens, i tip toe and peek out the front window, i wasn't very fast so i saw nothing, and it never rung again.

A month later, its about 6pm, singular door bell ring, im there in 20seconds, nothing, front gate not moving, again me alone in the house.

Am i imagining all this? there is no way i am not crazy

Coincidence or not, a few days later my mum is in the house, the door rings, my mum answers, its my elderly neighbour.

So i think to myself so it was her all along, all those times i never answered the door it was her, even the times at 7am, shes old ok old people wake up early... ok case closed right.

Today

4:53am singular door bell ring, wakes me up from my sleep, i am not freaking crazy, you know how a door bell sounds, its long it lasts about 3 seconds, i am awake and i can hear the second half of the ring all around my house

I go back to sleep because i was tired, then it rings again at 7am... i tell my mum when i wake up says she didn't hear anything

Heres the good part my dad thinks im crazy too so bought some cctv security cameras and has installed one at our front porch

Today I rewinded the tape to 6:45am, 

I see two lumps laying vertically on our front porch, it is two people in sleeping bags

Skip forward to 6:55am

They get up, I see two men one wears a long brown coat and a black hat, he is big and fat but i couldn't see his face, the other guy is thin and small, he was wearing grey sweat pants and a grey sweater...

Him i saw, his face was skinny and pale almost half skeleton he has yellow rotten teeth

7:00am

I see him ringing our door bell then go back to sleep in his sleeping bag same with big fat guy, they zip themselves up before you could see their heads but here they zip themselves all the way up, and inch away like caterpillars, out of camera view (this took 3mins)

WTF - was this their sick way of saying thankyou for your hospitality 

(I rewinded the tape further they came at 3:09am and started sleeping on our front porch)

I think the ring at 4:53am meant the time they showed, i might have been in deep sleep the other times idk. I also think they hop our fence, I told my dad to put a camera there too, called cops shown them this, there's a patrol car outside our house right now.

WILLingtonegotiate,11,,5,1rdxhm,,29,"Well to start things off I have a hard time convincing myself that any of this is supernatural. Just extremely weird, somewhat scary. It may be due to the fact I worry about my families safety, more than anything. Well, I will start from the beginning.

We moved into our new home around the end of August. We resettled here in San Antonio due to my wifes employer requiring her to live here.  I say ""new"" home because it is just that, a NEW home. The neighborhood is new as well. All the homes are brand new the oldest being around a year old. We love the area. Awesome neighbors, rural setting, though stores still within walking distance. 

We know absolutely nobody in this town, so we have pretty much stuck to ourselves in the short time here so far. We live in a 4 bedroom house, with our three children's rooms upstairs and my wife and myself sleeping in the master bedroom downstairs. Our room is literally 10 feet from the front door. I say this because my story revolves quite a lot around that very front door.  

Around our third night in the new home is when it started. DING......DONGGGGGG!!!! The second part of the doorbell sound was separated by about 2 seconds. I don't know why I find that eerie.   DING......DONGGGGGG. 
DINGDONG DINGDONG DINGDONG
These three were quite rapid taps on the doorbell.

I must have woke on the first ring but did not quite have my mind working yet, much less my body. I open my eyes and hear the long drawn out sound of the doorbell being pressed firmly. Then three rapid taps. My room is completely dark, only lit by the blue lights of the alarm clock. This same clock showed me at this moment it was 2:30 am. 

""Wtf"", I thought. I immediately started fidgeting in my drawer for my handgun, it's a Glock 23 with an extremely bright light attached just under the barrel. It would be quite handy in a few minutes.  I grab a magazine, slide it in and chamber a round. With a flick of the switch the super bright beam illuminates my room and my clear path to the front door.

As I sleepily stumble my way to the front door I hear another rapid ring of the doorbell followed by a deep, loud, booming knock.  I check through the peephole and can make out the top of a mans head, as if he were leaning on the door, listening for any type of movement coming from within my house. I place my weapon on the door around where I figure this persons head to be and I speak.

""Who is it?!!"" I shouted

My question was greeted by only what I can describe as the loudest silence I had ever felt wash over me.

Again I shout, ""Who is it?!!"".
And I hear him for the first time.
""It's me, Daniel"", replied the dry, calm yet exhausted voice of the man outside my door. 
""I do not know a Daniel!"" I replied sternly. ""What do you want?"" I asked.
""I've been left here, I do not know where I am and I just need a place to sleep."" Replied the oddly calm voice just inches away from the barrel of my gun.
""You have 3 seconds to leave my property or I will shoot you where you stand!"" I said this with a very loud and booming command. In retrospect this seems harsh and I am not proud of it. It was after 2am and I was worried for the safety of my family. I mean no ""good"" person would do this type of thing to a stranger, right?

I start to count, ""1...........2"" just then I look out the peephole, and no one is there. ""3"", the 3 was noticeably quieter than the previous two in the countdown. I have a bathroom just off the foyer and it's window has a clear view of the front door.  I peer out of it, no one there. I think to myself ""okay, he got the point."" Oh shit what if he didn't and this asshole is now taking revenge on my wifes car or worse my baby (truck). I decided I would need to go outside, against my inner monologue telling my white ass to stay inside.

I enter my room to grab my shoes, and got a shock as my wife broke the silence.

""You are not going outside after that!!!"" She exclaimed. She must have heard the entire thing.

""Do you want this asshole screwing with our cars?"" I asked.

""I could care less, you are NOT going out there!!"" She again rattled off.

""Baby, go back to sleep I will be fine."" I assured her.

I get my shoes on, go to the front door and that is when I saw something so  simple yet extremely terrifying. The door had been unlocked this whole time. I do not know why but this had a huge effect on my nerves at the moment that it was noticed. I check the bathroom window once again a quickly snap open the front door while sweeping every bit of the front porch with the barrel of my weapon, the beam from it's attached light painting my yard as if it were the broadest brush in the pale. Nothing. I step outside and onto the wet grass. I check the side yard closest to my door, and then start towards the driveway. The vehicles looked fine as I could see them clearly due to the very bright street lamp illuminating my driveway. No sign of ""Daniel"". I start to check the other side of my home when I hear it. Thinking of it right now sends chills all the way down my body. 

""I'm right here."" Replied Daniel in a scratchy but clear whisper.

This was so chilling at the time, that I could not bring myself to turn around right away. It felt as if he were inches from me. Right behind me, staring. I feel a little embarrassed to say it took quite a lot of courage to turn around, but when I did, I was surprised. Daniel had not been directly behind me, but about twenty feet away, sitting on the curb beside my driveway facing away from me. His silhouette small and twig like. There was a lot of light coming from the street light across the street yet he seemed strangely dark. As if he were able to escape the lights grasp ever so slightly. I remedied this with the light beaming from beneath my pistol. When I illuminated him, it was not what I was expecting. 

Maybe my being terrified at the moment had me thinking irrationally. I was expecting an old bearded ghost of a man waiting for me to peer into his cold dead eyes, only to grasp my soul and rip it out through my throat, I know, too many movies right? This was a noticeably unkempt young man but not dirty, more of a grungy type of look going on. He was wearing a vertically striped orange and green striped tight fitting sweater, he was african american and seemed to be in his early twenties. He sat there seemingly in no hurry to turn around and greet me, legs stretched out into the street, hands placed palm down stretched out behind him, fingers noticeable grasping at the blades of grass between them. 

""What do you need?"" I rattle off, with an understandably shaky voice.

""Only what I asked for."" He replied, again way too calm for the situation. 

""I suggest you get up and move on before I call the police!"" I say. I crinfe now thinking of how I reacted to this young man. 

""That will be fine, would you do that for me, would you call them for me?"" He spat back, as he peered slowly over his right shoulder at me, his eyes closed tight seemingly due to my extremely bright light beaming into the back of his head.

""Sure, do you fucking realize how close you were to being shot man?"" I ask.

""Why on earth would you shoot me? I could have walked into your home, without ever knocking, right?"" He said this the way a mother would say it to her child when revealing she knew a secret the child thought nobody knew.

""Alright, move the FUCK on dude, NOW!"" I shouted but noticeably terrified now.

He rose to his feet, seemingly in one movement. Turned to me, his hand stretched out as to block the beam of light so he could open his eyes and look at me. He opened his eyes which were noticeably bloodshot and just looked at me, staring as if he were asking me to lower the light, which I did. As I did this he showed me his hands first palm then the back of his hands like a magician would when assuring his audience he had nothing up his sleeves. He brought his hands to his face and covered it, while rubbing it quickly as someone would while washing their face. He slowly lowers his hands to his side and then looks straight up into the sky, and then slowly down towards me. He smiled, and said in a hushed but very deep voice. 

""Call them motherfucker!""

I raise my weapon back up and start to back into my driveway towards my door, every few steps I make towards my door he makes one towards me.

""Call them motherfucker!"" He screams. As if he knew what the outcome of the call would be.

""Take one more fucking step, and it will be your fucking last!!!"" I shout, my finger fighting the urge to squeeze of a round into his torso.

He stops in his tracks, cocks his head at an angle and presents a very dramatic frown. Followed by a snarl. His face seemed to twist and contort while staring at me with the most anger I had seen on a human face, ever.

I get into my home grab my phone a run upstairs to a window to get a view of this motherfucker while I call the police. My wife was already up there, she must have been watching the whole thing. I quickly dial 911 while ushering my way to the window. As I peer down at him, he slowly looks up at us, still snarling.

""Call them, motherfucker!!!!"" His scream muffled a bit by our walls but still noticeably louder than before.

I get the operator on the phone, never breaking eye contact with Daniel.

I explain everything to the operator as they assure me she has officers on the way.

She calmly starts to ask for more details. What is he wearing, physical description, what has been said, did he physically attack me, was he still there, did he have any weapons, do I have any weapon? The questions seemed to go on and on. She then says.

""Sir you should be able to see the lights from the unit arriving, can you see it?"" She asked

""Yes!"" I exclaim.

She then asked for me to stay inside until the officers knock at my door. I immediately head down stairs and there is the knock.

""Poh-leece!"" A male voice shouted.

I opened the door, and was greeted by an officer. The cop was about mid 30's, portly and visibly sweaty. 

""You called in a disturbance?"" He asked.

""Yeah, did you grab him? I replied.

""Hell no, is he still here?"" He snarked. 

""Well he was ten seconds ago."" I said.

We both walk out into the yard where we had stood. No sign of Daniel. I explained everything to the officer as I have just done to all of you. He seemed to believe it all and was also a bit shaken. 

""Damn, that's some crazy shit!"" He said with a look of astonishment.

""You're telling me!"" I replied. 

He retreats to his car for a few moments and comes back. He explains that a family had just reported their 17 year old son missing. Their son was african american, tall, and most importantly his name was Daniel. He explained further that Daniel was a diabetic and they worried he may be going into some sort of diabetic fit. Everything started to fit perfectly. There was a reason he was so irate and up and down. This wasn't a maniac, it was a young man that was simply ill. My emotion went from scared for my family, to scared for this young man. As we are standing there in my yard, the cop and I. We hear it.

CRACK!!! ..........CRACK CRACK CRACK CRACK!

Five very noticeable gunshots rang out. Followed by my neighbor, a 60 something asian widow, running from her house, handgun swinging wildly back at her home. She was screaming, quite literally bloody murder.

As I stand there paralyzed with shock, the officer quickly draws his weapon and starts shouting commands.

""Put the weapon down, now!"" He screams thunderously.

""I killed him!"" She shouted while simultaneously throwing the handgun to the ground recklessly.

The officer orders her to the ground, approaches her slowly and quickly handcuffs her. He starts to search her, stands her up, walks her to his car and retrieves the thrown weapon. All while I am standing there in horror.

He shouts for me to go into my home and stay in there.  It turns out Daniel saw the lights about the same time I did. He must have quickly ran to my neighbors and ran through an unlocked door. My neighbor found him standing in her living room, naked and apparently slamming her cats head into the wall. She said he had the cat by the tail and was swinging it violently into the wall, blood splattering everywhere. She retrieved her handgun and shot him 5 times, running out her door immediately after.

I was told he was dead before he even hit the floor. She hit him with three bullets. One through the neck, one through the thigh and one, the fatal one, through his temple. I met the young mans family, who actually was pretty hostile towards me. They wanted, quite surprisingly, to sue my neighbor for wrongful death or some shit. I cannot judge them as I do not know what they must be going through.

Oh yeah, I forgot the craziest part. After the police officer ordered me back into my home, my wife and I found something that send chills down our spines. Lying there at the foot of our bed, a pair of shoes and socks. You guessed it. They were Daniels.

mitchbresh,4,,11,1rfvu4,,24,"So, let's just get right into this. I work at a Futureshop, and I have for quite a while now. One of my co-workers, Will, used to work in LA, moving his way up the ranks as a screenwriter, but moved to my city for his marriage. We both started talking one day about how we love to write and started tossing ideas back and forth. We both have a knack for the horror genre and decided that we would work together on writing a horror screenplay. This was about a month ago, and as of yet we haven't been able to sit down and work on anything together. 

On saturday we were both working and took our lunch break at the same time. We started talking about when we could get together to work on the screenplay and that's when the story came up. Will knows how much I love anything creepy and how invested I am in the paranormal, so he shared something another one of our coworkers, Chelsea, had told him. 

After he told me her story, I had to meet with her. She worked on Sunday and I asked Will to talk to her to see if she would be okay with discussing it with me. Yesterday I received a text from Will saying that Chelsea would really love to talk to me about the situation. 

One thing I should mention is that i have a family history of being involved with the paranormal. I have had many of my own experiences along with helping out friends of friends with questions they have about the topic. 

So yesterday I went in to talk to her about what had happened and this is what she shared with me:
She has a son who is about two-years old named Lucas. A week ago Lucas woke up in the middle of the night screaming at the top of his lungs. Chelsea ran to his room and tried to calm him down, but nothing seemed to work. She decided to take him into her room to sleep with her, but when she did this, he freaked out even more. She said that Lucas was fixated on one corner of the room and kept staring at the corner, repeating ""No, no, no..."" over and over. This obviously creeped her out, so she took him out of the room and he seemed to calm down. A couple nights ago, the same thing happened, but this time he pulled the sheet over his head as though to hide from something that was standing in the corner. The second night he freaked out, she had to take him on a car ride around the block just to calm him down.

She said that her room has always felt off to her and that she often gets the feeling that there is a presence in the room with her. I asked if she owned any pets and she told me that she has a dog. Chelsea then proceeded to tell me that the dog has acted strange in the room before as well. 

I asked her if there was anything else important I should know and she shared that her older son had said he saw a ghost in her room the other day. I'm not sure it's linked though, because he happened to ""see"" the ghost after the first incident with Lucas.

After I had asked her all of my questions I told her to start paying attention to certain details and to note them as they happen. I gave her my number and told her that if anything happens or if she has any questions, she should call me. At this point in time I don't think she has anything to worry about, but I told her that I would like to come visit her son and her house to see if I can get a reading on anything. 

I'm not sure when I'll be able to visit her house or if anything else will happen, but if something does happen, I'll make sure to update those who are reading this.",My Co-worker's Son,35,nosleep
yurglar,10,,14,1r6zsn,,27,"Under the Bed

I’m writing this because I simply cannot sleep and there’s something I really need to tell someone, and I find this reddit to be a good place to do so. It is something that is not what you’d consider in the domain of classical horror stories, like zombies or ghosts. It is not, because it was, and I’m afraid still is, real. 

It is so real that it happened 11 years ago, when I was only 7, on a cold morning of December. As you can see, not the night of 31st October. Just the placid, boring morning of 7th December. I was in bed, and I knew my parents were already out, they liked going on morning jogs together. It was a Sunday and my head was throbbing. I have frequent migraines and that 7th December migraine was particularly bad. So there I was, feeling shitty and thinking about lunch, when I moved and my bed creaked. The house was old, like proper old, and we had just moved in (in this regard that part of my life did sound like the beginning of a cliché horror story). I thought it was just temporary anyway, once dad left his job we would leave to California.

When I was a kid I had this habit of putting a pillow over my face when I had a migraine, normally one of those useless small pillows always hanging around. They were always cold, and the cold felt good on my forehead and cheeks. It might sound a bit stupid to you, but to me, it felt good for a few seconds. On 7th December I did this and suddenly, I could not remove the pillow.

I tried to remove it with all my strength, and whoever, whatever, was pushing down, gave in. It was more or less the strength of a skinny teenager. I started panicking, scared, my legs twisting and my heartbeat shooting through the roof. I didn’t even wonder what was happening. I managed to catch a breath and then it happened, all of a sudden. I heard the light switch of my room go out, and the blinds closing violently, and the pressure on the pillow suddenly increased. Twice, then tenfold. It was no longer the strength of a human being but something else. I felt my mind slowdown from the lack of oxygen and I stopped fighting. I felt a strange calm wash over me. Whatever was killing me was impossible to fight, it was like there was a ton of stone over that pillow. I saw a light, my vision going white and then tunneling, and I heard whispers. I was dying. I felt scared then. I put my hands over the pillow, but there was nothing there, and I only felt the hairs of my arms standing up. My hands were not smashed as I expected. My young brain could not make sense of it, but I remember 
being scared, really scared. That’s when I heard a bark.

My dog, Thor, had heard me twist and struggle in bed and had come, to my lucky rescue. The pressure immediately disappeared, the blinds opened and the light turned on and that’s when I felt it, sliding over my right arm, like a hand caressing it, but a dead hand, callous and cold hand, and I felt it, whatever it was, turning and hiding under the bed, like a snake hiding under a rock. Thor kept barking madly, teeth showing and ears back. He was a German shepherd, huge for the standards. Then he neared my bed, looked under my bed, growling and then stopped. He sniffed once, then twice, looked again under the bed, and then climbed on top of the bed and licked my face, where I laid, regaining my breath and control over my limbs, which had gone a bit numb. I remember hugging Thor and almost crying.

I told it to my parents but they did not believe me, they thought it was the migraines and started talking about a psychologist or psychiatrist and bad grades at school. I remember being angry with their reaction, but over time it faded. It took some time for me to sleep again and Thor always slept in my room, sometimes even with me, but there were never any more issues. I never even remembered it from time to time, it was just a scary, traumatic memory my brain just erased. For 11 years, I slept over that memory, over whatever was under my bed.

We moved out a month ago, after 11 years, to a new modern house in California, where my bed doesn’t even have space under it and I love it. My dad sold the house to this young couple who were his friends, who didn’t have much money, but loved the retro feeling of the house. Back then, I didn’t even remember that scary event 11 years ago.

That’s when, as I was laying on my new bed yesterday, I remembered, along with all my morning nightmare details 11 years ago, my dad complaining the other day at dinner table how John and Mary, the young couple, haven’t phoned or said anything about the house since they started living there.

I went to get Thor in my bedroom. I can’t stop thinking about it and I hope they are alright.

sinbysilence,9,,2,1r49de,,28,"Okay. You have to believe me. And what I'm about to say is going to make you not believe me. But please, be patient with me.

You're not real. At least, the you who is reading this isn't real. You only exist because my mind tells you to exist. Regardless of how unbelievable that sounds, I know it to be true. You're helping me cope. You're helping my brain stay active.  And, I believe, to some degree, you're helping keep me alive.

Since there's no better place to start,  I'll just start at the beginning. Back before I knew you existed. Back when you had the possibility of being real.

Back when my normal life got catapulted into this current situation.  I lead a very mediocre life. Living paycheck to paycheck, small group of friends, and no one in my life worth falling in love with. I was on my way to work, just like every other day. Stopped to get coffee. Lit my cigarette as I left the gas station. I began my morning commute.  It was all very routine. Until the car pulled out in front of me.  I stood up on my brakes, but still hit him at an abrupt 45 miles an hour. I ran the red light.  My seatbelt burned my chest.  My head  was blasted by the air bag. My femur protested against the impact until it snapped. The pain was dizzying.  Disorienting. I dug for the phone that flew out of my hand. Mom was still  on the line, crying. She heard what had happened and was over an hour away. But her and dad where on their way.

Now this is what I believe may have happened next. I think I remember getting out of the car and being put on the stretcher. I remember the god awful pain of having my leg reset on the side of the road. That had to be real, right?  It hurt so badly. It was the most earth shattering pain I've ever felt. Once I got to the hospital I was drugged and put to sleep to prep for surgery.

I faded in and out all week. After four nights, I woke to a conversation with my mom. I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night and, considering the drugs in my system, I was very much alert. My mom snapped to attention when she felt me stir. I look at her as though she was a stranger. I'll never forget the confusion I felt as I asked her...""who are you? ""

""It's me, Em. It's mom.""

""Where am I?"" I cried, tugging at the IV on my hand. 

""You're in the hospital,  sweetie.  You were in an accident. ""

""Was it bad?"" I begged for an answer. ""Was it bad?"" I was more hysterical the second time.

I never got an answer. Even when I woke up the next morning she acted as though the conversation never took place. And here's why: I never woke up. Instead,  my brain started to build my new percieved reality. Looking back on it, I think that conversation we had was the last real one I had. Because the accident WAS bad. Because I am still suffering from it, to some extent.

Suffering may not be the best way to put it. Sure, the first two months were brutal. I had to relearn to walk. I had to have help getting in an out of the shower. I had headaches. I got dizzy and sick often. I couldn't work. But it had to seem real.

Now,  life is amazing. I've met the person who made me believe in soulmates. I'm back at work - they even transferred me closer to home and gave me a raise when I came back. Remember how I was the one who ran the red light?  The guy I hit doesn't want to sue me. My life couldn't be anymore perfect if I wrote it myself. Because I have wrote it myself. My brain has created a life to make everything seem normal. I would have never questioned it if it weren't for the other night when I caught a glimpse of reality.

""Nurse...nurse...I think she's waking!"" 

Mom?

Opening my eyes felt like I was fighting a week without sleep.

""Where am I?"" I mumbled.  I hurt. It made no sense.

""You're in the hospital,  baby. You were in an accident, but it's okay. You're going to be okay. I'm so glad to see your eyes.""

Accident? I don't remember anything in my recent history that would have landed me in the hospital. I've been overly precautious these past five months. I voiced my confusion out loud.   ""What accident? I've not been in an accident since June."" 

I saw mom's face fall from optimism to sadness. I asked again, ""what accident?  Was it bad?"" I was scared. Scared because I didn't remember an accident. Scared because of how badly I hurt and didn't know why.

""Sweetie, you've been here since June.""

And then I understood. Why she was so happy to see my eyes. They had been shut since June. 

""Is it bad?"" But before she had a chance to answer, I was drifting again. And the next thing I knew,  I woke up in my bed with my boyfriend at my side.

Since that night, I occasionally catch bursts of their conversation inside my hospital room. Remember how I said I think you're helping to stay alive? 

""She's showing good brain activity. That's a good thing. Unfortunately,  it was a nasty bump to her head. But we've seen people wake up from comas after months, years even. So long as her brain remains healthy, there's no reason not to hope for the best.""

Sounds optimistic,  right? So why am I scared?

I've built an amazing life inside my head. I'm afraid I'll have to leave it. I'm afraid that I may soon wake up.

BumpinRapTapes,10,,9,1r0hla,,25,"So I got a call from a telemarketer, nothing weird about that really.  But before I hung up the automated voice started spitting out stuff like my address, age, stuff like that.  And then my social security number.  Then a list of my room mates.  And then I was concerned.  I waited until the machine stopped, expecting some numbers to press for more info or whatever so I could find out what's up and get myself off their call list.  All the lady robot said though was ""The Intermed company thanks you.""

Reasonably concerned I started doing some research, after ignoring a bunch of message board sites  I finally found what I think was the Intermed site (in like the fifth page of results).  This is all it said:

""Intermed is at the forefront of the organ trade market and thought processing innovations.  All our services are backed with industry leading research and proven by numerous customer testimonials.  Many of our customers are satisfied to the point of frequent return, and we pride ourselves in maintaining our client pool.

Nothing else.  White page, black text.  That's it.  I decided to backtrack to the message boards to see what I could find.  This led me to some random sites and eventually I found a few message threads of people sharing stories similar to mine.  A weird robot caller with way too much information.  One guy got the call in the wee hours of the morning and totally laid a boner kill on a sweaty night with his lady.  They all seemed to be on the same hunt I was, except for one username that I saw pop up on a few of the sites, he called himself ASimpleCipher.  All this dude did was sing Intermed's praises, how he and his friends had used their ""products and services to tremendous avail"" and ""would recommend to anyone!""  All very cheesy and all seemingly marketing plants.  Since that was my best lead I decided to make an account on one of the thread sites and try and get in contact with him.

I sent him a rather aggressive message, which may've been a mistake looking back.  But regardless, and unsurprisingly, I got no response.  I decided if worse came to worse I'd just deal with it when it came up.  I put the whole thing in the back of my mind.  For a few months.

Then ASimpleCipher responded.  Here's a copy and paste of our correspondence:

[Me]  Hey man it's really obvious you work for intermed, you're not fooling anyone.  I want to know who you are, what intermed is and how you got so much of my information.  And I want MY private information deleted from your database, and I want off your call list.  Immediately.  I will not hesitate to get a lawyer involved if this goes any further.

[ASimpleCipher]   I appreciate your interest in my company, Ben!  As always, customer care is a top goal at Intermed.  My representatives tell me that based on market research, you would be a prime candidate for our products and services.  As a courtesy, we like to know as much as we can about potential customers, so as to provide the best quality care possible.  Like you, I once felt a terrible weight in my life, one that rendered me incapable of reaching my full potential as a human being.  When doctors could not help me mend the flaws given to me by generations past, I took matters into my own hands.  As it came to pass, that effort is what gave way to this current business venture.  You may hesitate at terminology like ""Thought Processing"" and ""Organ Trade"", but let me assure you the danger begins and ends at the television screen.  So, if I may, I'd like to draw some common ground between yourself and I.  We do share many similarities.  As a young man, I was plagued with severe asthma (like yourself) from my mother's side of the family, leaving me unable to compete physically with my peers.  This lead me to more intellectual endeavors as I began to mature into an adult.  Cruel as fate is however, I soon discovered I'd inherited a more severe form of my grandfathers autism.  His genes riddled me with social anxiety, and I was thus outcast from much of any community I was ever a member of.  In spite of my flawed genetics I was only more driven to clear the blemishes of my being.  Nothing, I vowed, would hinder my quest for perfection... of the perfect human being.  Given to me from my lineage, however, was the savvy and cunning of generations of businessmen.  

Years, centuries it seems, passed while I honed my craft and built my empire.  Once one is outcast from society, one develops a strong callous to sympathy.  Under a mutual agreement of confidentiality between you and I, I will admit to using almost every associate of mine as merely a means to my own end.  Well, that end is Intermed.  Intermed is my true brainchild, as it were.  I will also admit to misleading you a bit, giving the facade of a full staff under my employ.  Let me assure you I am fully capable of operating this venture on my own.  Let me also assure you your personal information is safe and sound, as I said, I only aim to ensure the best service possible.  Never miss a detail is a creed I operate under.

Enough business however!  Even a jaded outcast such as me has need for camaraderie!  During my time working in the shipping industry I found myself in Northern California in the early 1960's.  My business associate at the time was a rather unstable man.  Every bit of his free time, it seemed he would study the art of coded language, ciphers, cryptograms... whatever one may call them.  Strangely, he got me very interested in the art and it has since become a favorite hobby of mine.  Of course his were much more complex than anything I cared to attempt, he was also versed in astrology and loved to incorporate knowledge of the stars into his little puzzles (This earned him quite the sinister reputation after we parted ways).  On the other hand, I preferred to leave little clues here and there, woven into my business dealings.  Now imagine what fun it would be if someone figured out my little puzzles!  All that work of building a persona of mystery!  Unravelled by a thread I'd left loose for some cunning soul to pull!  Really, I thought someone would've found it by now.  Even after everyone I've tried to sell Intermed's services and products to it is you, cunning lad, who has finally made contact.  Very clever, indeed.  Of course you saw my companies website.  I admit it is a bit sparse, a work in progress.  Reducing my mission for Intermed to a single paragraph however, I did put in a bit of extra effort.

I have been rambling though, I do apologize!  Thank you for inquiring about my company, I hope my response has eased any concerns you may have.

I really don't know what to make of this guy.  It really can't be some prank, the guy knew I had asthma as a kid.  How?  I have to say that I've never experienced such an air of creepiness from pure text.  Something about the way he composed his message was off.  I don't know.  I can't make a lot of sense out of any of this.  I stopped my investigation there, being as I have seen too many horror movies and don't like the idea of rabbit holes.  It's been a few months since and I haven't heard anything from Intermed or ASimpleCipher.  I check the thread site every now and then.  I did go back and check out the Intermed website again.  I'm really not one for puzzles, I can't make anything out of it.  So I'm submitting it here to see if someone is more ""cunning"" than me.  I hope so.  Anyway that about wraps it up, sorry for the length, I've been staying in lately as my asthma has been returning so I've kind of been alone with my thoughts.",A Simple Cipher,34,nosleep
NeonPaint,12,,6,1ra0o4,,26,"I need someone to help me. I need to actually be able to go to sleep and not worry about what I'm going to wake up to. I need it to stop.
The past few days have been enough to make me pack up and check myself into the crazy house. It would have to be better than this. 

I work at a nursing home. It's not a luxurious job for sure but this nursing home makes my job interesting. It's haunted. I know it sounds stupid but it really is. We have a shadow that haunts one room and our residents will act in ways that will set you on edge. I guess the most recent example is Dessy, I obviously cannot provide you her real name but this is a nickname I have given her myself. 

Dessy is a cute little old woman. She is the grandma you wish you could have. We've always had a pretty good companionship. A couple weeks ago she changed. Her appearance and her personality completely shifted. Her eyes become sunken in, hair was constantly messy when it used to always be well groomed, teeth started to turn a nasty yellow, and her feet...dear god her feet...they looked like they belonged to a creature who only resembled a human in the slightest way. The best way I can explain her feet is that they looked like long fingered hands with jagged finger nails, they didn't look like they belonged to some little adorable woman of 92. 

She started saying *things* to me. There was one conversation that has stuck with me. 

""Dessy, do you want to go to the dining room tonight?""

""Fuck...fuck...you little **whore**.""

""Excuse me? Why are you saying that? Honey, you can eat in your room, I just wanted to make sure...""

""How does it feel whore? Little slut you fucking slut you whore you **SLUT**.""

""You need to stop being mean. How bout we go into the bathroom and you can go before dinner?"" 

At this moment, she shuffles into the bathroom with me and I grab her pants to pull them down.

""You fucking slut. Does he do this to you? Does he put his hands in your pants? Does he fuck you with his hand? He fucked that little virgin c--t......virgin....whore slut **fuck** you...with his hand....virgin c--t c--t c--t."" 

I went white as a ghost. I was close to Dessy but this old woman never knew anything about me other than my age, my name, and that I wasn't married. I never spoke a word to her about anything sexual but she knew *things*. My personal life isn't something I want to share but her mentioning those last words did relate to me in a very personal way. I looked at her as if the devil himself were standing in front of me. And then she smiled. I can't explain to you guys the smile this woman gave me, how it made me cringe, how it made me sick. 

Fast forward from that moment to a few days ago. Stuff starts happening to me at my house. It began with scratching. One night I heard scratching coming from the walls then it was above me in the ceiling then back to the walls. I didn't think it was too scary until it started to follow me around the house. If I went into the kitchen, the scratching would follow. I couldn't get away from it. But I soon realized there are **much** scarier noises out there.

The moaning is what followed and it's been driving me to the brink of insanity. Every night I hear this awful moaning. Like someone is in this house crying out from a pain I can never imagine. I get up, I search for who ever or what ever it is. If it sounds like it's coming from the living room, I run to the living room but as soon as my feet hit the carpet, the moaning is now in the kitchen. It plays with me. Toys with my mind and makes me run around here on an endless hour consuming search of where it is coming from. If I even want to know where it comes from.

The sound is so sad but it feels unmistakably evil to me. I can't explain it but when I hear it, I know it's a cruel joke. I know people say that they are sensitive to spirits all the time but I have always felt like I have been. I can't sit down and talk to them like all these psychics out there but I will get random thoughts or names or feelings. If a spirit is around, I usually can get a name and maybe a fact or two but *this* has no name, nothing. 

What it does have is a moan that makes me instantly nauseous and it has a *smile*. I haven't seen it in its entirety but I got a glimpse of something that has made sleeping and living here nearly impossible. 

One night when the moaning was louder than usual, I went on the pointless search again trying to find it and figure out a way to stop it. When I walked into the living room, I saw a shadow and it had a smile on it's face that made me throw up right there. It made everything in me want to come up in my throat. After I cleaned up and calmed down, I realized that the smile was familiar to me. Maybe that's why it caused me to get sick, it could have been that my body knew instantly where that smile had been before. Sweet Dessy showed me that smile that day in the restroom in her room. She has never smiled at me like that again, but I can't handle the thought of seeing it again whether it's with or without a face.

The moaning and that smile haunts me. It keeps me running around my house every night because I want it to **STOP**. I haven't had a real nights sleep in days.  I'm exhausted and I'm working a full time job on a quarter tank of energy. Things I usually love to do, I don't have the energy to do. I always liked to post comments on reddit but it's been a couple weeks since I've even done that because the thought of actually reading a post and commenting is too exhausting, it's pitiful. 

I need someone to tell me what I can do. Any ideas will help. ",Maybe I'm losing my mind.,32,nosleep
ggtheblock,4,,8,1r2ucw,,26,"I don't know what I saw, I'm not even really sure I should have seen what I did. 

Two nights ago I was having a wonderful dream. There was nothing odd or creepy to it, just a dream. I woke up in the middle of the night as some people tend to do but then I have wondered since if I ever really did wake up at all. From my bed I watched as 2 figures cloaked in crimsom, one considerably taller than the other, walked into my room. The shorter of the two turned to look at me as he shut off my alarm clock. I woke up the next morning several hours after my alarm was supposed to go off. Did I unplug it in my sleep? Did I even set it in the first place? I didn't want to consider any other options. Last night however tipped the scales in the other direction.

Last night's dream is still fresh on my mind. I was on a mission to stop a bomb going off. I had a key and as I raced through the city streets I checked my watch every block to see how much time I had left. I made it inside the building, rounding the last corner, checking my watch one last time and saw that I had just 2 minutes to spare but when I looked up I was no longer dreaming. I was on my couch, looking eye to eye with the hooded figures as they sat only inches away. They were green, withered. The red of their cloaks matched only by the red of their irisis. No glow to be found, however they had perfect white teeth. The smaller of the two had the larger smile, clearly taking pleasure in what he was about to do.

 ""I'm sorry but we can't let you do that."" 

It was then that I noticed a small familiar watch in his hand and didn't really realize what he did as he removed the final 2 minutes from the timer. I was back in the dream, staring in horror at the monitors of the console I was supposed to have reached in time. Millions dead, cities in ruin, more carnage then I have ever witnessed. I broke, fell to my knees and cried until the building's security came and apprehended me. 

I don't know what happened. I'm not sure if I fell into some sort of inception scenario but I pray I do not have anything important to dream about tonight.",We Can't Let You do That,34,nosleep
Midn1ghtwhisp3r,3,,11,1r1zpy,,24,"The man in the road.

I live in a somewhat medium-sized house, out in the country surrounded by trees.

I've always felt safe here, never once paranoid, never worried, the crime rate here is pretty low.

In the entire twenty years I've lived here I've only seen news of one single break in.
I'd say that gives me plenty of easy sleeping.


Until recently.


I was getting ready for work, my job is night cook at a local restaurant.
I left the house, noticing the cool air of November,
And as the chill whispered into my lungs, I felt,
As cliché as it sounds, as if I was being watched.

I looked around, nothing was there.
But when I finally shrugged it off, and got Into my car,
I noticed that my mirrors were all fogged up.

Normally, this wouldn't even bother me, as It's so easy to get out of my driveway. 
But tonight, everything seemed wrong.
As I turned the key, and my engine started up,

I heard my radio move to static, from channel to channel, instead of the usual classic rock station.
Living alone, I have no reason to believe anyone would tamper with my car. I don't have neighbors nearby, and My dog would have warned me if someone was messing around.

Again, I checked my clock and shrugged it off.
I'd be late if I didn't hurry.

As I reached the switch off the static, my radio stopped, 99.9FM. 
And I heard a whisper, at first I thought I was going insane or dreaming.
But I turned the volume up, and could barely make out the words,
""kill...me.......Kill....me...""

The words sent a chill colder than the freezing air through my spine, and I immediately turned the radio off, and left,

theunlockeddoor,2,,10,1r1j47,,24,"I work at a public library and I really need to write about this.  Yeah, boring. Librarians=Blah. I know.  This is probably going to be tl:dr and dull.  I know I'm super-new to reddit, but I really need to get this out of my system and I'd feel weird posting about this anywhere else.  So, mock me for my noobness, but I really need to talk.

And aside from 'sexy librarian' sterotypes, you ought to know that the people checking books out from behind the desk have to deal with all sorts of people.  People checking out books about livestock and winking and grinning at you too much, and women, teary-eyed, avoiding your gaze, checking out books about abuse or divorce.  We're sort of like bartenders, but without the convenience of bouncers.  So, when I tell you that meeting this one particular guy kept me up at night, you ought to know that it's not because I have a simple, dusty job. 

This is a story about  person I met through my job.  It's also a story told to me by that person.  

When I came in to work one morning my boss was wandering around the workroom looking disgusted.  She kept going between the bathroom and her desk- trying to work but getting nauseous every so often.  Apparently, when she'd rolled up in the parking lot that morning, she'd found something on the pavement.

A wet set of dentures.

We all laughed at how weird that was, and set the things gingerly on a pad of paper towels in the backroom.  No way were we putting a pair of raw dentures in the lost and found tub.  We forgot about them before lunch.

Later that day, though, this guy came in.  I ended up knowing him as ""Irma's Nephew"".

He limped in and asked if we had any books about dentistry.  I told him I didn't know where to find them off the top of my head and proceeded to do a search on the computer.  As I typed things in and scanned our holdings, he kept staring at me.  His eyes seemed too large and white, popping out against his skin.  He kept chewing his lips and the sides of his cheeks.  It was so fierce, so intense and obsessive, it looked painful.

Then he said: ""Teeth.  C'mon, gimme anything about teeth.  How they grow....""  And trailed off.

I was rattled but I managed to scribble a number down on a scrap of paper and gesture towards the nonfiction section.  He hobbled off.

Twenty minutes or so later, it was the top of the hour, and my turn to do a ""walkabout"".  ""Walkabouts"" are a thing our library system made up to make sure nobody is being harassed or molested out in the stacks.  We're supposed to check all the blind spots in the building every half hour.

So, I was doing my walkabout when I spotted Irma's Nephew sitting on the floor between two rows of books.  He glanced up at me, stood, and as I was moving away, caught me.  His hand on my wrist made me nervous, but I looked back at the circ desk and saw Vikki watching us like a hawk.  Somehow this made me brave.  He told me he needed my help, that these books weren't helping.  So I asked him what else I might look up for him.

""No,"" he said, ""I need to talk to you, to someone, to someone, to anyone.  My aunt, she...""  And he trailed off, eyes bugging.

Sadly, money doesn't reach super-far in the library world, and I hadn't been trained on how to properly treat a mentally ill patron.  As a fail safe, I went with gentleness, since he had a hard grip on my wrist.

So, I asked him to talk to me (looking back over my shoulder at Vikki).

This is the best version I can write of the garbled story he told me.  I could just say: ""And then he told me a spooky story"", but that wouldn't explain why I'm jumpy. I apologize that this is long, but I'm trying to get this out in an accurate way.

""I’ve got an Aunt, named Irma, and she pretty much raised me.  She’s like my mother, but she’s been gettin’ on, gettin' on, you know, and recently she’s been forgetting things.  I need these books for her.  She’s got a problem.  A real….. strange thing goin’ on.
	
“Last summer she got all her teeth pulled.  Got dentures instead.  And she hated them, said they always felt funny in her mouth, and I TOLD HER! we’d go get them refit, recast, but she’d still hate them.  She’d just spit them right out onto the carpet and glare at me with her mouth-skin all sunk-in and puckered up.  I’m the only one of the family that visited her anymore.  So that meant she blamed me.  I was the only one around to be hateful to.  Fuck.

""In June, she started doin’ this thing where she’d say she lost her dentures.  Whenever I went over to see her, she’d ‘lost’ them and I’d scold her because dentures are damn expensive.  Pardon me.  But she’d say it’s no problem and grin big.  I’d look all over- turn the house upside down, and not be able to find them.  She’d say “They’ll turn up in no-time” and wave her hand at me like this.  

""The weird thing is that they would.  I’d come over again and she’d have them back in.  Clack them at me and laugh.  Everytime.  Clack, clack, clack.  And laugh.  Clack, clack.
	
""She, uh, she just kept losing them.  I tried talking to her neighbor down the stairs, Lucy, to try and help her out.  Lucy is a nice woman and said she’d check on her when she got the chance.  And she did good.  When I hadn’t been able to visit in a few days, I’d get a text or call from Lucy lettin’ me know everything’s alright with Miss Irma.  
	“Only I got into a car wreck.  Was laid up in the hospital doped out of my brain on pain killers for who-knows-how-long.  Doctor said I’d broken my thigh-bone.  I didn’t see Miss Irma for a long time.  I think I got a call from Lucy at some point but it’s a foggy.  I remember answering and Lucy just murmuring, murmuring something I couldn’t understand.  It must have been the drugs.  It must have been.

So, eventually, I’m better, and I go over there.  I try knocking on Miss Irma’s door.  She never gave me a key, but she always bustled up and let me in.  I knocked and knocked and she didn’t come, so I got nervous, you know?  I went over to Lucy’s then, to see if she had a back-up key, or could call the building manager.  But I when I knock on her door it just kinda…whoosh…opens.
	
I call her name, but nothin’.  So of course I go in, cuz maybe they both in trouble.  But Lucy is nowhere.  Her apartment is just… empty.  Except, just as I’m leaving, I see something pink on the floor.
	
{Here, the guy paused, licking his lips again.  It seemed to me he was winding up his courage, or working past something particularly horrible.}

""It was teeth, ma’am.  Dentures.  A top and a bottom, both.  The top was kinda falling off the bottom, was at an angle.  Like they’d just been dropped and left.  
	
“I knew Lucy didn’t wear dentures, so this scared me a lot, because Miss Irma might be wandering around lost with her dementia.  She’d started forgetting my name.  She could be anywhere, doing anything if she was spitting her teeth out again.
	
“So I run.  Run and find the janitor that sometimes cleaned up the stairwells and he looks at me like I’m crazy.  He says “I thought your gramma moved out last month.” I say “No, sir, you are mistaken.  She can’t have gone nowhere.”  And he says “Well, I ain’t seen you nor her in that time.”  And I argue with him but eventually he comes with me and unlocks the door.   
	
“Inside Miss Irma’s the tv was on, but, she wasn’t in her chair where she’d sit for hours and watch tv.  I mean, she’d sat there so much it had left an impression, her shape.  But that wasn’t all she left.  She also left her teeth. {He was giggling a bit hysterically at this point}
	
“No, not the ones in Lucy’s place.  These were different.  These were more.  These were MORE.  All over.  Pairs and pairs of false teeth were lying all over Miss Irma’s apartment.  They were on bookshelves and on the kitchen table.  The biggest pile was around her chair.  I was confused at first.  There was no way she could have collected all these teeth by herself.  I certainly only bought her the two pairs.  She didn’t have no friends to bring her sets of teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth.
  
""And they were different, too.  As in, some were little.  Like, tiny white baby teeth, just little gappy chips.  And others were big and wide and long.  And some of the sets, I don’t know how they could fit in a person’s mouth.  they were full of fangs and tusks and.

“And it makes no sense.  I can only come up with one idea.  She was on her own for a month, except for Lucy.  I know Lucy didn’t bring her all those teeth.  The only thing I can think is that she was growing them back herself.  That, every time she had ‘lost’ and found her dentures before, she’d just thrown them away and grown a new pair in her mouth.  Then that set would fall out and she’d grow more.  And then they must have started growing strange in her mouth.  And she's gone off somewhere wandering wandering, I can't find her. I don't..  I need help for her.""

I peeled his hand off and somehow got out of there.  I went back and handed him some paper I think had a number for psychiatric help on it.  Really, I went back to the staff bathroom and sat against the wall for a while, breathing and feeling really strange in my stomach.

When I left work, I had to pass the set of dentures my boss found in the parking lot that morning.  I found myself staring at them.

Chenigin,8,,9,1r6b7r,,24,"When I was ten my parents divorced. Soon after I moved into an old house in Orange County CA with my mother and stepfather. This house had a nice floor plan but needed major work. With all the remodeling being done to the house it was not uncommon for my step father to walk around at night to check up on and see how the house was holding up. One night I was laying in bed when I heard heavy footsteps outside my bedroom window. My room was located at the side of the house. Me being young and naïve I automatically thought it was my step dad. I heard the footsteps walk into the garage and enter the house via the garage door. I knew this was the time to go to the restroom because well.. their was an adult and he could protect me from my fears of the dark. When I heard the footsteps walk past my door I slowly opened my door and called out my step fathers name. At the same time I stuck my head out my door and saw the back of a boot I never saw before turn the hallway corner. This made me reconsider how safe it was to go take a leak. I heard a sound in the kitchen.. the distinct sound of the drawers opening and a hand shuffling through its contents. After what seemed like an eternity I decided to call out to my stepfather again, this time slowly creeping out of my room so I can get to the corner of the hallway. As soon as I started to edge forward I heard the heavy footsteps make a b line straight for the front door.. I started to pick up my pace so I could get a good view of who it could be. When I got to where I could get a good view of the door I saw something I would never forget. The door slammed shut and the lock turn to the lock position. As if someone had the key and was locking it from the outside. By then my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I ran to the door to see if I could see who was in our house. When I opened the door I saw nothing... No sight of someone running away.. no evidence of anyone ever being there in the first place.. Just 10 year old me.. standing in the dark.. Suddenly the fight or flight instinct kicked in again.. but instead its the opposite instinct.. fuck! I'm ten.. I am by myself in the dark.. someone just broke into the house! I slammed the door shut and ran into my mothers room. My stepfather right away called the cops and propped a chair to the front door and the garage door so even if someone had the key they could not open it. The cops showed up and didn't find a single thing. No footprints nothing.. My mother turned on me and said it was just my childish imagination making up things.. I started to doubt myself after the years... Chucking it as what my mom said.. my youthful imagination.. I am 24 now.. I don't sleep walk nor have I ever. If it was a dream... I never had one like that ever since. If anyone has any ideas on what I might of experienced please.. I am all ears. I always wondered what other people would have to say about this.

BensonHedges1,2,,14,1r60t4,,22,"I'm writing this from my phone, I needed to get out of the house. I'm sitting at Panera Bread and my boyfriend thinks I'm nuts. In the time I posted my last update to now, Things got worse.

 It was so bizarre - my boyfriend got home around 5pm yesterday and went to take a nap. He worked a detail after his shift, so I was home alone for the most part. I did my best to stay away from the room. My cat just growled.  
There was a good hour of him sitting at the doorway...growling. For anyone that knows him, he's has the most amazing temperment...he never hisses or growls. The entire time my boyfriend was in the room napping, NOTHING. He thinks I'm crazy because I begged him not to sleep in that room...he went to work at 10pm last night, and I slept on the couch. Remember that wind? I have no fucking clue what it was, but I was on a conference call and heard a small rumble from the room. I ignored. Apparently whatever is happening - ignoring makes it worse. A couple minutes later, another rumble, and a smell. I lied when I said the worst smell ever was burnt coffee. This smell was like death. Not the death that a cat drags in by the tail. And then another rumble. As soon as my call was over, I rushed into the room, febreeze in hand. I can't explain it exactly, but as I opened the door to the bedroom, all of that windows made a loud thud like they were closing, but they were open. I sure as hell didn't open them. Is it even possible for them to thud OPEN? What the hell. Against my better judgment I went into the room. It's day time, what can happen, right? There was a stain on the floor - just a big dark stain... I don't want to say blood because it's not mine and fuck this supernatural shit. It got bigger though, like water expanding. I could see it growing, but I couldn't tell if my mind was playing tricks on me. 
I ran.
Fucking ran.

What the hell is my cat seeing? I wonder if this is just my mind playing tricks on me. 

I've had some trouble posting this today - but I haven't been home, and I'm returning tonight. My intention is to sleep in that room. I want to know what's going on, and why it's getting so cold. I'm getting the chills thinking about the chills.

I really wish that we could continue this, but alas, we need to use this computer for other things now.  I know this will get all of you terribly upset, and I'm sure you'll think we're monsters, but what do you say to simulants?  For what it's worth, I myself do not want to shut this project down, but I'm a lowly peon, but I take comfort in the fact that the data gathered from this little experiment will advance science like no other project has in history, and such advancements may will lead to revolutions in saving peoples lives.

We've tried to avoid intervening in your universe, but I can't say that  we didn't occasionally indulge in a little fun here and there.  That said, I do apologize for having allowed so much suffering to continue unabated, but intervening too much would have invalidated our results, and then we just wouldn't be able to get published.

This is about as much as I, personally, will involve myself in this universe.  I felt you deserved to know that this simulation will be coming to an end in about 5 months of your time scale and reference, but please know how much all of you mean to not only me, but all the rest of the team that wrote and built the software and hardware to make all of this happen.  We definitely won't forget you, and we promise it will all be worth it in the end.

BiohazardTyrant,3,,10,1r4rao,,20,"So to begin, I was eleven years old I believe...

My father had brought me to a friend of his' house. Or rather farm.

I was excited because I had befriended the son of my fathers friend, for stories sake I will call him James. James had a older brother who was a year and a half older, so I was eleven, James was twelve and his brother thirteen. We had all played around the barn and fields plenty of times before. This time though it was a celebration of some sort, I wish I could remember why but anyway, they had been in this house on this farm for about half a year. Tonight was the big party, as in the most vivid thing I remember about that night. The cut off pigs head. Literally just cut right off, and sitting on a support beam about shoulder high to the adults. The body was dangling from a chain for a while, until they skewered it onto a metal pole and roasted it whole over a fire.

I really wish I could remember why they were doing that but sadly I cannot. In any case, me James and his brother were just running around like we always did like idiots. They had all of the farm as a playground and plenty of space to play. We began by walking over to the stalls where they kept the horses and cattle. The sheds were HUGE, and seemed to be endless to a younger kid as myself. 

After about a half an hour of walking through corridors left and right in the dark we started hearing noises, but not normal ones... Like chains being hit on metal and slammed into the ground, then grunts. We all took off running following James' brother who quickly let out out to the closest exit. None of us knew what the sounds were because of the fact the farm had been out of commission for about thirty years. Nothing alive should have been in there. 

We quickly made out way back to the farm house, the big one where all the adults were partying and tried to talk to them about it but of course they had all had a drink or three and ignored us laughing it off as childish imagination. 

For some reason. Some stupid god forsaken reason, James said we should go back out and just play in the field where there was a little light away from the adults and we listened. Once the three of us were out there it turned into a ""I dare you to go out in the field"" game.

We each took turns going farther and farther out into the night. Finally we all ended up ignoring the occurrences from earlier and started playing hide and seek. Bad idea. Very bad.

James and I were hiding in the tall grass near the side end of the barn and his brother came running out faster than I have ever seen anyone run, screaming bloody murder, to get away as fast as we could, get to the adults! James and I ran to him, and stopped dead in our tracks, quickly seeing why he had been fleeing. 

There we were, James, his brother and I all standing still, like sacks of meat staring to the treeline where we saw it. There were three if I remember correctly faces. All white and elongated, just weirdly shaped about six feet off the ground, and then came the true horror, the glint off the blades they were holding. 

We all ran.

Faster and faster we ran.

I turned around two times and I regret it to this day for the fact they were even closer than I thought blades outstretched trying to mince us up and drag us back into those hellish woods. 

We finally made it to the adults. The only thing I remember after that was that damn pig head, cut off, and just sitting there, I could see the spine, and every last vein... we tried telling the adults but they just laughed. None of us left the main barn after that for the rest of night.




About a week later my friend Chris came over, and had the worst part to share with me. He had been having these night terrors of these creatures tearing at him and chasing him through his own new home.

Then he told me his family had left the farm, and moved to the city.

Then he told me why. He was attacked.

Then he showed me, and lifted his shirt up, showing me a scar which I know he did not have before because we used to swim together all the time. He never had a mark there a week before. But now, across his stomach he had a fully healed scar of about ten inches going from left to right, like he had been gutted. But the scariest fact like I said was that it had not been there one night, then he woke up with that kind of scar. 

His family moved because of that, that day. And never returned to that farm.

I have long since lost touch with him, he became very paranoid after that and I just cant forget that.

Figured I would share it with the community, I do hope if any of you take anything away from this, if you see a creature, with a white face, long arms, and a huge blade by a treeline. Run, just run. And try to forget about it.","A tale of a Farm, and three young kids.",30,nosleep
JordanThirstExile,11,,34,1r857m,,22,"It started with the roses. Ever since I was a little girl I loved them. I loved the scent of them, and the colors they came in. I loved them so much that my mother had planted a few rose bushes outside our house so when it bloomed I could sit and stare at those beautiful roses. They bloomed in shades of white, and pink, but my favorite rose was red like satin. It reminded me of my mother and the way she always drew roses on her letters. 


Fast forward to the time I was 14 years old. I was never a popular girl, by far, but I wasn’t unknown either. I didn’t have long blonde hair or blue eyes, but I had talent, a slim body, and an obsession for roses. All my friends knew how much I loved them. They’d buy me perfume in a rose-shaped bottle, or a dress with red roses on them for my birthday.  I made the best out of what I could in high school being a short, brown haired, green-eyed girl. 


It was the day before homecoming when the boy I’d secretly been in love with asked me to the dance with a white rose. I swooned and he took me to the dance the next night. (I, of course, in a rose dress and him in matching colors.) He had brought me a white rose corsage to match my dress. We danced all night, and we continued to date until high school ended. After our senior year we went our separate ways and stopped talking. But this didn’t bother me, I hadn’t time to waste when I was busy with my roses.


In college I had been taking Art classes in my third semester when I got a call one evening informing me that my mother had pasted away in the hospital. 
The following Tuesday we attended her funeral. My father had picked out the colors. We buried my loving mother in pink roses, because she was a former cancer survivor, and we were blessed to have her as long as we did.
For the months following my mother’s death I became deeply depressed. The only thing that eased the pain from losing my mother, were the roses. When they bloomed in the spring my sprits suddenly lifted. The roses were my life, and I don’t know what I’d do without them. 


2 years go by and I ended up meeting a nice guy who joined my ecology class. His name was Dylan and we immediately hit it off. He gave me everything a girl could’ve ever wanted and treated me like a princess. I loved him more than anything in the world. We talked about moving in together and buying a house after college. We talked about getting married and having a daughter named Rose for my love of roses. His handsome blonde hair and chiseled feature would make a beautiful baby.


We went through college and eventually graduated together and got married. We lived in a small townhouse in Vermont for a long time after that. After trying many times to have the baby I so desperately wanted, the doctor came to tell that I was infertile. Dylan tried to tell me we could always adopt, always have a child if I wanted, but I didn’t. It wasn’t fair! If I couldn’t have a child that was my own flesh blood, how would she share the love of roses like my mother did with me? 


Again for a long time I became mute. I could not eat or sleep. Dylan became very distant and we hardly spoke. Everything we had was gone. Nothing made me happy anymore. Nothing would until I had a baby rose. I would look out at our garden and wait for them to bloom, but even then the roses did not make me happy. 


It was the next winter before I found out. I knew something had gone wrong because all of the roses had turned over black instead of falling off and dying. Dylan had come home late that night and seemed very stressed. I decided that night while he slept I’d go through his phone. 


He had 3 missed calls and a text from a girl named “Lisa”. The text read:
“You HAVE to stay home tonight! She won’t stop crying unless you’re here! –Lisa”
Who wouldn’t stop crying? Did someone care that much about my dear Dylan to cry when he’s not there? I remember him saying he worked at the office with a girl named Lisa, so I decided to send her a text replying, “Get her to stop crying, I can’t be that important.” 


After that I waited for a reply for several minutes before I got a reply back.
“Of course you’re important to her love! You’re her daddy! And she needs you here! Just take off work this one night!”


WORK? SHE though HE was at WORK? He was supposed to be at work all day! And WHO’S daddy was she talking about? 


I carefully went through his address book in his phone and found her home address. I silently walked downstairs, and out the door, grabbing a hoe from the garden before leaving in the car.


I knew the black roses meant something was wrong. 


I returned a few hours later with his “baby” in our car. I left her there while I waited behind the house. About an hour later I see Dylan walk out the front door to leave, when he suddenly stops when he sees the child in the car with the windows up. 
He screams “ALLISON!” 


Is THAT the things name? So it IS his! At this point I was furious! 


As he went to unlock the door to retrieve the child, I pulled him backwards so he fell into the garden. I picked up the hoe and shouted “ALL I WANTED WERE THE RED ROSES!”


The hoe dug into his head once, and I felt all the love I’d ever had for him release, into the small, tiny bits of pieces that were once my loving husband. When I was all through I tossed his body into the cellar along with his companion’s. At least now the black roses are blood red once again.


 A beautiful thing, the roses are. 


Little rose lives with me now and she has just enrolled in preschool. She loves the roses as much as I do, but her favorite ones are the dead petals. 


“So pretty!” she said, “Even after they’re dead!” 


I always agree with her on that. Sometimes she asks where daddy is and I must tell her, “Simple, Prim Rose, ask the petals!”

I froze as soon as I looked towards the front of the house. I saw something short, maybe 2-3 feet walking on two legs. It was walking in the direction of my porch or front of the house. I thought it was kinda strange since I live out in the suburbs and something like this would easily be noticed by any of my neighbors. The funny part is we both made eye contact, it noticed that I was looking straight at it. As soon as it did it ran away, and I ran after it. When I turned the corner there was nothing. I ran around the whole house just in case it was running circles around my house. Nada. So yeah I saw that once. No biggie since I havent seen it again or it hasnt messed with my garden.

cmd102,4,,4,1r2xzg,,21," unexplainable experiences are not completely abnormal for me. Every house or apartment that I've lived in, I've seen or heard something that would make a lot of people hide under a blanket or leave the house all together. The man at my window was one story of mine that never fails to make whoever I tell shudder, so I figured I'd share it here.

It began when I was 7 or 8 years old. We lived in an older house, but not one that would instantly stand out as ""creepy"" or ""unusual"". We didn't live in the middle of nowhere, but rather on a street lined with houses on both sides of the road. It was a fairly quiet neighborhood, the kind where the rare car that came down the street would often break up a game of football or hockey that was being played by the kids that inhabited almost every house. It wasn't perfect, but it was great. I was a very happy child. 

One night, I was plagued by a very odd, yet equally terrifying nightmare. I dreamt that I was in my bed, in the room that I shared with my older sister. I sat up and looked out of the window that was next to my bed, which sat in the one corner of my bedroom flush against the wall. The window overlooked the back yard, and in that yard stood a man. He wore a long black coat, a wide-brimmed black hat that hid his face from me, and a black suit. On his shoulder, there sat a very large black bird with red eyes. I stared at him for what seemed like forever, before he looked up at my window. The only features of his face that I could see were his eyes, which were a deep red, just like the bird's. Just as he made eye contact with me, the bird left his shoulder and flew straight at my window. When the bird got to the point where it would have inevitably smashed through the window and probably eaten me, I woke up. I was on my side, facing my sister's bed that was situated in the exact same position as mine, but on the opposite side of the room. I stared at her as she slept soundly, terrified and unable to go back to sleep. I decided that the only way I would get any rest was by looking out my window and proving to myself that the man wasn't really there, so I rolled over and sat up. My curtains were already pulled to the sides of the window, since my bedroom was on the second floor of a house in a decent neighborhood,  we didn't really worry about anyone trying to peep on my sister and me. The second I looked at the window, he was there. Even though he was impossibly directly outside my window,  close enough that he should have left fog with his breath, I still couldn't see any features of the man's face except his blood red eyes. I did what many children would do, I laid back down and threw my blankets over my head. I eventually fell back asleep, despite being scared out of my mind.

The man visited me several times a month for several years after that, always just staring at me through my window during the darkest parts of the night. When my sister moved out, I started sleeping in her bed,  across the room and away from the window. I didn't see the man anymore. 

One day, I was cleaning my room in preparation for my friend to sleep over that night. I knelt on my old bed, still there for when we had guests,  to clean the window. I pulled the curtain aside (as a teenager now, I valued my privacy), and saw a handprint on the glass. It was bigger than my own, but I didn't think anything of it. I had assumed one of my friends had left it there. I sprayed the cleaner and wiped it away with the paper towel, but the handprint remained. A little grossed out, I went over it again, a little harder to scrub the print away. It was still there. That was when I realized that, despite not seeing him anymore, I still received visits from the man with the red eyes. The hand print was on the outside of the window.",the man at my window,25,nosleep

I just kept clicking through - that was my greatest vice. I could have let it rest. But with every story, my blood pumped faster, my breath came quicker.

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

My stomach is in knots, every heartbeat a hammer blow against my sternum. My hands are shaking. My breath comes in stecatto bursts. I can't hold on much longer. The anticipation is mounting, building to orgasmic frenzy. I found it, the ultimate high. Or rather, it found me. All I had to do was believe. All I have to do is turn around.

My faith is sure, and I know it with every fiber in my being:

This night, I had a friend over. It's not related to the woman or this story at all - it was planned much earlier. I needed some help with my new place so she'd help me and sleep over because we had no idea how much time it would really take.

She had to leave really early, before 7 AM, so I thought I can just sleep until 7 and then go.

But as soon as she went out, I felt something weird. As if there's someone still with me. Someone watching me. I just knew someone is there.

Kind of like when I lived with my parents and I just KNOW they're here even though the door of my room is closed. And I know so I have to get up and check.
That's how it was. 

So I got up to check. Nothing, I couldn't see anything but I could still feel it. I figured the feeling would go away when I look around the apartment and see that there's nothing there. It didn't. It just felt like I was chasing after something and it kept getting away. Like when you try to hold onto something really slippery. 

I felt helpless and very hopeless in that moment. It was much deeper than just not being able to find something I felt was there - it was just an in-general feeling of misery and despair, not related to something specific. 

So I figured maybe I was just getting sick, maybe I was too tried, too stressed, maybe it's really nothing, and I went back to bed. I fell asleep really quickly. 

Then the doorbell rang, I woke up. It felt like I slept for hours and hours, but in reality it was only like 6 or 7 minutes. I went to open the door, guess who it was? The woman.

Yeah, I was terrified and for a moment I thought - I'm done. It's over. Byebye cruel world.

It  wasn't  regular fear, like you'd be afraid when you know there's a reason to, like a gun pointed or an angry dog. It was more like fear of the dark, you don't really know what exactly you fear but it's still scary.

And just to make it clear, once again - she doesn't LOOK scary. She looks normal.
She speaks in a normal tone, with a normal voice. But there's just something about her that makes me want to get away, but in the same way intrigues me - I feel that I HAVE to know.

So I was really holding back the ""what the fuck are you doing here you mad bitch"" rant that was forming in my mind, I just greeted her instead because seriously, what good could come out of getting pissy? Not like that would help now.

She says hi. I'm like uh,umm, yeah, hi. And then she tells me she just wanted to visit me to see how am I doing, how's life, etc, etc. So I'm like wtf, you saw me yesterday and the day before, and the day before. She ignores me. She asks to come in but I tell her I was just planning to get out, I have things to do so  I wouldn't be a good host right now. She says she doesn't mind it all. I say I feel embarrassed about having such a messy home. Maybe when I fix it. I know  she knows I'm lying. But I just HAVE to say that. I can't tell her the truth. She just walks in and I immediately escort her out.

And the truth is, I just DON'T want her in. I can't let  her. I know she can't do anything more than she could do in the hallway, or from the door, or in the park, or in an alley, or anywhere else really, but I just didn't feel like letting her in (and still don't). I know it was rude as fuck but so is trying to force someone to let you in their house at 7 in the morning.

She keeps trying to get me to make her coffee or breakfast or something. And the pushier she gets, I get less afraid, more angry. She then asks me about my old town, my friends, family, my new friends, my new place, what am I planning to do here. I don't tell her shit, I just ramble about unspecific things, getting more and more angry. 

She makes me feel dizzy. Not in a Oh-so-nice-and-cute way. In a very bad way. In a I-could-pass-out-or-even-die way.

Somehow I get through the conversation, and then she just suddenly stops talking and stares at me. ""You're really not going to let me in?"" I explain to her, again, that I'm going out now and the place is a mess.
So she glares at me and nods. ""Alrightttt"".

I really thought she was going to attack me - I was really waiting for her to try to hit me or stab me or whatever.

But she turns around, then she turns back to me and says ""See you soon. Maybe I'll come again tomorrow."" I tell her it'd be better if she just lets me invite her when I'm ready for visitors, when I can actually provide a good stay for a guest.
""But *friend's name* stayed the night?""
I get terrified again - bitch how the fuck do you know, but I just say that friend is helping me with the apartment.

She nods again. And then she says bye, see you. And walks away. Turns around once again, stares at me, and says ""I still can't figure it out. That's why I just have to come back, like you had to interrogate me at the park."" And then walks down the stairs. I try to stop her, but she ignores me. Won't talk anymore.

Now the thing is, nothing about her, except the knowing my great-grandmother part, seems supernatural, otherwordly. She seems like a silly, but creepy lost cause. And if it wasn't for my grandmother's warnings and the woman claiming to know Magdalena, I'd even consider her a cute wackadoodle. But I still have NOTHING to explain WHY my grandmother appears to fear this woman and NOTHING to explain HOW could she, a woman that looks not a day older than 30, have known my great-grandmother that died over 30 years ago.",Who is this woman ?

-----

For several years now I've had this story inside me like lead shot in my gut. I've considered telling it hundreds of times over, but the sheer magnitude of it has always stopped me. With six months of therapy under my belt, I figure it's time. I know now that I won't be free of this thing until I write it out. Settle in, because I can't tell this story in ten thousand characters or less. I'll be lucky to get through it in twice or three times that. It's hard enough to sum up everyday life, and this story is anything but.

I had a recurring dream when I was really little. I would wake up in the dream, and standing beside my bed was the most beautiful lady I had ever seen. Long, straight hair and long, flowing gown, both of the purest silver like captured moonlight. She would smile at me so sincerely, so lovingly, as she sat down beside me and began to speak.

The words were comforting like a lullaby, but I couldn't understand them. Though she spoke quietly, her voice seemed to echo through the room, through the universe, backwards and forwards in time, begging to be understood by my adolescent brain.

I always tried to stay in the dream as long as I could, but eventually I would drift back off to sleep in the dream and wake up to my mom gently rousing me for breakfast.

My mom died when I was seven, and the dreams stopped. Well, I prefer to say she died. She was murdered. I hate that word. It's so cold; it falls off the tongue like shards of glass.

My mom was a health nut; protein shakes, weight lifting, yoga, the whole lot. Above all, she loved to jog. We had several acres of untamed land around the house. She always woke me up about an hour before dad went to work so she could go take a forty-minute run through the forest and along the creek; it befell dad to make me breakfast and get me ready for school.

They found her by the lake south of the house. And hanging from the old weeping willow in the middle of the pasture. And scattered across the countryside in a ten-mile radius around the house - but that was mostly after the funeral. All told, the casket had about two-thirds of a person inside when we finally buried her. They never found her head.

We used to be a close family - me, my sister, my mom and dad ... Losing mom, and losing her the way we did, splintered us. Dad lost himself in his advertising job. My sister turned inward, and fell into drugs and alcohol, when the kids our age figured out how to get ahold of it. Besides his job, dad's other mission was to keep his girls safe from all harm, and he took that one even more seriously. Leanna got it a little easier since she was four years older. I was taken out of school. Dad hired a tutor to homeschool me. I wasn't allowed out after dark. I wasn't allowed out without supervision. Unless I was being taken to town for some reason, I wasn't allowed to range out of eyesight or earshot of the house.

I started writing obsessively. Mom taught me how to keep a journal as soon as I could hold a crayon. I still have my very first one; the pages are filled with scribbles in different colors, and some pages are nearly colored solid. I guess I thought that good writing should fill as much of the page as possible. I remember how unabashedly delighted mom was to see every single entry. I guess writing is my way of honoring her memory.

I took mom's death hard, but it was a long while before I really understood what it meant that mom was killed. Dad told me that a very bad man had taken my mom from us, that she was dead, that she'd never come back. All things considered, he handled that conversation pretty well. Nothing could have softened the blow, though. My mommy was gone. I loved her and wanted her, but I'd never see her again. She was dead, and death meant people were gone forever. We weren't a religious household, so at that young age I was coming to grips with the fact that mom didn't exist anymore. There was a hole in my world. It was like that feeling when you go to grab something like a can of Coke without looking at it, and you end up swiping at the air because that can wasn't where you expected it to be.

I healed in time. For several years I was just chugging along, going through the motions, numb to the outside world. Closing myself off was easy; the outside world mainly consisted of our house and the clearing around it. My dad was mostly an authoritarian figure when he was home, always vigilant but never available. My sister babysat me when dad was gone, though she usually left me entirely to my own devices. She was homeschooled too, but she could drive; sometimes she would simply leave me at the house and go off to do Big People stuff. 

That Big People stuff, as I've written, consisted mainly of shooting up with her friends, or scoring more dope.

She had been chasing her high for ten years straight when I turned eighteen. Leanna had been living with her junkie boyfriend for a couple years. She was never able to hold down a job for very long, so she would spread her legs for a dealer until he let her move in. That was how she kept up her habit. When that didn't work out, she'd beg dad for more money and find another dealer to fuck.

It was a miserable, shady life for her, and she would have kept going until it killed her. And it did.

-------

My dad got the call at four in the morning on a Tuesday. I remember waking up, bleary-eyed, to see him looking like death warmed over. I had only seen that tortured look on his face once before, and I shot straight up, wide awake, when I saw it that night.

""Leanna,"" I said.

He nodded. My heart sank into my stomach and stopped beating. She was living in the city, a forty-minute drive away. A long, miserable forty-minute drive away. Neither dad nor I spoke a word. He sat stoically, knuckles white on the wheel, crying silently. I might as well have been dead myself. I stared at my lap, taking in nothing, thinking nothing, feeling nothing. Where my heart had been was a gaping hole.

Dad led me by the hand into the funeral home, and sat me down in a chair where I waited motionlessly as he went to identify the body. I heard his wracking sobs as he came back to get me some time later. I reflexively turned towards the sound. The funeral director and another man were practically holding him upright as he stumbled across the lobby. They took me up and walked us to a private area with a couple of couches, where we both collapsed.

I sat on the couch, mindlessly pulling at my hair, gazing at my father as he poured out his grief. He had always been a reserved man, but the dam had finally broken. We had no family but ourselves. Mom had grown up in a foster home, and had no love for the people she called her ""fake parents."" My biological grandma had a stroke and passed in her sleep. My grandpa followed not long after, as old widowers are wont to do. I never knew either of them. If we had any extended family, we never knew them.

I half-noticed the little hank of hair tangled around my hand. I hadn't felt it when I ripped it out.

Dad cried for a long time, eventually slumping sideways into his couch. When his voice was gone and his sobs came without tears, he stood up. He seemed to be carrying the weight of a thousand suns on his shoulders. At his slight nod in my direction, I stood up myself, and we walked together to the car. He pulled out a rumpled piece of paper and his phone, and dialed a number. We were at a motel fifteen minutes later. We went to sleep in our clothes.

The next few days were a blur. There were arrangements to be made, and that was dad's job. I went to town and bought us clothes and toiletries to keep us going while we stayed at the motel.

The funeral was a small affair back home. We laid her to rest in the plot next to mom's. Dad and I were the only mourners. A minister said some words, we each tossed a handful of dirt on the grave, and it was over. It was over.

-----

We stepped through the doorway and into our home. Quiet pervaded the empty space, the sort of quiet only found indoors. Clocks ticking, a gentle hum from our air conditioner, our breathing and the stecatto hitches as one or the other of us suppressed a sob.

We stood alone in an empty house, our bodies kept upright through some force of habit or instinct in the absence of warm blood flowing through our veins. My sister had imparted some vitality into this place, unbeknownst to us, even after our mother's murder. As our Leanna died, so died the house. I might have turned to see the land itself had withered, without so much as a shrug.

Dad pulled the door shut, and the click of its latch, impossibly loud against the quiet, signaled the start of our new life, or merely the end of the old.

I glanced at the clock: almost noon. The gears in my brain began turning, cast about for something to fill the time until bed, and found nothing. It then latched on to the only activity left, and my feet carried me to the stairs with sliding steps. They balked briefly, as if puzzled by a reason to lift off the ground more than half an inch, and then continued. A minute later, I fell backwards, collapsing onto my purple comforter. My toes brushed the carpet from time to time, but that didn't matter. Nothing did. Apathy sang me a lullaby, and the world faded away.

My staggered footsteps echoed through the tunnel, meshing with the steadfast crashing of many feet behind me. Searing hot agony blazed through my side. I had to keep running, I had to reach the end before -

I snapped upright, eyes unfocused, drenched in sweat. I bent forward reflexively and threw up bile into my lap. I sobbed, and choked on my own vomit. I coughed until my throat was raw, until the vessels in my eyes popped, and then collapsed sideways.

Good morning, world.

quietgrl,12,,7,1rchof,,20,"I had moved to Minnesota months ago, in order to get away from some strange phenomenon happening to me in Philadelphia since May 2013. I don't know what to call these things... ghosts, phantoms, spirits? However, my friends and family aren't judging my experiences as real accounts of the paranormal, they believe that I'm slowly losing my mind. And sometime... I wonder if that's the case too, if I'm simply falling into to some form of schizophrenia. 

I decided to share my stories here, so maybe I wouldn't have to feel much like a freak or that I'm going crazy. Or maybe I just don't want to feel alone with this. 

Well, I had a week to relax again, without anything strange happening to me. However, I had that feeling again that things weren't over and was just getting started. I am anxious all the time, ready for the next creepy thing to happen to me, and I'm not even sure if I can call my life “living” anymore. I rarely sleep, I barely function at work, and I'm losing a lot of weight from the lack of eating. 

My only distraction these days seem to be stupid videos on the web and chatting with the cute neighbor named Charlie. I don't share with him about my “experiences”, because I don't want him to look at me with those same pitying eyes that my friends and family give me.

Although last week, I did dare to ask Charlie if he had noticed anything strange in the neighborhood. He gave me a funny and confused look and I had to try my best to explain what I was asking, without really explaining the truth of my situation. “Oh,” I said, waving my hands as if the movements would untangle my nervous words, “You know... I mean, do you notice anything weird or any weird stories from others in the neighborhood?” I was trying to figure out if I was the only person who had a ghost following them.

“No.” Charlie said, shaking his head slowly in thought. And then his baby blue eyes lit up, “Well, yeah! If you mean if there are any weirdos here, yes we have a few, like anywhere else. I am a bit weird, for example.” “Nah.” I blushed towards him, “You're not weird at all. You seem very normal to me.” And very cute, I wanted to add, but I kept that thought to myself. 

Well, after a while of nothing happening to me, I didn't exactly catch onto the next bizarre incident right away. 

It must have been nearly 3am in the morning, when I heard a man singing loudly outside, “If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe... I'd been married a long time ago! Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?” At first, I was a lot annoyed for having my sleep disturbed by the most unlikely song, but then it was kind of funny that someone really seemed to like this song and thought it was a good idea to bellow it early in the a.m. 

Then another thought came to me, that it may be the voice of Charlie, proving me wrong about my earlier opinion that he wasn't weird. It sounded a little like his voice and I couldn't help but wonder if he was drunk off his ass and having a bit of fun tonight. I rushed from my bed and peered out the window, my eyes slowly adjusting to the darkness outside. The only thing I could see was a shadowed figured of a man, non descriptive, as he shambled towards the direction of the pathway between my house and Charlie's.

I giggled to myself, before heading back to sleep, knowing that I would tease the guy tomorrow about his choice of song. I slept peacefully, as the night faded back into silence. 

The next day, I did run into Charlie, a silly grin on my face. I told him how I spotted him in a chorus of Cotton Eyed Joe, stumbling towards his house, at 3am in the morning. He gave me the most confused lemon face that I ever saw on a man and replied, “Well, I don't know who you saw, but it wasn't me. For one thing, I was asleep at that time, dead to the world. And second of all, I hate that song! I don't even know all the words to it, let along could sing the chorus.”

“Hmm.” I said, a bit confused now, because I swore it was his voice that I had heard. “Hey,” he smirked, “I did tell you that we have some weirdos among us, right? It was probably Mr. Roy, who lives about two houses down from us. All he ever does is drink and he only seems to leave his house during the night to avoid conversation and eye contact with any of the neighbors. I wouldn't be surprised if he had a few too many last night.”

I agreed with that explanation for the time being, but I wondered if Charlie was somehow covering up an embarrassing moment that I had caught him in. 

The next night, the singing happened again, this time at 2am with a loud chorus of, “Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?” I rushed to the window and again I could only see a shadowed figure, shambling towards the pathway and disappearing around the corner leading to the front of the houses.

I felt uneasy about the movement of the shadow, as it didn't seem exactly like a human's walk at all, and very unlikely for even a drunken one. It was a combination of stops and jerks forward, like someone moving a puppet on a string. And sometimes the shadow seemed to jerk too far ahead, causing the figure to appear a couple of feet in the matter of a blink. I wasn't sure if I was just overly tired and seeing things or maybe not. I decided to go back to sleep and forget about it.

The next night, I was awaken by the man singing the song loudly again, this time at 1am. I had left my floodlight on before bed, a light that illuminates my driveway. I eagerly peered out of the window, hoping to see the guy's face this time, whether it would be Charlie's or the weird neighbor's. This time, the figured shambled directly in the path of the bright light and still his face was nothing but a shadow. There was no hint to any of its features, just a shadowed figured that belted out, “Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?”

I was frighten, shutting my curtains, and hiding under my blankets. I slept with my bedroom lamp on for the rest of the night, just like a little kid. Later in the day, I asked Charlie if he heard the singing man last night or any time this week. He did not. And again, I felt as If I may be hallucinating these things.

Last night, I heard the man singing again, this time at 12 midnight. And I refused to leave my bed and look out there, not wanting to see that shadowed figure shambling by, moving many steps ahead in the matter of seconds. I figured, it was all in my mind, that it would go away if I just ignore it. That's when I heard the creak of one of my floorboards at the end of my bed.

I sat bolt upright and could see the shadow standing at the foot of my bed. Its darkness seemed to stand out much bolder than the darkness of the room, a silent silhouette of a man, who just stood there and said nothing for a while. I was too afraid to move or to call out to my sister who was asleep in the nezt room. I just stared at the figure, barely breathing, waiting for it to move or flinch.

In a voice that was deep and demonic, it sang out, “Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?”

At that moment, I lost my shit and began to scream, as I flipped out of my bed and hit the floor with a huge thump. I began to crawl my way towards the door of my room, but that thing... it grabbed my ankle and began pulling me back towards it! I kicked, flailed around on the floor, and cried out, “No, no, no, no! Let me go!”

My sister burst into the room,flipping on the lights, her eyes wild and her voice wavering, “What's happening?!” The shadow man was gone and I broke out into tears, still very afraid but so relieved that it wasn't there anymore. After some moments of hysterical sobbing, I was able to tell my sister what had happened. I thin this time, she believed me.

I don't know if the whole thing was just a horrible nightmare or if I'm somehow hallucinating. However... that grab from the shadow man felt a lot real. I can still feel the memory of that grip on my ankle, a rough and cold hand, that eagerly wanted to pull me in towards it. I can't sleep with the light off now...",Cotton Eyed Shadow,27,nosleep
Mrreeburrito88,14,,6,1r1tik,,19,"I don't know if this counts as a lucid dream or not but I have been having the same time of dream for a number of years and it has always managed to freak me out. I don't know where else to post this so if I could get some insight on I would be get grateful. 
How it starts is that I am laying in my bed and I am slightly awake but I cannot move or speak. I can how ever see what is going on so there is that. While in my bed it feels like I have a huge weight on me and I cannot move. I do however, try to edge myself over to side of the bed in hopes of waking up because I don't want to feel that way anymore. 
There has been one time where I woke up several times on to be slammed back down onto my bed. That time managed to freak me out so much that I ran out of my apartment and did not return until later that day. Another time I felt as though I was dragged off my bed and dragged down a hallway that seemed like it was at an elementary school only to never reach the end. 
I thought it was a ghost, for lack of a better terms, for awhile but I could not gather enough evidence to prove it. I do not rule it out though. I have had not physical harm come to and it happens so often sometimes that I end up ignoring it and just get annoyed by it. Oh I almost forgot that this usually happens from 12-4 am if that makes any differences. I have wanted to film myself and maybe record what I might say during these happenings. That may give more insight on it.

Myzrath,5,,8,1r5zd8,,17,"I came from a universe where things twisted and changed at the mercy of my infinite will. But here everything was the same. Every day I awoke encased in meat, trapped in the same skin I’d loathed for so long. I interacted with the same people I hated, and wondered why I couldn’t have been born across the ocean. My will and infinite vision was no use here: No matter how vivid my dreams were, they were meaningless and intangible. I spend endless nights staring at the mist and midnight skies, longing to revert to my true form. I dreamed of another existence that was so real, so overpowering that it choked out this disappointing joke  you call reality. Things are woven into the fabric of your world that you will never see or comprehend. And I longed to see them again.


I came from a place where I never had to question sanity, because there was no such thing. There was only the boundless infinity of thoughts. I was nothing, yet I was everything. I had no body and I had no pain. For vast, uncounted ages I soared through the bleak darkness of space, savoring the isolation and the pain it brought. My soul was seared by the fire at the hearts of stars, and my dreams were inspired by black holes sucking entire galaxies into oblivion. I wandered for eternity, but suddenly, it was over.


And I awoke in this prison of meat, wondering why the stars were so far away.


 I wondered why I had these new emotions, like hatred and longing. I was jealous of the other meat puppets for having better skins to walk around in. Or for living in a nicer house, or fucking a better looking slab of meat. Slowly I began to forget everything. And only in dreams can I remember true freedom: the boundless infinity where I once roamed as a collection of particles calls to me, and soon I will return.

I came from a dimension where my dreams, desires, and fears were nonexistent. I had no one to envy, no one to despise. I was a subatomic particle with the fury of a dying star, and now I’m trapped inside a walking corpse waiting to die.

The vomit had soaked through the covers, moistened my legs, and cooled by the time I decided to move. The clock read Too Early; I had slept for nearly sixteen hours. Whatever. Once my mouth was rinsed and the bedding had been bundled up and tossed in the laundry room, I padded into the main living room to watch infomercials.

Dad was up at six. I didn't notice him until he slumped back into the couch beside me. He was the first to speak.

""Morning,"" he said quietly.

""Mm,"" I agreed.

""How long have you been up?""

""Since four.""

""I came in to check on you several times. Looked like you were having nightmares.""

""Yeah.""

""You were crying. Tossing and turning. I tried to wake you up."" He pulled up the sleeve of his robe to show me some scratches. ""You, uh, thought I was a bad guy.""

My eyes misted up as I drew my knees up to my chest. Words began to spill out. ""I'm sorry --""

Dad cut me off. ""Shh. It's fine. I know you didn't mean it.""

His voice was so gentle. The authoritarian figure that had watched over me with a stern gaze was gone. The fierce strength behind his eyes was broken, and this man had no fire left. All at once, the protectve shell of numbness cracked and shattered. I wanted my daddy. Without a word, I crawled over and laid my head on his shoulder. Two weeks ago, this act would have been inconceivable. Two weeks ago, Leanna was alive. Some shred of rational thought in the back of my head noted with muted shock that the roles we had played every day were nothing more than an artificial construct, an act we played out every day.

Dad wrapped me up in his arms, and we cried together until I lost track of time altogether. Inevitably, the tears stopped flowing, though neither of us made a move away from the other for another hour. Who was left to prop the two of us up but each other? We sat watching infomercials, one after the other, neither of us really caring for anything but the hypnotic power of the glowing screen.

My stomach growled. I remembered that I hadn't eaten. In the same breath, I realized that my head was pounding. I clutched at my stomach.

""Eggs okay?"" my dad murmured.

I nodded, still bent over.

Dad lifted his arm from my shoulders and stood up. In the span of that motion, the weight fell on his shoulders again and he walked slowly to the kitchen.

I scarfed down the eggs unceremoniously and thanked my dad. After that, I retired to my room and spent most of the day at my writing desk, staring at a blank sheet of paper. I took regular breaks to stare out the window at the trees waving in the wind.

Eventually, the sun sank below the treeline, and I began nodding. As I did, my heart skipped a beat. Would I wake up tomorrow tangled in the sheets, fearing that unknown terror at my heels?

In the end, I told myself that it was irrelevant. Sleep is inevitable. I still couldn't shake the feeling of impending doom, that I might face that terror again. As I slipped under the covers, I cast about in my mind, looking for anything to ease my fear. A memory came, of a lady in silver. The dream I had when I was little. Suddenly I missed that lady. I couldn't recall her face, but the feeling she brought with her was clear as day when I thought about it. She made me feel safe, protected, warm.

Tears leaked from between my closed eyelids. I missed my mom. I missed my sister. I wished I could dream of that lady just one more time. Nothing was more important. I dwelt on her memory, and the aching desire for that little bit of relief spread through my body until I craved her like a starving girl that smelled pizza.

I fell asleep thinking of nothing else. And then I woke up.

She was standing at the edge of my bed, and she was beautiful, an angel wrought in the finest, purest of silver. And I did't hurt. I stared at her, and she was beautiful, and she returned my gaze, a quizzical look on her perfect face. And she was beautiful. Her hair and gown flowed behind her in slow motion, defying gravity. She opened her mouth as if to speak, then closed it and paused and lowered her gaze. Her eyes drifted back up to me, and ...

""Can you see me?"" Her voice was the choir of heaven, the sweet whispers of a thousand mothers cooing at their newborn children. It echoed through time and space, it echoed within my mind, and my heart lifted up higher, higher, until the echoes died away. I found myself smiling, tears of joy misting my vision, blurring it into a shine of silver against the darkness of my room.

I could only nod.

""You can understand me."" Her accent was stilted as though she was deaf; I got the feeling that speech was mostly unnecessary for her.

I collapsed as the sorrows, heartbreaks, and betrayals of my past bled from my soul, all at once. A moment later, I was at peace. I sat up in a fluid motion, turning to the silver lady before me.

""Yes. I was hoping I'd dream of you. I'm so glad you're here.""

""This is no dream.""

I laughed. ""How could this be anything else?""

""I do not know. But I promise. No dream.""

I considered this for a time while the lady waited, motionless save for her gown and hair. Some part of me knew that nothing this apparition would tell me would ever be a lie. Nevertheless ... ""Alright. I'll just stay up all night, then. That should make it pretty obvious."" I grew serious. ""Will you stay with me? Can anybody else see you?""

""You called me. Not sure how. Usually death calls me. But no one will die here. I don't understand. You know death. You should not see me now.""

My jaw would have been hanging open, except I seemed incapable of registering surprise that could overpower the warmth radiating from the ethereal lady in front of me. As it was, I responded, ""Hmm,"" a sound less consideration than contentedness. ""Well, what are you?"" I said, after a lengthy pause. She responded with a pause of her own, dropping her gaze and softly stroking her chin. And then, I felt a whisper in my mind, the gentlest touch of wind as something made its way inside. Her eyes lit up, and I felt her happiness. She could communicate without speaking, I suddenly knew, and this way was much faster, more precise. I tried to think back at her, and she didn't respond. A look of confusion passed across my face, and then I understood that I'd have to project myself back for two-way communication. Telepathy wasn't nearly overpowering as the sound of her voice, or maybe I didn't have anything left inside me to soothe and fix. I realized that I had a thousand questions, and we began to converse; to an observer, it would appear as though I was having half a phone conversation. I can only summarize our exchange:

She didn't seem to know what or who she was. She had no name. She simply popped into existence one day.

""What's your earliest memory?""

Dark-skinned, brutish people in caves. A woman being raped while her child watched. A fleeting moment, blurred, before her world became darkness, a state she termed sleep.

Holy shit.

She came and went, and sometimes she was in many places at once. Rarely she was everywhere. The last time that happened, she described lots of people starving or shooting at each other. Patches on shirts and overcoats: triangles and stars. The holocaust. She was everywhere then.

Holy shit!

My jaw was, in fact, hanging open now. ""You were everywhere? In the entire universe?""

No, not the entire universe. Just the earth.

""The oceans too? All the land?""

No. Only where there were people.

""Why do I feel so much better when you're around?""

She shrugged, lines of sadness creasing her face like cracks in polished diamond. The tragedy of her expression threatened to break my heart, as though I was watching a snake eat a kitten. Suddenly I saw myself as a child, myself and my mother. I knew this to be the last time I would see my mom alive. The silver lady was embracing her, weeping tears like liquid pearl. I could see a swirling darkness surrounding the two of them, there but not there. The more closely I examined the miasma with this second sight, the more sinister it became. I began to see through it, as though it was a portal to another dimension of gnashing, swirling teeth and rotting flesh. I felt a cold, alien intelligence invade my mind, and then I was a bug under a microscope. My mind was aflame with pain and disgust, pushing through the dull opiate warmth of the lady's protection. The demonic thing was plotting, yearning, and I could taste its desire with my own tongue. My vision began to fade to black, and I was immersed in inky, single-minded hatred of unfathomable depth. Time lost its meaning, and then I was back in my room, unsure if a second had passed or a century.

The lady nodded, filling my mind with her own, and I understood; I had seen the hunger in the world, a faceless, timeless entity whose only purpose is to consume and destroy. And before me stood the force of light.

Dawn broke through my window.

This might have been a bad idea, but I read about Astral Projection and started trying to practice it but I've had no luck.  But since then, I've been hearing things before I sleep and when I wake up.

A few weeks ago I started hearing the sound of boiling water coming from my kitchen in the middle of the night; after that it was quiet conversation; and after that it was the sound of a light switch being turned on and off.

In the mornings I hear scratching, and speaking and I can't pinpoint where it could be coming from.

What happened last night is what made me scared enough to write about this.  My eyes were shut as I was trying to fall asleep, and out of nowhere I heard typing on my keyboard, which is only a few feet from my bed.  I was too scared to open my eyes and look, so I acted like I was asleep.  This morning I saw a new icon on my desktop, it was a jpg, eventually I opened it and it was just black.

I remember a story arc in Grey's Anatomy, where the ghost of a doctor's dead lover followed her around and only she could see it. That's when I stopped watching the series.

I was eating cereal, watching reruns of Scooby Doo. I couldn't recall cereal ever tasting better, and I couldn't recall Scooby Doo ever being so entertaining. But that's how it goes when the embodiment of good is sitting beside you on the couch, giggling musically at the television. Today was a day of firsts for the both of us. Dad walked in at some point, looking haggard as I had ever seen him. His eyebrows shot up when he saw me curled up on the couch, neatly groomed and with color in my cheeks. I gave him a half-smile, equal parts enthusiasm and sympathy. Make no mistake; I hadn't forgotten my sister's death, but no therapy on earth could have matched the aura of the silver lady. I stood up smoothly, walked the three paces across the living room, and wrapped him in the biggest hug I could muster. He was apparently speechless, but when I looked up at him, I saw that the worry lines around his eyes had softened a little.

I reflexively looked back over my shoulder at the silver lady, and she expressed her joy at my desire to comfort my dad. I smiled at her, and then glanced back at my dad, who was looking at me quizzically now. I brushed my hair back over my shoulder and smiled at him again.

""We're going to be okay, Dad.""

He only nodded and wandered off. He had taken time away from work to grieve, and so he had not even dressed himself. In the silence that followed, I looked around. I had to laugh, and then I was shocked at the inappropriateness of my laughter. Sitting on the couch was a ghost that only I could see, a ghost that magically took away all my pain and trouble. Yeah, I must have snapped. Two deaths was one too many. My laughter had drawn the lady's attention. She looked at me and frowned a little. I shook my head at her, incredulous, and turned away. Things like this didn't just happen to people.

I was grateful, though; at least I didn't get the ghost of deathly melancholy or something. There wasn't much of an earthly nature that could upset me, with her around. That and the fact that I had an entire day to kill considered, I decided I might as well make the best of it. Everyone grieves in their own way, I suppose? Jurassic Park was showing, and I figured I'd go see it. The movie wasn't for several hours, though, and so I grabbed up my things and went for pancakes at IHOP. The silver lady sat across from me, and I couldn't help but laugh. The entire restaurant was going about its business, and yet, here sat a figure so obviously paranormal as to be hokey, like a ghost bride, her hair and gown blowing in a wind that only she could feel. She noticed my disdain and expressed a mild indignance within my mind. I shrugged it off and asked her what she could expect from me, but quickly shut my mouth and looked around when I realized that I looked like a total schizophrenic.

I still had an hour to kill after breakfast, so I decided to spend off some of my allowance; though it had been meagre from week to week, I had saved up almost a thousand dollars over my sheltered years. I drove down main street and visited several little boutiques, built into the slightly-renovated shells of old department stores and hotels from the town's conception way back at the turn of the century. Several tops caught my eye, and the lady waited patiently as I tried each one. I asked her what she thought of them from time to time, but she didn't seem to have an eye for clothes, having probably worn the same ghost dress for hundreds of millenia. I was just wrapping up at the last store, preparing to break another fifty dollar bill, when a little girl in front of me in line turned around.

She smiled wide and began tugging on the hem of her mom's skirt.

""Mommy! Mommy!""

""What is it, honey?"" the woman asked, a little exasperated but apparently feeling indulgent.

""She's so pretty, mommy!""

The mother looked at me and smiled, and I smiled back. ""Yes, she's very pretty, hon. Now come on, we've got to get to the bank."" She half-walked, half-dragged the girl out of the store; the girl's eyes were locked back over her shoulder, that cheesy grin still on her face.

I would have felt flattered, except the child wasn't looking at me. She was looking five feet to my left. Right where the silver lady was standing. My heart dropped right onto my stomach.

A sense of surprisingly smug satisfaction filtered through my mind simultaneously with a surge of grief and longing. Satisfied though she may have been about my reaction, the silver lady desperately wanted to follow the girl. Suddenly I was along for the ride, as the silver lady's desires became my own in our shared headspace. I paid quickly at the checkout counter and trailed along behind the mother and daughter as though in a daze. We walked out into the sunlight and I sneezed as my eyes adjusted. Their car was parked twenty paces from the store.

By the time I had halved the distance between us, they were pulling out. And then shrapnel was everywhere. I dropped to the ground reflexively and was peppered with safety glass. Truly in a daze now, I staggered to my feet and wandered, it felt, towards the smoking ruin in front of me. Their little blue sedan was wrapped around an old steel truck. I walked up to the passenger side window, got as close as I could despite the truck, and felt a warm breeze blow past me. The silver lady was in the car then, embracing the husk of what had just been an adorable baby girl.

Blood trickled from every orifice in her head. Her skull had split open from front to back, stretching her face oddly, and she was staring vaguely off into the distance, blinking out-of-sync, one eye and then the other. A couple arterial spurts sprayed the chrome bumper of the truck. One moment there was a girl fighting for life, and the next there was a life-sized gory mannequin.

I never got used to that part; when life leaves the body, the body ceases to be a person and becomes a shell, inanimate as though it never breathed or laughed or ate or drank.

Sound returned to the world, and I heard choking, gurgling screams. ""Oh my god, oh god no, my baby, oh god no."" My legs went out from under me. I sat down hard on pavement, kicked my legs until I bumped softly against the curb. The silver lady was crying again.

I don't know how long I sat there, but the next thing I knew, the street was lit up with red and blue lights. The din of sirens was crashing through my skull. I was nearest the crash when it happened, and so I had to give a statement. I must have done well enough at it, because the police let me go with the promise that I come in later to write everything out. The driver of the pickup was clearly drunk, and he must have been going twenty over the speed limit. I made my way back into the boutique with stuttered steps and asked for a phone. My dad was there in ten minutes flat.

I stared out the window blankly all the way home, held aloft solely by the presence of the silver lady. Dad tried to get me to speak several times, but his words were a dull chatter in the back of my mind. I closed my eyes as the tears began to roll down my cheeks. I curled up inside myself, and felt a welling spring of warmth rise inside of me as the tightness lifted from my chest. I fled into it, covering myself with the warming blanket of the silver lady's loving embrace like a child afraid of the dark. I breathed deep and opened my eyes. My gaze was drawn down to my own body. My skin had taken on a silver-white glow and an opalescence like polished marble.

I glanced over at my dad, wondering if he was seeing this. My heart skipped a beat as I took in the dark, sickly-hued vapor sticking to his skin like lake fog on a cold morning.

""Sarah? Sarah, what is it?"" he asked, seeing my face tight with shock and alarm. His voice was jarring; I could hear new and unfamiliar tones of worry and sadness layered within it. But I couldn't respond. I was busily looking around at the world, which had taken on an alien cast. The flora radiated crystalline hues and the sky boiled with color like something alive. I could see the air itself buzzing with activity.

""This is the true world,"" I thought to myself in a voice wholly not my own. ""We seem to have ... merged."" I felt my inner eye flipping through my memories and thoughts like the pages of a book, each moment replayed and recast in the new light of a foreign perspective. Simultaneously I felt my mind open to a tome of memories not my own, as though a hidden eye within me had opened for the first time. So much suffering, so much death. I was a failure. For aeons I had tried to stem the tide of pain and misery that ran rampant across the earth like a plague, but all my efforts amounted to a drop in the ocean.

I was being shaken. My mouth tasted of ozone. Dad had stopped the car, and I realized I was doubled over and screaming. Dad was near hysterics, trying to get a response from me. My voice, shaky and otherworldly inside my skull, said, ""Sick ... stomach. Home. Please, take me home.""

Benlightenment,1,,7,1r3pbk,,13,"So, my auntie used to work for a millionaire. Not the best kind though, the kind who got the millions by being lucky in the national lottery. He only won about 6 million or so, but it was enough to get him a fancy ass house, and to hire my aunt as a housekeeper/general helper woman.
His house was a kinda half-new project. There was an old bit of land with an old house sat on it just outside the city they lived in, which he bought up, and then built his house around that one. And then his garage, and a private gym... he wasn't clever with his money (and my aunt was stealing some too, which she went to prison for eventually, but that's another story).
So in the end, the guy pretty much bankrupts himself on silly business ventures and cars. He has to sell the house. At that point, I was staying with my aunt for a week or two for a little holiday, so she asked me if I wanted to come along while she had to clear some stuff out. Me, coming from a crappy little town, jumped at the chance to have a nosy around a millionaire's mansion.

Once we got there, my aunt took off into the kitchen, which is where Mr Millions was (his name was Lee, really). They basically said I can have a wander round, play on his Dreamcast (that was a mega thing for me at the time) and just don't mess around with stuff I shouldn't. Understandable.
So I wandered off, walked through a few of the mega living rooms with leather sofas and stuff. It was all pretty old, but I think that was more just because he'd bought it to look that way. I sat down and messed around on the Dreamcast for a bit, but got bored playing Quake and decided to go have another wander. He had a swimming pool, but I didn't have my trunks, so I was kinda lost for something to do. I figured I'd just go down the other end of the house where I hadn't been and see what else he had kicking around.

So, the house itself was a pretty standard layout. You know the mansion in Resident Evil 1? The entrance hall kinda looked like that, only it was dark colours and wood rather than white. Upstairs was basically just one long landing corridor which had loads of doors off it to bedrooms and stuff. At the very end was a double-door, which I'd never been through. Given the way the doors looked, I assumed they were part of the old house which he'd kept, so I went to have a look.

Inside was a pretty tiny room, considering the house. Probably could've fit two or three double beds in there at most. One side had a couple of armchairs and a little table, and the rest was like a little library, with a couple of bookcases free standing and the opposite wall to the chairs being a full bookcase wall, which was amazing to me at the time.
I figured there had to be something in here I wanted to read, so I went up along the wall of books just having a look what was there. It was all pretty standard stuff that you'd expect to buy just to fill up a bookcase. Dickens, Austen... that kinda stuff.

Now, from where I was, I couldn't see the doors anymore, cause the bookcases were in the way. So, not paying attention, when they slammed shut, I squealed like a girl and jumped almost out of my skin. Given the size of the house, I figured it was either the wind or someone closing the doors, not realising I was in here.

It wasn't, though. To this day, I still have no idea who did it (I say who rather than what, cause what is crazy) but both the doors were shut tight. But that wasn't the odd thing.
On the doorknobs was a book that had been placed there, balancing. So yeah, my gut is already going a bit weird at this point, cause that's just odd. The cover had bright colours though, so I assumed it was someone playing a prank. As I got close enough to read, I saw what it was: a kid's book. Innocent enough. Except for the title. 

“I See You”

It was some kind've of Peekaboo book for kids, but that didn't matter at the time. As soon as I read it, my blood froze and I ran out of there like a little bitch. 
I still don't know whether it was one of his family or not. The house has been pulled down since, though from what my auntie told me, the half that he built around is now a protected building, so it's still there, in pieces. 
She said it was haunted too, but that was only after I'd told her the story. It's about 10 years on now, and I still dunno what happened that day. Given that my aunt was thieving from the guy... it's not like I can ask him either.",The millionaire's library,20,nosleep
lamented_dreams,4,,8,1rgqu8,,14,"I love the dark. I really do.

I don't mean going gothic and pagan and all that, but I do like the dark. I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos, researching diseases and the supernatural, and writing stories.

Anyways, I've recently come across a quote from a game called 'Knock Knock'. And let me say, it's utterly terrifying for not just the player, but the watcher too. There's nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the game.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside."" —Knock Knock

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

DjFlamefist,14,,2,1reoey,,15,"So i was staying at my aunt's house because she was going away to Iceland for a couple of days, and i had to watch her dog for a bit. Poor bastard couldn't be left a lone, now could he? I have experienced minor things in that house before, like things vanishing and reappearing and things like that. I guess there could be some logical explanation to it, but i have always been sure there was something fishy going on in there. I wasn't afraid though, haven't had any ""problems"" before. At the third day, the day before they returned, it happened. Although it was a normal day, no problems what so ever, i heard someone ring the doorbell. I thought fo sure that this was my aunt returning early from the vacation for some reason, but it felt... odd. I brought her dog just to stay there for a second line of defense as i was opening the door (The dog was a basset hound for those who might wonder). I opened the door and i saw two weird guys there, they looked like they have come from a party or something, atleast they looked drunk. ""Hello"", i said in my own language ofcourse, didn't expect visitors from other countries. They looked weirdly at eachother, dog barking like flipping fuck at them. ""Is this Norway?"" they answered, Surely that must be a weird question to ask. ""Yes, i suppose so, where are you guys from?"" i answered, trying to be as polite as i could. ""Oh, nowhere, was just checking with ya'"" they said with a weird look on their face. ""Umm, do you need to borrow a phone or something? surely that must be the reason you are here?"" i said. ""Well, we were just checking with ya'"" they said, with the dog between my feet still barking like heck. They looked at eachother and left. They went about 8 meters away from the house as i was closing the door. Thought it'd be impolite not to say goodbye, so i opened the door again to ofcourse... say goodbye.
They weren't there. Nothing was there. Everything was as usual, the dog had stopped barking, and i was left with a question: Is this real?.

I am sure that they couldn't have gotten more than 2 meter away from their spot while i reopened the spot, even if they ran at full speed. Even then i would have seen them. What do you think happened, people of reddit? could it really be some logical explanation for this?",I might have encountered a ghost.,17,nosleep
funnyguy135,2,,5,1r3dcj,,13,"When I was younger may family moved around a lot.  One of the places that we lived in was a town in New Jersey.  We were only there for about 1 year but the events that occurred will leave a lasting mark on me for a life time.  In order to protect the identity of people names will be changed.

During the summer when I was around the age of 13 my family moved to New Jersey.  Upon moving I quickly befriended my neighbor, James.  James and I began hanging out a lot and soon he started introducing me to some of his friends.  I soon became friends with these people and joined their little friend group of 4.  Pretty soon school started up again and I began meeting fellow class mates.  I made a few new friends but I mostly stuck with James and those people.

One day during school I left class to go to the bathroom.  Upon entering I noticed that someone had clogged the sink with paper towels and turned on the water.  Luckily I got there before the water started flooding over so I turned it off, cleaned up the sink and went about with my business.  When I got back to class I told Henry (one of the people in my friend group) about what someone had did.  He began to chuckle and told me I was funny.  I asked what he meant and he turned to me looking confused.  He asked, ""Wait, you don't know?""  I said I didn't know what he was talking about and he told me he would explain after school.

At the end of the day I went to go meet Henry so that he could explain to me what he was talking about.  I walked outside and saw James, Henry and Tim (the other member of the group) waiting for me.  I asked what was going on and they said they would explain.  They told me that about 5 years after the school was built, before any of us were born, a boy had been killed in the bathroom that I had used earlier.  They told me that he was being bullied and the bullies thought it would be funny to give the kid a swirly (a swirly is where you hang a kid upside down, put his head into the toilet and then flush it).  Any way what the bullies did not expect to happen was the kid to drown.  The bullies thought he was just being a pussy so they left him on the ground.  The body was later discovered later in the day when another kid went to use the bathroom and saw that he was not breathing.  The bullies got into some huge shit and were expelled and got into some trouble with the law.  After that there had been strange occurrences of toilets or sicks being clogged, strange noises being heard, toilets flushing on their own or even for some people seeing a little boy soaking wet standing in the middle of the bathroom.  The school had been putting it off as tricksters trying to scare younger kids but people honestly believed what they saw.  At the end of the story I told my friends that they were bull shitting me but when they kept trying to convince me so I got frustrated and went home.

The next day in the school the guys were still on me about the whole murdered kid and how he haunts the bathroom.  I didn't believe a word of it and started to get really mad at them.  We got into a fight and I didn't speak with any of them for a while.  About a month after our fight Henry left to go use the bathroom.  He was gone for 20 minutes and the teacher asked me to go check up on him.  I agreed and left go see what was wrong.  I walked into the bathroom and saw no sign of Henry but only a small puddle of water on the ground.  I figured that this was just some elaborate trick that the guys had set up to try and scare me.  I started saying out loud, ""Really funny Henry but you can come out now cause what ever you're trying to do is not working.""  Thats when I heard a slight whimper coming from one of the stalls.  I opened it to find Henry curled up in a ball on the ground soaking wet.  I knelt down and started shaking him and yelling for him to get up but all he did was lay there whimpering and slightly rocking back and forth.

I ran to go get a teacher and then brought her back to the bathroom.  When we arrived Henry was no longer curled up in a ball but now standing up in front of one the mirrors just staring into it.  The teacher ran over and asked what was wrong but he just stood there staring.  She started to pull him away and he look at her and said, ""No...I need to stay...he told me to stay...that i'm going to join him.""  The teacher asked who told him to stay and then after another second of silence Henry burst into tears and said, ""The boy...the boy tolled me.""  For about the next week Henry did not show up in school and James, Tim and I got worried so we went to visit him at home.  When we got there his mother answered the door and when we asked how he was she said that all he does is stay up in his room and when ever they asked him to leave his face changed and he said he was to afraid.  We went up to see him and when we got up there all he did was look up at us and then look back down at the floor.  We asked how he was doing and he didn't answer.  After a few minutes of silence Tim blurted out, ""So what happened Henry?""  James and both gave him a nasty look and he just shrugged.  Henry looked up at us and said that he saw him.  We asked what he was talking about and he said he saw the boy.  That they had stared at each other for about 20 minutes before the boy started walking towards him saying that he had to stay with him and join him.  Henry started to back away but that only angered the boy as he lunged at Henry.  Henry said that he was all of the sudden drowning in the toilet and he heard his name called and so he sat up and then collapsed to the floor.  I then entered the stall and tried to get him and the rest we already knew.  We all sat there in silence before with out a word got up and left.

Henry stopped coming to school and after a few months we heard that he had moved away.  We stopped talking about him because we refused to believe what he had told us.  As the school year came to a close my parents informed me that we were moving again.  I was upset because I would be leaving my friends but also slightly relived.  I stayed in touch with James and Tim but over the years we grew apart and the whole long distance thing stopped working.  The last I had spoke to them they said that they hadn't seen or spoke to Henry since that day we all went to see him.  I hadn't seen Henry either but to be fare I was purposely trying to avoid him.  I grew up and one day while reading the paper I saw a story about a man who had drowned in his own home.  His name was Henry Goldmen.  I figured that this couldn't be the Henry that I knew so long ago.  But there is still apart of me that wonders that maybe Henry was telling the truth and maybe what ever tried to kill him the first time waited years before trying again but this time it succeeded.

The_John_Deere,11,,14,1r800l,,14,"I thought i would be safe from stuff like this, that these sorts of things wouldnt happen to me for a long time. Honestly, I didn't. Hell, I especially didnt expect it to be at school. 

I've dealt with ghosts before, more than I can count. I can normally help when people have problems with the paranormal, but now I'm the one in need of help.

I assume many of you remember u/inaaace's stories about Rose and the orange, correct? How could you not, that was one of the biggest things on this sub all year. This encounter/series of encounters is like that.

It started about a month ago. I'd have a dream that I wouldn't remember, and then at random points in the day I'd remember having that in the dream. Every day more and more instances of déjà vu would happen. This week has been the worst. I remembered my dream on Wednesday, and everything tht happened Wednesday I knew would happen, like us having a substitute in French, a pop quiz in Trigonometry, and a surprise workout at Track.

Last night, I thought I had a normal dream. Just regular stuff. Until *she* showed up.

This girl has bothered me sine freshman year. She's a bit of a weirdo, and all my friend think she likes me. The feeling is not mutual. Anyways, she popped up in my dream with the creepiest damn smile I've ever seen. And ten everything went black. I don't know if the dream ended or I just forgot the rest, but it just stopped. 

I came to school today thinking everything would be dandy, and it was, until 8th period seminar (my school has a ""free period"" that we go to every other day, and the class we go to during that block alternates every time). I walked in, and she sat next to me. Awesome. Just what I need. 

For most of the class I felt her eyes on me, and everytime I looked over she had a smile that grew gradually bigger. By the end of the period the smile resembled the one from the dream *exactly*. I was extremely freaked out, and it was probably showing, too. I looked over one more time, and then te entire dream flashed back to me. She had been holding something in the dream, some small enough to fit in her hand. As soon as I remembered this, her eyes locked with mine, an then she reached into her bag, 

And held out an orange.

I have to go back to that class in 2 hours. I don't know what to do. Nosleep, please help me. I don't think I can handle this one alone.

Edit for words. Sorry I was in a rush to write this.

EDIT 2: 15 minutes left in class, nothing really noteworthy has happened. Seems like she's backed off a bit. I still feel her eyes on the back of my head, though, so I'm bracing myself for when class is over.

EDIT 3: sorry about the delay, early track practice. The remainder of class was extremely uneventful except for the last 5 minutes, during which she got that freaky smile on her face and started slowly moving closer to me. When the bell rang, I bolted. Didn't want to stick around any longer. 

But what's really freaky is what happened around the end of practice. We had a workout today, and on our cooldown I could have sworn I saw her, behind the trees or on the other side of the road. I just ignored that though, and it's all been pretty good since. I just got home, so I should be safe.

Pretending_To_Care,2,,10,1r6wgf,,14,"It was around 1am, when Steve and I stumbled upon the railroad tracks that lead out of our small village. 

""You know, about two miles down the track, there's an old church that's been abandoned. I hear it's a place for Devil worship."" Steve was grabbing a branch just off to the side of the track. 

""Fuck that."" I snapped. 

""Chicken shit?"" Steve smiled. 

""No! I just don't think it's a good idea. Rick said he'd been there during the day with Alan, and there was blood all over the place and a stick that had been used to stab something.""

""How would he know that?""

""There was blood on it.""

""Well look, I've got a stick! How's about I stab anyone if they get near. Or you, for being a pussy."" Steve began jabbing towards me like some sort of fencing opponent. 

""Fine, we can go, but you lead the way, big man."" I agreed. 

We hiked down the tracks for about an hour and a half, maybe longer if you count the couple times we stopped so Steve could smoke from his pipe. The church was in sight. 

As we got closer, we notice a faint light pouring out of the broken door at the front of the church. When we were within twenty or so feet from the side of the church when we crouched behind some trees in the woods. 

""Do you hear that!?"" Steve gasped. 

""Hear what?""

""That chanting.""

We fell silent for a few seconds, but in turn were met with more silence. Nothing. 

""Look, let's creep around front and see if we can get a look inside."" Steve was already headed toward the front before I could object. 

It's a surprise that if anyone were inside, they didn't hear us. Steve was stepping on every stick his feet could've found.

As we placed our backs against the wall of the church, we could hear shuffling against its concrete floor, then silence again. 

Steve leaned over to me ""Right, on three, we both take a quick look... One, two... three.""

We probably should have booked it as soon as we saw what was inside, but shock had totally frozen us in place. 

Upon looking inside, we were met with the dead stare of about thirty fully cloaked people. They knew we were there, and they just stared at us. Behind them was a bloodied lamb, and beside it, a man holding a stick.

Now I'm no expert, but I thought sacrifices were conducted with a blade. NOT by gouging what must have been a couple dozen holes in the body of your sacrifice. 

""Jesu- Oh my God man, fucki- RUN!""

We ran as fast as we could for about ten minutes before I pleaded Steve to wait for me. I couldn't run any more. I had to catch my breath. 

""What... the FUCK was THAT!?"" Steve gasped. 

""I, don't know. You fucking idiot. I told you we shouldn't have gone anywhere near that fu-"" I stopped abruptly.

Behind us was a mob of people carrying flashlights.

""Get down!"" I gasped. 

We laid silently in the dark of the woods for what seemed like forever. We kept our heads down, trying not to breathe. The only indication about where they were was from the lights they carried, and then the worst possible thing that could've happened, did.

In succession, all the lights that were just on, went off. We were blanketed in darkness with this group of men, no more than thirty feet away. We only heard the crackling of branches and the shuffling of leaves for the next few seconds before we heard a voice nearby, grumble a faint ""We have seen you. Come out.""

I couldn't see Steve, but I knew what had happened. Steve bolted off further into the woods, snapping their attention right at us. I could hear him sulking as he ran harder and harder, but they were catching him. I remained silently on the ground as they disappeared. 

I must have laid there, not making a noise for fifteen minutes. What just happened? I was worried sick about Steve. They got him, I just had this feeling, they got him. 

Eventually, I crept my way back home and snuck into my room without waking my parents. I contemplated waking them up to tell them what happened for a while, before I broke down and did exactly that. Sort of. 

At this point, it was around 6am, and dad was getting ready for work. I told him that Steve and I were in the woods and we got spooked by an animal and lost each other running, so I just came home. I told him I was worried Steve might have gotten hurt and that we should call to see if he was okay. My dad is a sharp man, and knew something was up, but didn't question me. He just nodded his head and said ""Okay. ""

We contacted Steve's mother, who confirmed that, surprisingly, Steve was home. After a few more minutes, my dad concluded their phone conversation and reassured me Steve was okay. 

Around noon, I drove over to Steve's house to check in on him. When I got there, he signaled me to follow him up to his room. 

""They know who we are."" He said. ""As I was running, they yelled my name at me. These people, they know who we are.""

I froze.

""If they know who we are, then they live in our village.""

""Exactly, we-..."" Steve stopped himself. ""What do we do?"" He asked.

The house I was and am currently still living in is about 4acres in the country on reserve and the area by my house is surrounded by trees on 3 sides, with a long driveway. There's a path just off the trees line that I used to love too walk but to get to it you need to do a bit of bush whacking. 

So one day I'm out on a walk on these trails with my 3 dogs; Ginger (mix breeds of something), Maggie and Charlie ( both black labs). The trail I'm walking goes for about 1km before you reach a sort of T intersection, go south and in .5 you reach these sand dunes or head north and there's acres and acres of trails. As I'm walking with my dogs, I get to this intersection when I hear Ginger start to whimper, she's nudging me trying to get me to head back home, I think this is odd  but my other dogs are fine so I brush it off and keep walking as Ginger takes off running home with her tail between her legs. 

Feeling adventurous I go north to do some exploring. 2 dogs in tow. I get another kilometre before a coyote comes across our paths. Dogs growling , coyotes looking at us, growling. That is till it looked behind us, kinda whimpered, and took off. Still didn't think much of it. What I was paying attention to was the howling coyote close to us and close to probably 5-10 of them I can hear howling not to far in the distance. 

Decided it was time to take my growling dogs home far away from the pack of coyotes coming for us. 

Everything was going fine on the walk back, coyotes got close then they got distant. Dogs were happy, that is... Till we got to that damn T intersection. It was like a fricken flip got switched. My once happy dogs started whimpering, I felt them nudging me on both sides, they started kind of running up ahead before they would turn around, realize I wasn't with them and they would come back by my side, nudging me to go faster, whimpering, tail between their legs. I was  scared... Then I heard it .

2 claps, right behind my head. I'm I'm the fricken bush ! I turned around slowly and ... Nothing. I grab the biggest branch I could find and start walking. 
Double clap, keep walking
Double clap, maybe it's an animal, but what kind of animal makes that noise right behind your head ?!? 
Double clap, turn around.., still can't see anything !!!
Double clap, keep walking
Double clap, little people, centaurs, bad spirits ? 
Double clap, I want to run all the way home but force myself to walk because running seems like it would make the being watched and followed feeling so much worse... 
Double clap, scared me, scared dogs...ALL...THE WAY...HOME... followed me all the way to the tree line, my dogs were scared all the way home, till we hit the tree line..then they were happy...

I ran to my mom crying, warning her not to let anyone walk the trails alone anymore. I still can't, not alone. 

I don't know what followed me home, but I know that whatever it was, it was very bad..",Followed home by something while walking in the bush,19,nosleep
angelcot,3,,1,1rh91p,,12,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep
Marksman46,3,,3,1rftnd,,12,"Have you ever looked in a mirror, and you were a little off put by your expression? Or looked at yourself in the mirror and realized that the person looking back at you, is you?

I walked beside my friend, and as we walked, we talked. I can’t remember what we talked about, but all I remember is this bland, superficial conversation about nothing in particular. Conversations like these bothered me; they didn't seem real to me, just like sounds, verbal ""things"" that hold no real meaning. And as I thought about our conversation, I wanted to make it more real for me, to give our little talk some depth, and just before I asked her a meaningful question, I tripped. I startled awake, rubbed my eyes, glanced at the clock but the time didn't register in my head. I realized that I needed to go the the bathroom. I shuffled over, dragging my feet to be sure I didn't trip or stub my toe, flicked on the lights, squinting from the brightness, relieved myself and turned on the faucet; I ran my hands under the cool water, threw some water on my face, picked up the towel and wiped my face off. As my eyes adjusted to the light, I looked at myself in the mirror, and my reflection was... smiling at me...I considered that I may have been dreaming, or hallucinating, but my cold damp hands and the pain of the bright light was all too real. I did what I would usually do when in this sort of disbelief and rubbed my eyes some more, hoping I was still just a bit drowsy. 

But nothing changed. 

I looked at myself and was quite curious. I felt my face with my hand to see if I was actually smiling… It certainly didn’t feel like it. Normally this would creep the hell out of me, I would, on any other occasion, scream or run away, but I just stared at the reflection, looking into my eyes as if they weren’t mine. A genuine happiness. I haven’t felt that way in far too long. I felt calm. But suddenly, as though something dropped to the ground, the feeling of calm had broken, like a shattering vase, a feeling welled up inside me. 

A tightness in my chest.

Like someone had just punched me, it was one of a gurgling frustration. I would be happy if it weren’t for this stupid house, things are constantly broken, and this wretched family; it all torments me, every day of my life. That’s when I heard the voice of my father from couple days earlier “Because I said so.” the words resonated in my mind, I could feel my teeth gritting, the sound made my skin crawl... but the reflection just kept smiling back...taunting me. The shrill sound of my mother’s voice beckoned in a continuous annoying ringing in my ear…I shook my head to clear my thoughts but the ringing was still there. I peered over at the clock and looked at the time. 2:34... 2:34... 2:34…2:34? It's late.

I couldn’t possibly sleep now, I was simply too stressed. I had school tomorrow, but I had to deal with this.

“Let me sleep” I muttered half to myself, half to the voices and that face in the mirror. This was when I noticed the mirror had stopped reflecting my actions, and just was a still image of myself smiling. I became angry at this point “What is wrong with you…” I said to it, hoping it would stop. “Just go the hell away!” I growled through my teeth. Feeling rather violent I stared back into my eyes, trying to counteract that incessant grin with my anger. ""No."" It's mouth didn't form the words, but the sound just streamed out of it. The ringing got louder and louder, I tried to cover my ears but it felt like it was coming from inside my head, the voices began circling me and taunting me and that terrible ringing. Then it all just stopped. Was it over? I just wanted to go to sleep so I could continue my broken life. It started laughing, a laugh that sounded unmistakably like my voice... But it was a sound I had never made before... a sound like... true laughter... this was new to me. It bothered me. I was envious. Why can't I experience that kind of happiness? He bothered me.

I had enough. 

The voices all faded away but the mirror kept smiling. “STOP!” I yelled as I punched the mirror, the blood was quick to run down my arm and the few pieces of mirror were stuck in my hand, I could feel them scaping at the bone. The remnants of the mirror on the wall reflected nothing but my angry scowl and bloodied arm. I stared at my hand. It didn't hurt, but I could lightly see the reflection of my own face in the bloodied shards. It still smiled. IT STILL SMILED. ""NO."" I slammed my hand against the counter, the blood spilled all over the room, on my shirt and face.

“And so it happened, Blake had snapped;
though In his own mind, he was trapped.
Broken and confused he wanted to die.
But all he could do was simply cry.”

“The lights flicked off, his mother shrieked, in the other room;
scared, as though she could feel her impending doom.
His father had been up all night drinking
While Blake was pondering and thinking.”

“The sound of the window outside smashing,
rang in his mind, terrifying, echoed the crashing.”

“NOW OF ALL TIMES!?” Blake shouted furiously.

“We enter Blake’s house to a horrid scene,
the smell of blood, nothing was clean.”

“The sanctity of his mind, and house violated,
with adrenaline and fear, his pupils dilated.“

“Sprinting to the kitchen he grabbed a tool,
a knife, very sharp, for he was no fool.
Not afraid to risk his life, with nothing to live for,
This life. And the criminal, he did abhor.“

“Creeping through the house to find the thief,
He heard a loud scream, though very brief.“

In his parent’s room he finds the two mangled corpses, the floor already soaked in blood. His parents had been completely mutilated, each had been stabbed numerous times, now slumped on the floor, eyes still open. A figure stood overtop the lifeless corpses that were once his parents, hunched over, with a bloody knife in hand, the tall man was half visible in the moonlight that came through the window. His skin fair and pale, his face, was itself a conundrum... it was an inexplicable quality. His face looked… off. Like an optical illusion where all you can do is stare and ponder. His fingers were skinny, the joints looked massive in comparison. He looked almost inhuman; but he was unmistakably a man. 

“Awkward” echoed in my mind; perhaps for lack of a better word, as he edged toward me.

""You didn't..."" I said to him.

“‘You’re welcome,’ I stated in a soft, warm voice
to Blake who accepted my words without much choice.”
“I followed him back to the kitchen, as he put the knife down,
The blood dripped from his hair, as heavy as a crown.” 

“‘Its done, its over.’ He quietly muttered to himself.
‘We can sleep now’ He put the knife on the shelf.”

“I climbed back out the window, never there was a mess;
as Blake walked, he had no more stress.”

“His house unviolated but his mind still tainted,
to this new life, he will never be acquainted.”

My wits came back to me. Cold blood streamed down my arms. I walked calmly to the bathroom and looked at the cracked and bloody mirror, the counter was a mess. Between the cracks I see my face, depressed. Sad to the point of a complete bleak. The frown. That was more like it... That makes more sense to me, no longer that disgusting smile. I saw a tear on his face. It was of blood. Feeling around on my face, I felt a drop of blood. Blood on my face? Then I felt something that I did not expect. 

A smile. 

My mind twisted. Reality as I knew it broken, demented, distorted. I looked again at my hand... The shards of glass still glistened in the light, even covered in blood. I saw a piece of bone fractured. I glanced again at the clock, 3:07... ""When did that happen?"" I said, as recollections of what had just happened streamed back into my mind. Did I wake up my parents when I hit the mirror? Then reality hit me in a particularly cruel manner.

For a moment, dead silence.

“MOM, DAD!” I yelled as I sprinted across the house into their room. There they lay. Bloody and mangled bodies, multiple stab wounds on both of them, in the torso, the chest, the legs, the knees, even the face.

I hugged them, soaked in their still warm blood. Yelling at the top of my lungs, “I’M SO SORRY! I’M SO SORRY!” 

Like a pin dropping, the tick of the clock in their room brought me to how real this was.

But only one thought reverberated in my mind. 

This is going to totally ruin my day... 

After about 20 minutes, the blood grew cold, and the corpses began feeling rather stale. I walked around their room, looking for my next day’s lunch money, and as I was walking out, I slipped in a pool of blood. With a loud crash, I continued to lay on the floor for quite some time, I silently muttered to myself

“Dammit, now I need to get some new clothes.”

I began pacing toward my room, taking off my shirt, frustrated by this inconvenience. I threw it on the floor, and it made a sloshing sound. ""Maybe I can wash it..."" My mother had done my wash up until now. I took a shower and put on some new clothes. Clean at last. 

I walked back into my parents room. I stared a little while. Maybe 2 or 3... hours. It was so… Peaceful. This should’ve happened a long time ago.

When I remembered that it was time for bed. 

I began laughing. Laughing as I never had before in my life. Overjoyed. More genuine than any laugh I have ever had. 

Time for bed? I don’t have a bedtime anymore. No one to yell at me. No one to tear my mind apart. I laughed and laughed until I heard my alarm clock go off in my room. 

“Oh, time for school!” I said with a grin on my face.
But without my parents here to test me, this was no race.
Me? This house was now my place. 
I'm here to stay, for I had left quite a trace.
",Reflection,15,nosleep
Dectrek,2,,4,1rbx7r,,13,"All my life I have never believed in luck. It’s just some stupid phrase coined from the minds of jealous or self-absorbed people saying, “Aren’t I the greatest, I just won $50,000 off the lottery! I’m so lucky!” or, “Can you believe that he just won 50 grand off the lottery, that son of a gun.” Now just because I think that luck is a bunch of crap doesn’t mean that I gamble. Oh I gamble alright, I gamble until I’m rich and drunk at the same time. I’ve been to Vegas with my friends, Ron, Jerry, and Max a ton of times and they always say, “Wow Rob, you’re so lucky!” and I’ll either ignore them, or I’ll be too drunk to hear them. I was addict when it came to gambling, but one night, that all changed.

It was another Vegas trip with the guys. I had lied to my company telling them that I was going on a “business trip” and they had completely bought it. I even was able to use company money to pay for the trip! We checked into our hotel room and decided that tonight, we were going to live like there was no tomorrow. I played craps until I was running low on money so I went to the blackjack table and counted cards until I was well funded for the rest of the night. We drank and we drank and we drank until we could barely see anymore. I started to black out so we went to the streets.
	
Now the next events were blurry and I don’t remember all of it. I think what happened was that my friends were telling me that I lucked out at blackjack when one of them said something about me cheating. I got all offended and started taking hits at him and I think we got in a fight. Next thing I knew I was in an alley and was starting to black out, probably not such a good idea to have had that much to drink, and that’s when every turned black.
	
This is when it happened. First, everything was dark and I couldn’t feel anything but then I heard voices. They were cheering all around me that sounded like something exciting was happening and then I got the sense of feeling back. I was lying on my back and there were voices all around me, cheering as if it was a football game. Then the lights went up.

I was blinded at first but as my eyes adjusted to the light, I saw thousands of people sitting in stand around a stage that I was on. I was laying a colorful wheel, something you would see on the wheel of fortune, and I couldn’t get up. Beyond the crowed was darkness and the only light came from a huge light bulb that was about 10 yards from where I was laying. A man was standing on the stage and was holding a microphone.
	
“Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome too our next contestant, Rob Johnson!”

The crowd went wild and the wheel started to spin, slowly at first, but it gained speed quickly. I was beginning to feel sick when I heard “Jerry, press the button when you’re ready!” and the wheel began to slow down. As it slowed I heard the man on the stage yell, “Let’s see how luck our contestant is!” too which the crowed started to yell out colors that they thought the wheel would land on. The wheel stopped on the color green, and the crowd screamed with joy. All around the room the color green was shown with the words “Bad luck” on them. I was deeply confused when I heard, “Well it looks like Rob wasn’t too lucky, stay tuned for our next contestant,” too which I blacked out.

I woke up at the hotel in bed, where I instantly began to contemplate what happened during the night. I came to the conclusion that it was all just a dream and that my friends found me in the alley that I passed out in. They had driven me back to the hotel where I slept the rest of the night away and was now waking up from a drunken dream. Ron came into the room where they asked me if I was ok and what I was doing in that alley, too which I replied, that I just had had one too many drinks. They gave me some water and then told me to get ready for breakfast. The rest of the day was ok up until we went back to the casino at night. I was losing my fortune at craps again so I thought I would count cards at Blackjack again to refund my losses.

My count revealed that the next card too be thrown was going to be a four and I had 17 points on the table. He had thrown 4 aces, kings, queens, jacks, 10, and so on and so until 4 to which he had only thrown three. I knew that there was no possible way that I could lose so I went all in He picked up the next card and laid it on the table, and what I saw I couldn’t believe. He had laid down the ace of spades which I distinctly remembered getting three games ago. I just sat there in disbelief as he ranked in all of my money.
	
I ran to the atm and took 5000 dollars out of my account and ran back to the blackjack table where I counted cards until that was all I could think about but every time my calculations revealed what the next card was, It was always a card that made me go over 21. I kept running to the atm and running back to the blackjack table but I always lost. My bank account was swept clean that night; all of the money that I had worked hard for year after year was taken away from me in a few hours.Ron, Jerry, and Max all said that it was just bad luck but I couldn’t believe what happened that night. It had been a terrible night, but not as bad as what happened when I feel asleep.

I was back on the wheel, and everything was exactly the same as the night before, except I got a new color! This time, I landed on purple which lit up the room with the word “Truth”. When I woke up, it was the next day, and my friends came in and brought me too breakfast. That day, my company found out I lied to them about the trip when all of my bank account money disappeared, and I was fired. The bill for the trip was sent to me but I knew I wouldn’t be able to pay for it. That night I was back on the wheel being spun again for a new color.
This continued for ten days, each brought a new horror such as “pain” or “divorce” to which I was beaten up by some muggers and then divorced by my wife. On the eleventh night, I was standing on the stage with the man holding the microphone. “Let’s give it up for Rob Johnson everyone!” The man yelled and the crowd went wild. I was ushered off the stage and was taken into a room with the guy who had the microphone.
	
“Nice job Mr. Johnson,” He said, “The crowd loved you!”
	
“What was that?” I asked, “I demand you tell me at once what is going on.”
	
“Oh, I’m sorry, you must be very confused. I’m Chris Armstrong, and I run this show. You see whenever someone new comes along, we take the number of big sins that that person had committed in the past 24 hours and we have them face the wheel and its consequences that many times. You had 10 total major sins in that past day so you faced the wheel ten times. You sure put a show on for the audience!”
	
“Sins?” I asked.
	
“Oh yes, you committed theft, gambling, murder you name it! You cheated at blackjack, you became drunk, you beat up a few people, and you committed more theft. We haven’t seen a suspect like you for a while!”

“I don’t remember anything like that!” I snapped at him.

“That’s probably because you were drunk when most of it happened. Don’t worry though; you’ll have plenty of opportunities to make up for them later.”

This is when a thought occurred to me, he said I committed murder but I didn’t remember doing, or who I did it too.

“Wait… who did kill?” I asked suspiciously. 

“You don’t know? I thought it would have occurred to you by now. Let’s see if I can make you realize who. You got into a fight with him after you left the casino. You hurt him pretty bad, and in your drunkenness, you killed him. When he came here, we thought that instead of making him face the wheel, why not have him push the button that stops the wheel from spinning. It was an attraction that brought in a larger crowd than usual.”

That’s when I remembered him saying “Push the button when you’re ready Jerry” and how I had gotten into a fight with one of my friends about me cheating at blackjack.”

“I killed Jerry?” I asked in horror, but then a new though came into my mind, “Wait, if Jerry is dead and he pressed the button to stop the wheel, then does that mean I’m…”
	
“Yes, you are dead,” Chris said as if he knew exactly what I was about to ask, “You died of alcohol poisoning when you passed out in the alley. The past 10 days have been a simulation. Mr. Johnson, welcome to Hell.”

nisyldaed,10,,10,1r6mcx,,11,"Someone once said ""The greatest strengt is to know your weaknesses."" Luckily I found that out quite Early. 
You might say that I've been blessed with a keen perception, so I always tended to grasp certain concepts and situations quicker than the peope around me, which quickly lead me to thinking that I was somehow superior to others.
Letting these thoughts and thus my hubris overtake me : that was and still is my greatest weakness, but ironically the very cause of my Pride allowed me to realise this very thing, so whether it's a blessing or a curse might be your own perspective.

My story begins with something that should have been a regular day at my university, you know: attending courses, not paying attention, browsing the internet on your phone, etc.
I can't really get into detail here, 
because my memorIes of what happened are really blurry, but I remember a loud crack, a bang and loud rumbling. The next Thing I know is waking up in the local hospital.
From what I've been told, the corridor I walked through that day collapsed without any reason and buried 5 students beneath it. I was the only survivor.

NOw, that event didn't really help with the aforementioned pride, quite the contrary:  I convinced myself that somehow I subconsciously saved myself from the collapsing ceiling and that my surival once again showed that I was better than the others wo died.
Once I fully realized what I just thought I couldn't help but feel disgusted by myself, but this was only the beginning of my descent.
Of course I went back to university after a fEw days, since I only had some bruises and a boken finger, and that's when the prideful Thoughts became more frequently and more aggressive. Word of my survival got around pretty quickly, since it's a small university, so everyone I knew and some people I didn't know came up to me and talked like I was some kind of miracle survivor, or in some cases even a hero. And, needless to say, I absolutely loved that. I also began to notice that I began to be more condescending towards other people. Sure, I've always had my share of disrespectful thoughts about some persons but ever since the accident I sometimes said things aloud and I Always hit them where it hurt, it was pathetic to watch.

After a few weeks things started to go bacK to normal, people wouldn't talk to me that much anymore and this bothered me to no end. They wern't giving me attention anymore. Had they forgotten what I waS? Had they forgotten that I WAS SUPERIOR?
It couldn't go on like this, they needed to be reMinded, reminded of the greatness that was mE, no, IS ME!

Remember the quote from the beginning? I think it's bullshit. Because one of the greatest strengths is actually to be a good liar. And what a great liar I am – I've been lying to you all the time!
They still haven't figured out that I blew up the corridor. Still don't know that I indeed survived the collapsing corridor by an accurate calculation. 

And next time I'll be showing them my true greatness, it will be a lasting reminder.",Pride,21,nosleep
TreasureHouseofDoom,16,,62,1r396v,,12,"Channeling Aunt Lucia’s strength and wit, remarkable as both had always been, I felt myself fortified for what lay ahead, but that didn’t mean I was completely unafraid.  Fear and anxiety are nearly interchangeable in certain situations, and shedding them completely is not always the wisest approach.  Composure maintained, I dealt now with redirecting the bases of these emotions into something productive and controllable.  I remembered my mother’s fearlessness, the way she seized every opportunity to create and do good, the inner power she exuded. This I channeled, too.  Sisters in unison (one living and one passed on) to strengthen me, I was sure I carried now a shield of sorts.  Across the miles, as if she knew the battle I faced, I could almost hear my mother say, “Keep your head up, Julianne.  Stay focused.  Do good work.”  This was her mantra, and as far as I knew, it had never failed her.
Laughter rose from the study again, and I was about to step through the door, open myself to the onslaught, when I caught the fragrance of chocolate on the air, warm wafts from just beyond the door from the foyer to the hall.  I heard the voices of children, conversation and giggling, just beyond that, too.  Instinct told me this is where I was needed most.  Dulcie wanted me to follow her into the study, and in her realm, there was no telling what might happen, but Mary’s presence was just ahead of me, and it was possible I would have the opportunity to observe more of the events that had led to terrible schism between friends.
Doors shut and power out, the hall was dark, and the musty odor of rooms not allowed to breathe hung in the air.  I tried but couldn’t recall if I had smelled this odor the night before.  The chill and dank fragrance felt captive, too, as if I were stepping into some forgotten time and place.  It was completely possible that I was, that I had discovered some portal, that Mary had provided one.  Passing doors, I heard the sounds of the once living in other spaces, the turn of a music box in a nursery, the zip and knock of a trestle-powered sewing machine, probably a Singer like the one my mother used as a plant stand at home, the coos of a baby and the lullaby her Mama sang.  These memories, vital and vibrant, empowered me, too.  There was good energy about this place, and I allowed it to circulate now through me.  
Three doors I passed to either side, and I was just about to open the door to the kitchen, when a fourth door to the right opened slightly.  Through the slim space provided, I heard the singsong voice of Dulcie, coy and friendly, beckon, “Won’t you come play with us, Julianne?” In the background, the festive tones of a calliope rose and fell, and I found myself reminded suddenly of a wonderful memory from my childhood.  My siblings and I had been treated to a day at the North Carolina State Fair, where my mother had introduced us to a man she knew from antiques auctions.  He’d shown us the most glorious old calliope, and he’d had a real pet monkey named Clayton the Scoundrel.  
These are the old tricks of angry spirits, to tease some memory out of us, exploit and make it vile, distract good people from good works.  I knew this, but I longed, too, for simpler days, days when my sister, brothers, and I were among familiar people in a familiar place, days when we were too young and innocent to recognize the darkness in others.  
‘Julianne,” familiar voice from the kitchen prevailed, and as I reached for the cool brass doorknob, I knew immediately whom I would find on the other side.  
“Aunt Lucia,” tears stung my eyes, but joy filled my heart.  Three years she had been gone, on the other side, only her voice to guide me, so much more than most others ever had again of a loved one, but now she stood in front of me, poised, pretty, powerful.  Emanating from her in golden beams was the very energy she had radiated in life. “How can this be?”
Aunt Lucia’s smile was warm invitation into the kitchen.  ‘Forgive me, but I worried you wouldn’t get the fudge just right.’ And she laughed at me as others of our family often did.  I was neither a baker nor a cook, ‘but she is a Kook!’ my sister might have said.
‘These young ladies have just introduced me to Vassar fudge.’ And now I saw Mary at the island in Seth’s ultra swank kitchen measuring out white sugar.  Across from her stood Dulcie, her expression perplexed.
‘Miss Lucia, wouldn’t it all be better with more sugar and perhaps a little more cream,’ she asked, but Aunt Lucia only laughed sweetly.
‘Well, Sweet Dulcie,’ she began as if she had known Dulcie Moseley for years, ‘why don’t you tell me.  Isn’t it a Moseley who sent this recipe to you from Vassar, and didn’t she help to invent this sweet confection?’ Aunt Lucia had such a way with children always.  ‘Never ask a yes or no question,’ she had often told me. ‘Always engage a child.  If necessary be wrong so that they may be right.’ I remembered this as she winked at me over Dulcie’s golden head.
‘Well, no, Ma’am. My Aunt Mae did send this, but she isn’t a Moseley; she’s a Baker, on my mother’s side,’ and she and Mary burst into laughter as if her aunt’s being a Baker who sends fudge recipes was just about the funniest thing they’d ever heard.
‘Or she could be a Boiler or a Cook,’ Mary giggled.  I watched in some awe as the two girls exchanged looks of pure love, deep respect, and as my Aunt mitigated whatever memory might endanger this momentary union. 
Now she turned to me, expression earnest, voice so soft I practically had to read her lips to understand her words. ‘Mary is a pip and an angel, but there’s deep sorrow about her, and Dulcie really is a sweet girl, good and kind, but the anger that rages in her spirit is pure fire. You must handle this all very carefully, cautiously, and you mustn’t lose either your temper or your control.’
This was the way of the women in my family.  Always they’d presume that the younger women were ready for anything, too, that we could accomplish anything we set our minds to, that our minds over matters-at-hand would suffice.
“How did I get myself into this mess,” I said out loud, and Aunt Lucia raised finely sculpted eyebrows, as if to ask, ‘You mean you don’t know?’ and suddenly I was reminded of the walk through the cemetery, the prank gone too far, the Ouija board I’d promised my mother I’d never used.
‘How you came to be in the middle of this is no longer the issue. What matters is how you plan to get yourself out.’ And her insistence that I must disengage myself only after my promise to Mary was satisfied was implicit.  There really was no other way.  Now she only mouthed without even a hint of whisper, ‘Don’t bring home any hitchhikers,’ and I understood her warning.  There are people who live their lives under the shadows of dark, sad spirits, hitchhikers who will never find their paths home. To be under such shadow would be detriment not only to me but also to anyone who loved me.
“But what do I do?” I asked Aunt Lucia.  And perhaps some answer would have come if only I had been strong enough to hold this lively memory open longer.  Instead, I felt the collapse of these exhausted spirits in front of me, and in moments the vision in the kitchen they had never known had faded.  Only red and black trim against the swank white and stainless of the kitchen Seth’s mother had designed remained, or so I thought at first, but as I investigated more closely, I found the buttery print of a child’s right hand smudged where Dulcie had stood only moments before. Moving closer to it, I thought about tearing a paper towel from the roll that stood upright just beside the sink to press it down for some evidence of this impossible reality, when suddenly it combusted to tiny flames and the sizzle against the stainless island carried the salty tingle of tears.
The nature of my gift is such that I cannot press spirits to reveal themselves, and even if I could, I don’t believe I ever would.  Instinct dictates that as little engagement as possible is always the best mode, and it’s a rule by which I live my life whenever possible.  But I knew I’d have to take a more proactive stance to accomplish what we all—Mary, Dulcie, and I—needed, and for that I’d have to examine the house. 
I thought back to the night before, almost literally decades ago considering the journey along which these girls had brought me, and the things Seth had told me about the house.  I knew, for instance, that his father had discovered a secret compartment in the study, that old photos and tintypes had been stored in the tin handkerchief box found in the wardrobe that stood in his parents’ room, that the hall was part of an elaborate addition to join the kitchen to the rest of the house, and that the Ouija board was strictly taboo in the Jefferies household, just as it would have been in mine. I knew, too, that the kitchen was not built in 1870 when the house had been, and that the original kitchen must have stood just past the rock wall in the farthest portion of the back yard.  I did not, however, know where the Ouija board had come from originally, and now I wondered if it had been in the house when the Jefferies had moved in or if it had come into the house with them.
I’d have to go to the study to begin my investigation.  The notion sickened and worried me, but I gathered myself for the inevitable.  My mother had long taught me that the most direct way to gain protection from spirits that might harm you was to go to the Big Guy himself.  Some might laugh at this, but faith was and still is much more than a crutch for me, and anyone who believes in the fires of Hell must embrace the comforts of Heaven, too.  Opening the door to the study, I pushed it open so that the door knob bounced lightly against a chair just to the left of it.  Colder air pushed into the space right in front of me, and I shivered as if I were outside in a snowstorm.  Dulcie was here now, I knew, and she had been waiting for me.  

“Our Father who art in Heaven,” I began, voice bold and strong, “Hallowed be Thy name,” The chandelier above the Dr Jefferies broad mahoghany desk swayed slightly at first and then began to spin from the center, reminding me of the whirl-a-round at the park. “Thy Kingdom Come, Thy will be done—” 
And now Dulcie laughed with much more depth than a child might have, cold echo of the anger that was eating away her soul, interrupted to say, “I’m not the Devil, Julianne. I’m only a little girl, afterall.”
And I strengthened myself for the tantrum I felt welling in her, “On Earth as it is in Heaven.”
“Look at me, Julianne.” And it was all I could do to not make direct eye contact with her, but I did see that she was as pretty in what came close to flesh as she had been in the picture, innocent and sweet looking, and completely mesmerizing in her charming presentation. If I had not known what I did, if I could not recognize the hate that burned her from the inside out, I would have reached to hold her, stroked her golden ringlets, played dolls or drawn with her just as I would have my own little sister, but there was no denying the tenacious embers of her eyes, even as I avoided contact with them.
“Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us,” And now her laughter was maniacal, sad and laughing all at the same time.
“‘Forgive us our trespasses’,” she mocked, “and who is the trespasser here?” The question hovered between us and then seemed to take on an energy all its own as the accessories on Dr Jefferies desk and the loose items throughout the room rose and began to spin as if convection of Dulcie’s anger moved them.
“Lead us not into Temptation,” I continued, spirit emboldened with every word of the prayer I had known by heart ever since I had been a toddler, “but deliver us from Evil—“
And Dulcie’s angry laughter swelled to a cackle that rattled the house, but then it fell, too, as the little girl so consumed by anger became increasingly exhausted as I continued, “for Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, Forever and Ever. Amen.”
I knew the entities that had exploited Dulcie’s sorrow and loneliness were not dormant and would not give up so easily.  Stronger now, I added, “Dear Heavenly Father, Give me strength for the challenges I face, and cast all unkind, mischievous, or evil spirits from my presence.  Wrap me in your loving arms to protect and fortify me.  I ask these things in your name. Amen.”
And now the room became silent, its energy subdued, and the objects that had spun around me lowered then settled in relative proximity to where they had been to start.  I breathed deep solace and was happy to find new warmth about the room and to detect the spicy scent of candles burned perhaps days ago in the air.  For the time being, this was a study almost like any other.  Now I set my task to discovering its every secret free from interruption for awhile.

Spudz_OCD,6,,5,1rgcw5,,10,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

So I approached her because what my grandmother told me just wasn't enough. 

She was in the park, on a bench with anther woman.

I said hi, and at first I started just saying random stuff like the commenting on the weather and such things, but then I decided to ask what I want to know. I asked her if I can talk to her about it, and the other woman excused herself.

I asked her a lot of questions, but basically all she told me was that if I really am not Magdalena, she can't tell me all those things.
Though she said if I am her, and she finds it out, then I'll be sorry for lying, because a deal's a deal and you just can't run from it. She said she'll know if I'm lying to her because she always knows. I
 was pretty scared so I tried explaining to her that I really, really, REALLY am NOT my great-grandmother, but she told me ""Don't bother"", and explained to me that if I AM Magdalena, she'll know. ""How will you know?"" ""I'll be.. seeing you around.. so I'll know easily."" Creepy, stalker-ish, creepy.

I asked HOW could I be Magdalena - it's been a LONG time. Even if she was alive she'd be OLD. But she just giggled and wouldn't explain. ""Can't tell you now. You'll probably find out one day. Actually, it may be very soon"".
I wouldn't stop asking and making remarks at how impossible it is, but she just said ""It happens. And she wouldn't be the only one, you know"".

And in the end, she said something like ""Let's say I believe you - but if you are lying... We're friends, but that doesn't mean you can just forget a deal. A deal is still a deal even if we're friends. And you're not being a friend right now."" 
I tried to say I'm NOT lying, I was like ""I'm not.."", but she cut me off , ""Just in case."", she said and then got up and  started just walking away, but she came back and said, almost laughing ""I was on the bench first, you're the one that should go now"". 
So  I got up and as I was leaving, after I said ""Bye"", she said ""Bye bye... IRINA."", with an eyebrow raised and a smirk. As in ""I know it's not Irina but whatever I'll say it for now."" Like if someone says ""He's just a friend"" and then you'd say ""Sure... FRIEND"". That kind of tone.

I'm not sure if I should be afraid.
I mean she didn't do anything to me and she doesn't seem to even want to anything to ME as me, as in really me, not Magdalena, but it's still creepy. Especially the ""I'll be seeing you around"" part. That's basically ""I'll be looking at you"". Kinda scares me.

dws7rf,3,,7,1r8d9t,,10,"I was reading posts today and was reminded of something that happened to me when I was a kid.  

It was an average summer day and I was somewhere in my mid to low teens (couldn't drive yet).  Since it was summertime school was out and like most kids I spent it with friends doing whatever seemed like a good idea at the time.  Usually we would go play in the woods or ride our bikes around.  

That day I decided to call up one of my friends and see if he wanted to hang out.  So I picked up the phone and to my astonishment the line was dead.  I didn't think much of it because I figured maybe they were working on the lines around my house or something.  His house wasn't very far from mine (only a mile or two) so I decided to just ride my bike over and see him.

When leaving my house the first thing that surprised me was that I didn't see any people or cars around.  It was summer in a residential neighborhood so there should have been kids out playing and people going about their daily lives.  Again it seemed like a coincidence.  As I was riding I remember thinking it was eerily quiet.  There was no wind that day which is odd enough in and of itself but the air seemed almost stagnant.

Being a kid it didn't seem like much of a problem and at the time it just seemed like a small thing.  What I remember most now is that not only were there no people going about their daily business but there was not a single sound from nature.  I could hear my bike tires on the road and the sound of the crank and my own breathing but there were no other sounds.  No birds, no dogs, no chirping or buzzing of insects.

I got to my friends house and knocked on the door. 

Nothing.  

I knocked again.  

Nothing.

That was just plain odd.  He had several other siblings and even though his parents worked, I remember thinking that there should have been at least one of them there.  At that point I decided that something was definitely off.  I rode my bike back to my house as quickly as I could and went up to my room and shut the door.  Several hours later my sister came home from work and I went down to talk to her.  She asked how my day was and I couldn't bring myself to tell her about the strange events of the afternoon because I figured that it must have all been a coincidence and I was reading too much into it.  I went outside and everything seemed normal.  Wind blowing, kids playing, dogs barking.  To this day I never figured out what was going on but it was like someone turned a switch and turned off everything but me and then flipped it back and everything was back to normal.

Jonathon and Katie, both 22 years old, broke up two weeks ago. ""Boredom,"" as Katie would put it, is the reason for her diminishing interest in Jonathon.

Jonathon still loves Katie.  Jonathon misses Katie; he didn't want to break-up.  He still looks at her with the same eyes he had when they started dating at the age of sixteen. Jonathon is struggling with the break-up. He's depressed and has called in sick at work four days in the last two weeks. Today is one of his sick days.

He lies in his bed, it's 11:57am.  He stares at the ceiling, wondering what Katie is doing.  Wondering when, or if she will take him back.  He loves Katie, but he can't help but feel anger towards her too.  How could she do this to him?  After all they have been through together, she ends it... because she is bored?  There must be another reason.  

*She must be seeing someone else.*

Jonathon snaps out of his internal back-and-forth and sits up in his bed.  He sighs and turns his head to look in the mirror. 

*I haven't shaved in a week.  Katie doesn't like it when I neglect shaving.*  

He slowly steps out of bed, stands, and looks blankly at his bedroom wall.  His attention is captured the moment he receives a text-message.  Reluctantly thinking it could be Katie, he quickly grabs his phone.  

*It's Katie!*

""We need to talk.  1:30 this afternoon at McAlister's Coffee?  It's important.""

 *This might be my last real opportunity to convince Katie that the break-up was a bad idea. Not too eager though...* 

He slows his thumbs from tapping like an Irish river-dancer, and slyly replies, ""Sure. Sounds good.""  He looks in the mirror once again and smiles. His first genuine smile in two weeks.  

*Now to shave.*

Jonathon shaves, showers, puts on his most decent clothes and decides it would be a worthy gesture to stop by the supermarket for flowers before meeting Katie.  

*Katie always loved it when I bought her flowers.  This will remind her of the good times.*

It's 1:15pm and Jonathon is driving to McAlister's Coffee.  He is nervous and excited.  He hasn't seen Katie in nine days.  

He pulls up to the coffee shop five minutes early and decides to sit in his car until 1:32pm. 

*Not too eager.* 

At 1:29pm, Katie comes out of the coffee shop looking emotionally distraught.  She sits on a bench located in front of the coffee shop.  She notices Jonathon's car and perks up, wondering why he is just sitting.

*Shit.  Now she thinks I am being flaky.*

A whole three minutes too early, he reaches for his flowers and gets out of his car.  He smiles at Katie and makes his way across the parking lot.  Katie gets up from the bench and meets Jonathon halfway.  

""I don't really want coffee.""  Katie admits to Jonathon.

With his most charming smile he replies, ""Oh? Why are we here then?  What did what you need to tell me that is so important?"" 

""I... went on a date last night.""

Jonathon's charming smile slowly turned into a subtle frown. ""You did...?  With who?""

""That's... not important.""  Katie's eyes began to swell as she looked into Jonathon and hugged him.
""I made a mistake. My night made me realize what a fool I have been. How can you ever forgive me?"" 

Katie pulls away to look into Jonathon's eyes once more.  Jonathon wipes her tears away and with the truest smile says, ""Katie, I love you.  Of course I forg...""

The noise begins...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

...

...

...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**


Jonathon, Katie and everyone around them grimace, grab their ears for cover and look to the sky.


**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

...

...

...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

Cars in the street stop dead in place and their operators look out of their windows, wondering where the sound is coming from.

Katie looks at Jonathon with a fear he has never seen in her. ""Jon! What is that!?""

Jon's knees give out.  As he falls to the parking lot, the loud ambient chatter goes silent. The only noise he hears is the sound of the rustling wind and the brushing of leaves on the ground.  He tries to stand up but he can't.  He tries to comfort Katie from the ground, but he can't make a sound.  Katie is standing completely still in place, as though a mannequin.

*What the fuck is going on? KATIE! KATIE! CAN YOU HEAR ME?*

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

...

...

...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

Jonathon, locked in an upward looking position, sees it.

He sees where the noise is coming from.

He notices a wet stain overwhelm the outside of Katie's jeans.  

*She must see it too.*

Everyone around him is paralyzed, but he feels their fear. He feels their need to run, but they can't.

He realizes these are his final moments, he tries one last time to speak.  Though only thoughts are allowed.

*I love you Katie... I love you.*

He sees the first person launch violently into the air, then the second, the third.  It's his turn.  He's jerked in the air in the direction of the anomaly.  The last thing he sees is Katie.  She is the last thing he wants to see.

bebadhavefun,2,,4,1r3ema,,11,"Hey guys, well, I'm a new user but I've been reading NoSleep for about a year now, though I never felt like sharing my ""supernatural"" experiences until now. In time, I'll post more, but I feel the need to start with something that brings tears to my eyes to this day.

It was mid-2011 and I was on my winter break, my mother was working her night shift and I was alone in the house with my little brother (who was 7 years old at the time). 

At around 1 AM, I started to feel sleepy so I turned off the computer and headed to the bathroom to grab some toilet paper in case my flu got worse during the night. 

As soon as I get to the bathroom I notice two things: The first, outside it was raining incredibly hard and the second, the dog had followed me to the bathroom and was whining softly while he waited for me to come out. Being a recently adopted dog (We've had him for a week or so back then) I didn't think much of it, ""Maybe he's afraid of the rain"" I thought as I headed out and closed the door.

That was when I saw it. A couple of meters to my left, through the half open door that leads to the garden, something that made me question my sanity. 

It was a...creature, I guess. Taller than the door frame, covered in thick light brown hair that walked in two feet. I saw it for a split second before it hid behind the wall. I thought I was hallucinating -even though I've never been skeptical- so my first impulse was to open the door to see what the hell was that. It was the moment my dog got in the way between me and the door, shaking, whining and showing his teeth at me to keep me away. As I said, we hadn't had Morrison for too long and I didn't want to get bitten, so I backed off to the kitchen trying to wrap my head around what was going on. 

Suddenly, the sound of scratching on the walls made me jump. It seemed to come from everywhere and Morrison started barking at this. I made him shut up and, in desperation, I grabbed the biggest knife I found in a drawer and stayed there in the middle of the kitchen, shaking because of the cold and the situation I was.

The scratching faded in the rain and for a moment, I thought everything was alright. That until the door swung open and slammed back shut, making me jump and run to get the hell out of there and lock myself in my brother's room with the dog, still holding the knife tightly. 

I remember hearing soft ""bangs"" on the door outside that started to get louder and louder each time and I just covered my ears, praying to anyone who could hear me for it to stop. But it didn't.

When it became too much for me, I gained enough courage to go outside and put a couple of chairs against the door just in case. When I came back inside leaving every light in the house on, a few minutes passed by before I heard a loud bang outside the room. I knew that, whatever it was, was trying to get inside, so I opened the bedroom door and looked down the hallway: The chairs I had put against the door were knocked down and the door was wide open. I could only shake my head in disbelief as I came back to sit on the edge of my brother's bed holding the knife -that seemed to be useless by then-.

I don't know at which point I fell asleep, but my mother woke me up at around 8 in the morning and asked why wasn't I in my room and what was all the mess with the chairs in the hallway. I told her, she didn't believe me and I'm pretty sure I'll never know what the hell was that thing.

PS: Sorry about any mistakes on the writing of this story, english is not my first language. 
",I'll never know.,15,nosleep
IntricateVenom,9,,5,1r2dyl,,11,"I've known that I have had this ability since I was six. Actually it all started when I was six.

I can see spirits. I see them sometimes like normal people, but they have a sort of ""glimmer"" to them. In all of my encounters I have never been to speak to one, but they don't need to; their expressions tell me all I need to know.

As I said, this all started at the age of six. My mother and I moved into an old house that was built in the 1910's. There was another house next to it that was a complete mirror image of the one I lived in. The history was that the houses were built by two twins. One twin was a good man, while the other had a sadistic side. He was a murderer and he alone had killed around 6 people in his house (which was the one I lived next to). To this day, around 20 people have been murdered in that house.

Anyway one night I was in my room staring at the ceiling (I have insomnia so it's quite hard for me to sleep) when suddenly, I got this immense feeling of anger and fury. However, the feeling wasn't coming from my house, or even from myself, but the house next door. I got out of bed and looked out the window and I will never forget what I saw.

Staring out of the window across from me was a man who had to be in his late 40's. His face was contorted into a meanful scowl. He was wearing old tattered clothes. He was staring right at me; right into my very soul. Then, almost instantly, he vanished. I started to cry really loud and eventually my mom came running in. I told her what had happened but she didn't really believe me.

Fast forward to 16. I've been seeing spirits all the time but only when I'm ""tuned in"". This is the best way I can describe it. Its almost like tuning a radio to the right channel. I've found that once I ""tune in"" I can see spirits in all kinds of forms and shapes. However, one night when I was 16, I found that i can see more than spirits.

When I was 16 my friend and I were big into the paranormal and we liked to go to graveyards and such to see what we can find. On this day we decided to go to one of the most haunted graveyards in our state - Dice Roads Cemetary. There have been lots of people encountering things there so we decided to go. 

Apon arriving there, I become overwelmed with a sense of dread, sorrow, anger, sadness and everything inbetween. Besides that it looked pretty normal. We did some walking, some voice recording, normal shit, and finally we were standing outside the car talking when it happened. It was around 3 in the morning when I saw a shadow move. I clicked on the flashlight and moved it over to that spot, yet nothing was there. I decided at this point to tune in and see what I could find. When I was certain I was tuned in, I opened my eyes and immediately wished I hadn't. 

In the graveyard floating were a pair of blood red eyes and they were staring right at me. They were full of hatred, scorn, and just pure evil. Time seemed to have stopped and I just kept staring at those eyes. I couldn't look away. Then, all of a sudden, they rushed forward with lighning speed, out of the graveyard, and directly through me. What happened next is a bit fuzzy. I remember feeling all sorts of emotions and having many intricate thoughts. Then everything goes black. The next thing I know, I awake to find my friend knelt down next to me shaking me. He said that I had uttered one word before i fell. 

Destroy.

The entire ride back i was physically sick to the stomach and had a massive headache.I've never gone back to that place and never will. I'm 17 now, and Ive gotten a lot better at controlling what I see. 

These are only two of the many stories I have to share, but I felt these were thew most important. I just wish that I could forget some of the things I've seen. I also hope others are like me and see where I'm coming from. I'm going to keep working on it, and use this ability to possibly help othersw in the future. ",My Ability,16,nosleep

Hi everyone.

First off, I owe everyone who read and commented my story my deepest gratitude.  I still haven't been able to tell anyone about last weekend's events in person.  Lately its easier to look others in the eye, and I even enjoyed a buritto the other day, but I still can't bring myself to actually *say* what happened.

Yesterday, after reading everyone's comments I made my decision. u/GeneralJiblet, u/BraveGoldHeart, and u/Explodingtaoster01 really got me thinking (and all of those who contributed helped; just knowing I'm not alone was a relief), and most importantly I realized that I'm not powerless in this.  What I do will be *my* choice; on my terms.

I'm not sure how to explain it, but the moment my mind was made up a deep, zen-like calm came over me.  Almost instantly after the thought crossed my mind it felt like a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders; I have you all to thank for that.   

__________________________________________________________________________________

I do, however, need more support from you guys.  Like I've iterated before, I just can't talk about this to my friends or family.  I had some episodes and struggled with depression (doesn't everyone at some point?) a few years back, and I just worry they might think I've finally snapped if I start talking about “aliens” and stuff.

Anyways, I need your input.  I'm sure there's rational explanations for this stuff...so if you guys feel the need to talk some sense into me; *please* do.

Like I said, its like a weight's been lifted from my shoulders. That night; last night was the first time I've slept since the weekend. Today-and this is what has me *unsettled*- my tattoos are...almost disappearing. They've faded a ton, literally overnight. 

These aren't that old, and even the newest ones are just...washing away? They're silly but substantial tats from back in college when I was in the Coast Guard Reserves...and I swear I hadn't noticed a change just a few days ago. The blacks, blues, reds...they're all fading.

I've also had almost a dozen nose bleeds. I know its November; its getting colder out and the air is dry...its just that this many has me...*worried*. I almost fee like I *should* be more concerned, but I'm unable to focus any any train of thought for more than a few moments.  I'm sure its because of how little sleep I had been getting.

Even now, just typing this has me feeling light headed. I'll probably lay down, the glare from the computer screen is hurting my eyes and putting a slight red tint to my vision.  

Thanks again guys.  You have no idea how *truly* comforting it is knowing I'm not alone.

SprightlyMonkey,2,,7,1r98ph,,10,"Most people, no matter what their age, can't really remember many things before the age of 4, barely anyone can remember most of their life before the age of 10. I know that my earliest living memory was when I was 3, when my younger brother was born. It's odd that, after it all, of all the things I could've remembered, it's that which is stuck in my mind. When, after it all, I was left with but a notepad with three notes. A URL, an address, and some jottings. And thus, I take it upon myself to inform you of all that I've learned in these past few hours.

I don't really know who I am any more. I'm a tall, gangly male with long black hair, and the only name I have to go on is the pseudonym I'm using to convey this message. I know that, once, I was interested in psychology and philosophy. These things mixed together to form a fondness for one thing in particular. I slowly became obsessed with working out how memories worked, why we had them and how they formed. Of course, you have the scientific answers, but thinking back, they don't really provide you with much explanation. Very, very few people, if any, can remember their birth, perhaps the single most important events of your entire life, and barely anyone can remember it. Don't you think it odd, that whilst we remember inconsequential things like our first tooth falling out, or how you grazed your knee when falling off your bike, you can't remember being born? People will put it down to a theory called ""Childhood Amnesia"", where adults find it difficult to recall early memories, as children haven't got fully developed limbic systems. But how come there are exceptions to this rule?

Of course, the answer is I don't know. Or, more, rather (as horribly ironic as it is), I forgot. I know that I did research this, I did a load of it. In as much detail as I could. It was a personal project of mine, one I know I'd been working on for a long time. Again, God knows how long, I forgot that too. It all feels like an eternity ago now, considering I've forgotten it all. I suppose that it's my own fault, considering I brought myself into this, I went perusing into areas one should've left untouched, as far as this transcript can tell me. And that has landed me deeper in whatever mire I find myself in than I can assume most others ever have. And that scares me. Not because I fear for my life, definitely not. I am literally nothing now, with nothing to my name but this notebook and what I am writing here. 

I suppose you want to know what the jottings are. Well, they're in two parts. The first parts are like stage directions, with little annotations in handwriting I can only assume is my own, describing the setting (presumably so I can find my way back there). The second part, is a statement. A saying, or a speech or something. So without further ado, I shall do my best to relay this script.

I am sat at a bench at my local green. It's a cold, dark winters evening, with heavy air hanging over me. Across from me, stands a man, who is much better equipped for the cold than I. He's wearing a large overcoat, with the collar rolled up around his cheeks, and a small hat stuck atop his presumably bald head. He looks about 40, the only reason I can tell being the soft amber hue from his cigarette, betraying his wrinkles, lined with a rushed stubble, with awkward tufts slightly bushier than the rest. The wisps keep rising up and obscuring my view of his glassy eyes. If I didn't know any better, I would've said he had been crying, but that's silly. He stands a good inch or so higher than me, and makes an effort not to slouch. Whenever he speaks to me, he addresses me very carefully and politely, referring to me as ""Sir"" or ""Mister"" and making sure to annunciate every syllable as if a single mistake would betray him. This makes his speech slow, but not staggered, he has no difficulty in speaking properly, but he is deliberately taking care. He isn't particularly stocky, but nor is he lanky. He's a perfect medium. He's addressing me, gesturing for me to approach him. He's ushering me on now, waving his hand as if to say for me to fall in behind him. I do so. He's leading me to a flat. (the address is written here, but for your protection I shan't be putting it in until I can confirm it's safety). It's very well kept. 5 rooms. All doors are shut.
He's gone into the room straight ahead of the sofa I'm sat on, shutting the door behind him. I'm not sure how, but I don't think he noticed this.

This next part, is not in the same handwriting as above. It's very intricate, certainly whoever wrote it took their time. There are, however, mistakes. Very obvious mistakes, but I cannot figure out what they're for. I think that that may be why I am writing to you now, to see if you can assist me.

Dearest Curious Inquirer, 
It is my solEmn duty to regretfully inform you that you have gone far enough in your scour for the true workings of the human mind. It is a sincere wasTe of a life, lived too litTle, for me to have to extingUish, but you leave me with no other option. You simply have discovered toO much. The real worry that I have, is that I may have intervened far too late. However, there is no use in dwelling upon these mistakes. They are mine, and mine alone. I was charged with the protection of your Blood, and that is a duty which I can onLy suffer for so long.

I truly wish I could reward your innovation, I honestly do. In as many years, I have desired a chase such as this. Something I can truly be proud of. 
If you remember one thing, which is highly unlikely, I want it to be that your childhood is something you have to keep. Once it's lost, it's lost.
The infinite possibilities of a child's mind, is often labelled as immature, but tell me, can an adult construct a story from but a pen, paper and some squiggles? Do we consider men like Picasso to be immature, and simple-minded? How can something so infinite, and yet so delicate, be incomplete? You mislabel it as immaturity, when in fact childlike wonder is a blessing. A blessing, lost to age, because it no longer ""suits"" you. It doesn't ""fit"" the world you're entering. That is why you are stripped of it. We act, simply as you ask.

JustAnotherLondoner,1,,9,1r8zg3,,10,"Last year, my brother Liam fell ill and took himself to hospital. He wasn't insanely ill, but due to the fact that he kept fainting and falling into things, he felt the hospital was the safest place for himself to be. After an examination, he was told that an ear infection was causing his balance to be off and him to faint. They kept him in for observation until he stopped fainting and would be safe at home alone. 

He told me that the first night he couldn't sleep. The man in the bed next to him would groan throughout the night in agony. He didn't know what was wrong with him, but it was too late for a nice chat, so he remained silent. 

The second night wasn't much different, but Liam managed to sleep for a few hours, from about 3am until around 10am. He hadn't faint for a while and felt he was getting a lot better, hoping that he would be able to go home soon.

Later that day, the man in the bed next to him awoke. 

""Hi, I'm Jim."" He introduced himself. ""What are you in for?"". My brother explained his ear infection and that he had fainted and fallen into things, and asked why Jim was here.

""Well..."" He began. ""I don't really know. I was only in here for a broken leg initially. Then I fell ill. I think they're keeping me here.""

""What? How?"" Liam asked. 

""When I was close to recovery, I told the nurses that I felt ready to go home. Later that night, I woke up to see a nurse leaving my bed. She didn't see me, but I noticed that my leg felt funny. I think she did something to it. I don't know what... but the next day I fell terribly ill with pneumonia. This was nearly a week ago, and i'm still here, not getting much better. Don't tell them when you're ready to go home... just go."" His face was dead serious. 

Liam was a bit worried about Jim's story, but assumed he was a bit crazy and paranoid about the nurses. He ignored Jim's advice and told the nurse that he was ready to go home. He felt the disappointed gaze of Jim fall upon him as the nurse walked away.

""Well... Good luck."" Jim sighed. ""I hope they let you out."" 

""Thanks."" Liam replied. The nurse later returned and confirmed that the doctor would look at his ears the following day. 

That night, Liam had another restless night. Jim was groaning again, but Liam was beginning to grow used to that. 

Suddenly the groaning stopped. The silence of the night was instead met with the screams of Jim.

""AARGHH. STOP. GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME. DONT YOU DARE PUT THAT NEEDLE NEAR ME. FUCK OFF!"" the curtain was closed around him. Liam couldn't see what was going on. He was too scared to speak. 

The curtain swiped open. Liam pretended to be asleep, his eyes slightly open. He saw a nurse leave Jim's bed. Jim was laying in his bed, holding his legs. 

""A..Are you okay?"" Liam whispered. ""What the fuck just happened?"" 

""I told you, man. The nurses are keeping me here. They saw that I was getting better again and she just stuck a fucking needle in my leg again. I'm not getting out of here any time soon."" Jim replied. He revealed his leg to Liam - there was a small hole with blood dripping out of it. He had indeed been injected with something. 

Liam laid down in shock. Jim decided that now the attack was over, it was safe to sleep. 

When Liam awoke the following morning, Jim was gone. Liam asked a nurse where Jim was, and the nurse apologetically replied 

""Mr Morris passed away late last night"". How could that be? He was well enough to hold a conversation with Liam just hours earlier to his apparent death. The injection. It must have been the injection. 

I visited Liam later that day and he told me of the events. He begged me to sign him out and get him home that day. He was desperate. He was not in safe hands there, after all. I tried to sign him out, but the doctor assured me that it was in the best interest to stay one more night to ensure the infection had completely cleared. I reluctantly agreed. 

I visited again the next day and Liam was in a terrible state. He was pale, his face was sweaty. He even had a temperature... he was in a much worse state to what I had seen him like the day before. The doctor told me it was just a side affect of the medicine they had given him. Liam told me otherwise. 

""They attacked me, Kate. That's the only way i can describe it... I was pretending to sleep late last night and a nurse came in. She rolled me over, and prepared my leg for an injection. You know what they do, they wipe it with some sort of liquid. I startled her when I asked her what she was doing. She told me it was 'just procedure'. I asked her to stop and said that i'd rather not have the treatment. She got aggressive. Called another nurse. One held me down while she injected me. I screamed but nobody came. Now all of a sudden I'm ill. I'm not getting out of here, Kate. I'm going to die in this bed. Just like Jim."" He began rocking back and forth as I tried to comfort him. He was soaked with sweat. 

I asked his doctor what was wrong with him, and the doctor told me it was pneumonia. My heart sunk. It was just like Jim. Liam was right - he wasn't safe here. I needed to get him out. 

""I'll be back tomorrow to get you out of here"" I told Liam. ""They won't let me today... and now that they have a clue that I want to get you out, they're all watching me. I was almost escorted out when I shouted at the doctor. Tomorrow I can do it quietly, when i'm not being watched so closely."" Liam agreed. 

The following day I returned to the hospital. Liam told me the nurse had not returned that night. I put him in a wheelchair and took him to the toilets. I gave him some clothes that I had collected from his apartment and he changed. I asked a nurse to bring me any belongings he had left with the desk, stating that he had asked me to take them home for him. The nurse agreed and brought me his things without a word. We escaped and I took him home. Before leaving, we slyly stole the 'sign out' clip board, and Liam was able to sign it. He was legally free. 

Three days later Liam was found dead in his apartment. The pneumonia had gotten worse and, without treatment, took his life. He left a note. It read: 

""I was taken into the hospital with an ear infection. I left without said ear infection, but with bigger problems. I was abused. I have made a realization; either the secret injections being given are procedures to keep population down, or, they are ways to make medicine companies money. After all, they make money through our illness - they don't really want us to recover. I would not advise anyone who is not dying to stay in a hospital - definitely not alone. There, you will never truly be in safe hands.""

AfterYourHeart,0,,11,1r7cv5,,7,"This is an update from: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r1po8/dead_ends/)

Ok! I have a little bit of time. I’m not sure when they’ll be back so I have to be careful.

That day, the day Pugsley died, Joe and I talked about it after Sophia had gone to bed. He swore he didn’t leave the window open. He always had an encyclopedic memory, remembering the tiniest little things about just about everything, so I believed him. I know I didn’t open the window. I also know that when I left to pick up Sophia, I had to un-deadbolt the front door. Joe quickly went down to check the back door. Also locked. We decided to just drop it and we went to sleep. If I remember correctly, I didn’t sleep well that night.

I wish Joe would come visit me. They said I could have visitors occasionally if I was well behaved. It sure does get lonely in here. I mean, there are others, but man do they have issues! I’d rather just keep to myself. At least I have my art. They even let me try to sell it, well rather, they let an art gallery try to sell them, and occasionally someone buys one. I plan on putting these letters in the back of one whenever this is finished. Hey! Maybe that’s how you’re reading this. If so, thank you for buying my art. I hope you enjoy it.

I remember the day I painted my daughter’s eighth birthday portrait. I had never tried such a thing before, but she was so beautiful that I had to at least try. Her hair was blonde and getting quite long. She liked to straighten it. She had the look that screamed head cheerleader, queen bee, but I always hoped she grow up to be a scientist, or an engineer. She was so smart. With her smile, she could get away with murder. She was missing a few teeth at the time, and a few more were still growing back. That just made her even cuter. Looking at her was like looking into the heart of your childhood. She always made me feel young. I loved going on adventures with her.

The day I painted her, I needed her to sit still for a while, and I wanted to try and make it fun for her. I wanted to paint her smiling, not bored out of her mind. The first step was music. She loved music and she loved to sing. She was pretty good at it too. Then I came up with a great idea. I got her her own easel, canvas, and paints, and figured we could paint together. I’d help her figure out what she wanted to paint and get her started, and then I’dl paint her.

Just thinking about that day helps me almost remember what it’s like to be happy. We had so much fun. We listened to music, sang and danced a bit, painted (she decided to paint me back), and talked about just about everything. She told me all about her new school and the friends she was making. She was such a people person. People were drawn to her and always wanted to be around her. Looking at her, it astounded me how quickly she was growing. When did she get so tall?

At the end of the day we did our reveal. I showed her my painting and she showed me hers. I have to admit, I was pretty impressed by hers. Looks like “artist” could be added to the list of things she could be when she grew up. We decided we’d hang them together in the hallway once they had dried. I wasn’t quite ready for the day to be over, so after we cleaned up, I took her out to eat.

Joe got home after Sophia’s bedtime. I proudly took him to the spare room to show off our paintings. I turned on the light and Joe laughed. I screamed. I explained to Joe that I didn’t do this. That when Sophia and I had gone to dinner, it was just a normal portrait. That someone else must’ve come in and painted over the original painting, altering it. He stood silently, staring at me for a moment. Like he was trying to figure out if this was some kind of weird prank. He then kissed me on the forehead, told me we would figure this out later, and went to watch a movie. After he walked away I turned back to look at the painting.

Whoever had done it had blackened out her eyes. They had also paled her skin, and given her deep circles under her eyes. It reminded me of a picture I had seen when I looked up black-eyed kids. I made the mistake of looking it up at work, and the picture had stunned me so badly, that I immediately drew all the blinds and curtains in the place and covered all the windows. I am usually not that much of a chicken, but for some reason that picture had a serious effect on me, and now there I was staring at my daughter, turned into a black-eyed kid. 

I quickly destroyed the painting. I never showed it to Sophia. She had been so excited to see a painting of herself. The next few days were her scheduled days to stay at her dad’s, so I decided to try to repaint it. The duplicate was pretty good. Not quite as good as the original, but it was pretty close.

The next morning, I went to check on the duplicate and it had been ripped to shreds. I showed Joe, but he shook it off. This time he was convinced that it was some kind of joke. He swore he wasn’t falling for it. Then he went off to work. I sat and cried for a while, burned the painting, and tried one last time. This time I hid the painting, and this time the painting stayed safe.

Ok. It’s almost meds time. I better hide this again. I hate the meds they give me. They make me feel so weird. I don’t even know what day it is anymore.
",Dead Ends,18,nosleep
NightOfTheLlamas,4,,8,1r6rmn,,11,"There are few things that drive me mad. I don’t even understand why they get me so worked up in the first place. I’m not OCD or anything of the sort. It’s just that I can’t stand things such as the sliding door when it is open. It should be closed at all times. The door is just a small problem compared to my shower. It drips. 

At first I could turn the shower handle and the dripping would come to an end. It was inconvenient at times because I would stop whatever I was doing to shut up the *drip, drip, drip.* Sometimes my food would burn slightly or I would miss a phone call cause I was busy pushing around the handle to end the sound. I really don’t mind though because it ended that cursed dripping and that’s all that really matters to me. 

It got worse. When I turned the handle to end the sounds it would start up again randomly later. I would be watching Netflix or reading a good book when I hear *drip, drip, drip.* It doesn’t ever end. All through the day the shower leaks water out in a steady rhythmic beat. It drives me crazy. 

After a week or so I couldn’t handle the sounds anymore. I couldn’t handle the *drip, drip, drip.* I bought a new shower head thinking that would solve the problem. After setting it up I blew out a breath of relief. The dripping would finally end now. I ate dinner that night happy. I closed the open sliding door before settling myself on the couch with my laptop. I was on Netflix and about half way through my show I heard something. *Drip, drip, drip.* Covering my ears with my hands didn’t stop the sounds from making their way to my brain. I could still hear it. 

I tried everything I could think of. I called the plumber but that did nothing. I wrapped a rag around the shower head. That worked until the rag started to drip from all of it’s water build up. I also took the rag and placed it at the bottom of the shower hoping that it would mute the dripping sounds. This worked yet it didn’t. I could no longer hear the dripping but I could *feel* the drops of water slamming against the rag. 

In the end I just spent as little time in my own home as I could. There was no way to be bothered by the shower if I wasn’t even inside of the house. This worked until I had to go home and try to sleep. Which ended up with me not getting a wink of sleep. I would stare up at the ceiling with my eyes unblinking just listening to the shower leak. I would pray in my head that this torture would end somehow.  

I stopped sleeping in my home. I hated going to that place. Whenever my feet hit the floorboards of that house it was as if at that moment the shower started to leak again. I slept at a friend’s house. She never asked questions as to why I wished to stay with her. That was something I was dearly grateful for.

It has been a few weeks since I started to live here. I haven’t felt this much peace in a while. I was heading to the kitchen for a glass of water. It was almost midnight and the sky was pitch black. As I walk down the halls towards the kitchen I freeze. To my left was the bathroom door. Through the wood I could hear a soft *drip, drip, drip.* ","Drip, Drip, Drip",19,nosleep

fennelliott,0,,6,1r1j2w,,8,"I think the scariest number in the world is 1. Singular and individual in it's stance, only separated by 9 decimal points to 0. It's the foundation of other gathered numbers to be made stronger by the additive of another. However, if the unit remains alone it can be a reflection of myself. There are others number out there, but what are they but to be counted, added, subtracted, and divided. In a way, there's solace in being singular, but safety is not reassured.

I can count the number of steps it take me to cross the hallway into my bedroom by the measure of 12 units to create what is called a foot. 15 1/2 feet takes me from end to the other, each print of my callous sole leaving behind an echo of flesh sticking to hardwood floor. Each step is lonelier than the next.

There are portraits to the side of me of my family, filtered out by a camera lens portrayal of vintage black and white with an average border frame 9 x 12 inches protected by glass and wood. The reflection of my bedroom light shines to the side of it, 11 feet more until I reach the shimmering source. However the darkness of the picture reflects something else, more darkness than light, 6 feet behind me.

I cross a doorway that leads into an open room. Two bunk beds found belonging to my sisters, and a faded moon glow behind the blue curtains whipping gently upwards toward me by the open air flowing in. Someone forgot to close their window, and I think to step into their bedroom to close it, but then that would wake them. Also, it would subtract my distance to my bedroom, and I would be closer to the darkness lurking 5 feet now behind me. It reflects my light as well, an edge sharper than the glass that holds the photo of my loved ones intact. More intact than the pieces of my sisters hidden beneath their blankets, soaking a dark color that a small stream of moonlight shows.

I step closer now to my room, the T.V. hissing at me in white noise. I had only gotten drink of water after checking upon the noise that came down stairs. A crashing sound, not like glass but like a muffled collapse on the hardwood floor embedded all around. I would have went to check on my dad to see if he heard it too, but he's with mom in the other bedroom across from me. I know, having seen his shadow creep into bed with her, and the rustle they made to wrap around one another. My mom gave in, and I had passed by before they would noticed or I would have seen too much. She lays quiet now, drooped across her bed in slashes of romantic red, her favorite color.

Feet creak closer behind me in another gained step.

My room is in it's warm glow with the study light turned on, the T.V. static buzzing, and my phone vibrating in the pocket of my pajamas. I stop to look at the text just before my door. I stand as a silhouette with a face lit by the small framed screen fitted in the palms of my hands. I notice the text before I notice the added step, and quickly I read, ""Closet Keeper, Family Seeker. 1 by 1, piece my piece, the family fits in the closet.""

the text is disturbing, even as I step into the comfort of glow, reaching to close the door but instead find myself grabbing the hand of another. Lifeless it feels, sheltered by a thick fabric in tight grip to the something that extends into my back. I don't notice it until the withdrawal of what I thought was only a cold chill running against my spine. More and more I feel the same chill run up and down my body with gathered droplets spraying across or falling down around me and in my uncontrollable fall, I spread out flat 6 feet even. Straight and presented in that same red as my mother. That same sound as my fathers muffle down stairs. and slowly chopped piece by piece like my sibling.

Together we are gathered in the closet, one by one. However we do not form anything greater beyond the mess we contribute to my bedroom floor. Though I was not the first, I am number 1. Alone together, and singled out amongst the living as a dead soul. I am afraid of 1, for even in number there is still me and you. We are individual, and only more bodies prove that we are just that. Alone in fight, and alone in death.

BOATSSnHOESSS,2,,1,1rdzvd,,10,"So when I was 15 my love was having a bonfire on Saturday nights. Although one thing did change that.
I live in way out in the country part of town so having a fire was usual, hearing coyotes were usual, and that sort of thing. So this night me and my friends decided we were going to stay out in a tent tonight, so me and my friend allen went in my house to get blankets and food. This is when I knew something was wrong, a sudden sense of dread came over me as we returned outside to my friend Ryan and Cory running towards us screaming bloody murder. Cory explained what he had heard, he said something made a noise sounding almost like a panther. I went back to the fire leading the pack when i turn on the spotlight (i luckily grabbed just in case) and began sweeping across the woodline, thats when i spotted it. It was a grotesque pure white creature with hollow black eyes staring at us. I was petrified out of fear. My friends ran away back into my house. I stayed. I couldn't move an inch. Then it began crawling at me on all fours, but there was something wrong with it. Its arms were almost backwards on its arms. Then it screached at me. Ill never forget that horrible sounding scream. It made me think of death. That's when I decided I needed to get the hell out of there. I began running back to my house, unaware of where the creature is I looked back to see it crawling right behind me. Thats when i saw its face and claws. Its mouth was filled with jagged sharp teeth and the claws were not animal like, almost like someone carved bone into a razor sharp knife. I gained speed and jumped over the fence at full speed causing me to fall. I got up and screamed and starting waving my arms as if the creature were a bear then I realized it was gone. I walked back home and told my parents. They didn't believe me though.
But to this day 4 years later I have no clue what this creature was or wanted.",Louisiana Demon,11,nosleep
kenandmforever,1,,2,1rc5s5,,9,"Hey, guys. Long-time lurker, first time poster…I guess I finally have something to post about. Everything’s just been wrong the past few weeks. I miss her so much. I know this isn’t a therapy subreddit or anything, but I was just thinking…maybe if I can get these thoughts out, they’ll stop bothering me. It’s just, I should have been paying attention, you know? I should have seen something was wrong. But I didn’t, and now she’s gone, and it’s all my fault.

I guess I should start at the beginning. She was my first serious girlfriend – I’ll call her M, to protect her privacy. Last thing I would want is her family finding out I’m talking about this on some site for thousands to see. Anyway, M and I worked together at a tutoring place on campus. It was my first job, and I was nervous, but she helped me figure everything out. M was really shy – she could almost never meet my eye, and her voice was super-quiet – but really sweet, once I coaxed her into talking. I got the impression she didn’t think too highly of herself; whenever I tried talking to her about her major or anything, she’d change the subject. All I really got was that she was a Bio major, and she was working on some research project about some new “cestoda,” whatever that meant. But she liked hearing about me and my major – English, I’ve never been science-inclined – and laughed at my jokes and everything, so we had a good time.

After our shifts were over, we’d go to the Subways down the street sometimes; I would always offer to get her something, but she always turned me down. She would just watch me eat while we sat together. It always made me feel kinda bad, especially since she was so small; it was like eating in front of an African kid, or something. But she never seemed to mind, so I got over it. We became good friends.

Eventually I asked her out for dinner and a movie. I can’t even remember what we saw – some remake horror flick about mind-controlling carnivorous worms, or something? – but we had a good time. We were laughing through the whole thing, and she kept pointing out the impossibilities and throwing all her science knowledge around. I don’t want to sound weird, but I found it pretty hot.

But by the time we got back to the car, she had stopped smiling. She said she didn’t feel too good, like she was sick or something. She said she wanted to walk back to her apartment – she lived just off campus, and was really big into fitness and everything – but it was like twenty minutes away and in the middle of the night, so I drove her home. She got out, said goodnight, and that was it. No kiss, nothing.

I went home thinking I had blown it, but when we had the same shift again, she was really happy. Kept saying she’d had a great time, and everything. So we went out on a few more dates. I let her pick what we did – she never wanted to go out to eat, but she did teach me how to ice skate, and we went on a few hikes, even some 5k runs. Those were the worst, but it was worth it to see the way she lit up. 

At the end of each one, I kept wanting to kiss her, but she was really sheepish about it. Every time I went in for one, she’d turn her head, or peck me on the cheek before I could. She was always embarrassed about it and apologized, but I figured she just wasn’t ready; she didn’t seem the type to have done a lot of dating herself. That was fine, I wasn’t going to rush her into anything.

The first time we kissed was like three weeks after we started dating – and I won’t say anything but wow. At this point, I realized I was completely head over heels for this girl. She was smart, she was funny, and she liked me, which was different from most girls. We started “going steady” after that – and that’s when everything started changing. The signs that something was wrong had been present before, but they really should have become apparent afterwards. God, I’m so stupid.

She started wearing big, baggy clothes to work – huge stifling sweaters, that sort of thing. I wondered if one of the guys at work was hitting on her or something and making her uncomfortable, but they were all either huge or really friendly, and I didn’t want to ask. She would shake sometimes, too, like she was cold, even when she was being swallowed up by these enormous shirts. I’d hug her and she’d lean into me, but it was like I couldn’t even feel her underneath the clothes. 

She started eating a lot. Like, I mean, a ton. When we went to Subway now, she’d put away two footlongs like it was nothing. I took her out to a few ritzy places, but the portions were always too small, so we would end up getting burgers or something afterwards. I didn’t really mind – it was nice to see that she felt comfortable enough to stuff herself around me, I guess. We were kissing a lot more, too, which was of course awesome. Because of her, I was into hiking and stuff now, so I felt great. Everything seemed perfect. Maybe that’s why I wasn’t noticing the signs.

I stayed over at her place a few times, as things got more serious, but we never went too far. She was still embarrassed about that sort of thing, I think – but that was fine, I could wait. Her couch was still infinitely better than my dorm bed anyway, and her fridge was always heaped with food – mostly meat, granted, but I’m no vegetarian. 

Despite all her eating, though, she seemed to be getting thinner. Her face was paler, and she was more withdrawn. Sometimes she would just stare into space for half an hour at a time, not saying anything, only to shake herself as I touched her or called her name a few times. She started calling into work sick, and when I visited her she would just be curled up on her couch heaped in blankets, the remnants of some sandwich or a pizza box scattered around her. I started to get worried, but I wasn’t worried enough.

Once, when we were making out, for a moment I felt something more than just her tongue in my mouth. The feeling didn’t really leap out at me – it was just a sort of niggling sensation, swallowed up by everything else that was going on – but I kinda stopped, and she drew back and looked at me with curiosity. I swallowed, ran my tongue around my mouth a few times, but decided I had just imagined it. Then, she asked what was wrong, and something flickered in her eyes.

I don’t mean that in a poetic, English-major-y way. I mean I literally thought I saw something tiny dart through her eye.

I freaked out, needless to say, but she was just confused. She said she didn’t feel anything, and even when I shined a light on her eye to see for sure, there was nothing there. I thought I was just going a little bit crazy, so she went to bed and I stayed on the couch. I shouldn’t have dismissed it. I should have taken her to the doctor. Damn it, why didn’t I?

Things got worse. She stopped coming into work entirely, and I began taking time off to go make sure she was okay. Her staring into space was more pronounced than before, as was her shaking. When she got up and walked around, it was disjointed, like she had forgotten how to use her body. And she kept asking for food, all the time. At first it was just sandwiches, then it was hamburgers, then it was just the burger itself. Then, once, she asked if I could just give one to her raw.

I was taken aback, disgusted, but she just looked so pitiful, shrinking into her bed with all her pillows and everything fluffed up around her. So I did. Well, I cooked it a little, but it was still plenty pink in the middle when I brought it to her. She ate the whole thing, gave me a sleepy smile, and fell asleep.

I went back to my couch, silently freaking out. It was all too weird for me. I’d never heard of anything like this. I’d heard about feeding a cold and starving a fever or whatever, but this was ridiculous. I decided I was going to take her to the doctor the next morning, whether she wanted to go or not.

But when the morning came, she wasn’t in bed. I could hear the shower running in her bathroom. Frankly, I was a bit surprised she could even manage to walk that far, as weak as she seemed. But I decided I’d give her some space; if she was showering, maybe she was feeling better.

I decided I’d go and make myself a sandwich. When I came back, the shower was still running, which was weird. It had been more than thirty minutes – I had ended up making myself a second sandwich and had eaten a hot dog, too. I was just weirdly hungry. Anyway, by now I was a little concerned. I had no idea how long she had been in there before I had woken up, and she wasn’t the kind to take really long showers anyway.

“M?” I called, opening the door a crack. “You okay?”

No response.

“M?”

Still nothing. God, the sound of the water hitting her is still in my head.

I stepped inside. The steam was almost blinding; there was a window she usually opened to let most of it out, but it was closed. “M?”

I pulled back the curtain, and there she was, sprawled on the tile, blood pooling around her fractured skull, her eyes gazing sightlessly upwards as the rain pelted her naked body. But that was not the worst part. The worst part was that she looked like a skeleton. I still remember those pictures of the Holocaust victims we all see in high school, where they look more dead than alive; that was exactly what she looked like. She was so painfully thin, it was a wonder she had managed to walk on her matchstick legs at all. Her ribs looked like they were about to poke through her skin. But her belly…that was round and full, like the distended ones you see in those images of African children on the charity commercials. 

I knelt by her, but of course there was nothing I could do. She was long gone. She must have collapsed and hit herself on the temperature knob on the way down. It didn’t look as though she had struggled at all; she would have died almost instantly.

I stayed there for a long time, just staring. A few times, I thought I saw her stomach move – but of course that was crazy. It was just the way the water hit her. Then, in a daze, I left. I called 911 – even though it was far past that now, obviously – and explained what had happened. The lady on the phone promised to send a cops and an ambulance my way immediately, even though there was no need.

Then I sat down, and made some bacon.

I can’t even really remember what happened when they arrived. There were just people swarming all over my house, suddenly. Two big cops started asking me questions. I don’t really remember what I said. They kept asking me why I was eating, and I just kept repeating that I was hungry, over and over. One said I needed to go to the station with them, so I did.

While I was there, they wouldn’t give me any food, not even a bag of chips, no matter how much I asked. They kept asking me how I couldn’t have known she was starving, how I couldn’t have known something was wrong, over and over and over. All I could say was that I didn’t know. She’d hidden it all from me, with her huge clothes and thick blankets. I kept saying if I had known, I would have helped her. I would have saved her. Now I know she was too far gone for that, of course. I hadn’t seen the signs in time, and it was too late.

Eventually, they let me go. Later in the day, someone called her apartment, but I didn’t pick up. A doctor, I think, or maybe a coroner. They left a message. Something about her stomach. It sounded important, but I couldn’t bring myself to listen again. I wandered around her apartment for hours, touching everything that had belonged to her as if it would bring her back. As if I could take back her mistakes, and mine.

She must have had some sort of eating disorder, I guess. Looking back, the way she acted when we first met sounds like classic anorexia…but then it must have changed into something else, I don’t know. Maybe she was eating a lot and then throwing it up – I’ve heard about that on TV.

Sometimes I can’t help but think back to her stomach, how swollen it had been, how deformed. I have no idea what could have caused that. But it doesn’t really matter now, does it? She’s dead, and it’s my fault.

I’m sorry, guys. There’s not a whole lot else I can say. The past few weeks have just been awful. They kept it out of the news, but somehow people keep asking me about it anyway, wondering why I didn’t do something, why I didn’t see. I don’t know. I’ve just been living in a daze since it happened, like I can’t feel anything at all. Nothing seems right. Sometimes my hands kinda jerk on their own, when I’m just zoning out. I keep waking up in the middle of the night, feeling like I’m starving, but I think I’ve been losing weight. Grief, probably. I’ve heard it can do that to you. I really don’t know. I just kinda wish it would end.

Again, I’m sorry. This is a lot to dump on you all, but I just have to get it out. I’m going to post this and then lie down for awhile, I think. I haven’t gone to work in four days now. Just haven’t felt up to it. Maybe make myself a burger – that sounds good. Don’t think I’ll cook it, though. My stomach seems to handle it better when it’s fresh.

Lady_rosalie,6,,4,1rbth4,,9,"I found a journal today while sifting through some things at a little local secondhand shop. They have a lot of old and cool things, so I tend to go there a lot. I decided to buy it and a few other things. I didn't look through the diary, since honestly I assumed it would be empty. Well when I curled up to write something's a few minutes ago, I saw it wasn't empty at all. Or even that old!

The first page was dated September 23rd, 1993. Only two decades ago. It was filled with normal teenage things. The author, a 16 year old named Lily, was worried about school, and the hunky guys and if they liked her. Boring things, yet I kept reading. I couldn't help it. I read things Lily might not have told anyone. It was kinda cool. 

Then I got to October 3rd, 1993. Lily and her (B.F.F4evur) Sarah, as well as a few other girls, Ruth, Emily, and Jessica, came over to stay the night. A slumber party. After doing the normal things, the pulled out a ouija. Oh great, I thought, it would be a bunch of 'scary' occurances. But nope. Nothing happened according to Lily. But it spurred talk of the local haunts. 

""Everyone knows about these places. Like, pinkys cave, that crying statue, there's like, two insane asylums, the screaming bridge, lovers gate and witches gate. Well of course we talked a put them. Emily said she swears she saw a ghost at lovers gate. Yeah right. Ghosts are totally bogus. Well whatever. I decided, with S.E.J.R's encouragement of course, that I would spend the night at each one. So there chickens. I'd write about it too. Don't worry Diary. The times I go will be reaaaally dull."" 

I felt a chill go up my spine and I've stopped. I looked at the last paper pages, to see if it went on. There was nothing. She stopped writing like, a quarter of the way to the end. What's even worse, is the dry red shit on some of the papers. I think it's blood, but it's not like it's soaked. But still...I want to go on, but I'm worried. What if she did go? What did she find? 

I'm going to try and do research on this. Figure out who Lily was, and hopefully, I'll find that she alive, well, and that blood is just from something else. ",The Diary,13,nosleep
RayAllenLovecraft2,0,,8,1r7jhu,,8,"A rather peculiar incident happened not too long ago on a cold, rainy night.  It was a little past 2 a.m. when I left my friend's house.  Its a old Victorian house in a once thriving town.  As I was driving down the empty road, I saw a taxi cab in a left turn lane.  I was able to see it's lights from about a mile away.  The green glow shined through the mist and created this aura on the surprisingly empty street.  This is not uncommon in a large town such as this, but the thing that puzzled me is where it was turning into.  The taxi was turning into a mental institution for the criminally insane.  This event happened to startle me because it was so early in the morning.  I continued to drive home wondering why someone was being released so early.  The next day, I went to school.  My school is only a stone's throw away from the mental hospital.  As I walked out of my last class I saw a familiar glow.  It was that green taxi again.  I didn't think much of it, being a college. I see taxis picking up people all the time.  As I hiked across the parking lot and got into my car I noticed it was still there.  I didn't really pay much attention to it because classes can run pretty late, maybe someone was taking there time walking through the campus.  As I tore out of the parking lot I noticed it wasn't there.  Maybe the driver got pissed and left.  I met up with some friends from class at a Mexican restaurant down the street.  As we were waiting for our food I told them about the coincidence that happened the night before and what just happened in the parking lot.  My friend, whose family had lived in the area for a long time, told me more about the mental institution.  He told me about how they once tested drugs on the patients and preformed lobotomies up until the 1950's.  The room was dead silent.  Luckily, our food came out shortly after the disturbing conversation.  When we finished eating, we talked more about it.  I was becoming obsessed with it.  Why was it there so late? Who where they picking up?  Was it the same taxi? Our conversation was cut short when the bill came to the table.  We were too busy counting our singles and change (we are college students!) to be talking about the mental hospital.  We stepped outside and had a cigarette before we would part ways.  We were standing in a empty parking lot at around 10:30 p.m. when we noticed something out of the ordinary.  We saw the green taxi picking someone up at the restaurant across the street.  It was just parked there.  We abruptly said goodbye and got into our cars.  I drove home without stopping.  The next night at dinner, I told my parents what has been going on.  They didn't believe that a green taxi has been following me around.  Days and days passed and I continued to see the taxi again.  I was getting really paranoid.  I started to take days off of school to avoid seeing it.  My parents were deeply concerned with my behavior and suggested that I see a psychologist.  I mustered up the courage and drove there myself, after all, I am a college student.  I couldn't concentrate on the road.  I was afraid that I would see it again.  I was so bent out of shape, I accidentally ran through a red light while making a right turn.  I heard somebody laying on their horn.  I was shocked to see who I pulled out in front of.  It was the green taxi!  I raced to the psychologist.  I ran as fast as I could into the office.  The councilor was frightened by my actions.  She took me into her office to hide me from the other patients.  I told her everything. She was gravely concerned with my state.  She suggested that I be admitted.  My heart dropped. I started to break out in a cold sweat.  She left the room to make a phone call.  I assumed that she was notifying my parents that I was being taken in.  She talked to me for a few more minutes until she got a call.  Once she hung up, she told me my ride was here.  I was puzzled.  She walked me out of the building and told me she called a cab.  I froze.  I looked out the glass doors and saw the green taxi parked in front of the exit.  I broke out into a violent fit, thrashing and resisting.  I was not getting in there.  Two security guards restrained me and started to drag me in the cab.  We were driving down the same street that I first saw it on.  We got into the left turn lane and entered through the opened gates.  I gotta cut this short.  My computer time is up.  The hospital only gives you an hour a day. I hope you enjoyed the story.

I had two glasses of wine while my clothes were in the drier and fell asleep on the couch around eleven. I woke up at three-thirty with all the lights on, it was raining out. I love falling asleep to the rain. I tried to drift back to sleep despite feeling completely awake. I never felt the sleep pass over me, but eventually I began dreaming. In my dream I was giving my manager a ride home. It was dark and quiet in the city and I was jokingly pretending to be asleep while I was driving. I had my head leaning back on the head rest and my bottom jaw was slack so my mouth was open. But then I felt that I was stuck that way. So he started nudging my right shoulder to make me wake up. I felt panic in my dream. That's when I came out of that dream and back into my living room where I was asleep on the couch. My mouth still agape, my eyes still closed. I was short of breath. That is when I realized that I still felt the nudging sensation. Now, however, it was coming from behind the couch cushion against my right shoulder. I could feel and hear the cushion pushing me back and forth on my couch. It then felt like I was fully awake and the nudging stopped for a second. I took a second to let myself feel afraid. The nudging began again but now there was an orchestra of movements all around on my couch. The cushions under my feet were being pulled upward in short little beats, and the left side of my pillow was doing the same thing. I felt and heard the blanket next to my right ear moving like it was trying to tickle my face and ear. I allowed these hallucinations to feel real, and as soon as I gave in to their reality, I felt the sides of my pillow begin to curl up and over my face. My heart began racing, my breaths were shallow, and I still was unable to move or wake myself up. The pressure of the pillow on my face increased until it felt like I couldn't breath. I was sinking into my couch, the pressure was on my entire body now. I knew I had let my fear fuel this hallucination for too long. I took a giant gasp of air, and woke up. I didn't know how to prove to myself that I was truly awake, so I stayed sitting upright with the lights on and opted out of sleep for the night. ",My dreams won't let me sleep,17,nosleep
Lady_rosalie,1,,6,1re4vh,,7,"So I tried to research this girl, Lily. Nothing on the Internet sadly. I didn't think it would be that easy. After all. I have no last name. Alley Cat, where I got the diary from, is open tomorrow. If the weather isn't bad tomorrow I'll go. 

But I did read more if the diary. There's some normal things, but October 8, 1993 she went to Pinky's cave. This is what she wrote;

""So mom thinks I'm at Sarah's. I'm spending the night or, whatever. She never calls, so I'll be good. I'm at Pinky Cave! It's like, dark so I'm writing with a flash light. The rules are all night stays. Ruth and I made a bet. Ha! She's way going to lose! Then I'll have 50 bucks! 

Okay diary. This is the legend. So like, no one knows why it was built. Or when. Some say moonshiners, some say the city. But it's not on city plans. At all. It's like, a three mile long tunnel made of concrete. Not a real cave! Anyway, so like, Robert Pinkman lived across the street from the opening and claimed it as his. A baby and her mom got caught in a super bad storm and drown in the cave. So now she haunts it, asking where's her baby. (No sight of her so far!)that's sorta all I know. Well I'll write again in a few, I'm going to eat some food. (Chips! Yum.)

2:15am So I fell asleep but I woke up and heard something weird. Like, crying. I'm sure I'm the only one down here. Maybe it was a dream or something. I'm going to try to sleep again.

5:53am I just saw it! I was getting ready to pack it up and go to Sarah's, when I saw it! Her I guess! She was white with this like super long hair and like, sorta an old dress. She was crying, then turned to me and vanished! I like ram out of there. I just now came back for my things. Okay so one thing happened. I can't wait to tell the girls though!""


And that's where that night ended. Not super spooky, I guess. But I still keep getting these chills. Like there's more to come. Pinkys cave, was actually a drainage place, built forever ago. It's on city maps though. Still I heard a woman died there too. But who knows for sure? 

Well there's more, but that's for tomorrow. I'm far to scared to read what comes next, at least at night.

""Fuck that. You need a hospital,"" said my Dad as he arced the car across the road, onto the shoulder, and back into the opposing lane, headed to the center of town. I was smushed against the door and then the back of my seat as he gunned the accelerator, giving the engine a run for its money and losing traction briefly in the process. My heart hammered in my chest and shocks of adrenaline coursed through my body. This was it. I was dying. My mom, my sister, both dead. Now it was my turn. Two minds swam around inside my skull like binary stars poised to collapse together. They took turns, rocking back and forth faster and faster, each feeling the pull of the other as they battled for control of my body. Faster and faster, approaching singularity, vibrating my perspective like an engine in a car, numbing my face and fingertips. Black encroached upon my vision as I drowned in fresh air, and then all was darkness.

""... appendix looks alright. Given her recent loss and the trauma she must have experienced witnessing the crash, it's likely she had a panic attack. Has this happened before?""

""No, never ...""

I opened my eyes. I inhaled. Sickness and death coated the inside of my nostrils. I pictured my sinuses and lungs darkening as though I was inhaling smoke from an electrical fire. Yellowed fluorescence glared down at me from the ceiling. Misery seeped into my pores and tugged my heart in several directions at once. Someone nearby was about to die and so many were suffering.

I heard beeping and someone yelled for a crash cart. Right on time.

I was alive and I was myself. But the definition of ""myself"" had changed. I felt distinctly like one person, yet knew that I consisted of two beings. We had fused together, the silver lady and I, and I was equal parts both. I examined my skin, its ghostly sheen. A greenish corkscrew-shaped worm drifted over my bed, briefly silhouetted against the glow of the fluorescent lights, and sighed dreamily.

""Well that was different.""

""Oh thank Christ, you're awake,"" my dad half-sobbed, lurching toward my side and away from the doctor.

""I'm fine, Dad. I think I had a panic attack."" A small purple leech-like thing with white spots had attached itself to his face while I was talking and slurped at a tear that had just trickled past. It shivered ecstatically and began purring.

""I thought you were dying. I just ... it would have been too much,"" he said, brushing another tear off and inadvertently dislodging the leechkitten thing. It screeched and flitted away with a farting noise.

I consulted my expanded library of memories - from when I was the silver lady. Strange and very hungry creatures loved to gather at hospitals. They fed off the dying, the vulnerable, the grieving. It seemed to be a drug for many of the darker things in the world. I mused to myself that fire was used to keep those pests away before it was used to cook meat. People were so much more in tune with reality before language let the mind shape perception.

The doctor checked me over and kept me awhile for observation. Dad and I left with a small prescription of Xanax and a referral to a local therapist. I knew I wouldn't be needing either now, but also that it would reassure my dad to go. I couldn't think of anything I wouldn't do to make him feel better, and mentally shrugged.

I wanted to go pick up my car, but Dad would have none of it. His tone told me that he'd rather walk through Hell than let me out of his sight right now, and I couldn't blame him. We went straight home, and I stared out the window in fascination. A herd of giant spotted fuzzy caterpillars were crawling across the road on the way out of town, wiggling phallic appendages on their backs quivering with the motion. We rolled the car straight through the middle of them and several popped with a glurping sound, like balloons full of soft, pulpy pudding. A tall, lanky, semitransparent humanoid was licking the red paint on a stop sign several miles later with a blue, fuzzy tongue the size of my dad's knobby hands. It paused when we pulled up and stepped over to the car in two long strides. I was slightly embarrased to notice, before it stooped over, that its wrinkly penis was the size of my forearm. I stared into one set of its chameleon-like eyes and smiled; its other eyes were flitting around and examining the car. It licked the window, leaving a slimy trail that lingered until we were nearly home.

The vast majority of the spiritual wildlife that hides in plain sight is harmless or mostly so, I knew. Extremely weird and illogical, yes, but for the most part its interactions with the world we know are trivial. Hardly surprising that we don't see much of it, considering the human desire for an orderly world: was a tiny six-armed ape just fucking my ear canal, or did that song get stuck in my head on its own? No, no earfuckers here, no sir.

My dad and I were both exhausted when we reached the house. I broke off to the kitchen while dad meandered to the living room. I popped open the freezer looking for my jumbo-sized tub of neapolitan ice cream, and was greeted by a tiny pixie-like critter with the head of a fly. It burst out of the freezer and shook its tiny segmented fist, shivering hard enough to affect its flight.

""Sorry,"" I thought at it, as though I had been telepathic my whole life. Which, technically, I suppose I had been.

""Damn right,"" it thought back. It shot me the middle finger and buzzed off, phasing through the solid glass window and toward the treeline.

Yeah, spirits are like that sometimes.

I grabbed my tub of ice cream and a spoon, because this was not a day for diets. I marched into the living room and plopped down beside my dad, who was just settling down himself. He turned the television on, and it was set much louder than it needed to be. I jumped, and so did the shadowy figure in the corner. It began screaming bloody murder. Shocked, I mentally yelled at it to quiet down, but I apparently didn't get through. Dad almost immediately turned the television down, but the figure only screamed louder and my ears began to hurt. I silently tried to reason with it for fifteen minutes, to no avail. In exasperation, I asked if it wanted some ice cream, and to my great delight it quieted down. I took the tub back into the kitchen, shadow man in tow, and scooped out a spoonful of icecream into a little saucer, which I sat in the sink. I wasn't really sure what it was going to do with frozen dessert, but I didn't really care as long as it was quiet about it. I grabbed my bottle of Xanax off the counter and tipped a couple into my palm, because it was most definitely a day for anxiolytics. I tossed them back and swallowed dry, and then went back into the living room, taking my tub. The living silhouette stayed behind.

Dad left the station on the news until it mentioned the crash, and then he channel surfed for awhile. Between the sedatives and the ice cream, I wasn't paying much attention. I whittled the strawberry down to almost nothing and then half of the chocolate before I realized I was really full and put the tub back up. The shadow man was gone and the ice cream in the saucer had warmed and melted. I mentally shrugged for the second time that day, which reminded me I needed to set up the therapy appointment. I grabbed the sheet of paper with the name and number on it, called, and scheduled an appointment. The earliest they had was about two and a half weeks from then, and would probably last an hour and a half, and could I please come early to get the paperwork filled out. I said I would and thank you very much, then hung up. I wrote the appointment down on the fridge calendar so I wouldn't forget.

I chuckled softly to myself. I was Alice falling down the rabbit hole. I needed a shaman, not a shrink, but I doubted either one could help me, and I thought back to the memories of my mother's death, of the wound in the world that had taken her away from me. I saw it over and over again; each time the person was different and so was the setting. The memories stretched back to antiquity, to the times before the written word, before hatred took the form of words at all. I knew that specter so well. To call it the devil would be misleading. To call it evil an oversimplification. I felt righteous fury well up inside me, a gift of the silver lady, a pure, single-minded longing for cleansing fire.

And then I felt the distinct impression that somewhere dark and far away, an eye had opened and turned its gaze on me.

I heard the voice as an echo carried on the wind from across a great chasm.

""My, Sarah. How you've grown.""

to me
3 minutes agoDetails
Since the no sleep community knows about some of this stuff I was wondering if you guys can help me out and maybe tell me what this thing is?
   Throughout my life I've had a couple experiences that a normal human being might perceive as...odd. Though slightly nerve wracking at times, I've been able to brush them off. They were all dismissed on account of lack of sleep or my stressful lifestyle. That was until four years ago. Four years ago began the string of events that now has my questioning my sanity. Because of what happened and what has continued happening for the past four years I have to sleep with a nightlight when I am alone. Even though I'm almost twenty years old.
   I remember the day clearly. I was fifteen years old. Fifteen and brave. Fifteen and oblivious. What did I know about anything, anyway?
   I came home from school as usual. It was such a normal and uneventful day. Painfully boring, really. It was a Friday and at 15 I didn't have much to do after school. Especially because the weekends were my father's days and he had a strict curfew of before 9 in place. No sleepovers either. I didn't mind this because I didn't have any chores to do. I was free to stuff my face with pizza and play video games all weekend. It was a pretty good setup.
   After playing with my GameCube for what seemed like ten hours, I was ready for bed. I sauntered off to the washroom, went through the motions of bedtime and was soon in what I considered pajamas. Just an old tank top and old gym shorts, really. I climbed into bed without a worry or care. After getting situated, I quickly drifted off into dreamland.
   A couple hours later I woke up. I had to pee. And bad. I sat up in bed and waited for my eyes to adjust. My light switch was on the other end of the room and I'm not the neatest person. I wanted to be sure I could make shapes out so I wouldn't step on anything on my way to the door.
   A couple seconds went by and my eyes adjusted. The room grew a few shades lighter and things were coming into view. That is, except for a spot in front of my bed.
   At the foot of my bed was a large shadow. It appeared to be the silhouette of a very tall person. I sat there, almost in a trance. Dazed and confused. And as I continues staring I noticed something. There were absolutely no features to it. It was just a black mass. That's when I understood. This thing wasn't human.
    I frantically blinked, hoping my eyes were just playing tricks on me. After every blink it was still there. Fucking staring at me. And whatever it was, it hated me. I could feel the malice coming off in waves. I knew it wanted to hurt me. To do something awful. The worst part was I was powerless to stop it.
   Fear washed over me. I could feel ice in my spine, lead in my stomach. I was completely paralyzed. I was at its mercy. My heart felt as if it would burst out of my chest. If that thing didn't rip it out first. I sat there and we stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity. Then it moved. 
   Slowly but surely it came closer and closer to my bed. My terror was reaching its peak. I was drenched in sweat. But I couldn't muster up a sound. That is, until it moved again. Slowly, it bent over me. It was getting closer as if it meant to come face to face with me. I gathered every ounce of courage I had. I shut my eyes and began screaming at the top of my lungs.
   A few seconds later, my dad came rushing in. Tears began streaming down my face and all I could say was ""There's something in my room."" My dad mistook something as someone so he checked my window, which was still locked. Then he checked my closet which was still empty. He dismissed it as a nightmare. But I know what I saw. I slept with the light on that night. And every night since then, when I'm alone I sleep with a small lamp on. A couple of times I felt brave and I have tried to sleep without a light. But I swear I can feel something there. And that is not the last time my own personal tormentor came to visit either. Does anyone know what it might be?",Can anyone tell me what the hell this thing might be?,14,nosleep
BensonHedges1,1,,7,1r8sq9,,6,"Upon arriving home last night, the first thing I did was drag my boyfriend into the room. I was happy he finally had a night off and could witness what I've been stressing out about. Seriously, you should see me. I look like a crack head - no sleep - wrinkled clothes - everything..I have to run in and out of the room to get clothes for the next day. Thank god I haven't had to go into the office.

Anyways, I've spent most of my time in the spare room and kept the door shut. My cat has been incredibly cautious, he's looking around every corner, and just sits on a chair in the kitchen that faces the hallway to the bedroom. He is normally very cuddly, he welcomes me at the door, headbutts me for attention. This has all stopped. The hair on his tail is at a constant stand-up position. I took him to the vet this morning - she says anxiety seems to be the cause. I've got some kitty-prozac, maybe I should take it? 

Anyways - we went out for dinner last night and came home and fell asleep on the couch. Around midnight we got up and went into the room, and there was no chill. The windows were closed, and there was seriously no activity. He thinks I'm nuts, but I swear this keeps getting worse! The only thing I had to show was the dark spot on the carpet...it's grown more of an amber color, looks like rust, and it smells if you get close to it. Not nearly as rancid as yesterday. He thinks maybe there was a leak in the roof or something, but I don't know...

He left for a detail this morning at 5, so I figured I'd get up and moving, I actually felt good about things. Maybe it was just some weird series of events...I will tell you though, I had some really crazy dreams last night. I don't remember them scene for scene, but there were some people who I'm sure I know, but can't put my finger on. All dead - a bunch of dead corpses laying outside all these spots of this new town I've moved to. Outside the barbershop I visited yesterday. Outside the clock tower that I thought looked so beautiful at sundown last night. Dead people laying outside a warehouse - which is where my gym resides now...it felt so vivid. I remember just walking around, and I could literally feel myself bumping up against spirits. It was so vivid that I literally sighed with relief when I woke up and noticed myself wrapped in my boyfriends arms. I felt safe. 

I digress...

The weirdness has crept back though. I showered, had breakfast, and made some coffee...though I've been using the espresso machine because the drip on the coffee pot kind of freaks me out. During my coffee making process, I heard some tapping coming from the bedroom - up against the door. The cat was sitting in front of the door, but not close enough to be causing the tapping. As I approached, it sounded more like scraping, but was really faint. 

I opened the doors, and the windows are cracked open. I didn't do this. The bed looked slept in - we had made it so nicely before he went off to work. And the floor of the shower in the bedroom was SOAKED. I did not shower in there - I used the one in the main bathroom. Someone's sleeping in this bed, someone is showering. Someone is opening the drawers in our dresser. 

I walked into the room, and there was that feeling - the feeling from my dream. It felt like I had to push through dozens of bodies to walk through the door. SO MUCH PRESSURE. You know those days when it's windy as hell out and you're leaving a department store? They have those heat lamps right before an exit and you walk outside into the freezing cold - it's such a pressure change. That was this exact feeling. I felt like I entered a totally different place - it didn't feel like my home. There was so much negative energy...I could feel it. My mind start racing with flashback of that dream I had. I was walking around this town, everything was much grey-er than normal...I felt like I was warped somewhere. It was nuts - it felt like a movie, but I know it wasn't. I know none of this was happening, but I could feel it happen. The next thing I knew - I was gasping for air with my back on the bed. I looked at the clock and it was 8am...somehow I had lost track of about 2 hours. 

I regained composure, walked to the hallway, and my cat just hissed at me. He wouldn't let me pet him, pick him up, anything. Just hisses...and I felt dizzy. I noticed some hairballs and some piles of puke from my cat, which was definitely out of normal. I lucked out, my cat produces very limited hairballs...

I immediately called the vet...

And now I'm home, freaked out again, and the door is shut. There's a pretty constant knocking, scratching, and I'm sure that I've heard the shower turn on. At one point I heard the door open and close immediately, as if someone was peeking out see if I was still here.

sineating,3,,5,1r72fb,,8,"So I'm very drunk right now and I'm sorry if this isn't super coherent.

My friend killed herself last year, in a park. An hour before they found her body another friend called me asking if I had seen her, cause she'd gone missing, and I started calling in-town friends to keep an eye out for her.

He called me again, an hour later, and said ""they found her"" and I didn't understand at first and he said ""what the fuck do you think happened?"" and, well. I hung up and curled up in the corner and cried for a little while. I thought she had hung herself.

I called another friend and she ran over to my place, and hugged me, and bought me a pack of smokes and told me we should walk. It was late, and it was dark out, and I swear to god I saw her hanging from every tree we went past, and she was staring right at me. She was waving around because the wind was fast and her feet were kicking, but she was staring right at me, I swear. She looked so angry.

We went over to a guys house to break the news, cause he's a really emotional guy and he'd need someone to hug while we told him. He cried. I stared at the wall and saw her feet kicking. 

We left, and it must have been 1am and my phone was going off but I didn't want to hear it because I kept seeing her up in the trees, except now she was crouching on top of the branches and looking at me, and there was no rope around her neck and no gun (she took half her face off, and my friend's dad was the paramedic who took her away so I know this)and she was watching me? She was creeping along the branches and moving her hands and watching me.

I went home and cried some more and I was afraid and confused and I smoked a few cigarettes to calm down (I want to go buy a pack right now but)but I could still hear her, creeping along the branches. So angry. I didn't sleep but when I did, I heard the branches creaking under her, the crying in the woods, and the rope creaking. There was no rope, but I don't think it knows.

I visited her grave at night, and the branch of the tree above it (there was no tree I am afraid) creaked and snapped and touched my neck.

I keep hearing tapping on my window at night, and when I work night shift I won't look at the trees, because suicides turn into restless spirits, don't they?

Is she even still there?

darkdreamers,0,,6,1r4n8q,,7,"Remember the old days where we used MSN as a form of communication? It was pretty sweet. We could give dancing emoticons of someone's ass and they can't do shit about it.

So back then, when they just installed this new voice note feature, I was hooked. You record a few seconds of you talking, send, and the other person can listen and reply the same way. So one day I was doing this with my friend, just voice-noting back and forth. We didn't think twice about using an actual telephone because holy shit voice notes! What a time to be alive!

So I was replying to his voice note and sent it. After sending it though, I always press play to listen back to my own note, but this time, there was nothing there. I paused, pressed play again, nothing. Quiet. As if I recorded a normal room. Then I heard a humming, not a machine hum but a woman's hum. I was around 13 or so at the time, and my voice still resembled that of a 13 year-old girl. But this voice was older and it was humming a song, really slowly. Really creepily, as if she was right next to me as I hit the record button previously. I paused it and ran out of the fucking room.

Up until today, I still don't know what that was. I quit the chat and refused to do voice notes ever again. The fuck was that?! ",Voice notes...but not my voice,13,nosleep
Darrenshan66,0,,8,1r3u6m,,7,"I walked up to the old elementry school with caution. It hadn't been used in years, and the gym had parts of a tree growing through the planks, and an entire section of it had to be torn down for having asbestos in the walls. I got to the entrance and what do ya know? It was locked. I cursed and kicked the door. I was supposed to be able to get in so I could do my project for history class. I was supposed to go to one of the oldest buildings and town and right a report on it, so I thought it would be cool to get first hand experience inside the building. I had even told the groundskeeper I was going to visit the school! But alas, the door was locked. I was right about to leave when I noticed something shining in the grass. Being curious, I walked over and picked it up. It was an old key. ""Could it really-"", I asked myself, turning towards the door. I walked up and stuck the key in and IT WORKED. Excited about my new found courage I ran into the building. The old concession stand for the gym was the first sight to greet me. Its old countertops covered in ancient dust. I pushed open the doors and entered the gym. Holes were broken in the wooden planks of the court where a tree had pushed through. I pulled out my camera and snapped a few pictures. As I looked over the newly taken photos I noticed what looked like a person standing on the stage in the background. ""Hello?"", I asked, hoping that whoever I had seen was kind enough to respond. I got no reply and decided to take a closer look at the picture. ""Must be the light"", I told myself, shrugging away the fear of whomever I had seen. Then I came to realize that there were no lights on. I decided to correct this error and walked to the back of the gym. I flipped the lightswitch and the lights burst into life. The gym became so bright that I had to cover my eyes. I walked into the middle of the gym. I was about to snap some more pictures with the flash off when the lights cut out. ""Stupid old fuse"", I said walking up to the switch. I flipped it off and on again, the lights came back on and I walked to the middle of the gym again. Then the lights turned off again! ""What the hell?"", I asked, walking up to the switch. My jaw dropped when I noticed that the switch was missing. All that was left was torn wires and twisted metal. I ran for the front door but it was sealed shut. I pulled the key out of my pocket and stuck it in the door. I yelped as the key turned red hot in my hand like a live coal. I dropped it as the metal liquified into a puddle on the floor. Just then, the lights in the gym came on again. I walked out onto the court and what I saw made me shiver. Something had left footprints in the dust. They looked like a cross between a skeletal foot and hooves. I gasped and ran to the exit at the back of the gym. I opened the door and ran down a corridor to the door to the outside. I tried the handle but it was locked. I cursed and shook the handle in anger, when I heard something and fell silent. Something was coming down the corridor. It moved on heavy feet, making clicking noises with each slow step. It made shallow breaths, almost as if it was struggling to breath. I covered my nose as the scent of rotting flesh hit me. I stared down at a puddle on the floor and got a veiw of the creature. It was wrapped in a red cloak, with tears in the seams and stains all over it. It's face was the skull of a cow, and it had long arms that touched the floor, the claws on its hands scraping the floor as it walked. I flew into a panic, i kicked at the door until the lock broke. I burst into the night and ran until I was numb, then I blacked out...


Ten weeks later the building was torn down. Some workers reported that they had found a basement littered with human remains. Then the story was never talked about again.

AfterYourHeart,2,,5,1r1po8,,8,"You ever have one of those days, one that changes your life so drastically that looking back you can’t help but wonder where you’d be if it never happened? I know I have. I also know that without that day, I would never be here. I apologize if this is a little blurred. They only let me have “soft” writing utensils. No pens. No pencils. So I’m writing this in artist’s charcoal. I don’t know why they think I’m so dangerous. I swear I’ve never hurt anyone in my life, nor would I! That’s why I’m writing this. I’m hoping that if I write it all down someone, anyone, will read it and understand my side of the story. The biggest problem there is that not even I understand my side of the story. Everything is so messed up in my head; events are out of order, somethings are blurry, others are just plain missing. Who knows, maybe I’m just writing this all down to help myself understand, but where do I even begin? Well, I supposed I already mentioned the day everything changed, so I may as well start there.

Sadly, for a day that sent my life into a quick downward spiral to hell, I don’t really remember much about it. Not the date. Not the weather. I could barely tell you the month. I can tell you this. It was night; well, I guess it could have been really early morning. I was working third shift at the time and I know I was at work. I was cleaning. I was cleaning the bathrooms more specifically. I had just gotten done with the upstairs bathroom and was getting ready to clean the downstairs bathroom.

Before I go on, I should mention that at the time I was working in a foster home for teens with mental and physical disabilities. Since I mainly worked nights, my main tasks were light housework, some dinner prep for the next day, and mainly, stay awake and make sure nothing happened to the boys during the night. It was a pretty easy job as there were only two boys at the time; one 16 and one 18, who for the most part, slept through the night. 

Anyway, where was I? Oh  yes. That night. I had finished cleaning the upstairs bathroom and was about to go clean the downstairs bathroom when I noticed the light in the garage was on. That’s weird. I knew when I got there at the beginning of my shift, that I walked up the driveway, and as it was already dark out, I would have noticed if it were on and it would have bugged me until I turned it off. I’m a stickler for not leaving the lights on. I know that I was deep in thought as I walked up. Maybe I was so distracted that I didn’t notice. I have been known to wander off in my own little world from time to time. Then again, maybe my boss left it on after I had already gotten there.

I decided that I better go check it out. After all, protector to the boys was also part of my job, and the phone was on the way to the door. I grabbed the phone, dialed 911 and put my finger on talk, ready to push it if something went wrong. Since it’s a landline, if I do call and can’t talk, heaven forbid, dispatch will still be able to know the address and send a car out to check. I crept slowly to the garage door. I’ll admit, I was terrified. I probably should have called anyway, just to be on the safe side. I made it to the garage, slowly opened the door, and peeked my head out. Empty. I gasped as I released the breath I didn’t know I was holding. Still holding the phone, just in case, I checked the back garage door. Locked. I let out a small chuckle as I started to relax and I headed back into the house, making sure to lock the garage door, and turn off the light on my way back in.

Crap. I noticed when I walked back in that in my stupid terror I had left the bathroom light on. *Sigh.* At least I could use the exercise, I joked with myself on the way back down the hall. I think I was still feeling really foolish for how worked up I let myself get. When I turned into the bathroom, a scream of terror got trapped in my throat so hard that I passed out.

I came to on the bathroom floor. I was a little achey in a few spots, but considering how hard I must’ve fallen on bare tile, it could have been way worse. Lucky for me, my head landed on the bath rug next to the shower; although, there was a bit of a ringing sound in my ears. It either went away or I got used to it quickly , because after a moment I didn’t even notice it. I slowly got up and checked out what startled me into fainting for the first time in my life. 

The mirror had writing on it. I looked closer. The writing was orange. Orange marker. Washable. Weird. Why would someone choose orange marker. That just seems like an usual choice. I mean, I know there were markers in the linen closet next to the bathroom, but who would look in a linen closet for writing utensils? I mean, it’s just not what I would expect writing on the mirror to be written with.

Wow. I can’t believe I can get so side-tracked, even at a time like this. Focus. Mirror. Orange marker (weird). Writing. Maybe one of the boys did it. Well, of the two, only one of them was verbal and literate. His bedroom was just down the hall. The other boy had his room in the basement. It was a fully finished basement that was remodeled specifically for him. He had pretty severe Autism and didn’t speak or write. I checked my phone. Not that much time had passed while I was on the floor. I decided to go down the hall and check to see if Gabe was still awake. I knew that if he had written it, he’d be giggling in his room, waiting for a reaction.

I opened his door and turned on his light. He was sound asleep. Even though he was face-up he didn’t even flinch when I turned on the overhead light. Now trust me, as the person who took care of him most nights and got him up and ready for school in the morning, I could tell when he was faking sleep. I also knew, in general, how long it took him to fall asleep. There was no way he wrote that.

I walked back to the bathroom. After looking again I couldn’t help but think, it couldn’t have been Gabe. His hand writing is atrocious. The handwriting on the mirror was fairly neat, feminine almost, and slightly familiar. Again, I couldn’t help but shake off a weird feeling, and again I should have called 911. I guess I didn’t want to be the one that had to call the cops while working, which I found stupidly embarrassing. So, after a quick yet terrifying search of the house revealed no one else and all the doors and windows locked, I cleaned off the mirror, first reading it one last time:

*“Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb.
Mary had a little lamb and she threw it out the window
The window, the second story window.”*

	
I couldn’t help but say it in the sing-songy way that my grandpa had originally taught it to me. It was a silly twist you could put on the right part of any nursery rhyme to make it even sillier. He taught it to my sisters, cousins, and I to keep us entertained on long car rides. Sometimes we’d pass it along to any friends who happened to have come with; although we quit doing it by time I was 12 or 13, so I don’t think I was friends with anyone any longer that would have learned the song with us.

I watched TV in the living room for the rest of that shift, trying to distract myself. It didn’t work at all and I jumped out of my skin at every noise. When my boss got there I blamed illness on my incomplete chore list. She believed me as I had never before not finished them, and she wished me better as I hurried off.

When I got home I curled up with my fiance and somehow managed sleep. Then again, I always felt safe in his arms. When he got up to leave, he quietly kissed me goodbye. As he slipped out the door, I slipped back to sleep.

I remember I woke up before my alarm. For some reason I was cold. I peeked one eye open and noticed Pugsley was gone. Oh well. He sleeps when daddy sleeps, I can’t expect him to sleep when I sleep too. I also noticed that Joe had left the window open again. Man, I hate it when he does that. Now I get to lay here and debate whether or not it’s worth getting up and closing the window before my alarm goes off. I decide quickly that if I close the window now, I can still jump back in bed and snooze for a little bit longer before the alarm, but when I got to the window, sleep was the last thing on my mind.

There on the sidewalk below, was Pugsley. The dog Joe, Sophia my daughter, and I had gotten together upon getting this new apartment. Joe had been so happy about having our bedroom on the second story. As I looked down, many thoughts flooded my head. One more than the rest. *“the window, the window, the second story window…”*

I put the dog in a small box, then double bagged the box with plastic bags, and put it in the garage freezer. After all, I still had to pick up Sophia from school. I would try to figure out what to tell Joe and Sophia on the way there.

They’re coming! Crap! They’re coming to check on me! I have to hide this. I don’t want them to find it. If I’m never able to continue, just know one thing. I AM NOT CRAZY!

sangarji,1,,4,1r1huu,,7,"I bought a camera last week and snapped pictures of my four year old daughter. I was excited about showing her those pictures as that would be the first time she would be seeing herself in a photograph.

When I laid the photos in front of her, she held them in her tiny beautiful hands and looked at me with a hint of confusion.

Who is this Daddy?

Its you of course, my darling. Don't you see?

No. Its not me.

Of course it is. Its my beautiful little angel.

But daddy, I don't look like this in glass ( She calls the mirror a glass ) I have blue eyes. This girl has black eyes. I have a mole on the cheek. And my hair is black. This girl has brown hair. This is not me. 

She was not lying. I know her play face. She was being earnest. 

And she was describing Sarah, my little sister who had suffocated to death in the attic 28 years ago.

While playing hide and seek with me. 

When she was four years old.

We don't have any pictures of Sarah and there is no way my daughter would've known how she looked. Unless...

00WELVAERT,5,,10,1r17ja,,5,"EDIT: Some spelling mistakes

Hey guys, I'm going to tell three real and inexplicable occurrences that have happened to me so far in my short life (Still a teenager) These occurrences involve a sound, or a sight being there that wasn't really there.
I can't really explain anything that has happened here, but I would like to share. Here it is...

The first time this had happened to me I was very young, around 7 years old. I was a confident little fellow, and after a day of playing with my brother and such I decided to sleep, in my sleeping bag, on the 3rd floor of my dads house alone...

So as I am about ready to start dreaming, with the moon out far and it being past my bedtime, I suddenly hear a man whisper to me.

The first time I had no idea what it said, completely unclear. So I freeze in pure horror, until again he whispers to me.

It still didn't say anything understandable, but at this point I was calling out for help from anyone in the form of some weird exhale of a loud shriek (That is really the best way to describe what I was doing). I was afraid if I called ""Dad!"" it would know I was trying to get away and it would hurt me.

So then it whispers to me, a little louder ""Noo no, it's okay"" ""shh shh"" as I scream for my dad as I remain frozen still from fear of moving a muscle.

Moments later my Dad rushes in to comfort me, as there was nothing there. I tell him what I heard, and even having it being the breakfast table conversation the next morning, my Dad was sure it was just my silly little child's mind playing games.

I slept in his bed that night. I knew what happened was real, it was so vivid and I still remember it all of these years later.

That was my first time experiencing something so inexpiable and supernatural, the second time was during the middle of last Summer.

So me being a stupid little fellow, me and a friend of mine decided to stay up for 2 entire days straight.

It was terrible in the first day, we could barley keep our eyes open. But coffee and monster pulled us through until the 48 hours were near over...

Nearing the end , as we are in the last hours of sleeplessness I had walked in to my room and closed the door to do something that I don't recall. It may have been to change clothes

As I'm changing, I started to hear the moaning and groaning of a person outside my window.

I took a good look outside, and saw no source of sound. It didn't get louder when I had opened the window either.

I had then started to hear my shower turn on, but when I opened my door to try and confirm someone was showering the noise stopped. I had opened and closed my door a few times and the noise stopped and started along with the door.

So I finished whatever I was doing, went in to the hallway and told my friend what happened  and that it was time to sleep. I was exhausted and confused as hell, maybe too tired to completely understand the fear I maybe should have been condoning. But, who knows.

So now comes for the most real and recent occurrence, this only happened 2 weeks ago.

So it was a Monday night, with school being off for Tuesday I managed to get my dad to drop me off to meet up with some girl to meet up with (Around 7:00 at night when he dropped me off).

The night played through, and it was eventually time for me to go (Around midnight when I left) . But luckily for me my ride fell asleep on me (Mom -.-) [More of my fault for staying with her so late]

So I didn't want to make her parents take me home, or make this anyone else's problem other than mine. So me being very tired thought ""Eh, I'll just walk, it wont take THAT long""

So I started off on my little (long as fuck ) adventure! I walked, and walked, and about 90 minutes in around 1:30 AM I'm walking by an elementary school in my neighborhood.

Everyone I have told this to has not believed me. So if you want to talk shit in the comments please don't waste your own time.

There was a leaf bag at the end of the street that connects with an intersection, but I swear to my life the leaf bag had limbs, was moving, and was on a bike.

I stared directly at it for moments at a time and it continued to ride the bike. It rode the bike, moving it's limbs but it was not going anywhere.

So, I just kept walking. Now pretty freaked out I start seeing black figures fly across my field of vision.

I just fucking ran because of that, past the elementary school, until I came across a giant parking lot for the church nearby.

So I took a breath for a moment or two, then I saw someone maybe 15 feet away. It was a pretty normal sized person, but it was wearing a full black coat, I could see nothing but black on it.

That just horrified me, I ran even more because of the adrenaline rush seeing that thing gave me. When I stopped running I could feel my pulse beat like drums. It was so irregular and strange, it would thump a few times, stop for a few seconds, and thump a few times again. I never saw that someone again.

I was very close to home at this moment, so I finished my 2 hour walk that lasted from 12AM-2AM within the next 15 minutes or so. The moment I finally made it home was amazing.

I can't say I know what was going on that night, or any of those times. But I can ensure to you that these things all really happened. I just can't explain how.",It has happened 3 times.,15,nosleep
Cremewagon,1,,5,1r15us,,9,"I'm 26 years old and I have been suffering from chronic sleep paralysis for about 9 years now.  I figured this would be a good place to recount some of the experiences I've had.

**Chicago** -  I was living with my girlfriend in a very tiny basement apartment.  The apartment was dirty and had low ceilings.  In our bedroom we had a bed and what was probably meant to be a closet in the corner of the room, only there was no door on it and no light fixture.  This corner of the room was always dark.  

My sleep paralysis dreams have always been vivid in the extreme.  Every detail is captured exactly how it would be as if I was awake.  It truly is impossible to tell the difference. 

My first incident at the apartment was one night when I fell asleep to my girlfriend watching Bridezillas in the other room.  I could see the light from the TV flashing under the doorway and hear the audio.  

Something was very wrong.  I could sense a presence and I knew it was in the dark closet/corner of my room.  It had not revealed itself, but it was there.  There is no fight or flight response in my very worst experiences.  It is just distilled terror.  I cannot move, cannot breathe, cannot scream.  That's when it comes out of the corner.  It moves very quickly.  Skittering almost.  I can see flashes of pale skin and long dark hair.  It is on the bed in seconds, I can feel the weight of it tugging on the covers.  Then it is on top of me.  I cannot breathe and I am face to face with something so evil that it is seared into my memory.  It is a woman, only she has a tiny face, her eyes are lambent green and she has draped her hair over me, trapping me right next to her face.  I can feel tiny puffs of stale breath on my cheek and the weight becomes unbearable.  I scream and wake up.  

This happened a few times, always the same woman.  Sometimes she would crawl out of the corner and across the ceiling before dropping onto my bed.  Sometimes she would just morph out of the shadows and appear on me.  This happened numerous times at this location and then she just stopped showing up.  

After a year we moved to a slightly larger apartment a few blocks away from the Belmont stop.  Sleep paralysis was very rare for me at this point.  We had lived at this place for about two months when I had another episode.

**Second Incident-**  I had just finished watching ""The Pixar Story"" on Netflix and had paused it on the credits and fell asleep with the lamp on beside me.  I had fallen asleep on my recliner so I was sitting up, which is strange because all of my other experiences I had been on my back.

When I wake up I see a massive being sitting next to me.  To put him into scale, I am sitting in the recliner and he is sitting on the ground.  The top of his head is level with my chin.  This would put him around 7-9 feet tall standing up.  Not only that but there was an aura of power that was palpable and just emanated from it.  He/it is resting there, it is the color of black marble.  I can see beads of perspiration on the skin.  Whatever it is, it is absurdly muscled and well defined.  Every possible muscle is nearly bursting out of the black marble flesh.  I can see the jugular vein in its neck beating with the pulse, black blood pumping through the spiderweb of veins under its skin.  I know now that it is a male.  His eyes are closed but I know they are completely yellow if they were to open.  I know that if I wake him I will die.  I sit there and watch him, he does nothing but breathe in and out as the perspiration rolls off his body.  This goes on for fifteen minutes or so.

When I woke up from this one I had a deep sense that I had encountered something from another realm.  That is really the only way to describe it.  It was too real.  Nothing in my room had changed, ""The Pixar Story"" was still paused and my lamp was still on.  But the presence of whatever I had just seen lingered for a long time.  

Another interesting thing about this one that sticks out.  I've never seen him again.  He just showed up once.  Which I thought was odd, because something as vivid and unique as this entity seems like a perfect thing for the mind to hold onto and conjure up again.  But it's been close to four years now and I have not seen him a second time.  I hope he never comes back, honestly.

**Third Incident-**  And now my last one.  This one happened three days ago.  I live in an apartment in Licoln, NE now and this is the first time it has happened here.  

I was laying on my side when I woke up, for some reason my phone was on and the clock is showing 2:01 a.m.  I live in the basement unit and there are orange sodium lights that shine into my room through the blinds.  One of the blinds is slightly lifted because my room-mate set her coffee there while she crocheted a scarf earlier.  Her knitting stuff is still on the chair.  At this point I start panicking because I cannot move and I know what is happening.  

There is a tapping on the window.  Really quick, light taps, followed by some scratching.  Like a cat is trying to get inside.  The orange lights start casting some strange shadows on the floor and I can see something moving outside the window.  It is moving with intelligence, trying to figure out a way in.  There are tiny puffs of humidity on the window too, so I know something is breathing on it.  At this point, I'm seriously trying to wake up because this is going to get very bad.  It moves over to the far right part of the window and starts tapping and scratching again.  Then it unlatches the window and opens it.  A frail looking arm slips in.  The skin is either dark, dark green or black and slimy.  The rest of it slips and it looks strangely cat-like, only minus the fur, and it glistens in the orange of the sodium lamps.  It just kind of sits there and stares at me with large pure black eyes.  Then it runs at me, only it moves without grace, like stop motion gone wrong.  I manage to turn my head and scream.  When I wake up I am moaning quietly.  

What bothered me about this one though is that my phone was on, and showing 2:04 a.m. when I woke up.  My phone had no reason to be on, the only thing I can figure is that I bumped into it during the episode.  

So, yup, those are my stories and yes, having these experiences have made it difficult to fall asleep some nights.  I've got a lot more of these experiences and I'll probably share them later, but this is enough for now.",I suffer from chronic sleep paralysis.,14,nosleep
the_dark_half,5,,1,1rhyj5,,7,"You know that feeling when you’re all alone and hear your name whispered? Maybe you’ve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop? Had things go missing only to re-appear in odd places? Maybe you’re like me and you lie in bed at night, only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around, nothing. 
Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately, tickling you? You check and nothing was there? I’m sure your parents tell you it’s nothing from a young age; perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination. They probably deep down fear it’s a ghost or apparition. Even they couldn’t know how much worse it really is.  Stop deluding yourself. It’s not a cobweb. It’s not the wind. It’s not nothing. It’s something far more sinister, an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention. 

Some of you, I’m sure, will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house. It’s such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do, it’s the spookiest part of a generic horror movie, because those suits in Hollywood haven’t seen what these creatures are really capable of. If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their ‘voices’. I’m sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed, taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because it’s real form is so terrifying you’d probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear, a zombie-esque state you’ll never awaken from-and that would ruin their fun too early. If you don’t die instantly, seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed; hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and I’ve heard of cases where insides have been liquefied, skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every pore.

The first time I awoke to one in my room with me, it was after I’d given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention. I had thought it was cool, I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me. I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination, until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg, followed by more spindly legs, followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs. Yep, a giant spider, bigger than a horse came into my room. I tried to scream, but that just resulted with me hyperventilating, then vomiting all over the floor. It strode in, all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away, but it held me down with its two front legs, piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devoured-which I was.  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn. I lay in bed, delirious, desperate, muttering for help. My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices, screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me. I passed out shortly after, from fear, blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later, believing to have all been a dream. I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals, birds mostly, wrapped up in what appeared to be spider’s webs, discoloured, drained of their blood and insides. All dead. I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself, dried blood caked on my body and face, puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts, my stomach, my legs and in my hair. 

The second night I encountered one of them, they took the form of my uncle. I lived with my uncle for nearly 5 years while my father was travelling almost every week for business. I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods. He didn’t know what his brother did to me. That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear, I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me. He crawled onto the bed and tied me down. I struggled, but when I did he beat me with his belt, like he had started doing when I was eight years old. I fought as hard as I could, tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably, but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl. The torture that night lasted for many hours, possibly days. I try not to remember it. I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago, when my uncle died. This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me. They’ve only grown stronger with every drop of blood, with every scream and with every hopeless sob I’ve given them.

Their true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that won’t instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane, yet; they like to take their time with their toys. The dreams for me started after those incidents. I have seen what those beings really look like and…just thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking, unable to stop retching. The other day I wasn’t careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train. In my dreams, it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world, but it all feels real. 
Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this torment…but what if when I die, I get sent to their realm, to be their plaything forever? 

It’s not just the occasional brush against my skin, the odd floor creak and the rare moment of ‘is someone calling my name?’ Now I feel them on me at all times, their rough, sharp skin cutting mine, scratching me, violating every single part of my body. Their voices scream and howl at me, maniacally taunting and laughing at my never-ending misery. Even when I shut my eyes, I still see them, their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you. 

Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts, of spirits. Yes, it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering, isn’t it? You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive; you open your mind and let them in. Don’t. What’s out there isn’t human, it isn’t some person with unfinished business, what’s out there wants you to think that, to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it. 

Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window, like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper? That creak outside your room? That faint sensation on your flesh? I hope not, because now you know what’s really there and they’ve always known about you.",Don't give them attention.,8,nosleep
Rhapsodeyus,1,,0,1rgtyq,,8,"Some may recall a story I posted a few months back, about shadow-like figures who visited me on a mission for knowledge, and afterwards, disappeared like ghosts. For those who do not recall, the story is [Curious Visitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4dv2/curious_visitors/).

If you have not read that, well, you probably haven't missed much, but it will help with the backstory for this one if you do read it.

Done reading? Good, let's continue.

This happened last night, Sunday, November 24th, 2013. I woke up at precisely 4:27 AM, and I know this because I watched my small digital alarm clock on my bedside table flip to 4:27 AM as my eyes opened. I also noticed that my lamp was off (I sleep with the light on for safety reasons, since living with cats can be hazardous). However, I could see my plain, black clock in a pale blueish light.

My brain clicked. ""My laptop is on. I must have left it on and the power went out, so it's running on battery."" Then I remembered, quite clearly, turning it off and closing it before going to bed. That's when I felt a weight at the end of my bed, sitting in front of my laptop.

I sat up, looked, and spotted a shadowy figure sitting in front of my laptop. The NoSleep submission form was up. I coughed, and said quietly, ""You could have asked."" Instead of, say, a sudden spin and a glare from Brarger, as I expected, my visitor vanished instantly.

I didn't expect that, and it startled me thoroughly. My previous visitors would never have been so rude, and certainly would have asked my permission to access my personal computer. I shifted, tossed the covers aside, and moved to the end of the bed, to read what it had written.

I now wish I hadn't.

The message ends there. I suppose I interrupted the agent and he fled.

Whether this is genuine or not, I cannot know. If it is a fake by a rogue agent, then its purpose is unclear, but it is certainly unsettling. If this is a prank, then it's impressively elaborate, yet in poor taste.

Working in fast food is never an enjoyable experience. But by far the worst part is the smell of dirty dishwater. I’m not talking about your run-of-the-mill dishes at home.

I’m talking about 600 filthy dishes soaking together in the same water for 6 hours. It creates a smell unlike anything you can imagine unless you’ve experienced it. It smells like bacon grease, vomit and in the case of one terrible night, human flesh.

It started like any other night; rude customers, a barrage of fry and burger orders, floors to be mopped. The time dragged by with each minute feeling like an hour. It was sometime between 9:35 and 43 seconds and 9:36 and 29 seconds that I heard it. 
THUNK

I paused a second while taking an order “Hello?” said the customer in the speaker. Nothing else seemed out of the ordinary, and things resumed their familiar pace.

That is, until 10:41 when I heard a pounding coming from the walk-in freezer. I left my dish sink to investigate. And my manager, Sandra stepped in front of me. “Where do you think you’re going? Wash those dishes”. She stayed in that spot, arms crossed, unmoving.

I turned back to my dishes, glancing quickly around the corner before returning to the sink. I could swear I had seen that the outside of the freezer was blocked.

I heard the tell-tale beep of a customer entering the drive thru queue.

It was then that I realized that Kelsey, the sandwich maker was nowhere to be seen. I had been so focused on my own misery that I hadn’t noticed that Sandra had started doing both sandwiches and fries. With it being late at night, there had only been three of us there. It was at this moment that with a crash, Kelsey came racing out of the freezer, shivering and MAD. She came at Sandra, howling “you BITCH”, and tackled her. 

Sandra put her hands around Kelsey’s throat and squeezed. Choking, Kelsey backed up to the wall. She flailed, and kicked, freeing herself. She ran towards the back of the restaurant, grabbing the cordless phone. “I’m calling the police, you psycho! How could you lock me in there?!”

Sandra approached slowly, palms out. “A punishment to fit a crime.” Then she grabbed a knife and with one deft movement, pressed the blade at least 3 inches into Kelsey’s stomach. With a shocked expression, Kelsey gurgled, and fell backwards into the dish sink, her hands going limp. After a few seconds, she lay still, and red began diluting into the water. 

“It was self defense, you saw” said Sandra with a sly grin, and wide unblinking eyes. The drive thru began beeping loud in my ear as I stood motionless. Sandra retreated to the office and closed the door. My eyes flicked back and forth between the door and the water. To this day, I still hear that relentless beeping, seconds before I fall asleep. And if there is a hell it smells bacon grease and blood.

frankthompson,2,,7,1redk6,,6,"There exists for all people a point. A point where the quantity of coincidences exceeds what one is willing to accept as coincidence. For a skeptic this point is rather high, while for the naive it might very well be one. Long have I thought of myself as a skeptic, particularly in regards to the paranormal. A scientist by trade, I never accept any evidence that is non-repeatable. Nor do I accept theories based on small numbers of events. I feel the need to preface my story with this short paragraph so that when I present my experiences you understand the viewpoint at which I approached them.

I grew up in a small house occupied by many members of my extended family. As such, rare was the moment in which I was ever alone in a room. Save time spent in the bathroom, someone was always within line of sight. College was much the same, having shared a rather small suite with three other students. Being alone was not a sensation I encountered until my late twenties, having had to live a rather spartan life upon discovering my chosen vocation left work opportunities few and far between; typically tackling this issue by living in small apartments with many other individuals.

I was 28 when I obtained my apartment. My apartment, no one else had any claim to the space. It was a two bedroom apartment, one bedroom utilized as my home office and the other for sleeping. I landed a job with the CDC, and even though the cost of living was higher than what I was used to in the Midwest the pay was more than enough for me to find adequate living space within my budget. I was ecstatic at first, but my enthusiasm rapidly dwindled.

The first nights were difficult. I often thought I was hearing noises within the walls, and after a few days I took to leaving the television on across the hall. This helped me sleep a bit, but the noises continued. Eventually I was content to drown them out with music at night.

I had lived in places with rats in the walls and old buildings that creaked many times before, but somehow this was different. These weren't the intermittent squeak of the floor nor the persistent chewing and skittering of a rat swarm. Odd rhythms with inconsistent breaks filled the nocturnal orchestra. Irregular beats; consistent sounds expressed in patterns I could not follow. The predictability of the music I played over it clashed heavily with the ever-present undersound.

Additionally, the noises seemed to get louder the more ambient noise was present. I first noted this phenomenon on a Saturday night when a rather eventful occurrence must have left the patrons at a nearby bar incredibly excited when they took to the streets at last call. I was awake finishing a manuscript when their merriment took to the streets, and rather than notice the commotion caused by the inebriated I first became aware of an inexplicable uptick in the level of sound coming from within my home. This noise was what broke me from my concentration, and only after it did so did I become aware of the people outside.

I began experimenting with the sound. Recording it, manipulating it. The volume increases linearly with the volume of other sounds, based on some rough audio analysis. I took to sleeping with ear plugs, and silencing all other sounds in my apartment such as to appease whatever is making the noises.

I presented the sound files and my analysis to a coworker in confidence after some time. I had little to fear regarding questions of my insanity, as I had taken some video footage as proof of the location and timing of the events. He was intrigued, but insisted it was most likely something mundane. My theory that some sort of creature or creatures were reacting to the ambient noise levels was rapidly rejected, and I felt rather silly. Still, something was occurring, and he offered to come help me seek out the source of the noise on the following weekend.

We grabbed dinner that Saturday evening, and he and I retired to my apartment shortly after sunset. It was a rather pleasant outing, and I was fairly certain that he was interested in me beyond what I had suspected initially. Still, though, the point of the evening was locating the source of the noise and that is what we set our minds to upon entering my apartment. Or rather, that is what we were planning on setting our minds to when we arrived. The noise was, disappointingly, absent.

He stayed for a few hours more, however, and we watched a movie. When it got rather late I saw him out, after agreeing to see him again outside of work. I did rather enjoy his company, and his presence seems to have kept the sound away. I went to sleep, rather giddy for what the future might hold between us, and slept more soundly than I had since moving. There were no sounds that night.

I kept busy on Sunday, barely setting foot into my apartment. While the previous night was pleasant, it quickly faded into memory as I went about running errands and keeping the rest of my life in order. I had more energy than I knew what to do with, and I meant to make the most of it. I was drained by the end of the day, but I had accomplished many tasks that I would otherwise have continued putting off. I dined alone, and went to bed early. Predictably the sounds returned.

The sounds remained a constant in my life for some time, and while they were present I simply put up with them. Eventually the previously mentioned coworker wound up spending the night for different reasons. I hadn't even thought of the sounds, nor had I mentioned them to him again since that first night. With him there they were again absent.

After a few more months we moved in together, him and I, living in my apartment. When my lease ended we moved to a larger place, and had been there around a year without incident. This week, however, he left for conference that, due to a few projects at work, I was unable to attend.

The noises began the night he left, three days ago. I recognized them instantly, and was unable to sleep. I immediately set up an audio recorder, as well as my laptop recording video and sound. They were louder than ever before, and clearer. I spent all of yesterday reviewing the recordings and analyzing the files from before, comparing now and then. Several aspects remained consistent between the recordings, and I am certain that they are the same noise. This time, however, I captured something different. The recorder I use for work is a new one, and seems to have picked up more of the sound than my laptop and other device. I can understand it, now.

There are voices. Alien and unsettling voices, as though someone taught a pack of cats to speak in disjointed sentences. Snippets of conversations that make no sense, frequently referring to me by name. They know who I am, they seem to be following me, and it appears that they... like me, in some twisted sort of way. The creatures want me to know I'm not alone. They don't want me to be sad, they want to make sure I know they're there, that they're watching me.

I slept in a hotel last night, to get away from them. I couldn't sleep with whatever they were nearby, and hadn't slept the night before. I couldn't sleep much last night either, though. It was almost too quiet... I had to turn the TV on before I could fall asleep. I went home this afternoon, intent on discovering more. A few samples of broken sentences was hardly enough evidence for me to base any conclusion on, and I needed to shake the feeling that I've gone crazy.

I ""borrowed"" a few more recorders from work and set them up around my home. At least one in every room. The plan was to discover where the noises were coming from, based on where the voices were loudest and clearest. They started shortly after dark, predictably. The sound files were sent to my laptop every few minutes, and I compared them on the fly. Consistently they are loudest in whichever room I'm in, or in whichever room has the highest levels of ambient noise (dishwasher and microwave created this pattern). The clarity, however, seems directly linked to my location and my location only. The longer I stay in a place, the better I can understand them. I can hear them... right now. I know what they're saying. I don't have to be alone again. I don't have to be alone... ever. I just have to let them in.

I don't want to be alone... I guess that's why I have this hammer now. I just need to let them into the house so they can be with me... so we can be together. The more I listen, the better it sounds. I can hardly remember why I even left last night, why I would ever want to be alone.

I'm going to let them in now. I need to find out what they are. If I come back, I'll post the audio and update. If I don't, well, someone will find the recordings. The recorders will be missed in rather short order. Wish me luck. At least I know someone will know what happened to me if I go missing.",Lonely,13,nosleep

I have been like this for a number of hours. Right now, I’m desperate. I hear a noise outside the bedroom door, my dog Monty. He pushes open the door which floods my bedroom with light. He jumps on my bed and settles next to me. I lack the strength to push him away so I try and move closer to him in order to feel his warmth. I can feel his moist breath on my neck. It’s kind of soothing. I like it. He even licks my ear. This makes me smile. 
The noise of my mother opening the downstairs door that leads to the garden pulls me out of the light sleep that I fell into. I can still feel Monty next to me; his chest rising and falling with each breath.  Then I hear mother shouting ‘Come in Monty, its bedtime’.

freezessmyblood,5,,5,1r9hka,,5,"So I am a firm believer in the natural world, and I really have never believed in ghosts or anything like that before. But lately, I really don't know what to think. I'll start from the beginning, about a year after we moved into the new house. My room is one of the biggest in the house, with a good sized walk-in closet. I have always had these fleeting thoughts about a ghost or some sort of spirit living in my house. I get that feeling that someone's watching me regularly, especially at night. My room is also very cold almost all the time, though it wasn't when we first moved in. 

Lately though, I've been noticing strange things going on with my closet. At first, I'd leave the room and find the door open when it hadn't been when I left, or I'd find the light on or off when it had originally been the opposite. I always just assumed I hadn't noticed the door being open, I just really didn't want to believe that anything was wrong. But then the closet lights started going out. I know that really isn't anything special, but every single bulb we'd put in would go out within a day. We all just thought there was something wrong with the socket for the light, so we just stopped putting them in. 

Last night, something I can't explain happened and I don't know what to make of it. I awoke early in the morning, at about 3 AM, and I stood to turn my television off. As I turned around from the tv to return to my bed, I saw that my closet light was on. I didn't think anything of it, I just walked towards it to turn the light off, when I noticed two dark shadows blocking the sliver of light under the door. I thought my brother must be in there because we share a room and I was still fairly groggy from waking up, so I slowly walked towards the door to try and whip it open to scare him. I grabbed the doorknob and flung it open. Inside was a woman, standing right up against the doorframe, and she was so pale. Her hair was limp and pure white, and she was dressed in these white clothes that hung from her loosely. As soon as I saw her I froze and we stared at each other for only a second before she screamed the most horrifying, piercing scream I'd ever heard, and the light blew out and she was gone. I slammed the door shut and ran to my bed which, unfortunately, is right next to the closet. 

I stayed there for a while until I must've fallen asleep, because I remember her staring down at me. I awoke in my dark room and there she was, standing over my bed, just staring at me. I was paralyzed with fright, and I couldn't move. She just stared, and as she began moving her face closer to mine, I finally shook the paralysis and yelled. She slid back away from me as though she was levitating and disappeared.

JUVIE_MAKER,2,,1,1rhq9j,,8,"I have a nose for things. No seriously, all my life I’ve had a very strong sense of smell and I don’t mean for the average person. I have an abnormally, freakishly, ridiculously, absurd sense of smell. It’s been that way since I was a kid. Here’s a prime example, when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother (god rest her soul) every month in Daytona Beach for the summer. My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood. I would always leave my Gran’s house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats. One Saturday, after a day of playing outside (when kids used to play outside!) I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air, but something was…..off. There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent. It was kinda tangy, bitter, sorta nutty …just all around unpleasant. Being so young, I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didn’t like it. Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate. She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgust.

Gran:  What’s the matter baby? Come sit at the table and have a slice of cake.

Five year old me: I aint eating that cake, it smells funny!

(Let me just interject for a second.  Now if your family is old school like mine, you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elder’s cooking! Especially if that elder is a family member, you just don’t do it! That is unless you want a black eye, ribs broken, missing teeth… you get the picture.)

Gran: Girl, get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of you!!

Oh geez…there’s that tone. You know it, you know it well. That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off. You know… that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives you’re delicate child-like mind nightmares for a month (or your whole life). Yeah that’s what I was hearing right about then. But still I was adamant. I would not eat that damn cake. That smell! It was just too potent. Now, you might be thinking, what’s the big deal? Surely you’ve smelled worse things than that cake before, which is very true. At that point in my life I’d smelled worse things before (WAY WORSE) but I’d never been subjected to eat those things either. Also, the stench of that pastry….it was just… so very not right. I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong, and that cake was definitely wrong! Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth. With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throat.

Gran: Come over here and take this plate now!

Okay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble. Even if my grandmother didn’t kill me, I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life! I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake. Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify. With every step she took it grew more and more intense! “Girl, you better take this cake!” she yelled holding the plate out in front of her. I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away. “No!” I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip, “I don’t want the cake, granny!!” but my pleas of desperation came to no avail. My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table, her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm. Suddenly, she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction, tilting my face towards hers. She looked down at me with an awful glare. Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Gran’s wrinkled sockets. Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before. “You will eat this cake!” She shouted through gritted teeth. “Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece!” 

I had never seen this side to my Gran before. My once sweet, devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares. My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes. I had never known terror like this. My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs. To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade! But you know what? There was something else I was more fearful of. Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devil-like grandmother, there was still something more bloodcurdling, more utterly terrifying than her…that fucking cake! 

“NO!!!!!!!” echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother. My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman. Her arms flew in the air (letting me go in the same instance) and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenly….CRACK!
The sound of my grandmother’s head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house. Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor. I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum. I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that. I bent down and looked into Gran’s half opened eyes. They weren’t black any more. They’d gone back to their normal brown again. Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all, watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red. 

To make a long story short the police were eventually called. My Gran’s weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body, and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it. Needless to say there were lots of screams. Oh, and you’re probably wondering what that smell was, right? I actually didn’t find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was. I was pouring it into my foster parent’s coffee one morning when it finally hit me…Cyanide. From the smell of it, Gran probably couldn’t have used too much either. Maybe half a teaspoon, give or take; totally undetectable to the average person’s nose…but not to mine. “So that’s what that was, go figure”.  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs. My foster parents passed away later on that day, I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really don’t.  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me? Was it because of what I’d done to Oscar, her cute little Maltese? I mean, if I’d known the oven wasn’t a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently. I was only two at the time. Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommy…that really was unfortunate. I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed. 

But anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I’m an adult now and those days are long behind me. I’m actually on my way to my boyfriend’s…excuse me….ex-boyfriend’s apartment right now. I’m visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with. And guess what? They just had a baby, isn’t that the sweetest thing.  ",A nose for things...,9,nosleep
1234FUCK,7,,3,1rhjmk,,8,"So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation, Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back. Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses. I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared. I mean that’s how I even know about this sub-reddit because I like reading it. And that’s one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation. 


	We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the 16 year old son was the one who had it happen the most. I went through every scenario I could think on the way there, Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal, one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things. Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children. The son was as I said earlier 16 and the girl was 14, they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such. I took a note about it but didn’t dwell on it that much. We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house. Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready. After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV (Point of view) cameras strapped on and started our investigation. My Uncle took the upstairs, our colleague took the first floor, And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own. 


I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walky-talky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker. He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely ( plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going.) Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen. And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness.. It answered back.
My instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were. And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be. My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly “You know who I am.” I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions. It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here. It chuckled again before I heard a small sound. Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it. My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before. I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks.  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement. I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message. My uncle did that a lot; he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible.  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob, it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime. I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open. 


I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door. The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly, even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself.  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room. I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more. I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror. It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing. I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over.  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water. My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out. I also saw a candle and a small match book and that’s when it hit me. My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head…. This was a “three kings” set up.


 I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped. My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help. After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice.. My voice whisper right into my ear. “ Do you know who I am now?” I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong. I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights. I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened. I just held out my camera to him and he took it. Before he watched it he asked me why I didn’t call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did. He looked at our colleague before watching the recording.


 After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in. I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in. and it was as I thought. It was a set up for “ The three kings.” I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was. He didn’t so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket “ and it has been used recently. The bucket was full of water. “ My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation. We went back home and I have decided to type this up. Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house.  


I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house. I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them.

deanjp92,2,,0,1re04y,,7,"When I was about 12 years old, I started making home movies with my cousin Ben and my friend Mark. My parents had bought me a new video camera for Christmas that year. We filmed a ton of crappy short films, some original stuff, but mostly spoofs of existing films, such as The Ring, Saw, and our personal favorite: Dr. Giggles. This was probably because horror films were so easy to make. All you needed was the biggest knife in the house and some ketchup packets. 

Now it was mid-October, nearly a year since I got the camera, and we were getting tired of filming at my house and in my backyard. We wanted to go somewhere exotic. So we walked around the block, where a small patch of woods stood next to the exit ramp of a highway that cut through my town. This is where we would shoot our next film, we decided. The basic plot was supposed to be “two hikers are killed by a mad man with a baseball bat.” 

When we had finished all of the planning, which wasn’t much (we didn’t write scripts), the sun was starting to set. This is what wanted. We weren’t going to shoot a scary movie in broad daylight. 

We made our way to the woods. I carried the camera, which had a light built into it, Ben carried the baseball bat/murder weapon (an oversized, bright red, plastic thing that looked like something out of a cartoon), and Mark carried three cans of tomato soup and a can opener in his backpack. 

This was the basic layout of the area: from the street of the block I live on, there was about 300 feet of grass until you got to the woods. The woods stretched for a little less than a mile, parallel to the street. The thickness of the woods varied throughout, but reached a maximum of about 200 feet. On the side of the woods opposite of the street was a small grassy ridge that made up the highway exit ramp.

When we got to the woods, we looked around for a spot where we could start the film. There seemed to be somewhat of a trail running through the middle of the woods. We decided we would walk the trail until we reached one end and start filming from there. I turned on the light of the camera, as it was completely dark at this point. We started walking. 

There was garbage everywhere. Gas station fountain drink cups, candy wrappers, old tires. The place was a dump. 

“I guess we’re not the first ones to pass through these parts,” I said jokingly, “Is this where garbage trucks dump their loads?” 

“This must be Oscar the Grouch’s summer home,” Ben said as he gestured to a small red tent we were approaching. We all burst into laughter. “Anybody home?!” Mark yelled, “It’s Burt, Ernie, and Big Bird, here for a visit!” The tent came into full view, and I shined the light in its direction.  

Suddenly we all shut up. A pair of big black boots were sticking out of the door of tent. We stopped as if paralyzed. My legs weren’t moving, and neither were the legs in the tent. I realized I was still shining the light directly on the tent and quickly pointed it at the ground. Ben whispered, “Let’s get outta here.” 

They started backing away, leaves crunching beneath their feet, but I still stood there, terrified. I don’t know why I was so scared. It was probably just some poor bum, sleeping out here in the woods. But hadn’t he heard us coming his way?

“Come on man, let’s go,” Mark quietly begged me. I finally got control of my legs. As I was backing away, curiosity got the best of me. I pointed the camera at the tent. 

No boots. 

I couldn’t breathe for a moment. Then I ran. Mark yelled at me, “What? What?!” I didn’t respond, but they ran with me. 

I didn’t know where I was leading them, I just wanted to get away from there, out of the woods, away from whoever was now roaming around, outside of his tent. I spotted a pair of headlights driving on the exit ramp and decided to head that way. We got out of the trees and caught our breath near the ramp guard rail. No more cars in sight. 

I told them what I had seen, and we agreed that we didn’t want to go back into the woods. We would walk along the ramp until we got to the street, and then walk back to my house from there. 

We were just about to leave when Ben asked me where the camera was. Shit. I must have dropped it while I was running. I wanted to just leave it, but I knew my parents would kill me if I told them I lost it. The three of us walked back down the ridge, being as quiet as we could and keeping our eyes peeled for any sign of the camera’s flashlight, which I couldn’t remember ever switching off.

We had just entered the trees when I saw a dim glow just a few feet ahead of us. I walked up to it slowly, and as I bent down to pick it up, another car slowly curved down the ramp, its headlights illuminating the area for a moment. 

In the brief second that the woods were lit up, I saw a pair of big black boots sitting just two or three feet in front of me. I almost cried. I choked on my own breath and looked up slowly, expecting to see a man attached to the boots, but there was no one. It was just a pair of boots, neatly sitting there. I was confused, but that didn’t stop me from running out of there with my friends as fast as I could, gripping the camera tightly with both hands. 

We reached the ramp, followed it to the street, and went home. Needless to say, we stuck to filming at my house from then on.

About a month later, my mom and I were driving home from my aunt’s house after Thanksgiving dinner. We got off on our usual exit. I searched the trees for a sign of the red tent, but couldn’t see it. We were stopped at the traffic light just off of the exit, when I noticed an old beggar standing on the corner asking passing cars for change. The street was full of cars, but he eventually fixed his sight on our car. I tried not to look at him, but I couldn’t help it. Finally I realized he wasn’t staring at our car. He was staring at me. I looked closer. 

Black boots. He was wearing a pair of big black boots. Before I had time to think, my window started rolling down. Quickly, I looked at my mom, who was handing me a dollar bill she had just pulled out of her purse. 

“Give this to that poor man, it’s Thanksgiving for heaven’s sake. I’ll slow down when get up to him.”

I took the dollar from her as if in a trance and looked back at the beggar. He was smiling at me with brown and yellow teeth. My heart was beating fast. I couldn’t breathe again. His eyes stayed fixed on mine. We inched toward him as the cars ahead of us slowly turned right. My mom stopped the car next to him, and I cautiously held the dollar out to him. “Happy Holidays,” he said, smiling. “Happy Holidays,” my mom replied, as I sat there speechless, his eyes never leaving mine.

Even as we drove away, I could still see him in the side mirror, standing there in his big black boots. Staring and smiling.

animatordominator,2,,1,1rbzij,,6,"I am scared, I dont know if what i'm experiencing is anxiety and paranoia or real. I swear there is something in my house I dont knw what it is, but its doing a good job of creeping me out. I have always felt this creepyness in my house. I really started noticing it when i was home alone. One day I was in my house when a LOUDD banging on the walls started. I was frightened so I went to run outside. Thats when my bedroom door slammed in my face. I opened it and proceded. I went to my laundry room. That door slammed in my face. Then on to my door connecting my garage and house. That did as well. I went into garage and outside. I was terrified and stayed outside of house until family came home. Another day i was at home alone and was hearing some bangs, by now i became used to it and wasnt as scared. I was on my laptop and was trying to translate some words into a different language. Google was taking a while to load. I didnt realize it did until i looked and my laptop was typing on its own.  The words were in some foreign language. I translated them into english. It said, "" Its a sunny day today isnt it?""  I wrote back ""No its not"". Because it wasnt it was cloudy. There was no response after that. I had a friend over for a serious of days one time and we began to notice that one of my family members always woke up at 3:30. When one of them woke up they always complained of loud noises and a weird feeling. Recently all of this seemed to go away until this week.  I can barely sleep.

17minutes,5,,8,1r6us7,,7,"I'm... concerned.  
I was sick last night. Bedridden. It wasn't as bad as it sounds though.. I had a terrible fever, and it caused aching in all of my bones and terrible pain in my eyes and head. I wasn't sneezing though. My throat didn't hurt, my nose wasn't running, it was just the fever. I thought it was strange.  
I tried to stay optimistic, laughed it off. ""Hey, I don't have to go to class tomorrow!"" ""What if I'm going to be the first zombie? I'll have to type a story like that up for /r/nosleep.""  
Sleeping was difficult. The heat was unbearable but simultaneously, being outside of the blanket was far too cold even with my space heater on. I kept falling in and out, I'm not even sure if I got a wink of actual sleep. I'm beating around the bush.  
I woke up at 12:19. It's a curious case, I'm sure: How I recall such a vague moment in time. I'm sure the reason that number is burned into my head is because, well, it didn't change.  
I managed to force myself out of bed and grab a bite to eat, hoping a little bit of nutrition would help me feel better. Well, what's a better way to combat sickness than some leftover pizza at midnight? I grabbed the remaining pizza, threw it on a plate, and went to chuck it into the microwave. It still said 12:19, which I considered odd. I was positive that what I'd done since I woke up long extended the time period of a minute. I disregarded it, shit happens. I punched in two minutes and pressed start, but nothing happened.  
I was far too sick and far too tired to deal with a broken microwave, so I decided to just eat it cold.
I went to the living room where it was cooler and sat by the window. I love looking out the window at night. It's always so calm and serene, and no, I'm not afraid of something jumping out at me. There is a traffic signal within view from the window which always mesmerizes me. I don't know what it is, but the reds and greens stand out in the otherwise gray Massachusetts scenery.  
I had finished the pizza. I thought I'd eaten it fast, considering the light never changed. I threw my plate away and went back to my bedroom, only to see the clock staring right at me.  
12:19.  
I would think it was a weird dream. I have those a lot and they're always vivid. Dreaming vividly is sort of an ""unconscious talent"" of mine. The only thing is, when I opened the fridge in the morning, there was no pizza left.  
  
UPDATE (1 day later): I didn't have any odd experiences last night. Although I was scared to sleep in the dark due to my spending all night on nosleep, I slept well.

I slammed my eyes shut, pulled the covers over my head and rolled over to be closer to my fiancé. All I could think was please let it leave and don't touch me. Eventually, I drifted off again. My dog never woke me up that morning, which I thought was odd.

OsamaBinHiding,3,,1,1rhxdo,,6,"Last night was like every other night for me. Have dinner on my own in my small, yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV. Around 9 or 10 o'clock, I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time. The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was 12 o""clock. 

""Where did the time go?"" I thought. It had only felt like a few minutes. However, this was a normal occurrence for me. The world kind of, disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me, I can't break out of it.

I had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought ""Fuck, I better try and get some sleep"" 

See, I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city. So it isn't uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head. I wouldn't consider myself someone who doesn't get scared easily but when you're familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window - you tend to grow some thick skin.

Last night wasn't like any other night in my flat though. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was alone. My flatmate - let's call him, Evan for the sake of the story, was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but he's away a lot so I'm used to spending a long period of time on my own. My usual night routine of showering, brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something. My drawers were all pulled open. 

To most people, this is probably nothing - but for me it wasn't normal. I suffer from borderline OCD and everything, especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order. I hadn't left my flat today either. 

""I'm too tired for this shit"" I thought and went to bed. 

It's weird though isn't it? That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe, like nothing can hurt you. I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night. Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safe.

Well, not anymore for me. Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards - no biggy, right? However, as I drew closer to conscientious, I realised that these creaking sounds weren't coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bed.

And that's when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold, coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed.

TaylorBonaseraSr,0,,2,1rhb2e,,5,"I can explain why I'm so afraid of mirrors, or anything that could reflect light, even a glass door. It's so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes, but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible. She broke my mirror the first time, just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces. It was such a pain to have to clean all that up. I got at least five cuts. But she didn't care. At the very least she didn't laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster. At least she was nice enough to check herself for that. Anyway, I got my mirror replaced. She didn't break the bathroom mirror again, but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it. I don't understand how she did it, it's pressed up right against the wall. She'd have to ram her body sideways. She didn't even have any visible cuts. She told me she was sorry, and that she would try not to do it again. I believed her, and she was true to her word. But soon enough, I hear the crashing again. But this time it's my door. The majority of my glass door has been smashed through, but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo. No one lives here that has a body shaped like that. The other times I checked her she didn't have any cuts on her, but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her, but she couldn't explain what had happened. When the doctor asked, neither could I, because I hadn't been there. It's strange how selective she is; she won't smash into anything except mirrors or glass-looking things. Anywhere there isn't this kind of stuff, nothing bad happens. She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that, and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. She talks to me about it so often I feel like I'm beginning to share the feeling.

It's starting to unnerve me, and I don't want to live with her anymore. But I can't break the joint liability contract. She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection, so I did. But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks I'm not looking.

One day I'd had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room. It couldn't hurt, just for a little while when she couldn't see. She wouldn't notice. But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection, I saw her standing there. So close. She was so ugly. She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face. She followed me here, to my own room. I couldn't turn around. There was no point. I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldn't keep a straight posture. She was laughing at me.

But I'd heard that laugh somewhere before. And I'd seen that face before too. It looked so much like my own. She must have heard my thoughts, because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection. I couldn't stand the sight of her face anymore, it was so scary. It'd been such a long time since I'd spent so many minutes just staring at her. I had to take control. So I bashed the bedroom mirror in, balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skin.

It'd been so long since I'd last done that. Now every time I look, I can see her, feel her, I see her staring at her...our...reflection, through my eyes.",My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep
WillOTP,2,,1,1rc02m,,4,"My house is relatively an uneventful place. In the middle of nowhere in a Hollow in some backwoods hick town. It is a plain double wide, only here since 1994, scattered among normal homes. Dressed up to look like any other house, it is overall a lovely place to live. There is nothing noteworthy about this house until you stay a night in it. 

As my best friend has said himself, something about this home at night simply does not feel right. It feels odd. Strange. Thick air and eyes on your back. The backdoor of my kitchen is the worst, like someone is just waiting for you to turn around. Sometimes I struggle to stay alone in it, but for the most part I cope. 

That is, of course, until this morning. A late night's reading left me tired, in need of stretching, I wandered through my hallway into the kitchen. 

If you've ever been in a double wide, you'll know what I mean when I describe the layout of my home. 

My kitchen is partially open, a large walkway into the home only interrupted a wall with a pair of frosted glass windows peering in. If you walk straight, you'll come into my living room. On the left, through a short walk through the living room, is a bedroom+bath combo. On the right a spare bedroom, and another bedroom+bath combo (My room).

Sometime between 6 and 7AM I repeat a habit. I turn the TV on, turn on the living room light, and I wander my way into the kitchen. Making my way to my back door, peering out of the window at my yard and the graveyard that lies such a short distance away. I get goosebumps, as I so often do, wondering what makes me feel this sickly. Pushing it down into the pit of my stomach, I wander out of the small room into my kitchen, deciding to just go back to my room.

Walking back through the home, watching the colored laminated on the floor pass by, I look up and pause in horror.

My TV is on but I hear no sound. The colors pass by in my vision without any thought in the world. I am not focused on them.

I am focused on the massive white figure looming by my couch. I hear no noise it makes no noise. It stand tall, if you could call it standing - 6'5 perhaps. There is nothing special about it at all. I see no arms, no feet, no features.

And it was snow white. From top to bottom, there was no difference in color.

It doesn't walk. It has no feet. It wouldn't be so inaccurate to call it a white shadow, a shape similar to a person but without their details, but even more a blur.

It glides over the floor, passing through my living room to my bedroom without a sound or a movement except the position of its body. 

A few moments pass as I watch it go, and only once I hear my TV sound in my ear again do I move, running up to look in my bedroom only to find it as it was before, and nothing inside. 

Nosleep, forgive the corny title but I don't know what else to call it.

TreasureHouseofDoom,12,,75,1r7ztj,,3,"Dr Jefferies study lay before me, energy cleared and house relatively empty, but delving into other people's personal space isn't as easy for me as it may be for others.  Always, my parents have cautioned me and my siblings about the dangers of disrupting others' heirlooms, cherishables, and privacy.  I knew for instance that each of us has deep connection to those things he or she treasures, even if we are not personally aware of any sort of psychic ability and that some items carry with them certain protections.  A locket passed from mother to daughter, for instance, may have compound energies susceptible to unleash if disrespected.  Bring into this potential release of energy against an interloper a variable such as a holy relic or other spiritually imbued item and forces not easily rectified are to be expected.  But more profound than these fears of conflict beyond my control was the deep seated notion in me that all people, those among us and those just beyond, ever beyond, are entitled to their privacy, respect beyond measure, peace.  I'd done a pretty good job of jeopardizing such peace, and now it was time for me to make things right, but maybe, too, I would be able to bring more than satisfactory comfort.  Perhaps this predicament would be remedied with two little girls finding their way to Bliss.

""Whatever Bliss is."" I heard someone say over my shoulder.  Just to my left was a door that I presumed opened into the first room to the right of the hall.  Foreboding consumed my thoughts only a moment before I pushed it out of my mind and far from my heart.  Mama and Aunt Lucia would have called the voice ""Naysayer,"" and I knew far more than I needed about its powers.  

'The only power Naysayers have is anti-power,' I remembered my mother saying. 'They're the weakest link on a dark, rusted chain.  When all else fails, Naysayers speak to hinder what must be done for Good.' I must have been very young when I heard her say this, and I wasn't even sure she had said it to me.  Truth was, respect for privacy aside, I was a bit of an ease dropper by nature, and as far as I knew, she had been speaking to a friend or relative.   But the information, this reminder over time, was powerful strength to me.  I pushed the Naysayer from my mind.

There are two very important techniques to remember as one sets her mind to investigating scene and history.  First, proceed in an orderly and logical manner as often and well as possible.  Turn over every clue for deeper consideration, but remember to return every item examined to its proper place whenever feasible.  Second, follow instinct and revelation as each presents itself.  Order and Logic have their places, but in highly energized situations, short cuts sometimes arise.  Consult your inner voice in regards to each, and if that voice is true and strong in most situations, trust it now.

Having been involved in vintage house restoration through my mother's real estate dealings, I knew a thing or two about the sorts of places used as secret compartments.  Knobs on banisters, loose boards, trim and façade might function as easily concealed opening for places to hide cash or jewels, even the sorts of things others might never suspect had any value at all.  

Quick inspection of the study revealed a few components that might serve in such a fashion.  Among them were medallions at the corners of the door and window frames, along the elaborate built-in bookcases, and to the left and right of the fireplace, attached just beneath the mantle shelf. I presumed such opening would reveal a deep but narrow space.  Two doors, three windows, and an entire wall of shelving equalled 28 medallions.  There wasn't time to waste, so I decided the best method was to eyeball each for lopsidedness or failure to sit flush in place.  Any looseness might indicate wear and tear surpassing stationary use. Using the chair instrumental in bringing the ouija board to our attention to begin with as stool, I set myself to this task but came up short when I discovered each of the medallions at the windows and the doors paint sealed.  And the medallions along the shelves were all flush.  

Glad not to have wasted too much time in this pursuit, I set about removing books from shelves, five at a time, flipping through each carefully, feeling the plank of the shelf beneath and the wood behind to detect any anomaly.  This was time consuming but revealed nothing out of the ordinary.  By now I was becoming dejected and increasingly worried.  The sun lower in the sky, I saw beams of it peeking past the drapes at the center of three tall windows.  Now I pulled each to its corresponding side, let mid-afternoon light push through.  At first I only warmed myself in this, wondering why I hadn't bothered to bring more light into the room to start, but now I noticed something I hadn't before.  With my back to the door, it would have been virtually impossible to detect.    

From the outside of the study, the door was virtually mundane--heavy oak painted white, thick framework, medallions at the corners, nothing more. But from the inside, a fretwork panel of heavy design was fitted to meet the top of the door from corner to corner as if a transom window were hidden behind it.  And now, light pouring into graze the top of the desk in the center of the room hit a finely polished desk set, ricocheting to the fret work and passing through.  From behind, tiny glows of red and ember were cast against the white paint gingerbread.

Excitedly, I carried the chair across the room, stood on top of it hoping to budge the fretwork.  There was no such luck at this height.  I looked for something sturdy  to make me taller, but there wasn't anything else in here suitable for that. I'd have to grab a stool I'd seen in the kitchen earlier.  It troubled me to leave the study unattended, and I was not unafraid to travel the hall to the kitchen again.  The energy pushed from this room might have concentrated along that dark corridor, and--tired as I was--I worried that my resolve might be weaker now.   The best path, I decided, was through the front door and around the side of the house, and besides, 'I could use the fresh air,' I thought.

Opening the front door, surprise of warm air pressed against me.  For the better part of the last twenty-four hours, chill had held me in its grip, and now I basked in the warm mugginess of a typical Alabama fall day.  'Storms on the way,' someone said from the front walk, and when I looked down from my place on the porch, the broad smile of a tall man greeted me.  It didn't occur to me to wonder what he was doing here, and perhaps I already knew who he was.
'Miss Lucia, she's a fine woman, she told me you might need a few things,' and I walked to meet him with a firm, thankful handshake. His grasp was strong, and for a moment I pondered whether or not he might be just some local with a keen sense of what most couldn't see, some bright energy my aunt had detected from the other side, but his overalls and flannel shirt were old-fashioned even by farm standards, and the glow emanating from him spoke of peace and tranquility not found here on Earth.

'Name's Big Roy, Miss Julianne. And I'll help however I can. You got to know I love both those little girls.  Not one of them's an angel, but neither is they a devil.' And I was glad to find his grip strong now, if only for a moment.  He must've been a real force in life to bring such energy to me now.

""I've found a fret panel above the door in the study, Big Roy,"" I said.  ""And I need a ladder and maybe a hammer to remove it.""

Big Roy looked down for a moment, considered the peace of Heaven against the Hell of Life perhaps, then spoke.  'No, Ma'am.  What you need is a No.2 Goodell Brothers screwdriver.' Reaching into a pocket at his hip, he pulled out a relic to share with me.   'I made that fretwork for Mrs Moseley, put it up to hide a few things.' 

His dark marble eyes clouded, and he looked past the house to the back yard.  I followed the path his thoughts traveled, and suddenly we weren't in the front yard anymore.  Ahead of us stood the original kitchen, rock wall reminder of the boundaries between two converging worlds.  Within, two little girls working on some secret danced across the windows in silhouette.  The smell of fudge was heavy again, and laughter wafted, too, on convected breeze.

'That'll be Vassar Fudge,' Big Roy said.  'Never could stand the taste of it.  Mrs Moseley won't like it in the house, not since the fire.  But I swear, this place always smelled of barbecue and chocolate after that.' He shivered, tear at his eye, and I placed my left hand to his right arm, felt the sinew hard work makes, the strength of spirit hard life breeds, the exhaustion such projection brought from him. His memories were clues I could not cast away, but feeling the drain it made on his soul saddened me.

""Is this the only way, Big Roy?"" I asked sincerely, but he only smiled sadly back at me.

'Whatever it takes to bring peace, Ma'am.' Such is the nature of love and sacrifice, and now I committed the lessons Big Roy taught to memory, heart, spirit.

His pulse quickening at my fingertips, I felt the rush of energy course through me, inflate my heart.  Now was the time to prepare myself for the sort of vision that could drive some to madness, and just as I realized this, heat burst against my face like revelation of Armageddon.  Closing my eyes for only a moment, I turned now to see the pretty kitchen erupting in flames.  The shrieks of little girls trapped inside overwhelmed me, and now Big Roy ran toward the house as he had that day so many years ago, relived horrible moments, to break a window.  And there was Mary falling through to fall into his strong arms, but she reached back, scrambled to retrieve her sweet friend, the girl who might have been her sister always.  Big Roy pulled her more tightly to his chest, held her against the struggle she made, and ran from the porch, the pop and sizzle of pine planks harmonizing backdrop against the excruciating, rising melody of Sweet Dulcie's screams. 

Puddle of sweat and tears, I prayed for strength to continue as wails echoed through me.  And now I felt the whistling brush of silk against one cheek and the coarse scrape of wool against the other as two mothers ran to collect babies, only one to have her arms filled with a bundle of love ever again.  Big Roy passed Mary to her Mama's arms, and now he rushed to pull Mrs Moseley from the porch, just as the pretty gingerbreaded roof above it collapsed in spark and flame.  

Salt of sweat and tears at my lips, I wretched as the fragrances Big Roy had described--barbecue and chocolate engulfed me.

Darrenshan66,1,,3,1r0xps,,3,"I ran through the cornfield, I wanted to get out of there before the storm reached the field. I had just gotten into my truck when I remembered I had left the hose hooked up to the irrigator. I got out and ran, the wind was picking up and the sky was becoming dark. I had just reached the hose and was about to turn off the water when I noticed something move out of the corner of my eye. I quickly turned to look at whatever was there, but all I could see was the wind violently shaking the cornstalks. I shrugged and disconnected the hose. I was right about to return to my truck when I noticed something... The sky was now pitch black. The only things I had to light my path were the tiny flashlight on my truck keys, and the occasional lightning strike. I ran in the direction I thought my truck was in, I stopped running when I realized that thanks to the dark, I was completely lost in the field. I noticed a dark shape sticking out of the corn in front of me. I stuck out my hands and slowly walked toward it. It felt like it was made out of metal, so I turned on my flashlight to get a better view. What I saw made my blood run cold. The huge object that was buried in the dirt was my truck! It looked like it had been torn apart and thrown! ""Who the hell?"", I said, looking at the destroyed vehicle. Suddenly, I heard a voice whisper in my ear... ""Dont you mean WHAT the hell?"" 
I jumped at the sound of the voice, I turned around and shined the flashlight in the direction the voice came from but nothing was there. ""Who ARE YOU?"", I screamed ""YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?!?!"" I stood, waiting for an anwser, when the flashlight went out, then some unseen foe with tremendous strength wrenched it from my hand. I took off running into the rows of corn, the storm had picked up and I was being drenched with the now falling rain. I ran until I slammed into a wooden object in front of me. I dropped to the ground, the pain in my nose and the warm and sticky feeling in my mouth told me my nose was broken. I looked up at what I had hit, a flash of lightning revealed that I was staring at a cross. It was made out of crude wood and was held together using an old, crumbling rope. I slumped to my knees and stared at the sky, my eyes burning from the rain. ""God!!! What is doing this?!?!"" I received no reply.
I looked around wildly and shouted ""Where are you?!?? What do you want?!???"" I shuddered as a familier voice whispered back ""YOU""
Suddenly, I was picked up and thrown into the cross. It snapped as I barrled into it. I rolled into a nearby row of corn and stood up. My leg was in horrible pain. Lightning flashed again and I saw the splintered remains of the cross sticking out of my leg. I limped as fast as I could, my leg was killing me. I felt something quickly aproaching my back. I told myself ""Don't look back just keep running!"" I burst out of the field and dropped to the ground. I ran my hands along the ground and was overjoyed to feel asphalt. I stood up and limped down the road. The clouds parted above me and the moon shined down on the field. I came to an awful realization. Although I could see the corn whipping back and forth, I couldn't hear any wind. A dark, large mass burst out the the field and landed on the road. The clouds covered the moon again as the creature unfolded to show its decrepid features. It was completly covered in a black, whispy cloth that was torn and reaked of decay. It had two red glowing eyes burning in the center of its dark face. I turned and tried to run, but I dropped. The creature took massive strides toward me, It was at least eight feet tall and I noticed it wore a hood. I got up and sprinted down the road, pain ruptured from my leg but I ignored it, I ran inside a barn and locked the door. I sat on a stack of hay bails and listened. I heard silence. Then, as if it were a faint whisper, I heard my name being called outside the barn. Cameron... Cameron... I covered my ears. I saw the door fly open but nothing entered the barn. I slowly took my hands away from my ears, tears rolled down my face. I lost all control and yelled ""Why did you leave?!??!!"" All the hairs on the back of my neck stood up as something right behind me whispered ""I didn't.""",The Storm,6,nosleep
SeaDweller7,2,,2,1rhilw,,4,"I go to a regular school, its kindergarten to year twelve, so its pretty big. But, my school is an old public school, and the principle is ancient. Me? I am in year twelve, and I’m graduating next year, and my friends said I should share this story with you guys. 

Ok, where to start? Well, at my school we have a pretty serious problem with bullies, and when I say serious I mean it. One year our school was even on the news, but it was pretty traumatic. When I was in year nine, there was this little girl in fifth grade, called Melody. Her and me sort of talked sometimes, as she was a new girl and I was her school buddy (to show her around and stuff) She was a sort of short, curly brown haired, blue eyed and geeky girl. Glasses and all of that stuff, so your stereotypical nerd. Which pretty much was what she was.

After I moved up in to Tenth grade it was pretty clear that she was being bullied. Instead of gossiping or playing with the other girls, she just sort of walked around the school... bouncing a tennis ball and wandering around the grounds of the school. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Then, half way through the year, school was stopped. During lunch they lined us up and called our parents. Sent us home. They just said there was an accident. My mother and father lived in Melbourne and I lived with my uncle and aunty, and they’re pretty laid back and all ‘come home when you feel’ so I stayed at school.

I saw five year six girls with that sort of ‘we know nothing it wasn’t us we didn’t do anything’ look on their face before I saw an ambulance and a white body bag. Out of the end of the body bag stuck out locks of curly brown hair, and the always-screeching birds seemed to sing a sweet tune. A melody.

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Last week we had a substitute teacher who started screaming at a girl who was outside bouncing her ball after the end of lunch bell had rung. She didn’t realise Melody wouldn’t listen. 

No one knew why the back stairs from German were out of bounds for two months, and why the German teacher quit. No one asked why those five girls we’re stared at my Melody’s sort of... ghost.

I pieced it together. A simple push, a simple tumble. A simple death.

No one cares, all the kids just skip past her, all the laughter swallows up her silence. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

The doctor said that he can live normally without a heart transplant but we have to be alarmed all the time. Timmy is six now. My wife passed away when she was giving birth. I took good care of him since then. This morning I was drinking my coffee as always. Timmy was sitting at the table having breakfast and he was so pumped to go to school for the first time.I left some coffee in my mug and went to have a bath.i was in there for like ten minutes and when I came out  my son was already standing in the door and just made me hurry. I put my clothes on fast and opened the door for my smiling son. He was just smiling all the way. I'm much taller than him but he was always meters forward. "" Don't rush kid! "" He stopped. Turned back and looked in my eyes. The next moment he was lying on the ground. I ran to him. His heart just suddenly stopped. I Couldn't do anything. I tried to CPR but nothing .. My son's dead body was just hanging in my arms. I cried. The only one who I had left me. Timmy was dead.
At the morgue the doctors sent me home to rest. They didn't know why his heart stopped. My tears were flowing continuously on my way home. I stepped in the door, took off my jacket and put my keys on the table next to my empty mug. I wanted to sleep but I couldn't. I washed my face in the sink and as soon as I looked into that fucking mirror I cried. I lied in the bed for hours but nothing.. I just couldn't sleep. Suddenly I widely opened my eyes. My pupils shrunk. I've put my keys next to my empty mug. Slowly walked out to the table, looked into the mug. Some sugar left on the bottom. The sudden realization made me feel sick. I was about to throw up. I felt guilty.

That's how my Friday morning started.  7AM, and I haven't even had any coffee yet.  In hindsight, it turns out that I wouldn't need coffee.

I never liked that address.  It was a creepy looking compound.  Perhaps you want to call it a lot or a property, but it was always a compound to me.  Somewhere where bad things happened, they were just really good at keeping them inside.

We left the station, and made our way 10 minutes west.  It was on the outskirts of the city, and the sirens tore through the only road leading there.  As we pulled up, we saw a female with black hair, matted with blood and in a white gown.  She was lying face down, and we should've stayed in the medic.  We were told to wait for police, but during shift change...that could take forever.  She could be dead by then.  We strapped on gloves, threw our trauma bag over our shoulder and made our way to our patient.  The first thing that hit me was the twitching.  She was twitching her fingers and toes.  I saw the hair curled up in small concentrated spots in her hair.  It wasn't until we got closer that we realized why they were curled up; they were twisted by a drill bit.

We rolled her over, wondering what sick fuck got a hold of her, but the other side was worse.  She had been crushed, but evenly crushed.  It was as if it was done by a machine.  She was flat as a piece of three-quarter inch plywood.

Well, she was dead and there was nothing we could do about it.  ""Injuries incompatible with life"" was what our protocols stated.  That means that we didn't even have to try, because trying was futile.  We sprinted back to the medic and looked around.  Nothing.  We couldn't even see the patient.

Then it hit me.  We couldn't see the patient from the road.  There was nothing even slightly resembling a pedestrian around here, and we couldn't see her from the road.

""GET IN THE UNIT""  ""GET IN THE UNIT""  My partner was wheeling and I was healing, but my screams of concern weren't loud enough or fast enough.  He yelled, and I saw something that I'll never forget coming out of those woods.  They were everywhere, and they were surrounding us.  Their teeth were sharp, they were covered in blood, and they looked like some sort of hybrid between a little girl and a black hole.   We ran, but the only place to run was through the open gate.

We hit our little red Mayday button on our radios, which opened up the channel of our lapel mics.

LadyVengeance0,2,,3,1rdv1z,,3,"I woke up, stretched my arms and got up.

It was mid-summer, already warm and sunny and the birds outside were twittering.

I don’t know why but I was in a very good mood. I took a look out of my window, a very peaceful neighborhood.

My neighbors were working in their beautifully manicured gardens. I used to greet them but around 2 weeks ago they started to give me this strange look when I walked by. It was obviously weird to them that I was trying to be nice to everyone. I’ve never been like that, but I think I finally realized that life is more than just regrets, lies and all that bad stuff that happens every day. I mean, I got a new job, after 5 years of unemployment.

I went straight to the bathroom and brushed my teeth. I caught myself humming which I normally don’t do. But whatever I did, I couldn’t miss the feeling that I forgot something and I couldn’t remember what it was.

""Man, you look awesome today."" I said to myself and I gave my reflection in the mirror a wink. Just like I said, I felt good. I went downstairs and headed to the kitchen. I decided to prepare breakfast for me and my parents, just because I felt like it.

""Good morning, everyone!"" ""Good morning, darling."" My parents sat there in front of the TV, watching their favorite show. They recently started doing that; getting up early and watch TV. I stood there in the kitchen and asked: ""Scrambled or fried?"" and they would answer ""Whatever you like, sweetie pie.""

""So what are you guys doing today? Will you just stay here and watch TV again? We should enjoy the wonderful weather as long it’s warm outside, but I’m really sorry. I think I can’t join you, guess why!""

""…""

""Well, I have a new job, as a barkeeper. I think it will be a lot of fun, but I have to hurry now before I’m too late for my first day of work. I know you don’t like this and you would rather want me to have a normal job, but I can’t change it. It’ll do it for now.""

I was really excited. I opened the door, took a deep breath and realized that Mrs. Cartridge from next door was watering her flowers. I waved to her with a big smile on my face and there again, she just responded with that distracted glance. I don’t know what this neighbourhood was up to, but I could tell it was no good. They didn’t even like me from the start. As soon as we moved into this house, you could tell that these people didn’t want you to stay.

I still can remember this one Halloween. I think I was about 12 years old and I’ve always been a big fan of horror movies. My parents wouldn’t let me watch them, but I did it secretly when they were asleep. So I wanted the best costume ever: I only wished for a hockey mask and something similar to a machete. I wanted to look like Jason from the horror movies. My parents weren’t really happy about it, but it was Halloween, so what? I really enjoyed scaring the other kids, even the older ones. There was just one problem about it; for one kid this wasn’t as amusing as it was to me. He was so scared that he literally pissed his pants and of course he told his father about the incident. He rang at our house and told my parents that they would regret buying me such a costume, they should better take care of me and my strange hobbies and that I wasn’t even close to normal. What a stupid thing to say when you don’t even know me. 

Guess what he did the Halloween after. He grabbed me, threw me in his car and drove to the nearest lake. It was at the end of October and damn cold outside. He ripped my clothes apart and I really tried to fight back but this man was about 6.5 feet tall and very muscular. He forcefully put my head in the water. I thought I would die; that he would drown me in that damn lake. But he dragged me up again and asked me: 'Who is scared now, huh?' and then he would continue this over and over again. He left me there, naked, freezing, gasping,… but I felt nothing. I was empty. I went back home, all the kids were laughing at me, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to get home and get some rest. I never told my parents about what happened that day, but I could tell that this was just the beginning of it all.

My relationship to my parents was never that good. We argued a lot, we insulted each other… They really pissed me off sometimes.

""Go and get a job already!"" ""Stop sitting around like a lazy bugger."" ""I wish I’d have never been pregnant with you.""

Harsh tones, rough times, but in the meantime I started to understand their worries and doubts. Maybe that’s why our relation was getting better now every day. I got up off my ass and did something. I looked for a job, I’m cleaning the dishes from time to time, because my mom started to rebel and stopped doing anything in the household. That’s also the reason why it started to smell so bad in the kitchen. I now was a busy man; I couldn’t clean the house all day long. I had better things to do. I don’t even know if my parents liked what I was cooking for them. They didn’t eat at all, sometimes they only tried one fork saying to me 'You did a great job, honey, but we aren’t hungry.' I know that my cookeries weren’t the best and they just wanted to be polite and nice. So I had to throw away almost all of the food. The leftovers started to moulder and oozed a disgusting smell. I’m a messy person; I don’t really give a shit if my room looks untidy or the dishes are dirty.

My first day at work was really exciting. I’ve worked as a barkeeper a few years ago. I was still good at mixing drinks and serving them. I really enjoyed the atmosphere in that bar. It smelled like old wood and some of the lights were broken and therefore it was quite dark in there. Most people who came in here were at least 50 years old. The few women that found their way in here were prostitutes, looking for a cheap jag. I envied them so much; you earn money having sex with other people. And they made good money out of it. You can judge me, but I have my own opinion about that topic. If I was a girl, I would do exactly the same.

""So, and you’re the new barkeeper here? What a hell of a man you are, such a lovely face. You shouldn’t even be here, darling"", one of the prostitutes hit on me. ""But I really like it in here. Dreary places always attracted me. And on top of that, I got to know you, my dear lady."" ""My name’s Adora. Pleased to meet you. So, what’s your poison?"" 

We really enjoyed each other’s presence and talked a lot; about her job, about her family in Texas, etc. She asked me to come with her after my shift had finished. One thing led to another and we ended up in her bedroom. I waited ‘til she fell asleep and sneaked out of her apartment. I rather sleep in my own bed than somewhere else. I was hoping that my parents were already sleeping, but when I got home I saw them sitting in front of the TV. It was 4am in the morning, did they seriously stay awake ‘til I got home? Just to shellac me?

""I’m sorry that I’m so late… I hope you’re not-"" ""It’s okay, honey. Don’t worry."" I felt relieved. I ran straight upstairs into my room and lay down on my bed with a big smile on my face. My life couldn’t be any better.

I woke up, stretched my arms, yawned and took a look out of the window. It was raining, but still warm outside. I strolled into the bathroom and brushed my teeth. I recalled what happened yesterday and a smile lighted up my face. Having finished brushing my teeth I headed downstairs to prepare some breakfast. I greeted my parents delightfully and decided to make some pancakes. The only problem with that was that all the clean dishes and pans were gone and so I had to scrape the mouldering leftovers off of them. I know that’s not really how you should do that, but I had to hurry, otherwise I’d have been late for work.

""I hope you don’t mind that I used the dirty dishes to serve the pancakes on. I’ve got an idea. Maybe we should go out for a ride tomorrow; you both haven’t left the house in weeks now. Dad, I know you hate your boss, but maybe you should consider going back to work next week.""

So, what’s the plan? Maybe we should drive to the lake and go fishing. That’s a good idea. It’s been years since Dad and I were going on a fishing trip together. I went to work and there again in the right corner sat Adora with her two friends.

""You nasty boy sneaked out of my bed last night. I thought we had a lot of fun."" ""We did. I just wasn’t comfortable sleeping in another bed than mine. I hope you’re not angry with me."" ""No, it’s okay, cutie. Do you have plans for tomorrow? Maybe we could stay all day long in my bed and do – you know – dirty stuff."" ""I’m sorry, but I promised my parents that we’re going to the lake for a few hours, but maybe you could join us! That would be great."" ""I don’t really know, honey. I’m not that kind of person you should introduce to your parents."" ""Don’t be silly. We’re just chilling at the lake for two hours and afterwards we can do whatever you want.' 'Well then, if it’s just for two hours, I’m okay with that.""

I was excited like a little kid on Christmas Eve. I helped my parents to get in the car. Adora said she would wait at the lake, so that my parents didn’t get to know where she lived because it was some kind of embarrassing for her showing her poverty. When we got there, Adora approached the car, opened the passenger door and bursted out with a high pitched scream.

""What the fuck is wrong?"" I asked her. ""Oh…my…god…"" With tears in her eyes she ran off. What the hell was that? I don’t know that freaked her out that much. ""I’m sorry guys… I really thought she was something special."" ""It’s okay, honey. Don’t be sad. For everything there’s a season. Maybe she wasn’t the right one for you."" ""Thank you, Mom…Dad. I love you."" ""We love you, too, son."" 'Maybe we should go home for today. I’m not really in the mood for fishing right now.""

I drove back to our house and now there was Mrs. Cartridge again. She was cutting her rose bed. When I opened the door to help my parents getting out of the car, she dropped her garden shears and clasped her hands over her mouth. She looked like she saw a ghost. People these days… just annoying.

We were sitting in front of the TV and watched one of my favorite shows. I felt comfortable spending time with my beloved parents. I can’t remember the last time we just sat there without arguing; being a family again. Suddenly, I noticed piercing sounds of sirens from outside. Police cars stopped by near our house. What happened? Was Mrs. Cartridge in danger? What if something happened to her? I would never forgive myself. I could have helped her.

""This is the police! Open up!"" They pounded wildly against our front door. What the hell was going on? ""Open the damn door! Otherwise we’re coming in!""

What? No. I gave in and opened the door just to check out what the hell they wanted from us. They bursted into our hallway and pushed me aside. All of them were armed. There were about 3 or 4 police cars parking in front of our house. What the hell was going on? Did Mrs. Cartridge call the police? Why? One of the police officers went into the living room and yelled:

""Oh my fucking god… guys… two dead people in the living room. Man, that’s fucking disgusting."" The police officer came back and gave me a disguised look.

'""You crazy motherfucker. Get him the handcuffs on. He might be dangerous."" ""What? No. I’m not dangerous. I was just sitting there with my parents watching TV. This is not a crime!"" ""'You have the right to remain silent when questioned. Anything you say or do may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right…""

All I heard were the sirens and all I saw where the lights everywhere. I felt like I was in a movie, that this wasn’t real. They can’t arrest me. I’ve not committed any crime.

""Estimated time of death: 3 weeks ago. That’s why the neighbors complained about the smell. The cause of death is currently unknown, but what we can say is that they died an unnatural death.""

I just wanted to have a normal family, without any rhubarb. I’ve never loved my parents that much as I did the last 3 weeks. It was so calm and peaceful…
",Just an ordinary day,6,nosleep
Lnzy1,2,,1,1rdoii,,6,"My Grandmother made porcelain dolls, filling her golden years and every inch of available shelf space in the modest desert home she shared with my Grandfather with small breakable people. They were all dressed in elaborate frills and lace, hand crafted bonnets and daintily painted faces. They never scared me as a child as you would think a house full of unmoving glass eyes would. Instead, they compelled me to play and to dream. For my fifth birthday, Grandma gifted me with a pair dolls I named Lilly and Lanis. They were twin baby dolls dressed in bright pink and blue corduroy overalls. I took them everywhere and they filled me with the assurance that I would be a fantastic mother. One day as I helped Grandma clean out her shed, I knocked over a piece of wood that smacked int the wall. A panel of the wall popped off the nails holding it in place and tumbled to the ground with a clatter. Through the dust tinted air, I spotted a large metal tin inside. I instinctively went to reach for the item when my Grandmother slapped my hand away and quickly replacing the misplaced board, securing in place with a heavy tool box. 

“Leave it be,” she told me sternly. The next morning as we readied to leave and return home, I slipped away and back to the shed. With some effort, I was able to push away the tool box and the board fell away with a sweep of my hand. I quickly pulled the tin box out and opened it, an unbridled urge to know pulling at me. 

It was a doll. 

Its dress was of a deep maroon lined with soft black velvet, ready for the deepest of winters. Its face, white and pale as any porcelain, was in fact made of wood. Her eyes had been covered with a red ribbon. Before I could examine the doll further, the sound of my mother's voice jolted me back to reality and I hastily shoved the doll my bag. When I got home, I sat on my bed with the doll, pulling my fingers through the wiry black curls. The red ribbon was tied with an impossible knot so I went to the kitchen and fetched a pair of scissors. Stripping off the ribbon, I beheld the deep amber eyes of the wooden doll for the first time...

...and I felt a twinge of unease. 

It was only after seeing the dolls face in its entirety that I realized...how wrong it looked. The eyes seemed to focus straight at me with unnerving intensity, not the vague dead gaze of Grandma's other dolls. The eyebrows were painted a tad too narrow,and the sides of its mouth drooped ever so slightly. The doll looked...angry. I put the doll back into my bag and set it aside. 

A few nights later we received an abrupt call in the middle of the night. Grandma has passed away suddenly of a heart attack. While I changed my clothes, I looked up and noticed the items my dresser had been disturbed. My pink bejeweled box of assorted costume jewelry and nick knacks had been pushed aside and in their place sat the wooden doll. I stared at it for a moment, trying to think back to when I had placed it there. My mind was a jumble with thoughts of my now dead Grandmother and windowed Grandfather. The doll was insignificant. So it was only later after I had returned from a long day of mutual grieving with relatives that I notice the expression on the dolls face did not appear as severe as I remembered it when I first beheld it. I chalked it up to being my own imagination and let the thought escape my mind.

A few days after the funeral, I came home from school to find Lilly and Linus, the dolls Grandma had made for me, broken on the floor and in pieces. Their brightly colored overall slashed. I wailed at the sight of them and tried to put the shattered faces back together, tears of anguish at finally having a real sense of my loss. It was not just the dolls themselves, but the glow of warmth from my Grandmother's touch seemed to have left them. She was not coming back. And I cried. Above me, I did not notice the vague smile on the wooden doll's lips. 

I cried myself to sleep that night. It was windy and the loss of my dolls had left me in little mood for food or entertainment. I cuddled up with my well worn Little Mermaid blanket and eased into a dark nothingness without dreams. I awoke abruptly during a particular powerful current of wind as it pushed the tree branches into my window. I sat bleary eyed in the dark for a moment when I heard a soft sound of what sounded like foot falls. They were soft and rapid, seeming to come from under my bed. I assumed it was my kitten, Gizmo. So I laid my head back onto my pillow and waited for sleep to return. A clatter startled me back to alertness only a moment later and I looked around my room. One of the doors to my closet, which always remained closed (because monsters, you know) was open a small crack. Immediately my little brain began to race with thoughts of monsters with teeth and long claws and wide black eyes. Almost as if to answer my thoughts, there came another clatter from the closet. I jumped out of bed, grabbing the nearest piece of armament available to me: a plastic princess light up wand. I held it close to me as I approached the closet. As I drew nearer, I heard a most discerning noise as the closet door began to creek open. 

A giggle.

I ran toward the door, slammed it closed with all my might, and rammed the princess wand between the handles of the closet doors just as they began to shake violently. I pulled away and bolted out my door and down the hall to my parents room. I slammed their door closed, locked it, and swan dived into the warm confines of their down comforter. While far from happy with me, they did not throw me out. 

The next morning, my Dad asked me what had scared me.

“There's a monster in my closet,” I told him. He smiled patiently at me and got up to dress for the day. He looked at the door and shook his head, unlocking it and stepping out into the hall and paused, looking down. After a moment, he looked back at me with tired eyes and asked, “Did you forget your toys?”

Confused, I looked over the edge of the mattress down to the floor where my father stood. Just in front of the doorway to my parents room were the shattered plastic pieces of my princess wand...laying at the feet of the wooden doll with her mouth stretched into a wide grin.

LadyCorvus,0,,1,1rcaqz,,5,"She’d always been the one with the smirk, biting commentary, and quick wit. She’d been called a verbal sniper by her closest enemies, for her tongue was double-edged and if there was a compliment, a tongue-lashing was never far behind. But here… o, here… here it was if she’d been struck dumb, her mind numb and tongue leaden, all that was left to her was the steady, forlorn moan that seemed to resonate; emanate from the very core of her being.


Having no idea of where she was… well an echo in the back of her mind gave her one that she pushed at, tried to reject though it kept at her, nagging like a small wound that would not heal. The idea finally escaped the confines of her will as her morale flagged, though it refused to be defeated just yet. 


This place was of no earthly plane, the landscape … surreal and terrifying. The cold, reasoning bit of her mind that fought to make sense of what she saw, and to remember what had happened up to this point; had brought her to this one conclusion, told her something she could not, would not accept. 

Rising from the ground where she sat… had landed?...she made herself walk, it had always helped her think things through in the past and she clung to the familiar in this unfamiliar place. Shrieks and inhuman laughter filled her ears, sulfur and ash clung to the inside of her nose, mouth, and throat. She wondered idly why she did not cough at the abrasive air even as she wrinkled her nose at the smell that was reminiscent of all she’d been told of Hades or a post-apocalyptic event. 

The trees here were bare, smoldering, though oddly still standing; branches reaching out from side to side like angels that had somehow become dracoliches with outspread skeletal wings. She repressed the small shudder as she passed under them, heading towards the sound of water with a growing thirst that would not be long denied. It was with no small relief that she neared the water. Sinking to her knees gratefully to partake and clean her face, she stared at the surface; it was covered in a dark crimson ash, unlike any she’d ever seen before. 
   

Trepidation filled her as she tried to lightly skim this from the surface, hoping the water to be potable underneath it. It was when she saw her reflection and what it was reflected in that she knew she was truly defeated this time; that this whole thing was out of her ken or else she was out of her mind. For what she saw upon her cheek, reflected in the viscous, mercury coloured water resembled a barcode that had been seemingly branded there. It read May 4, 2099 # 6498-066.


“What in the hell?” 


She jumped at the voice before realizing it as her own, albeit harsh, torn, and ragged sounding. Gone were the dulcet feminine tones she’d cajoled, taunted, and teased with. As she fell back from the water; this bloody excuse for water, the realization hit her hard. With growing horror she scrambled back from the bank, sobbing out a prayer in a voice as broken as her faith.

Dylando,2,,0,1rbgs5,,3,"Connecticut is a beautiful area. You can live a peaceful life out near the woods, or live in a somewhat busy city, both walking distances away, and both having perks. Out in the forest, you have neighbors, but they will almost never bother you. In the more busy areas, however, you can find whatever store you need in a matter of minutes. As for myself, I've always been fond of quiet neighborhoods. I love the fact that I don't need to be bothered by noises or people wherever I go. You can actually be in silence, just you and your thoughts.

Growing up where I used to be, however, proved to be unnerving. Most of the time, I could wake up in the night, and just be. There was no need to be doing anything, and there was less of a need to be hearing anything. One night seemed to be quite the opposite.

I woke up at a point around midnight, and listened to the silence of the night, and I liked to do. I usually fall asleep no problem after that, but I had trouble, almost as if something was outside, waiting. Then I heard it. I was quiet at the start, coming out from our living room, down to our ling hallway, where the bedrooms lay. What I had heard was the click of high heels on stone, excruciatingly slowly, coming down the hall. After a minute of this, the clicking stopped altogether, *right outside my doorway*. My scared self, knowing my door was open, clicked on the small light next to my bedside, and I calmed down. It had seemed to be the house settling, as I could only see the wall outside my room, and the shadows emitted from the light in my room.

As the years passed, my family had moved out of that house, and began to rent it out to people. Since we only moved up to the end of the road, we decided to keep our garbage barrels at that house, so that we had no reason to trudge up and down a hill to move our barrels weekly. During these passing years as well, I had suppressed this memory of the clicking, and other minor occurrences that happened during our stay at that house.

Two years ago, The usual routine happened. I would be the one to bring down any garbage bags down to the barrel, and walk back up. Normally, I'd do this after dinner, and it would still be light out, but because light is limited in November, it had quickly became dark at only 6:30. This day was no different, so I casually walked down our road, garbage bad in hand, to our old house. Before getting to the barrels, though, I stopped dead in my tracks. Something just seemed off about tonight, even though, just like every other night, everything was quiet. But this quiet wasn't one that seemed to be peaceful, but more of a deafening silence, as though some force is compelling everything to stay quiet. This fear quickly vanished, as I saw how silly I was. *Everything was fine*, I assured myself. Walking passed a porch light near my neighbor's house, I saw my fine, slender shadow dart across the ground and lay the end in the empty parking space for cars at this rented house. As I walked to the barrels that lay at the side of the house, I was greeted by the sound of clicking high heels on pavement, and the motion sensor light go off at the parking spaces. As I tilted my head up to say hello to the renter, I had realized that there were no cars in the parking space, meaning that the woman renting the house was out for the night. I had also came to realize that the shadow that was mine had tripped the sensor, and that the shadow coming from me did not belong to me.",Shadows,3,nosleep
InsaneFang,0,,7,1rbeal,,5,"It was any other normal day for him, walking home after school. Billy was old enough, his parents thought, to walk home alone, he knew not to trust strangers and all that. He walked along thinking about his friend hadn't been at school, and he was a little worried, he never missed one day. 

He was walking when he walked into a lady, she had things scattered across the ground, he knew he should help her pick the items up. He picked up the last of the items across the ground, and he looked up and got a good look at this woman. 

She was in her mid-forties or early fifties, she had black hair, was white, brown eyes, and her face was a little wrinkled. He didn't even realize what he picked up, when he handed it to her. It was a knife covered in what looked like fresh blood, when he saw that, he started to back away. 

She smiled, and said ""Now don't run dear, you'll only make it harder on yourself.""

He opened his mouth to scream, but no sound escaped. He turned and started running down the street, trying to escape the woman with the blood stained knife. He ran forward, never looking back, and he finally saw a house, and he ran up to the door, and found that it opened. Grateful to this, he bolted inside, and closed the door. 

He peeked out the window to see if she was following still, he noticed she had slowed down, and was laughing. ""Hopefully she's just a crazy old woman who likes to scare kids for a laugh..."" He panted quietly.

""I don't chase kids for a laugh."" He heard beside him. 

He looked up and there stood the woman, he opened his mouth to scream, but she quickly covered it. ""Now, now, dear, be quiet, it'll be easier."" He tried to shake her hand off his mouth, but she only clasped it harder around his mouth. ""I said to be quiet, dear."" 

He looked up at her, terrified, what was she going to do? She smiled and said ""There we go, my dear."" 

He closed his eyes, hoping, just maybe this was all a horrible dream. Please, please, oh please let this be a horrible nightmare...I don't want to die! Oh how he wanted to speak aloud, but that was not wise in this situation. 

She said ""Now I'm going to feed you some of my special soup. I never get any visitors often to share it with."" Now he was beyond confused, crazy woman with knife, who chased kids, was offering him soup?

She steered him to a table, and sat him down, she sat a bowl of steaming liquid with chunks of meat in his face. It smelled like chicken, but it had an odd smell that lingered in the chicken like smell. He made a face, and said ""I think I should go home, my mamma is probably worried about me, ma'am."" 

""Not till you get soup of my fine soup in your system.""  She replied

""My mamma told me not to accept things from strangers."" he said, getting up.

""Well then, my name is Linda. Now what's yours?"" 

""I ain't allowed to tell strangers anything about me, ma'am."" he said

""All you have to say is your first name.""

""I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't."" 

""Come on, please?""

He looked so nervous, and he finally said ""It's Billy, ma'am..."" 

""Well isn't that a nice name, Billy, well now that I know your name, and you know mine, we aren't strangers anymore.""

""I'm sorry, ma'am, I don't think it works like that. I'm sorry, but I really have to go."" 

""At least eat one spoonful of my soup...just one please, I never had anyone try my soup and be able to tell me if it tastes good.""

""Well I guess one bite wouldn't hurt anyone."" 

He went over to the bowl, and got himself a spoonful, the broth was a reddish color, the meat was dark like that of chicken or turkey. He put the spoon past his nose, and the smell that was lingering with the chicken like smell hit full force, and it was so putrid, he almost wanted to gag. But he had to be nice to this lady.

He forced the spoon into his mouth, the meat tasted like none he'd ever had. It didn't taste like chicken, or anything else. It had an odd salty taste with a metallic taste to it, kind of like blood... Wait, that knife! He tried to spit the soup out, but she forced his mouth shut, and said ""Now swallow, dear."" 

She forced him to swallow the broth, and he felt his eyes grow heavy, she put something in th...

Hours later, he woke up, the bed not his own, and the room was different. Please tell me I'm dreaming, where am I anyway? She came in, and the memory hit him. He tried to get up, but he was strapped to the bed. He tried to scream, but there was something knotted in his mouth, like a rag. 

""Well I've never had anyone to talk to, but I've always wanted someone to tell my secrets to, you know? Be able to be understood, and all that."" She sighs 

He couldn't talk, so he just laid there staring at her, silently pleading for her to let him go.

""You know that soup, I put special ingredients in that there soup. It has my special red broth, with my special meat. I have to get it in a different way than any other meat. You'll see how I do that later...or actually maybe very soon.""

He tried to fight against the ropes holding him down, but she merely chuckled softly. 

""Don't fight, dear, I just want to talk to someone. Now where was I, ah yes. During my days, I must have this special food ten times a day, it's so addictive. But with my running around to get it, I can stay thin, and not be fat like those lazy people who eat all day and night, and never move. Shame, such waste of ... oh never mind that.""

He felt like crying, and he felt salty tears start to form in his eyes. 

""Oh don't cry, you'll go home soon, well...to the home most of us are promised in the end, you'll have a new body..."" She sighed as if remembering something joyful. 

She lightly patted his knee, ""Well, I really can't say much else about what I do, it's time I show you."" She untied him from the bed, and said ""I shall lead you to your new living quarters."" She led him through the kitchen and into a dark room.

The smell inside was putrid, he wanted to gag, but the rag in his mouth kept him from doing so. The lights in the room turned on, and he saw the most gruesome sight. He finally opened his mouth, and screamed, though his attempts were muffled by the rag. 

The room was covered in dried red, there was meat hanging up, the freezer cool enough to keep it fresh like all other big freezers with meat in them. But this wasn't ordinary meat...it was..

He didn't finish his thought, because he felt a stabbing pain, and he fell down, and felt the world go black.

She later came into the freezer, grabbed one of the hanging meats, and went to the kitchen, and started to cut it up, and prepare some soup, while in the freezer, there was Billy's blood blending with the other dried blood, and there he hung, lifeless...like the others, the other dead kids...
",The Best Meat,12,nosleep
kailey16,0,,7,1r8ylh,,2,"So, about a year and a half ago my family moved into an old farm house that was built near the end of the 1800's. My whole family absolutely hated it there but I was oddly drawn to it and loved it, I have no idea why. 

On the first night we stayed there my best friend stayed the night with me, because the first night is always creepy no matter what. Now, supernatural things were drawn to my best friend. She could sense them and they always came to her. Once she stepped foot in that house she wanted to leave. But of course she refrained from telling me until after I moved out. She also didn't tell me about what happened while I was asleep. 

Before we went to bed, we decided to watch a movie. Then we just left it on the main menu and went to bed. I guess around 3:00 AM, she woke up to a bang in my room. From where, she couldn't exactly tell. But it was definitely my room. Then the tv went out to that gray and black fuzz and really loud for about 30 seconds, then went back to the main menu. She said she was shaking from fear. She refused to come over anytime I invited her after that.

Again, she didn't tell me about any feelings or anything until after I moved out.

I've always been interested with the supernatural, but nothing of the sort is drawn to me. I'm kind of happy about that, kind of sad. But I must've been the most interesting for whatever was in that house because it was drawn to me and it made it clear.

This house had two bedrooms upstairs, two bedrooms downstairs. It also had a living room that was recently built onto it so it had separate air condition and furnace.

It was mid-winter and the furnace on the original part of the house wouldn't work. At all. We got it checked out probably 4 or 5 times and they couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. 

My sister and I had the rooms upstairs but she couldn't handle the cold so she ended up sleeping in the living room with the separate furnace, so I was alone on that floor. 

Around the second week we were there, I was getting into bed with my 4 blankets and multiple pants and sweatshirts because of how freezing it was when suddenly I heard a huge BANG on my door. This freaked me out so I just grabbed my bible and prayed for whatever it was to go away until I felt better. Then it started happening every single night when I got into bed. Eventually it didn't bother me. Like whatever was out there was just wishing me goodnight or something.

In my room, I had a guitar and keyboard. One night, around 2:30 I woke up to the sound my guitar strumming. Assuming it had fallen over, I got up to pick it up then when I got there it was still exactly where I left it. Confused and a little freaked out, I just decided to go back to bed. Then, the next night I woke up to light. I sat up and saw my keyboard lighting up like it was being played. Then I got even more freaked out.

The bangs along with this demon ghost thing playing with my instruments happened almost every night.

During the four months I lived in the house, I went into a depression. Which is really only weird because I never have before or after. I didn't do anything, I slept all day, I didn't eat, I was mean to everyone, I really hated myself, and I contemplated suicide. Also, I had a migraine. Not multiple migraines. A migraine that literally never went away the entire time I lived there. I tried multiple different prescribed medicines and all of them just made it worse.

The weird thing is practically the day I moved out, it all stopped. I wasn't depressed anymore. My migraine went away. I was just happy again.

After realizing the coincidence, I looked up some stuff knowing that there was something in that house. Depression can be form of possession. Not as bad as all the stuff you see in movies with them becoming demons and doing back bends and crap. But I'm positive that whatever was in there attached itself to me. And by the way it made me feel, it seems like it wanted me to hurt myself. 

This story might not send chills down your spin like some others do, but I can't even think about it without being terrified. 

And the weird part is I have to pass that house everyday, and I'm still drawn to it. It feels like home. ",It feels like home,9,nosleep
aricat2000,3,,6,1r83z4,,2,"     I'm not going to say my house is old, because it's not. It's only 15 years old, so there is no reason to be hearing thuds coming from my ceiling downstairs. I understand that in a basement, you're going to hear the footsteps of anyone upstairs. But this noise is only around when I'm the only one home. My pets come downstairs with me whenever I go down there. 
     It started about a week or so ago. It just being a single, soft footfall. Everyday, it doubled and got louder. My pets huddle around me when the noise starts, scared of whatever is causing the noise. When it starts up, it's a soft footfall like it was when it first started then it gets louder and becomes two footsteps. It gets louder and faster as it approaches the stairs. Imagine someone speed-stomping all over your upper floor. It's pretty creepy. 
     I heard it come down the first step today. I sat here at my computer, frozen. I don't know what it wants, but I'm scared for the safety of my pets. My parents don't believe me and the thing is never out when someone else other than me is home.

xDrAlpakax,0,,6,1r3mwk,,3,"If it were any other day I would've just walked by, completely unaware and uncaring of what would happen if I approached this, what I percieved as a man. The simple chain of events that occured that day were miniscule and unnoticeable to the naked eye, but differentiated the outcome of my life. If you can call this life, it's a prison. My personal holocaust. Hell. Whatever you call it can not be descriptive enough to effectively describe the torture inflicted every day.
Let me start by saying I was just a normal kid from the suburbs. Imagine a white kid and you had me. 15 years old, 139 pounds, 5""9, need I get more descriptive? I was unnoticeable from the crowd of what seems like millions of other identities that were more important, more athletic, and more human. Not that I'm some alien in disguise, that's not what this story is about. Im just saying that.. well I didn't play nice with others. I'd always get into fights at school and in trouble at home. But I had a single core group of friends that I could rely on: Andy, Sam, and Marcus. 
That just happens to be where the real story begins, when all of us planned a trip up to a cemetery a few miles up the road from my house that had an infamous reputation around my neighborhood. Legend had it that there were a few unmarked graves placed in rediculous formations that no one could identify. No one knew if they were human corpses or not. So I guess thats why we were going up there, to solve the mystery; solve the puzzle. Why and what were these graves? When did they get there? 
We left on Friday evening and started walking north to the graveyard. The walk there involved the normal teenager conversations you'd expect from a couple of rejected kids with no one else to talk to. No weird signs, chills, premonitions, nothing. Just like we were walking to school. Completely normal. Normal... tell me again what that is? I havent caught a glimpse of normal in years. Help me..
We were nearly there and, of course, Andy has to stop to piss. Like we didnt just leave the house an hour ago. Why couldnt you hold it.. damn it Andy there was probably a public bathroom near the cemetery, we were ALMOST THERE. As he walked to the woods, the rest of us realized that we could see the cemetery from where we were, so we yelled at him and told him to catch up to us when he was done. As we approached the gates, some ravens flew away. Actually, they didn't fly away, necessarily. They flew towards us like we weren't as dangerous as what lied ahead of us. Of course, none of us thought anything of it, they were just startled birds right? Maybe they were, I don't know anymore. For all I know we all imagined it. An illusion created by some other being, form, your guess is as good as mine. 
We entered the cemetery and walked through the aisles, internally mourning for their familys' losses. Not that we knew the people six feet deep or anything but it was weird, its like I was dealing with the deal of a family member or close friend; they werent my emotions to bear but they were given to me regardless. After we seperately collected ourselves, we made our way the the main attraction, per say.  It was a giant stone monument in the middle of the open area we were stading in. It was an angel that was kneeling over a grave, and quite honestly it was creepy.  We walked up to it and inspected it. It's faded color, rain stained tears on its face, and sheer size were intimidating to say the least, but we set up our stuff in front of it because there were no other places to stay. 
After we got done, we decided to look for the unmarked graves we walked all this way for. We went left first and planned on walking counter clockwisr around the entire place until we found it. Left. Why left.. every choice was the wrong choice.. why not right.. 
We started walking past countless graves, and once we were walking for a good 5 minutes and couldnt find anything, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked at Sam and Marcus and they had the same ghostly shocked face as I did. They both felt it too. We all whipped around to find a man in normal black clothing: jeans, a black t-shirt and jacket, and a black hat. We came to the conclusion that he was an undertaker or groundskeeper or something, and we calmed down a bit.
""What do you kids think you're doing?"" said the man.
Sam replied, ""I.. err, we apologize sir. We were just looking around to find some weird stuff I guess.""
""Well you shouldn't be here, you're not safe at night. No one is."" 
""I think we'll be fine, there's just a bunch of dead people. What's the worst that could happen?"" Sam said
""You're looking for the unmarked graves aren't you?""
I said, ""How did you know?""
""Follow me.""
We all thought this guy was weird, but weird at most. He was scrawny and greasy. Not the kind of person you would normally carry a conversation on with. But we were all curious and had no idea where we were going. At that point something came to my mind; where's Andy? I told the man that we had to wait for my friend, but he said that he found him earlier and he was taking us to him so we can regroup. We hadn't seen him walk back in.. but we followed nonetheless.  
He led us to a secluded spot in the woods where we couldn't see the rest of the graves, where I surprisingly saw Andy standing unharmed, it seemed. As we approached him he murmured something which was undecypherable from the distance we were. We stepped closer, sensing a disturbance as if we were being pushed back mentally, but physically we were moving forward like a magnet. We got closer and closer and realized that his feet weren't... feet anymore. They were what can only be described as roots, binding him to the earth and not letting go. His eyes had turned to complete blackness, reflecting the darkness that now described his soul. 
There was nothing we could do, we tried and tried to get him out of the ground, but we couldnt do anything.  He was rooted too deep. What happened to him? We turned around to get help from the groundskeeper, but he was gone. Andy started to make noises from behind us.. we thought it was Andy. We turned around.. there was nothing. I mean nothing. Arid, dry, barren ground in the dark night. Andy was gone, the trees were gone, graves, everything. Just nothing. I turned to find Sam and Marcus and they were gone. Just me, alone. 
I began to walk to find some sort of shelter or safehaven or some sort to get out of this place. My shoes began to fall apart about an hour into the journey, forcing me to take them off and walk barefooted. I then walked for a few more hours on my raw, bloody feet just hoping for water, even a drop. So thirsty.. but I found nothing. The last thing I remember from the desert was laying on the earth, praying to whoever to get me out.  Then I passed out. 
I have no idea how long I was unconcious, but I woke up in a small grey room that had a single window on one of the walls. I mustered up all the strength that I had to somehow crawl over to it. I had will to find out where I was, and I did. I looked through the window, and there was.. me. On a medical table. Tubes running from my arms, some red, some clear, some green. All alone in this cold metallic room. A man walked into the room from a deadbolted door on the right side of the room. It was the same man I had seen in the cemetery. He walked up to my body and started inspecting me from head to toe, looking for something.. I dont know what. After he finished his search, he looked up and turned around. And stared at me. Through the window. 
""I am real. You will never be again. This is the reality, and you are trapped inside of your own mind, able to go wherever you wish, do whatever you want. But you will only feel when, or what I allow you to. Your flesh is mine. If I prick out your eyes, I may still allow you to see. But you will feel the empty, cringing pain constantly. If I cut off your leg, you can still walk. But you have to deal with the torture. Forever. Until I end your pathetic little life, which is what it has always been. Pathetic.  You should thank me, actually, for now I've given your life some purpose. You serve me now.""
And this is when I looked back at when I was at the cemetery. Me, Marcus, and Sam. This man touched us on our shoulders, we had all the opportunity to get away, but we didn't.  And by the way, how many arms do YOU have? Two? Or three...",My New Beginning,9,nosleep

I wake up in a cold sweat, my skin tingling with goosebumps. There is someone standing at the foot of my bed. I try to scream but the sound is stifled by a hand tightly over my mouth. I try to move, but I am being pinned down with a near crushing force. All I feel is pure terror and confusion. There are foreign thoughts in my mind. Reality seems vivid and dark.

The figure at the end of the bed comes into focus. It leans in, the featureless face right in front of mine. I try to scream again. The unseen hand clamps tighter. The being speaks in a slow, whispered voice. I cannot understand a word it's saying, but I can feel what it is trying to convey. Snippets of phrases come into my mind and emotions wash over me. I can feel the creature's disappointment and rage. I can hear the phrase repeated over and over again, ""You will die someday and it will mean nothing.""
It tells me that every soul is horribly alone after death. It tells me that hell is real. It tells me not to waste my existence, because someday I will not even have that.

It reaches a hand towards my face and presses on my forehead with its finger. The pain is unbearable. It feels like my head is shrinking and expanding at the same time. There is a sound louder than I have ever heard and then a silence more pure than in the vacuum of space. The finger presses harder for a split second. I catch a glimpse of the being's face. A lump appears in my throat as a realize who's face I'm looking at. Tears well up in my eyes. It's me. I'm wrinkled and my hair is gray. I look... dead. For a moment I realize something horrible which I cannot quite remember. Then I plunge into unconsciousness.

I wake up at around 11 am. I have experienced sleep paralysis before, but it has never been so disturbing. I am shaken. I write down what I told me. I get some breakfast and play some DOTA, forgetting about the whole thing.

My brother wakes up a few hours after me, and comes into my room to show my a new model he rendered on his laptop. While we're talking, he asks me what's on my face. I'm confused, and go to look in the mirror. What I see chills me to the core and arises bile in my stomach. I am speechless and my eyes water. What I see permanently changes my view of reality.

LittleMM,0,,10,1r2ocz,,1,"This story happened when I was in college.





My school is in another town so I had to live in student suites by myself.
My family is not rich and since I have a mild heart defect, I always feel weak and don't have enough energy to take a job after class. So in order to release at least some of my parent's financial burden, even though I'm a girl, I always chose the cheapest dorms to live in.





I've been living in four different dorms during my college days, all very old and small, one of them might even be actually haunted, but this story is not about any of them, at least not fully related. It's about something else.





On my way to school there's a juice stand, I always stopped by and buy a big cup of freshly squeezed juice after class. (Oh I forgot to mention, I went to night school and school ends at 10:00 pm.)
Since I buy juice from them almost every day even on my off days, I became quite familiar with the owner and will chit-chat with him while he's making juice for me.





One day when I was waiting for my juice as usual, I noticed that there's something on the ground at the corner of the road not very far from the juice stand.
It's a glass milk bottle with one single yellow flower in it. A five-petal flower with a very short stem and no leaves.
I was curious and asked the juice stand owner: "" Did someone died there? ""
He answered: "" I had the same question but, not that I know of. ""
Since it's not such an unusual thing, I didn't give it too much thought.





But after about two weeks I started to notice something odd.
The milk bottle was still there and the flower kept staying fresh!
But there's not even water in the bottle! It should dry out pretty quick without water.
I took a closer look and confirmed that the flower is not an artificial one.
That means someone's been changing the flowers frequently if not daily!
I got more curious and asked the juice stand owner if he saw anyone came to change the flowers, his answer was no.





It's actually quite sad to really think of it. It's probably someone very dear to the person who brought the flowers that accidentally died there. Maybe by a car crash, or maybe even a murder!
I talked about these wild assumptions carelessly and then I said goodbye to the owner with my fresh juice in hand. 





I went back to the dorm, my room is the first one on second floor, when I was stepping upstairs I could hear two girls chatting and giggling, they're my classmates, we took different classes so we didn't meet at school today, we were supposed to watch horror video in my dorm today and I totally forgot about it! When I reached the second floor I saw them standing in front of my door. The guy living next to me saw them at the entrance and let them in. They love watching horror videos at my place because the creepy environment offers an extra "" ambience.""




"" We were just talking about how creepy your dorm is! "" one of them said with a cheerful tongue.
"" Even this hallway seems haunted, why is it so dim? "" Added by the other.
"" Thanks guys for trashing my lair for me, like it's not a dump already. ""
I smiled.
Then we watched the video together, it's overall just another eventless night.





The next day after school, when I went for my daily juice, to my surprise I found that the bottle of yellow flower was gone. It was still there on my way to school!





"" Did you see who took the flower? "" I asked the owner.
"" That's odd, I didn't notice that it's gone! "" He answered.





I couldn't stop thinking about the yellow flowers on my way back to the dorm, I couldn't explain why I was so obsessed by it, I was so curious about the mysterious person who brought the flowers and why nobody ever saw him/her even when obviously the flowers have been changed so frequently? I was walking carelessly with my mind wandering somewhere else and the next moment a scene stroke me.





The yellow flower! It's there! Near the entrance of the park!
Someone moved it there, but why?
It's not likely that someone died there too, is it?
It's been curiouser and curiouser, but I couldn't think of it anymore.
The mid-term is approaching and I'm only half way done!
Can't waste my parent's money for a bad exam result.
( Yes, some of my classes still give exams. )
Thinking of it, I walked faster across the park.





There's no one in the part except me, and the street lights are so dim, they seemed dimmer than usual. One street light flashed when I walked pass it, I swore towards it: "" Great, now even you're trying to scare me, you asshole! ""
Then I turned back to the road,





That's when I noticed something near the bench about 20 feet ahead of me..... suddenly I felt a chill down to the bone..... the bottle of yellow flower..... why is it there???
Did someone put a bunch of flowers here and there on random spots? Or.....
I had to find out, so I backtracked to the park entrance..... no flower there..... that one was gone. So what does it mean? Someone's moving the bottle around .....for what? And most of all, how did I miss him/her? There's only one way in this small park!





It's not like I could do anything about it so I eventually carried on.
This time, the same bottle of flower appeared again in front of the convenient store right across the street of my dorm.
People were passing by , no one seemed to care, and I thought: "" Why should I? "" It's obviously none of my business.





So I entered the dorm building and went upstairs, but started to think how the bottle of flower seemed to "" followed "" me..... the chills came back, I almost reached the second floor, but I froze at the staircase. My body went all stiff I couldn't move, my pupils probably dilated like a panicking cat!





It's there.





The bottle of yellow flower, sitting there in front of my door.
A hundred thoughts flashed by, "" maybe someone's playing a prank on me, maybe it's a joke, but it's not funny. and by Whom and How??? 
I don't wanna know anymore, I'm moving out of this place! I know it's nothing to do with my dorm, my dorm is fine, it's not haunted, it's not the issue, but whatever!!!"" 





Before I realized, I already ran out of the dorm building and was on the way to my friend's house, and I didn't even remember how I got downstairs.





I couldn't stop mumbling to myself:
""I don't know if it's a prank or not, I don't care, I know there's nothing wrong with my dorm, it's the cheapest but nothing's wrong with it! and what kind of sicko would do such thing to me? Who would it be? Who could have known?
It's not possible 'cause I was pretty sure the dorm was empty that day, it's Saturday and everyone else went home except me! 
.....That cat..... it was an accident, I didn't mean it..... but it's not possible! No one could ever know! 
I don't care, I'm moving out right away. I'm moving out tomorrow!""

Motleigh,1,,5,1r09ur,,3,"I was about 12 or 13, living in a ranch style house in Southern California, when I had one of the creepiest experiences of my life. I was sleeping in my bedroom with the door slightly ajar. My bed was tucked into one corner of the room. The head of the bed was against the same wall as my closet door. The closet door was a large, sliding mirror. The door to my bedroom, which was an average door, was at the end of my bed. When entering the bedroom, one would have to walk past the end of the bed.

Some time in the night I woke up. I don't know why I woke up and I don't remember anything in particular waking me. The room was lit enough for me to see my bedroom door swing open about a foot. I did not see a person open the door. I did notice something crawl around the end of the bed and crawl up the side of the bed towards the head of the bed.

My first thought was that a dog was coming in, but when the thing reached the closet and slid open the closet door, I was certain it was not a dog. My best description of what I saw is a person crawling on all fours. I saw a dark silhouette, from the corner of my eye, crawl past where I was laying in bed. After the closet door slid open, the mysterious being crawled into the closet and closed the closet door behind itself. I was so terrified that I could not move. I laid frozen from fear on my back, in my bed, until I feel asleep. I was too scared to move or scream. I was awake for about an hour, unable to move, before I dozed off.

The next morning I woke up slightly confused, but I immediately slid open the closet door. I was not as afraid because the sun was shining outside and I felt that if it were going to harm me, it would have done it already. Inside the closet was my usual mess of clothes piled up on the floor. There was no monster or animal in there anymore. I did forget to check under the bed though...

oliviaclaire,0,,4,1r09ds,,4,"I apologize in advance for the length of this post.

The clock read 12:00. Not unusual for me to be up this late. I sat in my bed watching television and reading my usual horror novels. I, like many of you, are quite into horror and the paranormal. I began to feel hungry, so I sat down my book and began to descend down the stairs to the kitchen. I reached the kitchen and began to search for food. I felt quite uneasy with my back turned to the rest of the room. The feeling of someone watching me soon became overpowering and I had to turn around. That's when I heard it. Tap... Tap... Tap... It sounded like a finger tapping ever so lightly against the window in my kitchen. I was frozen at the sound. Though it was a light noise, compared to the deafening silence of the night, it might as well have been the loudest noise in the world. I shifted my glance to the window only to find... Nothing. I brushed it off and returned to my bedroom. As the night continued to drag on, I felt a growing unease in the pit of my stomach. Like something wasn't just right. I noticed my phone was dying, and reached for the charger plugged into the outlet next to my bed. I then heard something that chilled me to the very bone. Laughter. Very quiet. Very faint. But there none the less. I leaped from my bed and ran downstairs. I reached the living room and turned on the television, struggling to catch my breath and regain rational thought. It could have been anything, right? Eventually, I let the sound of the television push the experience to the back of my mind. Then it came again. Tap.. Tap.. Tap.. Louder this time. I was stricken with panic. I refused to let myself look at the window. 
""Just ignore it and it will go away""
Tap.. Tap.. Tap..
""Ignore it.""

This went on for 30 minutes at least. It began to drive me crazy. The tapping became incessant. I then did something I haven't done since I was a child. Retreated to my mother's room. I walked in with tears of complete and utter terror streaming down my face. Reluctantly, even though not much of an explanation was given, she allowed me to stay the night in her room. 
I climbed into the bed and began to let sleep take me. I felt safer in the comfort of my mother's room. Then, just as my eyes began to feel too heavy to keep open, I heard it once again. Closer this time.

It has been a little over a year since I last wrote - just over a year since the last nightmare.  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured, that, as Dr. Lough suggested, getting it out of my head and into a journal would help.

I read back over my last and only journal entry, as I tried to describe the nightmare.  It is so chaotic and scattered, yet I'm unable to find any other way to convey the details.  That is the terror of the dream at its core - utterly chaotic.  Jerking from one sensation to the next, the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be, to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion.  All of this, in layers of sleep - waking to the comfort of my mother's figure, only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out, with her eerie voice echoing through my body:

""You're connected now.""

Even now, in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages, I'm struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper.  Each detail seems to tie into the next, only to fall apart when I try to see the whole.  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr. Lough could make?  Is this what schizophrenia feels like?  I have no way to explain it.  It is as though there is a novelist's grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene, unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding.  I'm fairly certain this entry, and perhaps any subsequent entries, will be just as erratic.  I just cannot force these thoughts together.

So much has changed in the last year, it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me.  I have a son now, nearly 6 months old.  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote.  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace?  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father, the changes to my life, the responsibility, it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious?  I can't help but think it must have played a role.  It has been a blur, so many other things seem to have fallen into place.  Though they are exciting, it seems predetermined, somehow rushed.

Over the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in.  I knew I would live there once again - returning it to ownership in my family - though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly.  Rachel's grandmother died, leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together.  It was Christmas Day, the day she died - I guess her last gift to us.  Three months after my son was born, we were moving back into the mountains, back to the walls I had called home as a boy.  

One thing I feel for certain, this home is the source.  The nightmare started here, always took place here, was always fueled here.  I'm beginning to remember things, or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades.  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this house.

As a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase, which opened onto a hallway, always with my head down staring at my feet.  Left, at the end of a long hallway was a guest room.  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them.  Right, across a short landing was my bedroom.  I had trained myself to never look left at night - as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows.  If I would look up, I would become stuck in fear with the reflection.  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass.  My feet became rooted in place, the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me.  The nightlight would flicker in then out, each time causing my shape to jump forward, as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness.  I never remembered breaking loose, turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep.  I would wake up in my bed hours later, staring at my hands, inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare. 

I learned, I kept my head down and did not look to the left.

Our first night in the home, that muscle memory followed suit.  After turning off the main floor lights, I climbed the staircase.  My son was sleeping against my chest, his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder.  My head was down as I crested the top step, turning to the right, towards my room which was now his.  As I neared the bedroom door, his forehead left my shoulder.  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck.  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head.  I didn't need to look at his eyes, I knew.  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand, reaching down the hallway to the windows.  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle.  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door.

BLOODPIRATE,6,,2,1rdmz3,,4,"Fear is a strange thing

an unpleasant emotion caused by the belief that someone or something is dangerous, likely to cause pain, or a threat.

That's the definition of fear.

Everyone has it, but no one wants to admit it. People fear fear. Not me. I usually embrace fear, and openly invite it into my life. But, I usually get to control what scares me.

Not last night.

I was laying in bed, reading some stories on /r/nosleep before I went to bed like I always do. Like I said, I invite fear into my life.

I never believed any of the stories that were on here before.

My thoughts have changed.

My room has a bathroom with two entrances, one to my room, and the other to my sisters room. While I was reading some stupid story, I heard a noise coming from her room. I knew she was at work though so I just brushed it off and kept reading. 

I heard the sound again.

This time I decided to go check it out. I chose to use the door that leaves my room to get to the door to her bedroom this time, for whatever reason.

I opened up the door to her room. I could've sworn I saw something jolt to one side of the room. But, I went in further and discovered nothing. So I went back to my room.

The door to my bathroom was open. The light was still off which have it sort of an ominous and demonic look. I walked in and turned the light on. 

Nothing.

I turned around to leave when I heard more slamming noises. I turned back around to go to my sisters room when the light turned off.

I struggled to find the door knob, but when I finally did, the door wouldn't open. The other wouldn't open either. I started screaming now, but no one could hear me.

I sat down on the floor, hopeless. I've never felt fear like I did when that same shadow from my sisters room grabbed a hold of my neck. I couldn't even breathe because it's grip was so tight. I couldn't tell if I was blacking out because even with my eyes open, the room was pitch black. 

All of a sudden it let go.

I laid there, crying as my brother came bursting in the door. He turned the light on and shook me. I couldn't believe what happened. I got up and looked in the mirror. My neck hand bruised hand prints around it, and my back, chest, and arms were covered in scratches that formed weird symbols.

Ever since that day I have believed every story on /r/nosleep. You may not believe this but I don't care. I know the truth and that's all that matters.

dagronBorn,1,,1,1rcebp,,3,"For some reason or another, the paranormal loves my family. No matter where would move or what kind of cleansing ritual we would perform, something would make itself known. The earliest account that I can personally remember is from the age of five when my family and I had recently rented out an old house in desperate need of repairs. My father struck a deal with the landlord that if they were to bring the rent down considerably, he would fix up the place which would in turn up the property value.

The house sat on a few acres of land and had tool-shed in the back of the property which contained an old, sealed off well (this doesn't play into the story at all like the ring or some shit like that). The house was a small, single story home that was separated into two halves by dividing wall, but were connected via an old, red accoridon-style doors that had been faded with time. 

The left side of the house was cold. Always cold, even in the heat of the Texas summer we moved in. There wasn't much to the left side of the house except for large sitting room, and and old restroom that was filled with old junk that had been left behind by the previous tenants. I can still fell the cold upon my skin, and the invisible eyes that seemed to stare from every corner of the room. Needless to say, I never ventured into that room unless I was heading out the front door that just had to be on the left side of the house.

The right side of the house wasn't that bad. I never remember it feeling uncomfortably or eerily cold, and the feeling of being watched wasn't there. The right side of the house contained the living room, kitchen, my parent's room, my younger brother's (he was just about two years old at this time) room , my room, and the tiny bathroom we all shared.  For the first few weeks everything seemed normal, like this was going to be the first place in a long while we wouldn't have to pick and move suddenly (my family was like a roaming pack of gypsies when I was younger, never staying anywhere for too long). But, oh, did we have another thing coming.

The first unexplained phenomena I can remember was the soft, sweet voice of a woman who I would sometimes mistake for my mother calling my name. I would bound into whatever room my mother was in to see what she wanted, only to find out that she had not called for me. I brushed it off thinking that I was just hearing things that weren't there, just a case of a child's overactive imagination. Until it kept happening. Every. God. Damn. Day.

The second thing I noticed were my toys. I had fixation as a child to set up all my action figures along my room on whatever ledge was available. Window sill? Check. Dresser? Check. Makeshift step pyramid like display created from VHS tapes? You bet. Whenever I would leave my room to visit the restroom, or get a drink from the kitchen, and then come back to my room, my toys would either be facing the opposite direction I had placed them or they would be knocked to the ground with enough force to actually break more than a few. And, like the voice, I tried to explain it away until I eventually started to place my toys in a shoebox under my bed so that they would be safe. I still miss all the brave action figures that I lost to that house. Rest in pieces my dear friends.

The next few occurrences I witnessed firsthand, and they involve my younger brother. Cody, my brother, would be heard giggling and laughing and cooing in his room and if you were to check on him to see what was so funny, the rocking chair in the room would cease to rock as if someone saw you come in and stopped rocking. And if you attempted to remove Cody from his crib, he would scream and cry and reach for the rocking chair. When he was older, but still young enough to remember he once asked about the ""ugly lady with the pretty voice"" who would sing to him and make him laugh. 

One night when we were all sleeping soundly in out beds, my father gets in from a long day of construction work only to be greeted by a crying toddler in need of a diaper change. My father went into Cody's room, picked him up and set him down on the changing table. After cleaning up my brother and laying him back down in his crib, my father was free to go to sleep himself. The second his head hit the pillow though, he heard a commotion coming from Cody's room. He gets up, grabs his .38 and checks it out, thinking an intruder may have used Cody's room as their entrance point. Instead he is met with diapers strewn all over the floor. There was a shelf above the table that my parents placed the diapers and wipes on, and the diapers were stacked neatly enough were they wouldn't tumble. He thinks nothing of it, stacks them a few less this time and them proceeds to head back to bed. Then he hears it again. He walks back to the room to find the diapers on the ground again. My father stacks them up a little less this time, then goes back to bed. This same routine happens for the next hour and half; at one point he had put a solitary diaper on the shelf only to have it thrown on the ground soon after by some unseen force. It was them that my father knew it was time to move again.

That next week we rented a u-haul and began packing. We had just finished packing and moving everything to the truck and my dad was the last person coming out of the house. Everyone else was outside, myself included. My father had large box he as carrying out to the truck and was passing through the accordion door when something pushed the door shut on him hard enough that it took it my mom and myself to pry it open! He at first thought I was playing some kind of joke on him, but was even more fired up to leave once he learned I had been nowhere near that door!

The last I heard about that property was when I did a google map search only to find the parking lot of a Wal-Mart. I always wonder if they have a problem in the baby aisle. Specifically with the diapers. ","First they want us gone, they they don't want us leave...",4,nosleep
YouoTheNinja,6,,2,1rblw9,,1,"Midnight Snack.

I hear the repetitive sound of raindrops crashing into my window.

A storm is coming.
 
My phone continuously vibrating, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, who liked what, who posted where, what they did, who they like, who they hate. 

Personally I don’t give a fuck, but for some strange reason I always check the notifications, I guess that’s just another reason why I can’t just fall into a deep, relaxing rest.

   I sit here laying down, staring at the darkness of what I call my ceiling, imagining shapes and creating figures in my head. I can’t sleep, this always happens. I get up from my warm bed and crawl to my refrigerator; “Midnight snacks are the shit.” I mumble to myself as I open the ridiculously cold appliance. “It’s not even midnight; it’s like 3 in the morning, so much for a midnight snack…” I mumble again. Something’s odd though, the fridge is super cold, like you know when someone opens a refrigerator in a movie, and the frosty musk slowly rolls out of it, covering the floor with smoke; that’s happening right now. I grab a bottle of water; it’s got a slick layer of ice just forming on the top of the water. --I’d always break the skin of ice with my finger when I was little, still do. I take a sip of the icy water, and I feel my tooth ring. Cold water always hurts my teeth.

   I begin back towards my bed. The rain has become worse and worse, almost violent now, it sounds like someone left a faucet running or something. I get to bed; it’s chilly, like the underside of my pillow. That little trip will just probably make it harder for me to fall asleep.

…

I’m running and I trip.

I hate waking up from a dream like that.

This rain is insane, I make my way towards the kitchen again, it’s almost 4 now, I don’t get why I can’t sleep, the kitchen is probably twice as cold as it was when I last was there. The fridge looks like has perspired, and the sweat around it has frozen over, I scrape my name into the frost.

M- I- C- T- H-

Should I make a frozen dinner…? 

I try to open the freezer door, but it’s frozen shut. 

I pull harder, and harder.

It won’t open. 

I grasp it firmly and thrust downwards, it flips open and I fall back, and I hear two thumps after mine.

I look over and there are my parents, frozen with an expression of fear.

My heart drops to my stomach, my palms soak, my eyes freeze wide, my face is blank. 

I can’t say anything, I try to scream/

Louder/

LOUDER!

Nothing- All that comes out is a gasp for air, and my body goes into auto-pilot. I sprint outside.

I collapse. Drop in the middle of the road.

Covered in red from the violent rain.

I’m looking upwards, completely broken by what I’ve seen…


Tens upon tens of bodies tied up from branches hanging upside down.

Headless.

ephique,5,,3,1r8wrl,,3,"It was Friday and myself being unemployed at the time, was up for something to do. You see, my girlfriend was invited to a party by her new friends from her drama-crew she recently joined and she wanted me to join her. This party took place on the other side of our suburban ruin of a town and it made common sense for her to message me the location whenever she knew the exact address; again, she didn't know these people that well.

Around 9 pm I left our apartment to head to the party, still not knowing the exact location I figured I could at least walk to the bus-station that had buses taking me to that part of town. Luckily I got a message from one of her new friends on the way there. Describing how to get to the destination. My girlfriend hadn't paid her phone bill and had to use a friend’s phone to message me, she has done this before. She hates her network company.

I took the bus, taking me as far as I could bus-wise. After that I had to get a taxi, the only taxi driver I ended up finding had never driven anyone to that location before apparently; I'm guessing the drama-people pretended they had taxi's whenever they needed one. Good practice.

The taxi driver, who I believe was Mexican dropped me off at the address and headed back for the city shortly after. I had no idea her friends was throwing a party out in the middle of nowhere, and it was getting really chilly so I didn't spend too much time figuring out the mysteries of the universe out there; I ran up to the door.

My first impression was that this must have been the most quiet party in the history of parties. I heard no music, no laughing, no tapping. Nothing. Before I knew it I was banging on that door, it had no ringer or anything, I had to pound that thing. No one opened.

I felt pretty confused at this point, I did still have my phone though. Although calling my girlfriend was no use 'cause I already knew her network always shut off inbound and outbound calls and texts whenever she hadn't paid. Out of desperation I phoned her friends number, but no one answered. I assumed they were partying too hard to hear the phone ringing and I found myself mislead by a tired taxi driver who took me to the wrong house. That's the only explanation that made any sense to me what so ever.

Now, I was out of options. I couldn't walk back into town 'cause not only would I not know the exact roads out there; but it was also ridiculously freezing outside. I tried banging on the door again and again, maybe an old couple lived there or something and they would wake up if I hit that door hard enough.

I ended up smashing the lever on the door accidentally, the door wasn't even locked. I looked around to make sure that no one was watching me because I did realize that being desperate or cold wouldn't really vouch well in court. I couldn't see anyone so I sneaked into the house. Whenever I had made sure no one was in the first room of the house I closed the door behind me. Not being sure what I was looking for, I walked around aimlessly trying to figure out if anyone was home or not; my mind started to wander off into finding explanations. I remember one being that they were playing a prank on me, which wasn't a bad theory since the door was after all left unlocked.

I didn't check much of the first level of the house before I started walking up a great set of stairs leading me in a spiral upwards. It was very creaky so if anyone was awake in this house they'd easily hear me at this point. I figured no one was 'cause the entire house was dead silent with the exception of the noise I brought into it myself.

Upstairs I found a bedroom just across the hall from where the spiral staircase ended. It seemed to belong to a girl, a small girl. It was an empty bed in it and paintings on the walls, you know the type kids do in pre-school that parents end up pretending are works of genius to make the kid feel better and gain confidence? Yeah, those kind of paintings.

I got shocked by my own text-message signal that I stupidly left on way too loud, it was from an unknown number; I was hoping it was my girlfriend or her friend explaining the mix-up or something. The text said:
""Alright, we are all set! I hope you haven't fallen asleep my little unemployed darling. Make your way to 24th Radcliffe Street, it's not too far from the super market by the bus-station. Oh, and this is Jessie's phone... sorry, forgot to pay my fascist phone bill again. Sorry that it took me so long to message! Love you :)""",Take Me Out,6,nosleep

Sunny day in Nevada. Families having lunch outside, fathers teaching their sons how to grill steak, playgrounds
filled with kids. Every year I plan a trip with my son. Nevada has really nice caves in it. When I was little,
my father always took me there and so did his father. I didn't want to break this chain. I told Jake, my son, about that
cave that I used to visit but I did not have enough time to take him there until now. He was still sleeping when
I stepped in his room.
""Honey wake up!"" Jake opened his little eyes and whispered:
""What?""

""We are going to see the cave I told you about!"" he instantly jumped out of his bed and become so excited that
I can't even tell about it. He got dressed and ran to have something to eat. About five minutes later he was screaming
from the garage door.
""Hurry up mom!""

One hour car ride. Not the longest one he ever had. He kept asking me about the place. I just smiled and told him to
be patient. As soon as I parked the car, he blasted out the door and ran to the back of the car to grab two flashlights. 
""You ready?"" I asked him. He obviously was so we started walking towards our destination.
It was dark in there. Darker than anywhere else. Flashlights on.  He just kept pushing forward. Sometimes I couldn't 
even catch up with that little kid. After a sharp left turn I saw him standing there. He found it. The biggest hall 
in the cave. Every wall was shining when the light of our flashlights reached them.
""Beautiful isn't it?""

""It is indeed!"" he answered. He turned his head towards me but it was only q light at a corner 
that he could see. He totally crapped himself. ""Mommy wait for me!"" He started running towards the light 
that he could see. It is a maze down there. - MOM! - he screamed.
""I'm here honey!"" He caught up with me. He just gasped there and started to be a bit relieved as he realized 
that he was not alone in that dark cave again.
""Hey calm down little boy! I'm not leaving you here!"" went closer to him and whispered:  ""Or am I ?

I've been having a lot of bad dreams for the past 3 weeks, but i think this one tops all of them. Anyhow, I dreamt that I lived with my boyfriend in a big house, it was night and we both were sleeping. Suddely i wake up, and I sit up in our bed. I'm fully aware that I'm sleepwalking but I can't stop myself, lay down again or do anything about my actions. I start walking out in a big hallway (this is where the main door is located), then I enter a smaller, much more narrow and dark hallway, and in the end is a small wardrobe-like room which is truly pitch black. This scared me a bit since I am afraid of the dark but I just keep walking, I don't even consider NOT to walk in to the wardrobe. So I find myself inside this pitch black tiny room and I close the door and I lock it. Once I have locked the door i just panic, I'm not afraid but I simply can't stop screaming, I remember the scream so well, it was a true scream of despair, I screamed at the top of my lungs but I still was not scared. I started to bang the door, the walls, everything while screaming and crying as hard as I could. Finally my boyfriend comes to the rescue and the door was open now, he just grabs me and tells me I was sleepwalking and I just said ""I know"" in the sternest voice. He's scared out of his life and crying and I just looks at him like he's crazy and then i just go back to bed like nothing happened.

ephique,0,,0,1rikrx,,4,"I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom, dad and big sister. We were a normal family, neither happy nor sad, somewhere in between. I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano, practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs. It was also some sort of medicine for me; it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes. You see, my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting. I hated it; I hated hearing her yell at my poor mother.

During a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad, making sure that I didn’t have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible. My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up. I remember jogging most of the route home, since my dad sounded so serious. It gave me the creeps to say the least.

I jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house. The kitchen was the first room you’d see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs. As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably, something had definitely happened. My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch, he told me to sit down as well.

I was scared and curious at the same time. Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didn’t bother caring too much about any of my sisters business, so I could figure out that this wasn’t about my sister. I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible. My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say, as if he didn’t know how to explain something to me.

Finally, after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time. He said: “Your mother…” and then he needed to grasp some air, and he continued: “Your mother has passed away.”

I was eight years old and I couldn’t grasp that concept. I didn’t understand death, or that my mom was eternally gone. I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards god-knows-what, I remember thinking how unfair this was. I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly, he didn’t know what to do and he was in shock at the time.

My sister continued crying, she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didn’t actually care to know at that precise moment. She was just being desperate and no one could blame her. I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there, I thought that was why she was crying so much. I didn’t shed a single tear; I kept it all inside. Of course that didn’t mean this incident didn’t haunt me for years, I never stopped thinking about my mother. 

The aftermath of my mother’s death is what has been shaping my life the recent years. My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane. My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital. Something I didn’t even think existed when I was eight. This resulted in that I didn’t get to meet my sister very often, my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge; but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was. I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it, and I didn’t blame him. 

I was guessing that my sister wasn’t doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by, something that troubled me; I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad. It felt so dead, and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died. We didn’t do anything, I literally spent all time at home in my room, making or playing music. Me and my dad didn’t even greet sometimes when I came home from school, it was depressing. My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mother’s death, something that I’m about to get into.

You are probably wondering how she died by now, and it’s a legit question to be asking. The best answer I could give you is that I don’t know. My dad has always told me she died of liver-failure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me. It didn’t add up, my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didn’t drink. I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasn’t mature enough to hear the truth. In addition to this, whenever I asked my dad about this matter he’d get heavily upset. Nowadays I never ask about my mom’s death, nor do I even bring up mom as a topic.

Years went by and I ended up being fourteen. It kept going like I just described, I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house. My dad did work, he had the night-time shift at a local bottle factory, I’m not joking, he actually made glass bottles for a living. He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister, they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job. You guessed it, the bottle factory.

I was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen. My school was the type that had an after-school library that didn’t close till 11 pm. I didn’t need any of the books or supplies that the library offered; I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa. Either way, I hadn’t seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldn’t see her again for another two. 

When I arrived at the house the front door was open, “This is odd?” I thought. Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mother’s old jars. It’s never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door, number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys. It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it. The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door, around the lock. I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone, ready to call the police. 

This is when I heard something coming from inside the house. I was dead scared to say the least, this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse, I didn’t know. It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor, trying to move it. It was so dark as well, I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door, technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights. I started to slowly pace into the house, walking towards the noise. This is where I had to make a decision, was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark? I picked the former. I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window. It was my sister, naked. My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation; it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital. 

I switched on the lights in an instant. She had redecorated the entire kitchen, in the dark. Of course it all looked hideous and random; she didn’t know what the hell she was doing. I remember being in a slight discomfort, I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life. I also hadn’t seen her for a good couple of years at all. She didn’t look very comfortable either, she looked like she didn’t know who I was and was wondering what I was doing there.

I uttered “Linda?” out loud, that was her name. She didn’t respond, she just continued standing there looking at me. “Don’t you remember me, I’m your brother.” I still couldn’t get any feedback out of her; it was as if the wheel wasn’t spinning at all. I wasn’t sure what the protocol here was, not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured I’d try to call dad, before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered: “Don’t call dad.” This is when I realized she couldn’t be completely empty inside after all.

“You don’t want to call dad.” She continued.  I had no idea what to do, I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place. Luckily my dad got home at that point, not coming from a finished shift at work. He had a good five hours at least left, I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation. My father ran into the house as fast as he could.

This is when something I didn’t expect happened, he told me to leave. He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house. I asked him where I was supposed to go, he told me to wait in his car. Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didn’t think twice about it, I ran out to the car. As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times, I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts. I had no clue what the two of them were discussing, although I never saw my sister move her lips so I’m guessing my dad did most of the talking. 

After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car, he joined me inside. I remember asking why he didn’t bring Linda with him, “Don’t call her that name!” he shouted in response. I was so confused at this point. Dad started the car and drove me to my only friend’s house; I didn’t see him very often though. I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point, I didn’t really create any friendships. I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friend’s doorbell, his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused. I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight. I didn’t even know what was going on to be fair.

Whatever he told them worked, I got to spend the night at my friend’s place. Tim’s place, to be exact. It was pretty awkward I remember, I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish. We got to be desk-mates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester, so we weren’t very close. 

It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after; I guessed that made it easier for my dad, leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to. He did, but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tim’s parents, both trying to justify me as Tim’s best friend. I don’t know. Tim didn’t have many friends I guess.

On the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me, as if I was mocking him. I remember how desperate he looked, as if he had no fire left in his heart. He uttered the words: “Do you think I wanted any of this?” as he grabbed his hair in regret. “All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances, and I’m not blaming you when I’m saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours.” Is what came out of his mouth next. I tried to comfort him, telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not; I really didn’t have a lot of cards in my deck at this point. I mean my dad was basically losing it.

When we got home he told me that he was sorry, and that I should go up to my room. I did go up to my room but I got to tell you; I was starting to get very anxious about my dad. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on. I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online, I couldn’t sleep so pulling an all-nighter was my only real option. I was reading “A Brief History of Time” for a science project in school, I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes. I figured I’d go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway. I saw my mother standing just outside, looking right at me for a fraction of a second. Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane? It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink. 

The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night, I kept thinking about it as I couldn’t sleep. She looked deranged, scared and raw. The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white 50’s movie. I kept begging for the sun to rise up, I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what you’ll see. I might have been fourteen, but I can openly admit that I was dead scared.

It finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs, still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway. I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice. I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said: “I think I need help.” While holding the glass of juice as if he wasn’t sure he was going to drink the rest of it. I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasn’t sure, that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately. He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf, he thought that could give him some relief. I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea, jokingly adding that it’s better than hanging around the house doing nothing. He looked offended when I said that, something I didn’t really understand since he obviously worked all night, so that would justify him sleeping through the days.

I understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died. Well, it’s hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times, and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liver-failure. I mean it was possible. Imagine if it was true, and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me. That’s the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thing.

Having that explanation out of the way, I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time. It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf; I just walked into his room unexpected. A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room; it looked similar to an office which is nothing he’d ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory. He was actually sitting at his desk. Not only that, but the desk was flooded with paper-work of some sort, maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day, something he could manage from home. I didn’t ask; I had a big enough question for him as it were.

I dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured I’d sit on it. It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable, better than standing up anyway. Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying: “You want to know about your sister, and what happened the other night. Don’t you?” This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt, bringing up mom here would have been a car-crash. I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister. He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me: “Your sister is not right in the head; she’s in a mental hospital.” I couldn’t believe he hadn’t figured out that I would have known this by then. Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didn’t know. He explained the context, telling me that she couldn’t take our mother’s death. A tear started climbing down his cheeks, and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine, and then I left the room.

I realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business. I had no idea how I’d ever get the truth about my mother out of him. When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again, the image of my mom started crawling back to me. The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway, was my mind playing tricks on me? I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere. I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had, not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before. 

Night landed again, I hadn’t spoken to my father again that day. I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night, I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought I’d see my mother again. We all know you can imagine things in the dark, kids do it all the time. It’s as if your mind fills in the gaps, but that incident the other night was different. I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that I’d open the door to the darn hallway, and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer. I’m not going to lie, I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out; there was no sign of my mother. I turned on the lights and went back into my room.

Still not wanting to go to bed, not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured I’d listen through some of my older songs. I had loads of them; most of which weren’t very good however. I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good, especially not at writing my own songs. I guess I was decent at playing other people’s songs. I basically went through my songs in chronological order, it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years. 
It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs, and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine. I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before; it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs. Knowing that this wasn’t an overworked track yet, it was made just days ago and I hadn’t gotten around to mastering it yet, I figured I wasn’t going to give it more of a thought. That was until the neurons fired, that track was made the day I couldn’t sleep, the day I saw my mother in the hallway. Being a bit gullible I figured that I’d give it a go using my acoustic headphones. I tried everything. I played the song backwards; I cut out bass, middle frequencies, high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples. I couldn’t hear anything suspicious, just that white noise. 

I was a bit disappointed, at the same time relieved. Although that white noise shouldn’t have been there, nothing in my room could have made a noise like that. I didn’t want to over-think the situation, so I ended up hitting the bed. Later that night, as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before, slowly dozing off to sleep. I hadn’t been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when you’re in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you. I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere. Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise, it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder. I continued lying in bed, trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred, this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room. It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work. It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice; very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian. 

It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from, I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar. I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights. I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch, for the blink of an eye, just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again; just as the light went on. The same stare, same face, still that black and white filtered look from before. I got so shocked I fell down on the floor, the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant. I wasn’t sure what to make of this, and I definitely didn’t want to tell my father about what I had seen, knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital. 

I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldn’t let me sleep, I just couldn’t sleep at all. I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up, these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter. I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become. Whatever this all meant, and needless to say; I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

I met my father in the kitchen the next day, he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him. He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his work-crew later that afternoon. I was happy for him; he deserved some time out of the stress. After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added: “Have you been thinking of your mother lately?” As if he could read my mind. I told him that I was always missing my mother, and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately. He stated that he thought I had. I had no clue why.  Short after that he left for playing golf.

I kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night, I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing. In fact, I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed, how could it have been on? I had no idea. 

Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers. I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours. I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk, it got me a slight reminder on how he hadn’t gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet. The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort, as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company. I don’t know how I’d describe it better than that. After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address, I remember wondering why dad wouldn’t show me something like this: 

“Daddy, why didn’t you visit me last weekend. I thought you were coming back, I was waiting for you. I’m sorry if I made a scene, I thought something had happened to you! I ran to you because I wanted answers, no one has answers here. I’ve been getting visits lately, why can’t you come to me at the same time?”

I fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you, my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five year-old in this state. On after-thought I guessed my dad didn’t tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasn’t in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges. Although thinking about it, that doesn’t sound ridiculously different than a mental hospital.

The rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of work-related things and records of local police-investigations. Why would my father be looking into cases of murder, pedophilia, rape and almost anything you can think of? It wasn’t really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up. I knew he had a friend in the police force, that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them. I didn’t even want to know at the time, I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadn’t slept in far too long.
I apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that I’m dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there, I’m only taking precautions to make sure that I’m telling it right. If I’m finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right. 

My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work, which made complete sense. It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room, I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar. This time I wasn’t using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again. My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before, something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time, I wasn’t worrying about that. I was thinking about my mother showing herself again. Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itself.

Not too long into that night I started feeling sick of being in-doors for so long, and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing. I remember being on the sane side of the fence, thinking critically and trying to find solutions, not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell. I figured I’d take my bike down to a local gas station, not more than ten minutes from my house; I wanted some chips, candy and maybe a couple cans of soda. 

I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off; I got there faster than I thought I would. It wasn’t cold outside either; it was a pretty smooth night. After grabbing some generic brand of chips, Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left. I didn’t spend much time in the store, but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen. With no bike, feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home. 

Something out of the ordinary happened after this, and I wasn’t even sure if I was seeing things at first. I was walking on this huge open road; I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road. It was tied together with the forest behind our house. It was the type of road that didn’t have any traffic other than truck drivers, passing once every couple of hours at night. I didn’t want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what you’d imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear. I assumed she was looking for me; she was definitely staring at me. 

I continued walking, not necessarily fearing my sister. It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her, that she would never have done anything to hurt me. As I approached her she didn’t give me any response what so ever, she was just staring at me in a light-blue scrub-coat, looking lifeless. I had reached talking-distance; I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like one of those scenarios you can’t be prepared for in real life. She had started to shake a bit, I couldn’t tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous. I asked her if she was looking for me out there, and if she had escaped the hospital. She didn’t respond. I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me, as if I was a threat to her. 

After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back. I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon, or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it. She started to slowly bring it forth, it was a plastic bag. From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasn’t heavy, or dangerous for that matter. I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag, then she started to stretch it out to me: “I took this from your house the other day, I’m sorry. I think this belongs to you. Jonathan.” 

I do realize that I never told you my name, it is indeed Jonathan. I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even; she seemed to be so out of it. I remember grabbing the plastic bag, she wouldn’t let go of it too lightly either, it was as if she still wanted it. After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence, she wouldn’t stop staring into my eyes during these. Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad. Shortly after she started walking towards the forest; as if she knew where she was heading. 

I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister, whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit. I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dad’s car, acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch, as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister. I didn’t even know if I wanted him to catch her or not, she was purposely running away from him. He dragged her into his car and they both drove away, heading the direction he was originally going. This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital, and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times? Something wasn’t right, I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasn’t anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her. Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school, but that doesn’t change the logic of it. He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister, since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thing.

I ran the rest of the way home, trying not to drop anything; I still had all the items I bought at the gas station. I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did; I had no clue whenever he would get back, and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me. I couldn’t spot my dad’s car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house. I didn’t bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything, I made my way back to my room as fast as I could. I don’t really know why but I locked the door after me, as if there was something to fear. I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on. I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside; as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me. 

I never really thought of something until now, and that is how my sister could have found me. It must have been a coincidence, or she had been following me for a while; knowing she couldn’t approach me in the store. I don’t know.

I looked into the bag, it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room, and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen. After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever, for example there was a roll of tape in there. I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items. The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos, most being after mom died. The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks; they weren’t even dry, I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag. There was only one thing left in the bag, an usb-stick. 

I took the stick out and threw away the bag. Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house. The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasn’t sent to the hospital yet, but it was pretty much pending already. In fact, most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away. On one of them it’s my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing, she actually wasn’t acting too badly the first couple of weeks. I guess she didn’t process our mother’s death until later or something. Another photo is of dad’s old car, he had to sell it in order to compensate for our family’s financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had, my mother’s candle business. He loved that damn car with his entire heart; we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car. 

There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter “x” behind them. It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me. I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking. I figured my sister must have had done this, for what reason I was about to find out. I kept staring at the first picture; it was the one I told you about earlier, the one of my father’s old car. It was a Pontiac from the early 80’s and it must have cost him a fortune. I never had any particular memories of the car; I remember it spending most of its time in our garage.

I kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadn’t use the car more, he obviously loved it. The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper, for selling it of course. I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat. It wasn’t very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent. She had the same drained-out appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room, and this was taken after her death. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. I remember dropping the photo out of shock; so many thoughts started circling inside of my head.

dinofinger,0,,1,1rie11,,1,"    17^th May 2007.
I followed my dad went to Grandma's house. My cousin who lives with grandma, had a suspicion that something had happen to Aunt L &gt; *Her initial would be appropriate here* &lt; Aunt L was never in her sound mind but she prefer to live alone which is the best option avoiding the troubles she would cause to others. Grandma has a problem of [nagging](https://www.google.com/search?q=nagging&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a) disease which makes more Aunt L better suit live far from her lectures. 

Back again to my cousin, who received a call from Aunt L's neighbour. Her respond was *there was a sudden silent for the past four days*. Aunt L was never a social person who goes anywhere she wants and always out. She prefered to live in her tiny apartment secluded only her herself and herself she enjoys being with. But her neighbour help us to watch for her just in case for anything. So we respond to go and visit her house. My father, my cousin and I, the three of us went together with nothing held us back. 

As we arrive by the door, we knock and knock. From the window we can see noise screen from her small tv at the corner. But there was no sign of her. Somehow her grill lock and the door were changed, the key my cousin brought didn't fit at all. Maybe she doesn't want us to barge in anytime we want. My dad took the liberty to call the locksmith while giving positive thoughts to my cousin that everything was fine. 

30 minutes pass. The locksmith do his magic and opened the door. Such stench came out in full loaded right to our faces. Right in front of the door we can see Aunt L laid still in the toilet facing the floor. A 15 year old me shocked and I just watched her body in strip condition only a towel covered her other half and her faeces was right below her and all over behind her. Yet she is still alive, blinking and gasping.

My dad pull me back allowing my cousin to go in. I can still feel my father clenches my arms so tightly when he saw his sister. He said ""*[I better call the ambulance](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-an-Ambulance)*"", so he did and left. My cousin call me out to help pick her up. But she was too heavy, we can't even push her to the side. So my cousin rinse her with water to clean her off. I was told to took a towel and wipe her face. I could say her face was in a total blankness. 

25 minutes later the ambulance arrive. They took her with a stretcher. Both of us went down to send her off. I can remember certain vision of some neighbours pry on their window looking out what was happening. My dad went together with Aunt L, so left me and my cousin. Soon my mom and sister arrive bringing cleaning equipment. We spent whole 3 hours cleaning her house. Based on what I heard my cousin said ""*The man who always deliver her food got no respond from her for three days. That's when he ask the neighbour if she had gone somewhere. I bet if we were too late, she might have gone by any minute unconscious on the floor*""


    18^th May, 2013
We had her funeral in the day after the day we thought she would died 6 years ago. Funny the coincidence of the date just *one day after* we laughed. My cousin gave a speech said she was a fighter. Indeed she was. I think her life is better after that 17^th May living in the retirement home. She was more happier than before she was a shut-in.

As I was doing this, the big rocking chair next to his litter box was swaying, and I gave him a quick glance. I felt him sniff at my ear. He then jumped off the chair and walked into the kitchen.

echoes007,4,,2,1rhee9,,2,"I’ve always been a non-religious person. I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything. To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily. But I’ve always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff. I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this “religious experience” we all want, but I never got it. So, after a while, I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God, or spiritual experience, or anything that’s real, that will make me see life in a whole new perspective. Naturally, this got me down and depressed a bit. It was then when I started seeing 11:11 everywhere. It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines. I remember vividly, my heart stopped, and I remember a sound, like a blender going off in my head. When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me, I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box. It read 11:11. This stuck with me for a long long time. I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was 11:11 in the morning and 11:11 at night. As if reminding me that it saved my life. This was going on for a while, when I went as far as Googling what it was. Unfortunately, the 11:11 thing was associated to some spiritual stuff, things I thought were bullshit to begin with. But still, 11:11 was always there. Slowly I stopped thinking about it, and my 11:11 experiences were less and less. It wasn’t until last week when I was driving home (I was butt sober) from an event when it started raining. My tires and brakes were messed up and I didn’t get a chance to change them, and besides, it hardly ever rains in this town, so this came as a surprise to me. As I was driving up a hill, I lost control of my car completely on the wet road, and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car, but I couldn’t. This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road. Again, when I snapped out of my panic mode, the first thing I looked at was the time, and it said 11:11. I’m not one who believes in coincidences, but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me. Even though I don’t believe this stuff, there is NO way that could happen. Has anyone else experienced 11:11, or has randomly been “forced” to look at a clock when it’s 11:11? Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSD/DMT I took? ",11:11,4,nosleep
Jerbsybear,0,,0,1rh5g6,,2,"There are tales of a man committed to Central State

Who killed his wife and children while he asphyxiates

His doctors with the bloody spinal cord

Of his fat nurse, who cares if she was old

When the guards rushed in, it was no problem at all

bashing their brutish faces straight into the wall

Bursting through the heavy front doors

He killed everyone on the first floor

No one would stop him, no, not this time

5 years of waiting, no stopping on a dime

He had to get out on this night

To meet his lover, one at first sight

Taking his science class, year after year

Convinced that she loved him, held him dear

Called her ""favorite student"" and all

Had her parents give him a call

To invite him to dinner, on a cold winter's night

Slaughtered her family, their faces were a sight

In the judge's court, he mercilessly pleaded insanity

When, in reality, it was egotistical vanity

If he couldn't have her, no one can

To kill her new parents was the plan

Standing outside of the house that was soon to be theirs,

Looking to seek justice, to seek what's fair

So as he broke in and brandished the knife

She knew he was back to take a life

So quickly she fled into the night

Leaving behind more victims, as she took flight

She ran two miles straight to the highway

Waving for anyone to stop, to go her way

As hand grabbed her from behind the bushes

His knife drives deeper and deeper as it pushes

Past her vitals and deep into her heart

All flashbacks of her life seemed to fall apart

As he whispers ""This...feels so right""

Her mind tries to escape into the night

The fires of his greed are not yet doused

As he tries to get back to the house

He plans to take another life

While sharpening his serrated knife

""Am I next, is he coming,"" you cry with fear

Hell no, I'm done and sitting right here.",Sitting Here,2,nosleep
InsanityInABottle,0,,1,1rgw03,,2,"“Extra, Extra! The Piggy killer is at it again!” Yelled the paperboy, holding a darkened paper above his head, screaming the same phrase over again, as if it was no big deal. I walked towards him and asked him “How much?”
“Only ten cents sir.”
“Ha. Must be a pretty good story then.” I said, as I fumbled for a large dime. I handed it into the boy’s hand, it’s gleam bouncing the light of the sun, veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes. I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper, quickly turning from the boy, hearing “How about a tip sir?”
“How about you wipe your ass with the metal I’ve already given you.” I said back to the boy, who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers. As I walked along Hero’s Avenue, I kept the paper open, reading it over again. In large font, shouted “Piggy killer’s new victim!” with a picture of a woman, apparently known by the name of “Jessica Turrow.” She wore a large smile on her face, as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast, I presumed.
	The article read “The psychopath, depicted as a man with a pig’s head on worn over his own face, has struck again. Witnesses described him as large, while wearing a reddened trench coat, then finally, a bib, which read the term KISS THE COOK, slathered neatly against his chest in gore. He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual, was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn. We had identified the victim, through a ring found on the hand of the woman, who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church. If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description, contact the police immediately, or you may be his next victim.”
	I laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands, all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another, threading the needle on the two way street, not large enough for two cars to fit on.
	I walked towards the police station, which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop, a brothel and a printing office. A police car drove by; it’s loud horn sounding, flashing red and white, reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes. I walked into the station, the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose. A man screamed from across a large waiting room, looking down at the paper, then looked up and said “Oh. It’s the wonderful Flynn. Of course my dear, come, come.” I walked past him, glaring at his smug face, and then opening the door into my office.
	A man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me. He smiled and said, “Well hello sir, I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killer”
“The pig one?”
“Y- wait, there are more?”
“I believe there are, just they might not like attention as much as our friend here.”
“Well… thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept, but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer, coming out of his lair.”
	The man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk, arranging them appropriately. “So, if you look at these pictures, it was for when he first got into the business, holding small weapons, all identifiable, all related to the cutting of meat. Then as you look to the left, these are the later pictures, which are of him coming out, holding bodies on his shoulders, sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up, putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself, all the while in his pig mask. But, he seems to be getting careless. He cam outside, barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo, his face seemed veiled in… something. Something sticky, something gruesome. But if you look closer, you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face. Large, hooked nose, eyes, clouded in blue, teeth, sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouth.”
“Ha. So you’re basically implying that you’ve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it? I beginning to suspect you’re the killer!”
“But that would be silly. Why would a crazy give himself away?”
“I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”
“I believe this conversation is getting a bit heated. I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought I’d tell you where I’ve seen such events. Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on 1800 Bellcove Street? Well there’s your place. Sir!” said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag, which smelled of defecation and nickels. I watched as he slammed the door, then sighed and sat down on my desk, rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter, updating the information I’ve received from the man.
“Mysterious man visits police station, says he has a lead on the piggy killer. As you all know, the notorious killer has crossed the line now. Enough to even be called a serial killer! What a sick bastard he is.” I continued being as pessimistic as possible, updating the paper, then grabbing my camera as I finished the article. Typing in my name, finishing with my name, saying “Written by: Flynn Covetail.”
	Darkness was beginning to shroud the air, perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment. Light rain was spattering against my window, racing down to the bottom of the screening, only to fall against an umbrella below. As I left my office, throwing on my coat, I screamed to the man in the front desk, “Going out to…oh, let’s see...1800 Bellcove Street? If I don’t come back, Phone someone.” I said with a laugh, while walking outside.
	Instantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on “Western Lagoon highway” as the frivolously worthless people would say. I walked down towards the street, which was naught but four blocks from here. I passed by Dontell’s Donuts, Redgar’s Rotisserie and Salam’s Spices, all involved in the fattening of desperate cops, as only fattening diners were located near the station, so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against us.
	I reached the butcher’s place, which had been looted to hell by the anarchists, who were just a group of thugs that didn’t do shit to overthrow the government. The door had been pried off it’s hinges, yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains, hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe. Within the butchery, the first thing I noticed was a bed, a homeless man sleeping on it.
	I simply ignored the bum and walked around, searching for anything considered suspicious. I walked through the door, smelling the bum’s shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could. I looked through the shop, behind the counter I found several rusted knifes, which were corroded to the counter, which was a wooden rotten thing, with three cutting boards lining it, all of which nobody needed. The front of the shop seemed completely normal, but I listened to the bum waking, instantly screaming, “Who’s there! I will kill you if you’re trespassing on my property!” I laughed and screamed to him “I suggest you run out of here, or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes.” I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor, running towards me.
	I quickly turned, backing up against the wall, my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!” I shot to the side of the man, who quickly bolted for the door, a rat following closely behind him. I sat for a minute, catching my breath, while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion. As I stood, I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my head.








	Ha. Damn fool didn’t even know what he had coming. Shouldn’t have fucked with my grandpa… shouldn’t have yelled. My ears hurt. Are they ringing? Why the FUCK am I here? I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air, the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face, the pig’s blood leaking down my neck, warming me, keeping the cold away. I looked at my setup, which was simply the back room of a butcher’s shop, a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a room.
	Blood dripped into wooden bowls I’d gotten from the shop, the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling. Pigs, cows, chickens, even a few deer, but the most stubborn of prey, the pigs. The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling, their wrists cut, their feet missing, their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths. The damned pigs that walked the streets, reading their stories about who? About me! The beautiful man, who is dealing righteousness to the crazies, to the rich. Though they think that they’re so safe in their leather homes, they should be the ones making chairs; their dried hides need to be a part of furniture!
	Oh, what an inventor I will be! But the best part is, nobody looks twice at the photographer. Nobody looks at who’s behind the camera; they only care about the picture! And I am finally the one in the picture! Flynn, the little anus that believed he owned the whole world, because the police were backing him up. NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCH!
	I whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express. I raise him in the air, catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck. This self-conceited asshole needs one thing. A hook curving through the cheek, wrenched from his cheek. He thought I was the killer? NO! THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORD!
	Oh! My friend is waking up! Finally a new toy to play with. Oh, what a joy he will be! Oh no! What will I say to him? I guess I’ll just wing it. I guess I’ll just talk to him.  Where will I display this beauty? Ooh! The police station! Mmm, how delectable would that be? To show the pigs that even their weapons can’t defend them from me. THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME! I am a hero. I love being a hero and don’t try to talk me out of my heroism! I AM AMAING!








	My eyes slowly opened, to find a man in a pig mask, the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on it’s face. I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts! Why does my leg hurt? Where the hell am I? “Oh… you’ve awakened!” spouted the pig; it’s squeaky voice ringing through my ears. I screamed, “Help me! Help! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” 
“Now that’s not how you treat a guest, is it?”
“Fuck you.”
“Oh… language, language my dear friend. If you even try saying something like that, I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend Mr.Squeaks over here!”
	I looked to where he was pointing, which was a large column in the room, a decomposing rat nailed to the pole. “Somebody is going to catch you. They know where I am!”
“Oh, I believe they do, if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say!” said the phsyco with a smile. He pointed at the ceiling, which had two hooks on it, chains hanging from them and a headless man, blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness, into a wooden bowl. “Why are you doing this to these people?”
“Okay, okay, story time. Oh yay, stories! FUCK OFF GREG, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!”
	I looked at the pig with doubt, pain shooting up my leg, throbbing slowly into my brain. “SO, let me tell you why I love my job, okay? Okay. So, when I was twelve, I thought, I’m going to take pictures of weddings! I’m going to take pictures of people in love, because everyone else’s happiness, is mine.” He said this, while pinning his right hand against his heart, which contained an extra few layers of flesh, sewed against his own, along with a tattoo, stolen from his victim.
	“Okay, so anyways! What do ya know! I’m doing that now! I am a photographer! I love people being happy. SO, I one day, was at this one glorious wedding, full of lovely people. I had started talking to a woman and a little, oh what is it called? Fetish of mine was developed. As we were in bed, I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know, I have a few other… kinks. I wrung my hands around her delicate throat, stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth! I felt the rush as eventually, she started to fuckin’ bleed! WHAT A WHORE! She began to cough up blood, she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat, landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched, did I realize how wonderful blood tastes. Rich, creamy, delicious, blood, coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps. I invented ways of sucking people dry, licking them dry! Well, at first I was only an amateur, but, as I got better! Oh BOY did I start to love my job! Every wedding became a slaughter, every wedding gave me a new friend, because after all, nobody cares about who’s behind the camera! NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITS!
	So, pretty boy, I believe it’s time; you… started looking into my eyes, whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body.” He said this as his hand slid down from my chest, slowly down to my cock, grinning, spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed, slid a blade against it as chopped it off. I screamed out loud, blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled, then I fell asleep, never to wake again.

ReiKoroshiya,0,,0,1rgsca,,2,"Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life. Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me out.
how about I start at the beginning that seems easier. Well back in elementary, I was that kid the kid that really no one liked. I had a friend here and there but that's about it. I was basically a social outcast, 
I never really got my work done, I still don't. Note that I was a very, very angry child and no I was not spoiled if that's what your thinking, im the oldest of 3 kids who had been and are growing up in poverty, but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheap.
I had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head. I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the 3rd grade I found an author by the
name of R.L.Stine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interests.
A few of the simple things had scared me, and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind, I don't remember much about my childhood at all.
I don't know why I can't but that's just how it is. I do remember bits and pieces though, not anything like birthdays, mind you. Here Ile give some examples, I remember
when I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes, I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away. Years later I went back and found it, and of course it wasn't scary anymore. Another example
would be when I saw a ""witch"" in my closet, but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there, I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back on.
Once he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again. I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the room
and they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently 
about it. I can't remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly. Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldn't understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys, I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bed(I got top bunk). Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years, not much really
they don't seem to want to talk much about when I was younger. I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church, and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of me.
keep in mind I don't remember that about going to church, as a matter of fact I don't remember going to church at all. hmmm.... well skip forward to middle school where I had
actually made friends. I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny. I could barely even go a week without at least one detention. Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too, now
drugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that, but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I mean
certain ones that is, the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do, smoke, drink, etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and there
is no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I can't afford it and because of that im drug free. Not to much
happened in middle school, only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams (oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so if
say I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it, I also talk in my sleep) which sucks ass, The vast 
majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be home
free. I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won, even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldn't consider it a nightmare. I got my own room in the basement which was nice, and well my brother he was, how do you put it? 
Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that. Electronic malfunctions had started occurring, like waking up to my radio playing static, my alarm clock started to malfunction, etc. I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock 
went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear. Skip forward to highschool in the 9th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a change.
I read the hell out of creepypasta's and found some really cool narrators for them, listening to those was very enjoyable I didn't read scps often and I found a very long series called the holders.
Near the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didn't have a bad feeling to it, the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any sense.
Jump forward one more year, I had flunked my freshman year because I don't do my work. On those professional tests that they make you take S.A.T's or some shit I did 
insanely good on those like I should be an A- student overall. Now i reside in alternative ed. Im 15 right now. I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead of
Baptist a few months ago. Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymore.
That thing I actually saw it, I fucking saw it, it was short like about a foot and a half tall. I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleep
with my blankets over my head. Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away 
from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me. I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it I
think it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day. It might have seen me and it might be watching me type this.
It is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really, really dark, everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around it.

please tell me.",My Life.,2,nosleep
highchairchildren,3,,1,1rgqmu,,2,"I'm looking for any input. If anyone has had experiences like this, is there a way to stop it?

So this started about two years ago. In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling, like something bad was going to happen all the time.  I was anxious, always alert and never at rest. I hardly slept, primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer. 

Then, I started seeing things.

When I say seeings things I don't mean like hallucinations, well not really. I'm not crazy. There were never any voices and there never have been. It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes. 

Mostly accidents.  It happened once while I was sledding.  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about 20 ft. or so where it met a busy road. Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes, people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill. A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened. I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by. There was blood everywhere. I snapped back to reality and looked around. Everything was fine. There was no blood, nobody was hurt, just kids sledding around having fun. 

I continued to have random ""visions"" for the entire year. They varied in severity. The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards.  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner.  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove.  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash.  As I was seeing it, I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove. In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed, begging me to stop.  I snapped back and couldn't speak. I teared up and thought I was going to puke.  I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, sat down on the ground and cried. I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life. I got up and reentered the kitchen, finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened.  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness.  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldn't come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me.  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldn't afford. 

Then it stopped. As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than I'd had before.  It stayed away for a while. I mean really a long time.  I was vision free for an entire year.

I was prompted to write this because I had another one the other.  The first in over a year but I am scared. I don't want it to start again.  The most recent one was more subtle.  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg, somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere.  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain.  Then I flashed back and it wasn't there. I hadn't even cut myself.

I know this must sound crazy, like some Final Destination bullshit.  I swear to you I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't have hopes that someone could help.  Any input is welcomed.",Can anyone help?,3,nosleep
gogo345,1,,4,1rdw2r,,0,"You know when you are really young you're afraid of the dark? You get a night light to make it better but there is always that sense of fear.

Sure your parents tell you it's nothing and when you get older you grow out of it but there is always something in the back of your mind that makes you afraid of it. 


Maybe your claustrophobic of the thought of the darkness surrounding you, consuming you to the point where you are trapped not seeing the light again.

cavs8,7,,2,1rd3m8,,1,"The following is a recount of a dream I had last night.  This is my first time posting here and writing something like this so I’m sorry if it’s poorly written or riddled with mistakes.  Also, I’m awful at titles.  Thanks for reading. 

I struggle to stay awake at my desk.

“Go home, cavs8, there’s nothing going on today.”

*Thank you.  Why was I even here today, it’s Saturday*.

Grumbling to myself, I drag my feet to the car, get in and turn the key.  Nothing.  Just great.  Well, at least it’s only about a three-mile walk home.  I pocket my keys and think about grabbing my rescue knife for just a fleeting moment.  It’s not the best of neighborhoods but I should be fine walking home.  *Leave it*.

As I make my way down the street, passing one unspectacular building after another, I notice an attractive woman walking a few steps ahead of me.  I smile to myself and try to remember the last time I’ve been with a woman.  She glances back, notices me leering at her like an inexperienced teenager. She slows down.  

*Is she smiling at me*? 

“Hey there, you’re looking a little down.  What’s wrong?”

“N-nothing.” 

It’s a wonder I was able to stammer out any sort of reply.  She’s gorgeous, why talk to me?  Soft face with bright blue eyes that I could only stare at in wonder. Plump lips, coated in pink, oily lip-gloss.  Her jet black hair billowing lazily in the wind.  That damn smile.  

“Well, I was looking to have a good time and you’re more than welcome to join me hun.  For a price.” 

*Oh, now it makes sense. Well, screw it, why not*? 

I nod my head in reply and agree.  I follow her, mind wandering onto more…primal needs.  I should have been paying attention to my surroundings, noting the darker and more abandoned area where I was being led.  We’re walking up old, brittle concrete steps that must have been laid down decades ago before I think clearly again.  Too late to take note of my surroundings now.  The iron railing I grasp is cold and worn down but rough from all the years of exposure.  The air is thick, heavy and smells moldy.  *How can someone even breathe in there*?

We enter the loft.  *Was there something on the door*?  *Did she give me a name*? *I can’t remember anything*. *What was I doing here again*?  My view suddenly shifts to something out of an old video game.  I get a bird’s eye view of the place. It’s all pixelated 8-bit graphics.  One other woman was walking around but I can’t make out any of her features.  *This is…odd*.  I feel a light touch on my shoulder and the whisper of soft words, stealing my attention away from everything else to once again focus solely on her.  Her breath was warm, causing shivers to tremor throughout my body.  My view violently shifts back to my own eyes.  I look to the beautiful, mysterious woman with nothing but a blank look in my eyes.  

""Make yourself comfortable on the bed over there.  We’ll have to wait for our bodyguard to get her before we can have any fun.  He can’t make it until the night so until then, relax."" 

I should have found that last statement weird.  *What time was it*?  *Wasn’t it dark out when we were walking here*?  *Why do we have to wait for a bodyguard now*?  *I’m already here*.  *If I were to do something, wouldn’t I have already done it*?  *Forget it.*  I flop onto the bed and lay down on my back, right leg extended while the left is pulled up as if I’m mirroring the number four with my legs.  The other, indistinguishable woman joins us.  She cuddled up next to me on my right side further emptying my head of what little rational thoughts I had left.  That sweet voice was back in my left ear, talking to me as if I was the most important person in the world.  *When did she make it onto the bed?  Wasn’t she just standing by the doorway?*  

She drapes her unnaturally soft leg over my left leg and blithely draws random designs onto my chest with her fingertips. 

""Alright baby, relax, we’ll be having fun before you know it.""

I can’t wipe this stupid smile off my face.  I close my eyes for what seems like a moment.  When I open them, something is wrong.  Very wrong.  The room that seemed so inviting is now dark and cold.  I can’t see a doorway, just an empty shadowy space that seemed to stretch open like a hungry maw twisting my vision as the room seemed spin uncontrollably.  My heart pounds in my chest.  I look to my right where the other woman once was.  She's gone.  The familiar weight is on my left but I can’t move my leg.  I need to get up.  I need to leave.  I can’t be here anymore.  Get off me!  

The form next to me shifts, straddles me.  Her arms are straight, each palm flat, firmly planted next to my shoulders.  The long, black hair is in my face.  I can feel it faintly brush against my skin.  I try to move her off of me but she won’t budge.  I’m pinned down like a helpless prisoner.  She slowly begins to raise her head.  I notice her once beautiful eyes are now shut.  Bulged, gray eyelids are all that I can see.  Her entire face is now dull, pocked with blemishes.  I start to breathe heavily, close to hyperventilating.  The head continues to rise.  Wake up!  Oh God, wake up! Sometimes wrong!  I try to move again.  My legs won’t work.  My arms won’t work.  I can’t tear away my eyes from her dead, leaden face.  I start to scream.  

My eyes snap open.  I’m home in bed.  I still can’t move my legs.  There’s heavy pressure on my chest and I can’t stop breathing heavily.  There’s a slight outline of a woman above me, face now unrecognizable.  I can still feel her hair on my face.   *Get it off*!!  *Was she laughter at me before I woke up*? *Roll over*.  *Turn on the TV or light or something*! *Anything*.  *Relax….relax…I’m never sleeping on my back again*.

Johnvincent1,0,,2,1rbvri,,1,"The closest thing I have ever documented to a legitimate ghost is a photo that my aunt took last month. My family (mother, three aunts, five cousins and six or seven second-cousins) went to visit my grandparents on their farm in Cairo, New York. The little sparsely inhabited town is about 100 miles north of NYC and about a three hour drive from our home on Long Island. I've been visiting my grandparents up there for years now and have been visiting the farm every summer since I was born (and winter too since my grandparents moved there permanently after they sold their home on LI about 8 or 9 years back). I'm very comfortable up there, even though nights are sometimes a bit eerie due to the streetlights being either nonexistent or widely spread and the nightly barking of wild dogs in the woods surrounding the house.

Anyway, I'm going to try to keep this brief. To the story now.

My aunt and her boyfriend are recently engaged and my aunt used this little opportunity to bring up her boyfriend's parents (who are Italian immigrants) with them to meet my grandparents. This was the first time they ever met in person and the two couples seemed to hit it off quite quickly. It made sense because my grandfather is Italian and pretty much thought that my aunt's boyfriend's parents were really nice and intriguing people, I suppose. 

The time passed quickly and before anyone knew it, it was 2:30 AM. My aunt and her boyfriend decided it was time to take his parents down the road to their rooms at the Bavarian Manor. 

The Manor is a 150 year old Inn that spans many acres and boasts gorgeous lakeside rooms and a peaceful atmosphere. As well as some pretty spooky vibes now and then when the hour is late.

So my aunt and her future husband took his parents down the road, walked them to their rooms and then back down the stairs and started to head back through the lobby when my aunt's boyfriend stops. 

""Hey, this is weird. Did you feel that?""

My aunt looked at him, puzzled. ""No. What are you talking about?""

He shook his head, ""I don't know, I think I just felt something pass us. Something cold.""

My aunt said at that point, she actually did feel a little cold and this scared her. She wanted to leave.

""Wait,"" he said. ""Let's just take pictures. Just one each, me and you, of the lobby and if we don't see anything we'll get out of here. I just have this weird fucking feeling.""

My aunt just looked at him and agreed to do it because she just wanted to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. So she took a picture. And then he took a picture. He looked down at his and frowned. 

""Nothing,"" he grunted. ""What about you?""

He looked over at my aunt and her face was utter stone.

""What? What are you looking at?"" He moved closer and peered over her shoulder. He shivered as he stared down at the phone and saw this...

They then sped home and showed everyone who was still awake the photo. Everyone seemed to have the same reaction: Complete and total shock. No one could believe their eyes, and as a family of believers (in the supernatural) we all felt a little shaken to have this (even if it is but a shred) proof from a source in our own family who we know is honest and has no reward to gain in something like this. She just snapped the photo... And that's what came out in it. I still get the chills thinking about going back up there again, which I'll be doing next week (the day after Thanksgiving and for the whole weekend). I'd be lying if I said I wasn't preparing to venture over to the Manor to do some... ""Hunting"" of my own.

Last summer i got a job working at a local car yard. I would usually just strip cars of their parts. It was a nice job but the heat was unbearable. I remember having to go inside every 30 mins just to take a break. one day i was at my station pulling apart a rear end. i had left my tool on my table when i had left to go inside. when i came back out i noticed the tool was gone. i looked every where. i gave up and borrowed another tool from my co-worker. later that day i was locking up what we called the backyard. the backyard was basically a large field where we placed all of are cars. when locking the opening to it i found my tool near when of the cars. i thought maybe the guys there were pulling a prank. i asked them but they said they had nothing to do with it. as the days went by, more and more odd things took place. while at work one day i had noticed the gate to the backyard kept opening and shaking. i thought it was just the wind but something in my mind knew it wasnt. i went to go check it out and see what was making it go back and forth. as i approached the gate something moved behind the car. i yelled out but nothing happened. i stood there for a few minutes, my heart was pounding in my chest. soon i saw movement again i stepped back and without warning a tall dark figure rose up. i stepped back not knowing what to do. i ran back to my station where i had kept a gun. i grabbed the gun and ran back but nothing was there. the next day we put motion sensors just in case the intruder came back, nothing happened that week. the next week i was driving home late and noticed someone was behind me. this was very unusual, since i took a dirt road home. the car soon stopped and turned out its headlights. once i got home i noticed my front door was opened. i sat there in disbelief staring at the opened door. suddenly a dark figure came out of the door. we made eye contact and the figure fled back into the house. i ran inside with the same gun i had at my work. i searched the house for the next hour. the house was a reck, everything had been torn. i was in complete shock not knowing what do to. i called the cops but they weren't much help. the next night i woke up heard banging out side my window. i turned on the porch light and outside there were three men in dark cloths whispering. i soon as they saw me they all looked at me and said something i could not understand. i ran outside but they mysteriously vanished. the following morning i noticed two weird symbols on the wall they had been near. ive tries washing it off but i wont go away. i have since left my job and have never seen them again

ChainerSummons,0,,10,1r79o3,,0,"First, allow me to assure you that I am certain of my sanity and of my cognitive abilities. My name is Zachary Wilhelm.

My logic- whether it is flawed or otherwise, leads me to believe that each person knows fear. Viewing these fears in those I observe shows that it is safe to say that each person has rooted, elemental fears.

More accurately, we are afraid of the unknown within the dark, or more commonly the uncertainty of the future or that of death and what lies beyond.

It is said by some that at one point such irrational fear was more than a leftover disposition from the dawn of mankind. I believe that this collection of fears served our ancestors well, and that they continue to serve us.

I assure you, this phobia is not some obsolete racial trigger. We need this now as much as ever.

There are some of us, maybe even a few of you reading this, who are aware of the presence of the unseen. Aware that existence continues in darkness and that it is possible for that existence to expand beyond our initial perception. Maybe, like me, you feel a pressure in your head and hear a light, squeaking ring just barely audible to you, whispering that the world has changed around you. Others I have met and spoken to say that their first sign of these dangers is a smell of ozone, as if a massive electrical charge had been displaced nearby, rending the air.

I would speculate that we all feel these things from time to time in some form or another, but that it does not register on our conscious level. For those of us that have this sense, that unease may be keeping us intact and connected to the world we know. 

Ask yourself how it is possible in such a modern age of technology and advancement to simply disappear when we interact with so many people on a daily basis. Every day, more people just seem to cease to be. Sure, some... Hell, I'll be generous- MOST of the missing are eventually found either dead, alive, or however they may be found. We'll give it a nice big optimistic percentage of 80%. These pretenses seem solid, even hopeful. Four of five isn't bad at all, right?

What about the other one in five who blinks out of existence, never to return? Every town has that ""One in five"" disappearance that is just... gone- simply gone. It's as if the mist just swallowed them right up, isn't it?

This is just so. That is exactly what is happening. All these obscuring veils appear naturally throughout the world, with no exception. Every continent, nation, town, village... And they are created under predictable and natural conditions. Certainly there is no harm in the morning mists, but have you ever seen fog when the air was too dry and cool to hold it aloft and reason dictates it should simply not be? 

Within these otherworldly variations of nature, the world around you may slip away, and everything outside your vision ceases to be. Sound and light fall away, and you stand utterly isolated in your waning bubble of perception. You may have felt this, as I have. I would prefer to think we all have, but may have suppressed our  fearful senses.

These veils are like the curtains of a stage; heavy and thick and not meant to be crossed by us, the audience. Behind them lies the workings of our world and what may lie further beyond them still- into the epitome of our concept of the unknown or unknowable.

Allycat662,7,,8,1r67oh,,0,"Have you ever ran into *those* type of people that just fucking grate you the wrong way; the arrogant ones who get away with tons of shit and know they can get away with it?  Not the instances where you rise above it and claim your stake... but the more helpless cases.

You just want karma to intervene and give that little prick what's coming to them.

Energy work is something that I've been doing for over half my life, and there are ways to speed karma up on certain individuals who you feel have done grievous injustices to yourself and others.  There are definitely other ways to handle things of course, but I'd rather not have to kill people.  There are important lessons to be learned of karma and the desire to do harm to others.  There's a creed out there stating that whatever energy you put out into the world, you will get the same energy back threefold.


The first time I used energy against a person was when I was 14.  I did a stupid harmless love spell to get a crush of mine on a date.  He did agree on the date, but of course he got back with his ex.  Total energy backfire.

The second time I used energy against a person was a year later as a sophomore.  There was a really cute upperclassman I talked to all the time.  He told me that his long term relationship was crumbling and he just didn't feel it anymore.

His girl at the time was a likeable person, but she had an air of snottery about her I found irritating.  One day she walked by me while I was at my locker, and I threw my energy at her aggressively.  I didn't wish anything specifically, but the following Monday she walked into school with a broken leg in full cast.  Holy fucking shit.

Now, this may be just me, but I felt horrible about it.  And I got hurt too in return that same day in gym class.  I didn't break anything but it was an embarrassing situation since the cute upperclassman happened to share that class.

At this point I stopped using my energy against people.  I can do without the concequences. Until recently of course.  

I happened to stumble across a jerk-ass individual who was offensive in so many ways, it made my blood boil.  I don't use my energy against people anymore, so I did the next best thing:  I invoked the power of karma on their ass.

I collected the energy around me and made a silent plea to karma to give this asshole the karma coming to them.  I made the same plea another 12 times or so for good measure.  And karma answered in the form of physical pain against the offender.

Fml, what a frightening gift to have.  At first I gave in to karma and did nothing, but eventually I made another plea to karma that this person has had their karmic obligation fulfilled and to cease all further efforts (with a polite thank you).

The pain did subside, but gradual and slowly.

Now, I'm not going to say that this will work for all of you, and I'm sure it won't have much affect on situations much bigger than yourself, but I know that there's got to be some redditors out there that have done similar things.",Karma can be purposful. Can you use it?,8,nosleep
chocate,2,,5,1r5o4c,,1,"Cold nights, always cold.It gets really hot and you can actually feel the sun burn your skin but always always cold during the night. I was 10-11 years old at the time. I never met my father and my Mother left me and my brother with my Grandparents so she could work and give us a better future. Cold always cold. Constantly reminding myself that i was alone felt really cold. I had began to do bad in school, my grades were not the best. My mother had worked so hard for us, and all i could ever think was about how lonely i felt. I had my brother at my side but it always fell lonely. My heart had become a cold hard rock, always wanting to be loved but unable to.  10 years had already pass and i still remember how it felt, cold and yet so comforting. It felt like it understood me, and yet it felt so cold. 

I had always being a rebellious kid, always speaking my mind out. Never accepting what others thought is the right thing. I had developed my own acceptance of reality, i had to grow up fast and i was surprised at how childish the decisions of other kids were. i laugh at them, i saw them as lowly living creature. But those were my supposed friends. Always lonely no matter where i went, i was always fell left out. That feeling trigger my hated, and made me realized how superior i was to them. My heart was cold and i didn't care anymore. i just want to grow up fast and become something worthy of someone's live. 

i had done something real bad that night. Me and my brother were locked up in my old house. It was a flat with 3 rooms, it was old and falling to the ground, there were cracks all around. the windows were holding up somehow. My ant was really angry at me and my brother, she had always threaten us, saying that she would lock as up in that place. The place was were i was born, it was the place where i had grown up, it was the place where i saw my mother cry every day. Since the new house was built there was no need for me to go to the old house. There was nothing there after all. All empty and always so cold.  This night was no different everything was so dark, the only light you could see was the moon light. i could feel a chill going down my spine, i could feel my heart feeling been comforted, i felt like i belonged. Since we moved to the new house i couple of years ago, that place always scared me. Every time i went there i always left running,i always felt like something was always looking at me from behind, calling me, wanting me to stay there. There was always this malevolent presence, it didn't feel right. 

This night somehow was different, there was no presence, i couldn't feel anything. It was just cold. My brother was everything i had, a year younger independent as me, always looking strong as if nothing could ever hurt him. GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!! i heard him scream, his screams hold so much fear and so much loneliness, it sent chills down my spine. Every time he screamed i felt like if someone was patting on my back, rubbing his hand on my back. Cold, cold as my heart. I couldn't bear to see my brother so vulnerable, GET US OUT OF HERE!!!!! i could hear my self screaming. So much anger, it felt so good to scream my lungs out. It felt so good to finally scream my lungs out with no restrain. we scream for hours with no stop. 

I had some matches in my pocket, we lit up a fire with it which didn't last long. We had a metal bucket and some old would that had stay there. The fire didn't last long, as if there was not enough oxygen around. Even the burning fire felt so cold. we kept scream, asking to get us out of there. We been locked up for hours, it was already past midnight. You could see the moon and the starts, thousands of them. yet it was so dark and as always so cold. 

We screamed so much we felt as if our energy was being sucked in my something.  I felt week and light headed.  It suddenly got colder and colder, it was past midnight after all, it only gets colder. Suddenly we hear something scratching the door, as if it wanted to get in, and couldn't. It fell desperate, my aunt had the key and only her could open the door. There was no other way of opening it. There was no key sound, nothing everything fell as if space had been altered somehow. No key sound and the door just opened. No words, nothing, no one said anything. Me and my bother was left the room as if nothing had happened, as if it was something we been used to seeing. 

We were walking side by side and he stayed behind. I cold had touched my shoulder, i touched its had and i felt a cold metal around his finger. I never got to hear his voice, but i new that he told us to just go and he will come later after he closes the door. 
The night was cold and my heart didn't feel cold anymore, i just fell so much sadness, i no longer felt lonely, although i always kept wishing to have someone who would love me for who i am. 
We walked down to the new house, it was two story house, the biggest house in the whole town. It had big windows. As we saw walked down, we looked at the window a shadow rush upstairs, the night was quiet and we never heard doors being opened or close. I didn't fell scared, it was as if i knew who it was, and i knew nothing wrong or bad would happen to be or my little brother. 

Me and my brother were the only guys living in that house, and my aunt was staying there that night, it was her turn to sleep over. her sister and her used to take turns everyday to take care of me and my bother. There were no men living there. and there never was. I never gave it much thought. All the entrance doors in the house were locked, he had to climb our way up to the second floor to get in the house. When we went into the room where my aunt was, she was sound sleep and didn't wake up till the next day. 

After 5 years i finally met my mom, and finally met my dad. I told them what had happened that night. I told them about the ring, i told them about him.  At first they told me that it was probably my aunt trying to teach us a lesson, but she wasn't that tall, no one can be that cold, and no one in my family wore a ring.  later on i asked my mom again, and she finally told me that, i while ago my one of my uncles used to sleep there, when he was drunk. He was tall man, was married and never had any kids of his own. One day, i still remember hearing that they had found him death in his room. He had hanged him self living everyone of his family wondering why he had done it. No one knows till now. Without knowing me and my brother had called him, had woken him up from his sleep, and by taking our energy was able to take his human form and free us from that room. He said that he would come back, i had never stopped waiting. ",Cold Shadow,6,nosleep

So, a little over a year ago, I posted a couple of different things that happened to me back in 2005. There were a couple of things that happened between here and there, that I never got around to posting too. Anyway, here I am. Over a year later in the hopes that someone can help me, because something similar has recently happened.

So, while the other stories took place in NC, this all happened in MD. It happened about a week or two before Halloween. And all of this was very close together, and it all happened at my girlfriends house in Baltimore, Arbutus area for the locals. Her mom and younger brother have been living with her for almost a year now, until her mom can get back on her feet due to some unrelated, personal issues. I'm only bringing this particular thing up, in case someone may find it relevant. Her brother is 14. Mom, she's over 50, if not right at 50. Now...
After dinner one night, we were all sitting around the table talking. I excused myself to go shower. I have to get up at 4:30 in the morning, and generally just shower the night before work so I'm not in a groggy rush. So, I'm in the shower and they're, doing whatever it is they do as far as I know. I remember, and never will forget probably, the feeling of something tap me on the shoulder. It didn't necessarily feel like a finger. I pushed it out of my head almost immediately thinking I had brushed the wall or a towel or something. And that was it. That was all that happened in there. I got out, dried off and put on some clothes and left the bathroom. It was quiet in the house. No chatter, no tv and no video games. I just assumed everyone went to bed and headed upstairs to the attic bedroom my girlfriend sleeps in. It was dark, minus the flickery light that turned out to be a bunch of candles in the middle of the floor. My girlfriend, and her mother, playing with a Ouija board. They asked if I wanted to play, and I simply refused. Part of me wanted to leave because those things make me uncomfortable as it is. But I just layed down on the bed and tried to sleep. Mostly watching them. Mostly feeling uncomfortable whenever one of them giggled about it, or laughed and said it was stupid, which bothered me quite a bit. They were done when, after the second or third try, mom turned the disc, or whatever it's called, upside down and said she was done. They put it away and that was that. It dawned on me later that whatever I felt in the shower, would have happened about the time they started with their ouija seances...

So, a few nights later, I'm back at her house. I haven't heard of anything and honestly put the whole thing out of my head. That night, I woke up, at almost the exact same time she did. I looked at her, while she looked forward to the head of the bed, and immediately screamed. And not like a jumpy, something at the movies jumped out at me scream. Pure terror. I pulled her close and cradled her, and didn't see or notice anything. I turned on the light. Nothing was there. What she described to me was so horrifyingly familiar. She said, at the head of the bed, not 3 feet away, stood a figure. Not actually standing though. More like, bending over and reaching out for her. She told me two days later what actually woke her up was she heard something talking in the room, that said in a whisper ""what should we do with her?"" That's when she looked up and everything happen. I did make a mental note that it was after 3 o'clock. The only reason I noted it is because after calming her down, realizing I had less than an hour until I had to go to work. She got up and left when I left. The reason I say this one in particular is horrifyingly familiar, and wanted me to come to you with this in the hopes someone may be able to help me figure something out, is if you'll read the story at the top ""2005"", it's almost the same thing.

Now, I'm an atheist. I haven't prayed in years. And my girlfriend knows this. I'm not against it. I'll pray along to be respectful if the family is praying at dinner, or at a funeral. But one night, she woke me up shaking. Telling me that the room didn't feel right. And she was scared. She asked me to pray with her. Like, she wanted me to say a prayer for protection. I didn't know how to react, but this was extremely out of the ordinary for her. So I went with it. And after a minute of reaching into the back of my head for things to say, she started breathing slower. Calmer. She let me finish, then thanked me and said ""I think it worked"". She laid down and eventually, we both fell asleep.

The only things other than little squeaks and creaks, which could honestly just be the house being a house and making house noises, was when she was downstairs trying to sleep I guess. She didn't sleep in her room for a while unless I was there, and as I just recently moved to night shift, that's been a lot. Anyway, she said she heard her brother upstairs leaning in the chair, which he does while he plays on his laptop. So she sends him a text. A simple ""stop leaning"". Not a minute later, the text comes back and says ""I'm in bed"".
That's all I know or have heard for right now. I've spent fewer nights there since all that happened. Her mom burned sage in the room, or whatever the cleansing plant is (sage right?). Said some prayers. And I'm hoping that's it.",So this recently started happening again,1,nosleep

I had just moved to a new city after my sister's ""tragic"" suicide.  Adjusting was tough for all of us, especially for me since I had a hard time connecting with people.  Hell back then I didn't even want to. I preferred to be solitary.  Back then was tough because I felt empty inside. Nothing I did seemed to fulfill me. I was my own abyss. 

This kid started to pick on me one day. Don't even know why, he just did. I never took the time to learn his name. He walked passed me in the courtyard during lunch and casually referred to me as a faggot to his friends. They snickered and kept walking.  I couldn't tell you why that made me so angry.

And louder.

And louder.

The voice didn't bother me that much. I was intrigued by it. I wondered what would happen if I carried out its request. I acquired one of my mother's kitchen knives. A small one, as I didn't want to overdue it, and sharpened it a little. I then put on a black hoodie and began the hunt.

When I found my target, he was enjoying a smoke against a wall next to the school.  He was alone. I made careful strides towards him, listening to the voice inside my head grow louder with anticipation. I firmly gripped the knife handle, and as my target was walking to his car, plunged it into his side. I felt the blade slowly drive into the kid's soft flesh and his blood came oozing out onto my knuckles. He wheezed and gasped for air as blood filled his mouth. I stabbed him again, and he fell to the ground watching me watch him die. It took a couple of minutes but he finally stopped moving. I will admit that the rush of euphoria I received after the kill still makes the hair on my head stand up. For the first time, I had actually felt something. My legs quaked as I walked back home and cleaned of my mom's knife.  I grinned stupidly as I put it back on the rack. Ah, what a rush.

I decided to go to sleep. I dreamed I was in a desert. The man in the hood was faraway from me but he was coming closer. As he was walking towards me I saw images that horrified me. I saw my family sitting on a bench smiling, but then the hooded man came from behind them and shot them all in the head.

I woke up. I was sweating and then I remembered the doctor said the pills would cause hallucinations so I tried not to think of it. I heard my High school reunion was tomorrow so I got ready. When I got inside of my old school I felt disoriented and I felt like vomiting, until I saw the hooded man in front of me just watching. Then it ended and my old friend, Lucas said: ""Paul it's taking place in the gym."" I replied by saying: ""Thanks."" Then I asked him if he saw a hooded figure in the hallway he shook his head no. I got to the gym to see everybody there my classmates and teachers. Then all of the sudden the lights go off, everyone stares at me and laughs at me and then they crowded around me. They started pulling on me and laughing...laughing and I could swear I saw the hooded man in the corner of the room.


I screamed: ""NO!"" Everything was normal again and they all stared at me. I left the school and I drove back home. I got a pistol from my bedroom in case the hooded man came back. I heard the doorbell ring and when I answered it was the hooded man. I quickly got out the gun and I fired 3 shots. He collapsed and I laughed thinking it was all over. I heard a deep voice yell: Drop the gun!"" it was a police officer and I looked down and it wasn't the hooded man I saw, it was Lucas he was going to see if I was alright. 

I dropped the gun and he arrested me. Now I'm in prison for murder and every night I see the hooded man staring at me but it's just the medicine right?       ",It's only the drugs,13,nosleep

You might remember my journal entries from last month. Last month, I can't believe it's been that long. Days and weeks run now in an endless loop. Where I am now time doesn't matter. It's a nuisance, it's a hinderance. 

A lot has happened. I just wanted to let those who cared, who reached out to me, know that I am alive. Very much so. And I have met some friends. Real human beings. There is so much I want to tell you. So much I want to explain. But I can't. Not now. 

Just know that the monster under your bed is real. That shadow in the closet exists. And those voices, the voices you hear in the dead of the night are not your imagination. All your life you have been told horror stories. And now you seek them out, on this subreddit. To be entertained, to be thrilled. But these stories exist for a reason. Every story has a truth. A small bit of reality wrapped around trigger words and exaggeration. 

That truth is what lurks in the shadows of your house, just at the corner of your eye. The truth is what is waiting for you when you close your eyes to sleep, hoping for a peaceful night's rest. But nothing is peaceful in the dark. Where the light is eclipsed by the slithering, rotting presence that knows you oh so well. One day you'll know. You will wake up and know. All those stories. All those scary tales. All those fears.

Are real. 

It doesn't take much to become a monster. All you need is the dark to find it's way in. ",I am the monster,5,nosleep
bass_slapper,0,,2,1rh8lh,,0,"*You think me cruel. No. I’ve only learned to act on what I’ve been given. I’ve learned to deal with my problems in my own way. No one understands this but me it seems. This is for ME, I don’t do it for them. But they can’t understand my need. He can’t either. I must make me. Make him understand. How did he get here? I wish I came back. I want him back. WHY WON’T I COME BACK WHY IS HE HERE ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SOR-*

Past this the note is unreadable, spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people. Not that I’d really want to read much more anyways. I already know what happens. Well, not really “know”, but I can feel it. Who wrote it? I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson, if he’s even my uncle. What is this? No clue. A note, obviously, but beyond that speculation reigns. Where did I find this? My new house, in a drawer. Nothing is inherently terrifying about that – Oh, except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there. I just missed it before, I keep telling myself. I half believe it. A few pills later and I’m not worrying about it anymore.

Before this, I didn’t even know I had an Uncle Drewson, let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely, but now enacted, demise. With a heavily estranged family, growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility, one loses track of aunts and uncles. It was in a familiar neighborhood, a spacious three bedroom, so I was in no way eager to turn it down. As a poor, regularly unemployed person I’d been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldn’t afford anywhere else. I thought, it’ll all be worth it one day, the day I make it in the world. I can pay all these people back tenfold. “The day I make it”, yeah right. A consistent – and more pressingly, free – living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes. So I was moved in within a couple weeks. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life, I was content.

You know when you think back to something embarrassing, stupid, or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger, brasher days? Once you recall it, it starts eating away, regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts, till you would give the world to go back and change it, or at least erase the memory. Imagine that, only you can’t remember what it was you’ve done. It’s simply gone from you. The more you try, the less you realize. The less you realize, the more you regret. The more you regret, the more you try. That’s what’s happening to me, ever since I moved here. But it even goes past that. It’s the sudden feeling you’re being watched from barely out of sight. And at the same time, a crushing loneliness in that feeling. I pop a few more pills. Of course, I’m not being watched. There’s no one else here. If you think you’re being rather clever, figuring this out, oh-no-someone’s-been-in-the-house-with-you-all-along, I was most certainly the only one here. Anyway, this was about the time I found the note. If it was this Drewson, what is he talking about? Who does he want back? What is his need? Do I even want to know the answer to any of these? Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do, personal preference notwithstanding. Putting it all to the back of my mind, I chop up steak for dinner. I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef, particularly where matters of slicing and/or dicing are concerned. I once worked a sushi bar, as a side job to pay the bills, and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe, like you see in commercials. Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customer’s eyeball. Maybe I’m not quite as proficient as I thought… I grab the bottle of pills and take a few. I don’t really like thinking about that time in my life.

I’m digging through my drawer later, that same drawer, when I stumble upon another discovery. Instead of a clue, it only deepens my mystery. A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board. I carefully remove it, and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find, my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses. I think, this will perhaps answer some questions about the note, and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusion’s implications. As per your previous assumptions, I couldn’t be farther from the truth. I secure the stick in its dock. View files. Two folders: “Reminders” and “Media”. Reminders is empty, media contains one subfolder: “Vids”. I open the folder. Two more: “memories” and “triggers”. Memories is empty. I open triggers. I’m confronted with one video file: shotinthedark.wmv. It’s 0:40 long. I press play.

Before I continue, if you’ll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this. I’m a massive horror movie fan, and I like them brutal. The more blood and guts, the better. I like truly graphic, heart wrenching stuff, and I very rarely squirm at it. Three seconds into shotinthedark.wmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out. The scene I’m immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs. There is a single light source on the chair, but I can faintly make out a figure in the background. Then, without a word, the man’s brains are ejected out his face, accompanied with a thunderous bang. Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground. Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt, accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life, likely flooded by fear, but life. I don’t have too much time to process anymore; I’m preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket. I think, it must be fake, but I know it’s not. I’ve got to tell someone about this, I think, the police, someone. Yeah, I’ll talk to the cops. Then, over my subsiding retching, I hear a familiar voice utter “Are you sorry now?” in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler. Something in that voice is chilling. Something… I return my gaze to the computer screen, where the barely visible figure now stands in full view, smiling.

I recognize the smile too.

It’s me, smiling back at myself, gripping a smoking sawed off.

The computer screen goes black. My head spins. I lie down.

youngsterjose42,1,,4,1rge20,,2,"He woke up in the morning like every other day. Yet this day was different; Jordan was going back to school after being expelled last year. He was caught with drugs and his school wanted nothing to do with it. He moved, now resides in york, Pennsylvania and now goes to William Penn High. He moved to a house which was quite old and just had some renovations a while back. The rent was quite cheap so his mother said ""why not?"". I was one of Jordan's first friends, since moving to york he told me things about that house really strange things. He soon moved away a little after I moved away so I have no idea where he is now. If any of you happen to live in york I'm talking about the old burned down house on market street across the street from the kindergarten/daycare. This story takes place about 2 years before the house burned down. 

A month since school started and about two weeks since I started talking to Jordan he invited me over to his house. Jordan said ""cmon dude come and stay the night my moms gone and im pretty sure wont give a shit"". So I thought why not I haven't spent the night at a friends house in a while ""yea sure ill spend the night man"". We went around town skated for a while, went to McDonald's with a few other friends then it came around 10 or maybe 11 everyone was ready to go home and i was ready to just go to a place and chill, play video games, and maybe eat some more. We got to his place, sat down in the living room, and lit up a blunt. Playing grand auto 3, high off our asses, we ordered some pizza. We ate and everything was fine till I felt like heading over to the bathroom. As soon as I opened the door I notice under the sink there was like a small cabinet and the doors slammed shut. I was high so I didn't really questioned it much. I used the bathroom and then as I exit I suddenly hear a giggle coming from under the sink. A child's giggle, as if there was a kid under the sink playing hide'n'seek or something. Again I did not question it because I was high and didn't really wanna bother finding out what made the noise. Jordan passed out on the couch, I went to his room and tried to sleep on his bed. I remember waking up around four in the morning hearing footsteps and a child giggling I'm pretty sure it was a little boy. I couldn't really tell his age but he was young; I would guess around six or seven. He was running around the house and he stopped at the door I did not see him, I only ever got to see his outline. He said "" I'm really happy I got more friends to play with now"". Suddenly after that he vanished faster than I could blink. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I had goosebumps for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually I  calmed myself down by eating pizza and watching TV.",Hide 'N' seek,6,nosleep
InsaneFang,2,,2,1rdykh,,0,"It was a very dark night, I opened my eyes in the dark, and I watched the shadows stretch over my room. The trees moved in the night air, and made the shadows in my room move, and form together, and look like monsters. I watched the shadows, which actually do not help to watch, for they only offer uneasiness to the human soul, and you find no comfort. If I hadn't watched those shadows I wouldn't have noticed the slight movement that didn't go exactly with the shadows. It was dark, and I felt I was probably seeing something. But I thought I saw a dark shape in those shadows. It moved like the shadows, but it moved slower, and I thought I heard the soft scrape of a boot. I watched the shadows ever moving. I felt fear grip my heart. I felt there was something there, just watching me silently in those darkest shadows. I wanted to hop out of the bed, and rush out the door, but I feared that if my feet touched the floor, then that thing, or something else would surely get me. I heard a sound from behind me, and being in the frightened state I was in, I about fell out of the bed. Clinging to the side of the bed, tangled in the blankets and sheets, I felt like I was about to die. I looked up for the source of the sound and it was just a tree branch scratching the window. I felt relieved at this, and I kind of relaxed, forgetting about the thing in the shadows. I pulled myself back into my bed, turned and saw a darkened shape at the end of my bed. I felt the fear shoot through me again. I felt no thoughts, nothing, only the cold dark fear. I watched as the shape moved ever closer to my bed. I felt paralyzed, as if I couldn't move, speak, or let alone do anything. The shape moved ever closer. I felt a sound coming from the back of my throat, but it never escaped my lips. My mouth did not open, nor did the sound fully come out. The shape soon climbed slowly onto the bed, and moved closer to the lumps under the blankets, my legs. I felt myself start to tremble, but I still felt like I was super glued to my bed. I wanted to close my eyes, maybe it was a dream. It kept climbing up my bed, and I felt something off of it lightly slid against my leg. I felt myself tremble and shake even more. Soon the face was just inches from mine. I felt its hot breath on me, and the smell that emitted from its mouth wasn't that great either. I wanted to turn away, maybe get some fresh air, but I felt still frozen. It took one of its hands and pointed a finger at me. Though I could not see very well, it looked like instead of nails, it had sharp claws. It took the claw and lightly probed my face. The pain of the claw protruding my skin was unimaginable. It didn't feel like a cut from a knife or such. It felt like someone was burning my face. It took the claw and ran it down my whole face, and the fiery feeling intensified. Then I woke up, trembling, and drenched in cold sweat. I was thankful that it was a dream. But something about that dream made me still sit there terrified for my life. I looked out the window, at the cold moon shining its equally cold glow into my room, making shadows. Those shadows made me dwell more on my dream, and I closed my eyes, but all I could see in my mind was the dark shape crawling up my bed...and then the unimaginable agony that came from that claw cutting a gash into my face. I suddenly had the need to feel my face. I reached up slowly, my hand slightly trembling, fearing that it wasn't a dream. My hand finally connected with my face, and from instincts, I flinched, but there was nothing there, but cold sweat stained smooth skin. I shuddered a sigh of relief. I knew there was no getting back to sleep, so I decided I might as well go downstairs, and at least drink some tea or coffee, maybe even milk. Maybe it'd calm me down. I slid out of the bed, and headed slowly down the stairs. The silence was a little unnerving as I walked down the creaky steps. The dream still haunted my mind. I tried to shake the feeling that it gave me away, but it just wouldn't fade from mind. I finally reached the kitchen, and turned on the light. I opened up the refrigerator, and pulled out the jug of milk. I poured some into a glass, and slid it into the microwave, and heated it up. Once done, I pulled the warm glass out, and I headed into the living room, and turned on the TV to try to forget the dream. The TV's light washed over the room, and I watched as people spoke about things not at all important in this world. I took a drink of my milk, and watched the people on the screen. I soon felt myself falling asleep. I woke up, the TV was off. I didn't remember turning it off. It was still dark out, I looked at the clock, it read 1:46 AM. I swore it had to be later than that. I pulled myself from my bed, and I headed up the stairs to my room once more. I laid there in my bed for what seemed like hours. I rose up and looked at the clock, it said 1:46 AM. I blinked, was the clock broken? I walked over, and unplugged it, but it did not turn off. It remained shining lightly in the dark, reading 1:46 AM. I backed into my bed, and fell on top of it. I heard something from the window. I looked over and saw a face. The features were inhuman, I felt the fear paralyze me. I couldn't look past the face staring at me. Where its eyes should be, were empty looming dark sockets, the nose, a pig snout, and the teeth like a saber tooth tiger, and it had black curly messy hair on its head. It reached a hand up to open the window, and I saw the unmistakable clawed fingers. My nightmare had come to life. I opened my mouth to scream, but no sound emerged. The window opened slowly, and the creature quietly hit the floor. It moved slowly towards me. I heard its heavy breathing as it drew nearer, and nearer still. I closed my eyes, hoping it'd go away, but fate would not help me there. I felt a weight on my bed, and my eyes shot open. I looked into those looming sockets, and then my mouth opened and I screamed. The scream was not heard though. It was as if the world was dead. The creature took its claw up, and slowly sliced my skin, carefully, and only in certain places, as if it was a planned process...for some reason. It finally crawled off me, and left the room, and closed the window softly. I laid there in the bed bleeding slowly, the pain ebbing out of my body, feeling like hot hell fire. That's when I noticed my clock was off now. I laid there, relieved that it was gone...but those eyes...those dark looming eyes, would burn my mind forever.",Dark Looming Eyes,2,nosleep
xcalubur,0,,6,1r9pfe,,0,"This story takes place about 8 years ago.

I was working as a data entry clerk at the local newspaper.  My hours were 9-6, but I would stay after 6 in order to complete my duties.  I would also come in one Saturday a month to complete my month end duties.  Often I was left by myself in my department.  Nothing strange, but I would always feel like I was being watched.  Could never shake that feeling.  I never felt that i was in danger, and if I focused on the feeling long enough I would freak out a bit.

I finally came clean to some co-workers about that feeling.  Of course they mocked me, and asked the types of drugs I was using.  Nothing major, I knew they were having fun and just continued my duties.  Later that same day, my co-worker Toon who was mocking me the most came to my desk.  Mind you we had open cubicles, two desks on one side, 4 desks in the middle, and three desks on the other side.  I was part of the 4 desk area.  She asked me to describe what was watching me.  I explained to her it was a feeling and I never saw anything. 

6 o'clock came around and everybody was gone.  I was waiting for my 700+ page end of week report to finish printing so I could drop them off on the desks of all the department heads.  I was waiting at the 2 desk cubicle where the department printer was located.  This was G's desk.  She had a whole bunch of pictures on her wall and I was just looking at each picture.  Again, that feeling of being watched came over me, but stronger than before.  I turned to my head and saw it....rather her.  5 feet away from me, there was a head floating in the air.  She was some sort of gray color.  I was able to take in her features.  Medium straight hair, round face, the hair kind of hugged her face.  She popped, like a bubble pops in the air.  I was so anxious to get out of there so I could go home and get ready for my date with my girlfriend.  I grabbed the report, distributed them, and I was out.  On the 25-30 minute drive home, I was reflecting on the day and playing it over in my head.  Half way home I realized I came face to face with a ghost.

Basically, this is a very scary apartment. Shortly after I saw the girl, things got quiet. I stopped watching TV alone in the house and started going to church more. When my mom, who didn't have a job, would leave the house, I would often tag along or go in my room where my sister and I both slept. she was 5 so she doesn't have any recollection of anything.

One day, it was a rainy day and my sister's friend had a birthday party. I was invited for some reason. It was a rainy, gloomy day but the festivals were making everyone happy so I guess I was happy as well. The party was very expensive as they were sorta rich and there were tons of events and foods and things to do. But enough of that story.
After we left the party, my parents decided to go to church. Naturally, as a energetic 9 year old, I was reluctant to leave so I told my parents to drop me off at home with my sister. The house was dark and it was raining so I was a little scared. but, once my mother had tucked me into bed, I fell asleep and I thought that was the end of that.
I believe I slept until night time because I heard the front door closing. I thought it was my parents so I yelled to mom, telling her I was hungry. But there was no reply. Instantly, I was awake and my pulse was pounding. I was suddenly paralysed (with fear? I don't know) and I could only watch as I heard footsteps come up the stairs. My sister, I could hear her breathing underneath me (we had a bunkbed) but she didn't seem hear a thing.
             
Then a creak, and moan as my bedroom door opened. I watched as a shadow grew between my feet and hovered over me. I believe I passed out with fear or something cause the next thing I knew, I was waking up and it was later at night and my parents really came home.

A couple days later, my sister came home with a drawing. i asked her what it was as I shivered in fear. She told me that she had seen the thing I saw, except it spoke to her while I was sleeping that day. It told her that it was related to her, that it knew mom. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I never told mom, who was still having nightmares about her miscarriage. But could it be the sister I never had?

The happenings that have lead up to Tuesday night. I don't remember everything that happened to leading up to it. I tried to go to sleep early because I moved out of my house last month and I had been getting terrible sleep because I am forced to sleep on an air mattress. I am also staying at a friends house till I am able to move into my next house. I went to sleep around seven at night and them woke up at eleven that same night. I couldn't get back to sleep no matter how much I tried so I decided to start watching tv. After a while I got really thirsty so I went down stairs to get a drink of water. After I finished the water my stomach started to feel up so I went into the bathroom. I finished up in there and as I was leaving I started to get a feeling like a was being watched. I can even remember having the same feeling in the bathroom but I ignored it and just tooled around on my phone. Nevertheless I hurried up stairs and it felt as though I was being followed. I decided to ignore it and just lay down with my eyes closed and calm down. I did this for the next roughly thirty minutes and drifted off to sleep. With in minutes of me sleeping I again had the feeling of being pinned down and could not move. It had been months since the last time this happened but it almost felt as though it was going to happen. I cannot better explain the part other than I just new it was going to was coming. So after that I was a little freaked out but it had happened so many times in my past that I would get more annoyed than anything else. I then had a hard time falling asleep again. It took me hours to fall back asleep but nothing happened after I woke up I just would stay there in the bed annoyed that I could not fall back asleep. I am not sure if this is being triggered by the stress of me moving or what is happening. Alls I know is that I want it to stop.

""No it's not,"" I whispered, ""I can't be like this anymore, I don't ever want to do this again!"" John pulled back and searched my face. His black eyes probing. He slowly nodded.

""I want to show you something,"" He said. I looked up at him quizzically, my face showing my confusion. I trusted him though so I slowly stood up from the log I was perched on. He took my hand and led me to the picnic table that was in our woods, my family rarely ever used it for anything, it just sat there for throwing sticks on. But now there was definitely something on it.

""Trust me, this will make it easier for you to control your emotions,"" I nodded and stepped up closer behind him. Navanod was standing over by it and glanced up as we got close.

He was bleeding already, a small trickle that formed tiny puddles beneath him. A small smile crept onto my features and Navanod turned his attention to John, ""She's ready,"" Was all he said. John nodded and pulled the knife he always had in his belt out.

Going over to the man he barely pierced the skin before glancing at me. I had moved in closer, fascinated by what was happening, the man on the table fought against the straps screaming. I glanced at the house to see if anyone heard before looking back at John. He stopped making small cuts and finally pushed the knife deep into the man's skin. The man screamed and I was suddenly all the way at the table, perched on the edge, staring wide eyed at the thick stream of blood spurting out and pooling beneath the man and the table. The thick red liquid sinking into the leafy ground.

""Can I?"" I whispered. John looked over at Navanod before flipping the knife in his hand and giving it to me. I looked at it then at the man, ""How do I skin him?"" I barely saw the smirk on John's face because I was so focused on the blood, it was shooting a satisfying feeling through me that I had never felt before.

John came up behind me and held his hand over mine, ""Like this,"" His hand guided mine.

My head jerked up when I was finishing to someone screaming my name. A piece of me crumbled as I slowly gave the knife back to John, ""We can do another tomorrow,"" He said. I perked up at that. I was covered in the man's blood and I smiled at that. John stood and took me inside.

""Where have you been?"" My mom demanded.

""Just out in the woods,"" I whispered.

""Stop that mumbling,"" My mom ordered, John rolled his eyes next to me and I suppressed a smile, ""You know how much I hate you playing out there alone!"" I glanced over at John whose grin had now grown.

""Tomorrow,"" He whispered before disappearing into my room laughing.





Edit: So, I probably should say that John and Navanod were 2 of the 8 demons following me around when I was younger. No one but me could see them which led to some interesting situations if they decided to remain in the room when something was going on. I'm just going to post random snippets and not make this a series but in general, they will be about me and them. Sorry for any confusion and such.",I Want to Show You Something,14,nosleep

samisboris20,0,,3,1r97n2,,0,"When I was a little kid I was exposed to the world of sheer adrenaline. I loved roller coasters, theme parks, and loud action movies. I was 8 years young when I first started to see these mysterious ""black figures."" Specifically one dark, autumn night I had miraculously awoken from my small 8 year old body to find a beautiful silent room. After looking around for 10 seconds something had walked into the door frame of my room. I remember it perfectly to this day. It stood 6 feet tall and looked like an average sized human, except was not covered in skin. This figure was pitch black, the darkest color black I had ever seen. It was wearing a blissful white robe. The robe immediately stood out to me because its polar opposite color compared to the figures skin. This picture still haunts me to this day. There is never a moment where I cant stop thinking about this. After I had realized that this thing was stuck staring at me in my door frame, we both made extreme, extensive eye contact. Even though I could not physically see his eyes, as more time went by I could feel a weird feeling growing inside of my body. After I could not bare the feeling anymore, I asked it ""what are you doing here,"" ""what do you want from me."" I got no response from this being but a slight head turn. This scared me even more. When I got no responce back to any of my questions, we made this scary eye contact once more. The second eye contact was much longer than the first one, but after a while it simply just walked out of my door frame. That was the first and last time I had ever seen this thing. I told my mom the next day, and she told me it was something that ""god"" sent down to earth, but I have always doubted it, especially now... 9 years later. When I went to boarding school for my freshman year, I went to a supposed haunted boarding school located up in santa barbra. I've heard the ghost story thousands of times, and decided to go ghost hunting around the campus, but was unsuccessful. Later on that week, my things started to disappear and I would awake with scrathes and bruises on my arms and upper body. In the middle of the night when I would get water in the hallways, I would feel the same eerie feeling I did when I was 8 and would also see dark figures from the corner of my eye. The same darkness the being had when I was 8. The next week these same experiences started to happen in my personal dorm room, except this time it felt more malicious. The first time I saw something, a scary looking black figure, was when it walked towards my room mates side. I thought I was just dreaming, but the next night my closet door slid open and I saw the most terrifying thing ever. A gargantuan black horned figure slammed open my closet door and rushed strait towards me with its arms pointed strait at me. Before it was about to grab me it disappeared and the lights came right on, thanks to my room mate. AFter this happened I returned back home to LA. Luckily everything had calmed down. How ever now I am 17, I still see these black figures in the corners of my eyes. I need to know what is this?! IS it an evil spirit, are they angels, are the lost ghosts? I've been doing research and said possibly it could be shadow people? I just need to know what your opinion, so I know I am not slowly maddening. PLEASE IS THERE ANY ONE OUT THERE THAT CAN HELP.

I am grateful that I am born alive as a man but why does they have to be my parents?

They said that, before you enter the physical world, you are a mere soul waiting turns to bond with little human figure inside a pregnant woman once God granted your passage. That's when the heart starts to beat and so does your responsibility in life, shaping the right future. Well, I don't mind that.
The only thing ticks me that, why can't I choose who my parents are? Why wasn't there a catalog of possible parents set before me right at the moment when I am going to bond with the physical world? Why? Why do I have to end up with them?

All I get was a social party mother who always half state of awareness back late at night and when in morning I rarely get to have breakfast from her. The only food on the table was microwaveable TV dinner or a call for delivery from any nearby restaurant. Chinese? I always have that for brunch. During holidays, we celebrate at my Aunt house or dine at any restaurant available. I barely even remember when was the last time my mom using the stove. Such a lovely mother.

And yet my so-called father tend to ignore me always. The only time we are together alone was when my 9th grade PTA meeting. That was when mom had her ladies night off, so she called. My father and I are rarely together because he always disappoints with my grade, his eyes blinds with my greatest-proud big brother in big business world who always provide him this material world of joy and such. I bet he is too overjoy to even remember that I exist. My big brother always said that I may think too much. Maybe I did.

In any case, why did I not act now? Why do I imagine I sit down properly on the road watching fire burn glazing right in front of me? My mind is shrouded with thought on my mother and father good points. We are on our way celebrate Thanksgiving at Aunt Maria's house. My parents are quarreling in the car while I was the one handling the steering wheel. Too loud, just maybe because of that if I may lost my focus we might crash right at the middle of fork road. In the bonnet I secretly hid fire crackers where me and cousins are planning to lit it tonight at Aunt Maria's. If we did crash, we will be fireworks.

what i realized the gold and the creature with the eyes of blue are both like guard dogs and their masters are in control of them blue acted out of instinct. it has no final destination like visions where i see realities different from our own(theroy from first post in series). 

 changes since last post -moving didn't help much just bought me more time. i also purchased some throwing knives since my last update not due to the creatures just because i was losing my sense of home and slight sense of security from moving from the house i grew up in.

warning: i may ramble a bit with exlpaimations due to me having high funtioning autism and it causes me to have longer explainations than most people. i also have slightly bad social skills  due to it. also sorry about spelling and grammar i am on a mobile phone and it is half an hour until midnight for me i wasn't feeling well today so i am a bit tired and half of this was typed 4 days ago i just fell asleep before typing certain parts out that only i would have understood and i fixed and  made readable sense of itso you are lucky for now that i formatted what i did i will do a spelling and grammar edit tomorrow.

The thing that marked the change was the blue creature appeared just after i shut my eye lids and they felt stuck shut. I didn't bother trting to open them i knew it was no use and that the blue one was safe but not the gold one. So i kept trying to switch into a dream but none would take the creature started to make a half choking half growling sound over and over like it was choking on a word before it choked out the word protect then left.

i normally can start my dreams off then fall asleep into them but i haven't been able to gaurd my mind. i can normally just pick a theme eg. horror story abandon building and spy  every so often i will get an odd dream that my mind can't draw on my most recent dream because the normal ones seem to make a storyline like last spring a t-rex and i were talking and it was wearing a monacle and top hat while drinking champane in a ruined section of a city  and then from down the road walnuts got fired at me i ran forward and cracked them with my bare hands until they stopped. this time though it was they hacked in to a dream i had recently.

the recent dream i had fallen asleep while emotions i had were swirling so it randomized and it was that people on my list of people i trust that was pulled from my memories.
I would be getting ready for a formal dance at the school i went to before my dad moved yet in the dream i had moved to the  town the high school i went to is in. i could see the school in the dream from the house i was in and it was a bright neon green house with a picket fence and elegant hand carved wooden gate there are no houses like that near the school though and a cop knocks on the door of the house and my mom answers it and the cop asks for me and mom says i am getting ready to go to a school dance. the cop explains why he is there is to get me to come with him to talk out a hostage situation because the person with the hostage asked to see me. 
So i slip a throwing knife of the new set mentioned above into each pant leg pocket. then say that he can enter my room. i then ask if i can bring either a throwing knife or a wooden stake for defence should i be used as hostage depends what person from my trust list it is being held hostage already in the dream.

(I have trust lists because my lack of social skills makes it hard to make friends so i classify them as aquaintences with varying levels of my trust whether i am friends with  them or not is there call but in the dream after the dream completes it restarts and gets the next person on the lists.)

I get the ok from the cop who says hopefully it won't get to that. fast foreward dream the person with the hostage has the most defendable place in the school and the only possibilities for escape is the window behind  him or at least the body shape looks male. i will refer to him as chompers due to him having pure gold and silver teeth alternating so it goes silver-gold-silver-gold-etc. i first percieved chompers as a being to represent stress then i would be called to go stand near by, chompers holds a glock 26 pistol a common pistol in military games eg socom in each hand (right hand against hostage's head and the left one points at me) then i offer a hostage swap and hand the other hostage the defence weapon i had up my sleeve. then i stand so my back faces chompers while he demands certain politcians be eliminated and vast sums of money as if i was a powerful bargining chip the cops can't complete his ransom with the assination call. so he threatens me saying any last wishes i say i wish to hear a song from my phone and ask if i am allowed to reach in my pocket to get it. chompers says yeah so i grab a throwing knife and stab back wards near intestines with the left throwing knife and jab his thigh at the same time as i dropped and ducked the cops took thier chance to shoot him.
Each time he would normally fall and i would see the bloody muscles of his face when his head hit the floor the only difference now is his eyes have been like snake eyes bright red with gold pupils instead of just turning to empty sockets.

Could it be stress but what if it is two entities battling in my mind one being instinct and one being stress because the walks i would take around the block were to eliminate or at least vent off stress and the slight paranoia during the encounters let them cross into reality and be anchors for their masters if so could it be only my own brain is the only one with a frequency and pattern they can survive",weird walk around the block and weird dream weird cat thing common factor in both (update 2),2,nosleep

December 21st: I have heard of a substance that can make the body stronger and more in rage but it is all the way in South America I will have to call a superior officer to request for it.

He handed me him and helped me sedate him. Before he walked out the door he told me: ""Make mighty Germany proud.""




 January 11th: I have strapped the subject on a operating table, I have filled a syringe with the substance and injected it in his right arm. January 12th: The subject is not moving as if he is deceased. Maybe he is in a coma but when I touch him he makes no reflexes or reactions.

I told him what had happened. I tried to sedate the subject with a sedative drug and injecting it into his arm but it didn't work. The officer hit the subject on the head with a baton and even that did not work so we moved him into the closet and locked it. I bribed him not to tell anyone. January 14th: I saw through the window of the door the subjects eyes were getting darker and his skin paler. January 15th: The subject keeps making these horrifying screams that is eating away at me. January 16th: I heard the strap of the table finally snap and I quickly covered the door with a shelf.



January 17th: I have had it, I grabbed a revolver to kill the subject, I opened the door and when I did he lashed out at me and scratched me on the arm. I dropped the gun and the subject got on top of me. I noticed one of my surgical tools and I stabbed him in the eye killing him. I didn't think of getting medical help after all it was just a scratch.
January 18th: I feel ill, I am coughing and I cannot see straight. January 19th: My skin is getting paler and my eyes are getting darker. January 20th: I am starting to get sores on my body like a allergic reaction of some type. January 21st: I started to cough up what appears to be blood but it was black. January 22nd: My body is starting to take a more skeletal appearance. I feel too weak to call for help.

chanvargas,5,,7,1ra33y,,0,"we've been experiencing weird stuffs from this house ever since it was built and renovated. we heard voices, footsteps, some noise upstairs when we were all downstairs and vice versa. these creepy things always happen at 3:00 am onwards (not till 4am). yeah, i'm still trying to convince myself that all were just coincidences that they occur at 3 in the morning.. lucid dreams, nightmares and other stuff will wake you up at that time. and i was thinking that there would be any scientific explanations about those. anyway, the creepiest experience i had was just this year. i can't recall what day or month it happened. but this is how happened. 

it was a long day at work, i came home at 2am in the morning since i was in a late mid shift of a 24/7 starbucks branch here in our country.. i ate dinner alone (i got used to 3am weird shits so its not a surprise for me if something creepy happen again.) then gone upstairs to check on my emails, and read some blogs on some site. it took me a while and later that night i felt sleepy so i got ready for bed. as i enter my room, i went directly to the closet to change clothes. surprisingly i saw my 4 year old sister standing there. she even tried to hide at the dark corner of the closet, staring at me. i asked her, ""hey, why are you still awake? is there something wrong?"" 
she didn't answer.|
i backed off and felt confused. there were no creepy feelings that moment actually.. the time i came back to her, she said ""i'm going too sleep.""

she then walked to my parents room, after she left the room, i decided to follow her, i found her hiding again on an old TV rack that has been there since. i looked at her and she was staring at me with her face not showing any emotion, she told me the same thing again ""i'm going to sleep.""

she entered the room and closed the door. i went back to my room and lied on my bed. i'm still on the state of asking questions of WHAT THE FUCK WAS SHE DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ON THE CORNER OF MY CLOSET. then it came to my senses, the first time i had this lucid dream or nightmare (whatever you call that.) was at the same room where i was lying that time. the dream was an upside down star painted on the wall with a sentence written at the center of the star ""see the center of the face"" i stared at it in my dream then old faces of some people including those that i think i've seen in some history book and some old dollar bill. as the faces change, i suddenly woke up and realized that my body was numb. only my vision was active that time, and i have this feeling that someone is staring at me. it was a strong force. a strong force that gave me such fear. and that force came from the window that is where the closet was put to cover it. the same corner where i found my sister standing..

(back to my sisters incident) 
i thought it was over.. i was lying in bed at that very time when i felt someone staring at me from behind (i'm having goosebumps just by typing this story right now) it was her. again. she then ran back to my parents room after noticing that i saw her. that was the time that i felt fear. i can feel evil existence. but! i was too sleepy that time so i didn't spend much time thinking about it or being curious about it..

I went to investigate. I went out of my room and...
Nothing.
Maybe it was just me. I went back to my bedroom door. I saw something written on really drippy red paint.
It said ""Find me if you can"". I thought it was just my little brother Mike painting on the walls again. ""Where was Mike anyway?"", I thought. Then I remembered he was outside playing with our pet dog Molly. ( Don't ask me why he was playing in the dark, because I have no idea).
I went inside my room. That's when I saw it. The book was lying on the ground open. I picked it up. This is what the title said:
""yllaW s'erehW"" Now THIS was weird. I also saw the same Wally picture except his eyes were gone and blood was dripping from them.
It was possessed, I thought. I ran outside to bury it, and I stepped on something. It sounded like it was glass because I heard it shatter.
I looked down.
A pair of broken, black rimmed glasses. I ignored it and ran even faster than before.
I ran to my dog Molly's kennel. I always feel safe when she's with me.
She was whining in the corner. That was typical, though. But wasn't she playing with Mike? I shouted out, ""Mike! Mike! Can you hear me?""
No replies.
I ran to the middle of the yard to bury the book.
I stepped in another thing. It was squishy, and slimy.
I looked down.
Blood. Blood and guts.
And Mike.
Lying on the ground.
Stomach open.
With a walking cane through his heart.
I wanted to cry, but then I saw a little Post-It note on the cane.
A poem.
This is what it said:
""I can run, and I can hide.
Tear you apart from the inside.
Waiting in the darkness, with my cane.
Used to be for children, now insane.
Red and white, in the grey fog.
Running around with my little pet dog.
With my girlfriend Wenda, with her camera,
And an old man with a white beard.
The prisoner who escaped from jail, murdering people with no fail.
That's my gang, with no doubt.
When you're in with me, there's no way out.""
This was way too bad to just BURY. We had to set it on FIRE. Or RIP IT APART. Just destroy it in whatever way I could.
So now in my backyard, a grave for Mike, some burnt and ripped pages, shattered glasses, and a walking cane.
And to this day, I never read another Where's Wally book again.
And every night, I still hear the sound of a scratching walking cane against my bedroom door.
THE END.

i live in a rural town in the northern virginia area. As the winter comes near, the days grow shorter, the sun sets faster. One day, as i was walking home from work through a deep forest since i live in a small apartment complex, i felt little taps on my bag. But as i turned around there appeared to be nothing there, but me. I approached my complex, and climbed the stairs. The complex is compiled of many residents, and i live on the 6th floor. i swung my backpack off my shoulder and dug for my keys. I heard a scutter behind me and my heart dropped. I turned around but nothing there. I fumbled with my keys until i entered my old, cigarette fume filled home. My puppy delia ran up to my feet as i set down my bag. I noticed something odd about my apartment. There was an odd rustic smell, but i guessed it was from the open window. Did i leave the window open? I went to my room, changed, and layed on the couch, with the buzzing sound of the tv helping me doze off. I fell asleep on the couch with delia licking my limp hand. An hour passed, and i felt another lick on my palm. i smiled in my sleep and dozed off once more. Then a minute later, i felt another lick. maybe delia was hungry. I opened my eyes and delia wasnt there. Delia? i went to the kitchen to see if she ran to her bowl. but no sign of her. and then there it was. drip drip drip drip drip. what was that sound? i followed the dripping to the slightly ajar bathroom. As i opened it i saw delia, bloody hung by a noose in my bathroom. i screamed and untied her, and weeped with her bloody body in my arms. Then i felt a tap on my shoulder.... i turned around and a small man, with beady eyes, whimpered and licked my palm. ",floor 6.,10,nosleep

horriddaydream,90,,175,1r338n,,669,"My mother left when I was four.
Normally, that wouldn't mean anything, but I suspected for a long time that the porcelain dolls were coming from her, like some pitiful little attempt to show me that she loved me. 

My father; he worked overtime to keep things going in the household even if it was just the two of us. His hands were always worn from working the machines at the shop and he slaved even more when he got home and had to make supper for himself and I, and go through my nightly routines before I hit the sack. I sometimes woke up in the middle of the night and he was still awake, cleaning a room in the house, and I thought to myself, ""This man is dedicated. Has to be awake in only a few hours…and here he is."" I love my father, and I always have.

One of his most trusted friends from high school, Alexander, was my babysitter from the time my mother left, to the time I was about seven years old. We trusted Alexander. He worked night shift and so he was able to work babysitting in around his hours, and he would have done anything to help out my father to make that work. My father paid him even though he asked for nothing; he said he was just 'doing his good deed', ""and I like it anyway!"" My dad used to come home from work and Alexander would pick up his bags full of toys that we played with; he always brought the best toys and trinkets with him. His daughter had passed away when she was ten years old, and I think it brought him great joy to now share her old toys with another little girl. He would say to my dad, ""She was great for me. She ate well, and she took her usual long nap. I'll be back tomorrow!"" And he always came back. 

Well, eventually times changed and my dad's work schedule changed with them. We didn't see Alexander anymore because we didn't NEED Alexander anymore. My father thought that they lost touch permanently and when I asked about him he told me truthfully that Alexander was a very busy man. And he understood that, and I did too. 

For my eighth birthday, the first porcelain doll arrived. It had beautiful, blonde curly hair and a painted on face. She was wearing what looked to be an expensive, velvet dress with an attached tutu. She came inside a stuffed envelope with nothing else on the package to identify who had sent her. Just my name, that was all. The first thing that my father did was call my grandmother, who said, ""No, I didn't drive by and place a present on the porch. I'm not her coward mother; I would have given it right to her."" That gave my father the second idea: my mother. Only thing was, we had no way of getting in touch with her and finding out for she had literally taken off and abandoned us both. And over the next few weeks, nobody came forth and said they had gotten me the doll, so we assumed this is who had sent it.

They showed up every year since then. Each unique in their own ways, each more beautiful than the last. I thought it was a little odd, yes. Especially because my mother made no outreach to me so if she was sending me gifts but not bothering to even so much call me and check up, then that was just plain rude of her and her gifts meant literally nothing. But I continued to set them up on my shelf in my bedroom and they looked nice there, I suppose.

The year I turned nineteen, I was moved into college and was taking courses on my birthday. My father called me from home and asked me when I was coming back home for a break, and I told him that I had time this weekend, but I only said this because I sensed some urgency in his voice. I could make it work. He told me not to worry about anything but that he would really like to see me. Then he stressed that I always lock my doors and always have somebody walking with me if I was out past dark, which I already knew.

I returned home that weekend and my father said there had been an accident.
My porcelain birthday doll had arrived, my nineteenth year doll. When my father brought it inside the house, it had smashed into a hundred separate pieces.
Inside, there was a diary entry on a piece of paper.
We spent the entire day smashing open every porcelain doll, and the entire night speaking with the police.
Alexander had written diary entries for every time he had drugged and molested me, each more explicit, admitting that he had done the same to his daughter up until the time of her horrible death. My father and I hadn't a dry eye in our house that entire night, and I continued to have problems throughout my college career knowing that Alexander was somewhere out there, probably assuming a new identity and doing the same thing to other girls.

Now I know why he had always commented on me taking such 'usual long naps.'

honeymoonatthefalls,61,,144,1r0fus,,616,"The falls have a pull, according to the locals.  Something dark and unearthly like a siren’s song, sweet and somehow terrible.  It draws people “of a certain intent”.  That’s the polite way to say a lot of people end up crushed on the rocks below, their limbs torn apart by the unending rush of water, the brains that made them who they were nothing more than bits of foam and meat floating to the surface.  20-40 a year, in fact, depending on who you ask.

We were happy.  Weren’t we?  I thought we were.  I thought maybe we were different from everyone else, that we’d actually make it.  We wouldn’t end up in that 50% statistic.  We’d grow old together, laughing at the same stupid jokes, knowing what was going to come out of the other’s mouth before they even had a chance to say it.

Was it the pressure of the wedding?  The fact that I’m still “between jobs”?  Young 20-somethings in one of America’s bleakest economies, doing what we could to get by.  Scrambling for every scrap as the magazine covers reminded us how worthless our generation is, the snide remarks about our smartphones and Facebook and selfies.  Maybe getting married wasn’t a good idea.

But we were in love!  We were in love and we knew deep down in that secret place in our stomachs that she was the one for me and I for her.

So then why did it happen?

No.  I’m not supposed to ask that anymore.  I’m supposed to accept that she’s gone.  I’m supposed to accept the fact that she’s her own statistic now, one of 20-40 people a year.  Another tumble of bones on the body count that’s reached over 5000 since the falls became an attraction both for tourists and people with death on their mind.

But it’s hard to accept when I can still see her face so clearly, that sweet heart-shaped face with the little crescent-moon scar on her left nostril, the way her big blue eyes lit up when she showed me the fantastic deal she scored on Groupon, a Niagara Falls getaway for our honeymoon.

If only I could go back.  Tell her that the price was nice but I’d rather go to a beach, or Ireland, it doesn’t matter, anywhere but those cursed falls.

It’s impossible to describe how it feels to stand at the crest of Niagara, the mist peppering your face like cold little kisses, drinking in the smells and the sound and the remarkable way the water rushes down, down, ever down.  Your existence seems like a cosmic joke in comparison to this almost hauntingly beautiful feat of nature.  For a moment, it is.

The locals say you can tell who has a death wish by how close they’ll get to the edge.  Those who shy away, who shake their heads and insist nervously that they can see just fine from where they are, thank you very much, those are the ones who can’t trust themselves to get too close.  If they get too close to the edge, some little part of them knows they’ll jump.

She didn’t shy away.  She went right up to the railing.  She was smiling.

That’s the worst part.  She was smiling.

It was early in the morning, one of those damp gray dawns only possible in the new spring of upstate New York.  We had the sight to ourselves.  It was a little spooky, being out there alone, the kind of spooky you get from being in an empty shopping mall after hours, all those metal gates pulled down and the lights turned off.

She was standing there, a little too high on the guardrail, leaning just a little too far over, smiling as the mist touched her lips and made her hair curl in damp little tendrils on her cheeks.  She was beautiful.

I’ll never know why I pushed her.

That’s something I have to accept.

Jaunt-701,54,,147,1rff5i,,537,"I wrapped my dollie in her prettiest red dress, looked into her cracked eyes and whispered I love you.

I held her tight. I love you. I love you. But I started to cry, because dollies don't love back. No, my dollie wouldn't do, not anymore. I wanted something of my own to care for. Something soft I could nuzzle up to at night when I was lonely. Something that needed me. I wanted a real baby.

I asked mama how to make a baby. She slapped me across the face and made me drink dish soap to wash the devil's talk from my mouth. The red mark still burned on my cheek when I got to school, but no one noticed. They never noticed me except when I fell and spilled my lunch, or when Jenny and the other girls made fun of the holes in my dresses. They only noticed me to laugh at me.

That night after I said my prayers, I looked at the stars through my window and spotted one I had never seen before. Big, bright and ruby red, it seemed to get bigger the more I stared at it. It was beautiful, so I sent it a wish. Bring me a baby, I said, bring me something to love.

The star grew bigger and bigger until ruby red filled the room and turned the air thick and rusty. Something was there with me. Black and formless like a storm cloud, it floated above me. You want a child, it said, speaking into my head instead of my ears. I will give you a child, but you must promise to love and care for him no matter what.

I promise.

Wisps of black wrapped around my wrists and pinned them to the ground as sure as steel rivets. My nightdress was lifted and my legs pulled apart. Gritty black tendrils, rough as sandpaper, opened me and slithered inside. They scraped my insides, slowly at first, then faster and faster. It felt like I was being shredded to pulp from the inside out. I tilted my head back to scream, but black filled my mouth and nothing came out. Shhh, it said, to love your child you must suffer for him first. A final push in, and shards of splintered glass exploded inside me.

The thing loosed its grip, and I reached down to feel sticky red goo oozing out of me onto the floor. I was shaking and cold, and the room was falling away. Will I die? I asked.

No. You must care for him. It is your promise.

I woke the next morning without a scratch. Was it a dream? I touched my belly. No, he is there. I can feel him. Tiny and vulnerable and perfect. I would keep my promise.

He grew every day. Soon my belly was round and full underneath my dresses. Everyone noticed me now, especially Jenny and the other girls. Slut, they said. Whore. Trash. One day Jenny fell in front of a school bus as it was pulling away. You could hear the tire pop her skull open from across the parking lot. When the police dragged the driver away he stammered that he had seen something push her, something small and black like a living shadow.

Mama cried. She held me in a scalding tub and scrubbed my body until my skin cracked and bled. Not clean, not clean, she said. She pulled me out of school and swore that I would never leave the house until it was over and done, because what would the neighbors think. I didn't mind. As long as my little boy was safe inside me, I didn't care where I went.

I dreamed of him. He told me his name, but it was a sound I couldn't pronounce, a sound like a cloud of flies buzzing through the air. I couldn't say it, but I could hear it in my head, and that was enough. He told me that he would accomplish great things, but he needed my love to make him strong first. In my dreams I held him tight, looked into his dark eyes and whispered I will love and protect you always.

Mama dreamed of him too, I think. She would lay in bed with sweat soaking into the sheets whispering Please, Please help us God. She ate less and less until she was sunken and pale like a skeleton.

I was drawing pictures one night when it happened. I reached up for a red crayon and *pop*, yellow liquid gushing out of me. He's ready, he's finally ready. I called out to mama and told her it was time. She phoned the doctor, begging him to be discreet to hide it from the neighbors. He arrived and offered to inject me with something to relieve the pain. I refused. To love my baby I must suffer for him first.

Pushing, screaming, breathing, pushing again. Hours and hours. I was weak. I was tired. But the thought of him kept me going. After so long, we would finally meet. I would hold him in my arms for real and give him the love I kept in my heart just for him. I pushed again, with the last drops of strength I had left. I emptied out and collapsed down onto the bed, sighing with relief.

I am sorry, dear, but the baby didn't make it.

No. No you're wrong. I kept him safe this whole time. I protected him and loved him and spoke to him in my dreams, I was going to care for him and make him strong, he can't be, he can't be, he can't.

I am so sorry. Here child, you can say goodbye.

I held him in my arms. He was limp and motionless, his skin a pale gray, his eyes shut tightly. He looked so peaceful. I had never seen anything so beautiful in all my life. I clutched him to my chest and cried, tears dripping onto his head. Goodbye, my love, goodbye. But no, wait. He can't be gone. I can hear him. I can hear the flies in my mind.

His eyes snapped open and his head twisted around to look at mama and the doctor. Mama fell to the floor and screamed. Her legs scrambled to press her into a corner of the room, and her eyes bulged as she shrieked and pleaded to God. The doctor stood frozen for a moment before walking into the bathroom and quietly shutting the door.

My baby's head turned back to me, and I looked into his eyes for the first time. Two huge pools of midnight black that seemed to suck the light out of the room itself. I looked into those cold, dark eyes, and I smiled. My son. My beautiful son. I am so happy to see you.

I stood up while mama's jagged screams scratched my eardrums, and I carried my son to the bathroom. I opened the door, stepped over the spreading pool of red underneath the doctor, and turned on the tap. I bathed my son in the icy cold water as he stared up at me. He was perfect. He was everything I had hoped for. And he was mine.

-------

I saw things in my dream that night. I saw great buildings and monuments ground to dust. I saw waves of fire washing clean the cities of man. I saw clouds of flies so thick they blacked out the sun. I saw red. Mists of red, rivers of red, chunks of oozing red heaped high in the moonlight. And in the middle of it all, I saw my son, my baby boy. Mama's so proud of you sweetheart.

Take the razor and prick your finger. Touch your forehead and make a dot of blood. DO NOT touch the vial before you do so.*

*Open the vial and drink it. When you do so your vision will go blurry, but you have to stay calm. Pick up the paper in the trunk and read the first paragraph. It's in German, but I know you won't have trouble with  pronouncing it. At this point, you MUST stay calm. You will start to feel closed in and you will start hearing voices. DO NOT listen to what they have to say. Tear the paper into the smallest pieces you can and scatter them on the floor.*

*When that's done, go downstairs to the ""kitchen"". You will find a gas can and a lighter. Set fire to the house. No matter what the voices say, you HAVE to set fire to the house. After it starts going, the voices will go away. Then you need to get away from that house as fast as you can.*

Exxile4000,97,,154,1rbws0,,389,"Hello reddit. I'm a killer and I have no problem admitting that. Many people have fallen victim to my gruesome attacks and I live life regretting none of it. I'm only sharing my story on here  so that someone out there can know about it. Whether or not you choose to believe it is up to you.

I was a normal child, but normal is relative so who am I to make that call. What I should say is that I grew up how you would expect a kid to grow up. My parents treated me properly, I did great in school, and I had many friends. It wasn't until high school that I started feeling the need to kill. 

It was all so spontaneous. I was just sitting in class one day staring at one of the students when the image of him dying popped into my head. I zoned out and focused on the image, his body lying in a pool of blood leaking from his head. His arms were snapped behind his back  and his feet were missing the big toes. A few weeks later that daydream became a reality... and I got away with it.

Everyone in the school was whispering rumors to one another as I walked to classes. Some were saying that he joined the army, others were convinced that he just moved like so many other kids did before him. I was the only one who knew the truth and I had to hide my devilish grin from the rest of the school. That was my only murder in high school but it ignited the flame.

When I reached adult hood I landed a successful job and had plenty of money to obtain the tools I had always dreamed of using on my victims. That's when I began to develop a signature style. I would always sever the big toes but I no longer snapped the arms behind the back. Honestly, the sound of the bones breaking didn't sit well with me. Every day I would watch the news expecting to see that one of the victims had been found, but they never were. 

Years went by and I targeted another twelve victims. They were no one in particular. Women, teenagers, it really didn't matter to me. A dead body is a dead body in my eyes, I don't care who it belongs to. Very few of them would put up a fight and that was fine with me. I wasn't trying to drag out the last moments of their lives, I just wanted them to die. I wanted to savor the warmth of their blood on my hands as I slit their throat.  

About a week after I killed my final victim, I met a girl that I ended up falling in love with. She doesn't realize how close she was to becoming just another undiscovered body. She wasn't able to have kids which was fine with me, I never really saw myself as a father. Neither of us believe in god so we saw no point in getting married, I was okay with this as well. I felt like my life was finally going to be normal again. 

After we had been together for a few years I decided to tell her about my past. I made a special dinner for her to lighten the mood. However, when I told her she just laughed and thought I was being ridiculous. It turned into her treating it like some type of role playing fantasy I had and she ignored me as I told her it was the truth. I didn't know how to prove it to her... so I killed someone in front of her. 

One night I brought her with me on what she thought was a date. When we got to the spot I opened the trunk so she could see my victim. She still thought it was a joke and asked me how I got my friend to agree to this. I think she finally understood that it was no joke as I sliced the mans throat. Her face turned pale and she reached into her purse to get her phone. I was prepared for this though and I knocked her unconscious. After I finished with  my signature killing pattern I drove back to the house. My secret was not safe with her but I loved her too much to kill her.

Right now she's kept in my basement. I don't treat her like a prisoner mind you, she has everything she could ever want. I'm hoping in time I can start leaving her untied at night so she'll quit trying to escape. I know one day she'll accept who I am. Maybe one day she'll help me fulfill my new fantasy of killing together. Or perhaps you guys won't believe me either and you'll brush this off as just another made up story. But that's the funny thing about being a killer...",The funny thing about being a killer is that no one believes you if you tell them the truth.,543,nosleep

When he was 13, however, he moved into that bedroom, and over the years, the room become even more interesting. The room is now filled with posters of The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, an authentic Spanish sword he bought hangs above his desk, and loads of other bits and pieces which captured my imagination when I was younger. To top it all off, there was an air vent connecting his room and mine. Almost directly below my room, I could hear him some nights talking to his friends on the phone while playing video games late into the night. I envied his freedom. If I had tried that, my parents right across the hall would hear me and I'd be grounded.

When I was 13 myself, my brother and sister (twins) left for college. Now the only child at home, I called my brother up one weekend and asked, 
""Can I have your room?""
My brother paused for a long time before responding
""No.""
He gave no explanation, but I didn't really care. I could understand that when he came to visit, He'd want his own room to sleep in. For 4 more years, i didn't ask to have the room again, but when i was 17, my brother bought a house. To me, it seemed like he was pretty much beyond the point of having any reason to care about his old room, so one day when he called to check up on things, I asked again.
This time he responded more quickly. His voice sounded casual, but at the same time, It kinda freaked me out. He said,
""Nah, let mom make it a guest room again. Besides, your room is super classy! My room isn't that great.""
And so, yet again, I let it go. I stayed in my room and didn't really think anything of it... that is, until last week. 

This summer, I started having severe anxiety attacks coupled with spells of incapacitating depression, especially at night. I've been on different medicines to help, and have been going to therapy to help work on relaxation techniques. Last week, my therapist noted that sometimes the brain can form associations with certain rooms or areas. She suggested that my brain, due to the recurring spells in my room, may have formed a negative association with it. She told me that switching rooms may help me relax when I start having an attack.

That night, I did it. I switched to my brother's room, and it was amazing. Since my basement always stays around below room temperature, the sheets and pillow stayed cool, which was just to my liking. I slept better than I'd slept in weeks, and thought that perhaps this room was going to turn things around. But the second night didn't go as well. I woke from a nightmare, and felt as if there was someone watching me. I shook the feeling and went back to sleep. This kind of thing happened for a few more nights; each time, I awoke more worried than the last. 

Then came the big one. I fell asleep as usual, and I began to dream: another nightmare, but this time it was more vivid. In the dream, I saw looking at my brother, when he was only 13 or 14 years old. He was sitting on his bed, talking to something. I couldn't see it, but he was looking at an angle which suggested something much larger than himself. Tears were flowing steadily from his eyes, and he was pleading, BEGGING the thing to go away, to leave him alone. The power in the room went out; I heard a horrible screeching, like a pig being tortured. The lights turned back on and my brother lay there, unconscious. A large black bruise had appeared on his ribs. The clock in his room recovered from the power outage, blinking the numbers ""00:00"". My brother then jerked upright and walked over to the only poster in his room at the time, his Hendrix poster. He took a pen form his desk and put a tally mark on the wall behind it.

I jerked up in my brother's bed. I turned on the lamp and looked around the room. I noticed every poster. Sweat started pouring from my forehead, burning my eyes. I looked at the clock. The numbers blinked ""00:00"".

TheeMikeG,21,,73,1r4fsf,,333,"Dear Mike,

They’re letting me write a letter so I figured I’d get my story out there.

It was a routine night drop, nothing different from what we’ve done countless times before. The steady hum of the C-130 as it tore through the clouds was the only thing keeping me calm. Yeah, I’ve done this a lot, but you can never get rid of the nerves before a mission. We had an idea of what awaited us down there, but we couldn’t be a hundred percent sure. People are unpredictable, and that’s scary. The plan from higher was to have our five man team infiltrate by night drop a small village I can’t pronounce to search for and capture or kill a HVT whose name I also can’t pronounce. The gunship would rise up and provide overwatch until we were extracted. Airborne all the way, hooah. 

The LT joined us again, which he decided to do from time to time. Nice enough guy, I respected him. Was supposed to be having a baby girl soon, he would always talk about it during PT. Good for him, I could never hold down a relationship for very long. I figured it was just because I’ve seen too much shit to be normal and cuddle or whatever the fuck it is that couples do. The rest of the squad was the usual guys. Mitch, Craft, and Burroughs. All experts in their craft. We were a solid group and I’d take a bullet or hell, even two, for any of them. 

“Thirty seconds!” shouted the LT from the bench, a few spots to my right, closest to the door. The jumpmaster heaved the door upward and the familiar sound of air whooshing past the plane made my heart jump. There was always a kick. “Hook up!” he shouted. We all stood up in unison and clipped our static lines to the wire that ran through the plane above our heads. I tugged on my static line to make sure it was attached. There were no reserves for this one. The jumpmaster held up his hand. Five seconds. The red light turned green and the LT positioned himself by the door. The jumpmaster smacked his rear and the LT jumped out and was whisked away. My stomach turned in knots. Over a hundred jumps and I still hated this shit. I was last to go out. I tucked my head, took a hop out of the plane and suddenly there was the rush and I felt myself getting tossed. I heard my chute above and I breathed a sigh of relief. 
Looking up to check my canopy I saw a fully inflated chute and I thanked the Lord once again. I looked down for the rest of the squad and saw their chutes inflated too. Past them, I expected to see the ground, but there was only a thick smoke, or at least that’s what it looked like. A storm cloud? Why didn’t the jumpmaster hold off the jump until the bad weather passed? 

“Staus check” I heard the LT ask through the radio. 

As I watched the other’s canopies disappear into the black cloud I began to worry. I heard the squad all check in though so I felt a little better.  I held my hand up to my ear to activate our comms. 

“Sir, what’s the situation down there?”
	
“Zero visibility guys. Pretty foggy. Can’t see my own canopy,” he said.

Then I entered the black cloud and couldn’t see a damn thing. I heard something nearby. Flapping? My radio clicks before Mitch starts talking. “I heard something. Flock of birds?”
	
“We’re too high,” replied the LT. “Eyes and ears open.” I tried to look around but there was no point. I couldn’t even see my canopy. What if I was falling to my death right then? Heavy flapping got my focus. It sounded large, whatever it was. 
	
“Sir, something is up here with us,” I say.
	
“Simmons, stay calm, what’s gotten into –”
	
“Fuck!” Craft interrupts through the mic. Then I hear a long, painful scream far below me. 
	
“Jesus Christ!” yelled the LT, “Craft! You there?!”
	
Silence. Not even static. 
	
“Guys, stay calm. Get ready to hit any minute. I can’t see the ground in this shit but we’ll sort this out on the DZ.”
	
I checked my watch. It takes maybe two minutes to hit jumping from a mile up. It’s been six minutes and I know this wasn’t a HALO jump. Was I caught in a thermal? I pulled on my risers and felt myself drifting through the air. When I released, I didn’t notice any change in descent speed. The LT must have noticed the same thing because I could hear him cursing through the radio. There’s a loud screech; unlike anything I’ve ever heard. After it ended a few seconds later the LT had to shout over the commotion we were all making on the radio. We were scared. 
	
“Guys! I don’t know what the fuck is going on but stay calm! Weapons on amber.”
	
My combat gear was in a large sack between my legs, but my USP was on my belt. I took it out and held it ready. I didn’t know for what, but I was ready to go. How had we still not hit the ground yet? Then I got an idea. My combat load. We are supposed to release it before landing, and it slides down a twenty foot rope so we don’t break our legs when we land. I thought if I could cut it free, maybe I could hear it hit the ground. I asked for permission from the LT who quickly approved. He must have been as freaked out as me to allow me to abandon my combat gear. I pressed the handle on my hip and the gear slid down the rope and out of sight into the darkness. I took out my knife and sawed at the line until it snapped. I waited and waited but couldn’t hear a thing. 
	
I heard the flapping again, and someone fired their weapon, two, three times. Then silence. “Jesus Christ,” whispered the LT. “Status check.”
	
“Burroughs.”
	
“Simmons.”
	
Nothing.
	
“Sir, what the fuck is going on?!” I knew he wouldn’t have an answer, but I was desperate. 
	
“I have no idea.”
	
We drifted through the air for ten more minutes. Then I touched down. I didn’t hit hard, it was like I was just set down. Didn’t even have to fall over. I still couldn’t see a damn thing though. I heard quick steps and then Burroughs burst into view and tackled me to the ground. He was frantic. He begged me through tears to follow him. We wandered around until we came to the LT. He didn’t have a right half of his body. He was barely alive, sputtering through bloody lips for us to run. 
	
“My baby, my baby, my baby,” he whispered over and over until he didn’t say anything anymore. The cloud cleared from the area behind him and there was this thing. All I saw before I turned and ran was large leathery wings. I heard the screeching and the flapping of those awful wings again. Burroughs screamed as he was ripped backwards from beside me. Somehow I burst out of the cloud and I saw headlights. I nearly got hit by the jeep but dove out of the way just in time. Out got two guards who spoke a language I didn’t understand. Burroughs was the translator. They prodded me with machine guns and kicked and beat me until I was barely conscious. How did they not see the thing behind me? They dragged me into the back of their vehicle and drove me to their camp. 

I’ve been their POW for nearly a month now. If you get this letter, please get my story out there. I’m not crazy, I promise. I can’t explain what happened any better than that. We’re not alone. Something terrible is going on over here. Time to go; they’re beckoning me to come outside. It’s awfully dark out there. Is a storm coming in?

courtneymadison,33,,83,1r2j24,,253,"I'm just a normal 18 year old that lives at home and goes to class. I've never really had any unexplainable experiences but I had one today. I woke up and started getting ready for class, I thought I saw my mom in her room so I started having a conversation with her while I was getting dressed. She was responding as per usual so I thought nothing of it. (Quick sidenote: Nothing felt wrong with the way she was responding. Whatever this was it sounded just like my mom.) After a while she stopped replying to me. Being curious I decided to go see why. I went to her room and it was empty, looked in the kitchen and it was empty, She would of had to have walked past me to leave the house so I knew she hadn't left. I decided to call her to figure out where she'd gone and when I looked I had a text from her that was received at 5:27 a.m. saying ""Got called in to open. Be home at 11 so you can take the car."". I called her to see if she was messing with me but she was actually at work. I don't know who I've been talking to all morning and I'm really freaked out. Can anyone help me? 


EDIT: I asked my little sister if when she had had anything strange happen when she was getting ready for school and she looked at me like I'd lost it. For all the people that asked about the conversation, the previous night my mom had found a ouija board (unused and still in the packaging) in my closet and she had thrown it away, ""She"" was talking about how ouija boards are dangerous and I shouldn't mess with them. She was very persistent that I don't get involved with things like that but she's always saying stuff like that so it wasn't a very out of the ordinary topic for us. The conversation was about an hour long and I was fully awake when it took place. We checked the house and nothing was missing or out of place. We live in an apartment and all the windows were locked and the screens were intact, so someone couldn't have gotten in or out through them. My mom is really into the weird/paranormal stuff so I told her everything and she has no idea what it could be. Also I feel I should mention we've lived here for 15 years and nothing like this has happened before.

JunkPrince,53,,89,1ragny,,255,"Hey all, long time reader of /r/nosleep, and I finally have a reason to post!

I work in a recycling center. I am the guy that weighs the truck when it comes in with scrap metal, watches it unload, and then weighs the truck when it comes out. That difference in weight is used to calculate the value of the scrap and how much the customer receives for his load. it’s a well known place in my town, city actually. There’s a pretty steady business and it’s good work. I started out in the yard sorting and a few years ago moved into the office. I still have to wear a hard hat and safety vest, but only when I have to watch a truck unload in an area that the cameras don’t cover. 

A few days ago, we started getting loads from a demolition job about a hundred miles from town. It was an old Air Force base that didn’t survive the latest round of budget cuts. The base was being scrapped to make a nature preserve. The plan is called Nukes to nature. The contractors brought in mostly structural iron, copper wiring and office equipment. I was watching a contractor ( who was mostly likely drunk) tip his truck when a old metal desk caught my eye. It landed right side up twenty feet from me. Because I was bored I walked over and opened the drawers.

 One of the drawers a metal lock box. I took it back to my desk and set about picking the lock. Working in a scrap yard we sometimes come across old strongboxes or small office safes. My boss has a deal that if you can open it, then whoever finds it splits the contents 50/50 with the scrapyard. You can see why I’ve gotten pretty good at picking locks!

The box opened after a few minutes of concerted effort. Inside was just an old piece of computer equipment, an inch high by 4 inches long. The closest thing I could compare the size to was to the box that your bank send you your checks in. It had a small bar code on the top part, and handwritten in permanent marker was the words “ MJ-12, Containment “ An orange sticker proclaimed “ Erase and Destroy, ref FM 3-36 USA TRADOC”

I showed what I am now calling the hard drive to my boss, who was VERY unimpressed and gave me the number for a IT guy who might want to buy it. I am going to see if he wants to buy it, but I’m going to ask him if he can see what files are on the drive. Secret plans to bomb the Soviets? Blueprints for a new jet fighter? Who knows? It’s a mystery worthy of /r/nosleep!!!

I’ll post when I hear back from the IT guy

PeckerPoker,43,,85,1r58lt,,238,"Ok, so this isn't a long story filled with twists and turns, but it just happened about 15 minutes ago, and I'm a little uneasy now.

For reference, my husband, son, and I moved into an apartment in the top-half of a century-home a couple months ago. The doors all have old knobs and the doors don't always close easily - you really have to pull sometimes.

Anyway, I just put my son (almost two years old) down for his nap. I told him night-night as I closed the door. As I always do, I pulled the door shut firmly and made sure I heard it click. I swear I heard it click.

I walked away and into the bathroom to go pee. As I sat down on the toilet, I heard my son start crying, which isn't that unusual, but normally he doesn't do more than fuss for a minute before falling asleep. I even kept him up a little longer than usual to make sure he fell asleep. He seemed pretty ready to go down... thumb in mouth under his blanky, he rolled over onto his side and put his blanket over his head like he does when he's really tired.

I finish peeing and walk out of the bathroom and his door is wide open. I see him standing in his crib crying. I go in, feeling uneasy, and lay him back down and cover him back up. He lays there and just keeps crying as I check his closet... like there would be someone hiding in there or something. Kind of dumb, I know, but I couldn't just shut him back in his room alone without checking.

Even if I was wrong and the door didn't click shut (which is possible), it shouldn't have been wide open. When I haven't completely shut it in the past, it will open up about 5 or 6 inches. It's never opened up all the way like that.

I checked the rest of the rooms and closets, feeling nervous, but kind of stupid. Of course, there wasn't anything unusual anywhere. Still, I'm kind of on edge. I wish my husband was home.",Nap Time,323,nosleep

Thats some crazy stuff, am I right?

Let me know what you think.



","Found Hard Drive, wtf?",315,nosleep
tellmewhatiswrong,52,,59,1reivz,,213,"Arghhh. I have no idea what to make of this situation I find myself in.

I started off 2013 as being in the most amazing relationship I've ever had. I married the girl of my dreams last year, after being together for 5 years prior to that. She is the most beautiful, intelligent, interesting person I have ever met, and I knew that as soon as we met each other. Immediately, the chemistry between us was electric.

Don't get me wrong, we are extremely different in a lot of ways, but up until this point, that has only helped to make our relationship stronger. I'm an atheist, a kind of scientific nerd I guess. She, on the other hand, was more....new age? I guess you could say. Not particularly religious, but interested in the paranormal, philosophy, anything that can't really be explained. It would not surprise me to see her out hunting for UFO's, however for the most part, this side of her was really just limited to reading about such events and watching the odd documentary.

Having said that, she is so sensible and smart. She's a very curious person, that's what I put her hobbies down to, really. It's never been more than a passing interest of hers. She works as a personal assistant to the CEO of a law firm in the city. Everyone says she should study law because her talents are wasted as a secretary. But she seems content enough at the moment....well she did.

The reason I find myself in this mess is because she has changed her mind about something we used to agree on - kids. When we first got together, we both agreed that we did not want to have children. We based our entire relationship on that premise. We were content with travelling the world, expensive wines, and sex on the kitchen bench. All that would change if kids came into the picture. I have never wanted children, and don't feel like I ever will.

She used to feel the same. Until her sister had a baby. She started to get a little clucky, she said. She started to see us with a baby of our own. At first I thought it was just a passing comment, but the longer time went on, the more I realised she was serious. That's when the fights started. Fight after fight, every week. Her crying and yelling and begging me to change. To compromise. Me, dumbfounded and annoyed that one of the foundations of marriage is suddenly being challenged. Things have been said in the heat of the moment, and both of us have been deeply hurt by the other. She makes me feel like I can't give her what she needs, that I'm denying her her happiness. I make her feel like she's not important, she says. That I'm being selfish.

Maybe I am? I don't know.

So we found ourselves in a stale mate. She posted something on Reddit asking for advice and most of the suggestions directed us to attend couples counselling.

I was reluctant to say the least. But I was willing to give it a shot.

Sandra, our therapist, was actually not what I expected. She seemed rational and quite straightforward, not the Einstein-esque shrink that I had imagined. She advised that we really we had two options : either she could stay with me, and be without a child. Or she could leave me for someone who would give her a baby. We seem to be stuck in secret option number 3: staying in the circumstances we find ourselves in.

Disregarding all the fighting, she was still her normal self, and we have been managing to keep it together, and still spend some quality time together. We have still been going out with friends, and going for walks with our dog, and I know we still love each other.

I stopped going to couples counselling. I sort of felt like she couldn't give us a real answer, she was only there to listen. My wife kept attending on her own though, I think she takes some kind of comfort in it.

She came home last week and told me that she's going to be attending a ""Self help"" seminar, and would I like to go. I said definitely not. I couldn't think of anything worse than to be honest! Even the counselling sessions were too much for me. She asked if I minded if she went. She said it was with some famous psychoanalyst, and that her therapist would be in attendance, on the ""Assistance Team"". I said whatever she felt would help. She said she feels it will help her clear her head on the baby issue. I'm all for anything that could help us get back on track, so I told her to go for it.

The seminar seemed pretty intensive. It was 14 hours a day, Friday, Saturday and Sunday of last week. It was also very expensive, but I bit my tongue. 

She got home last night and just seemed exhausted. I haven't gotten many details out of her, as every night when she arrived home she went straight to sleep and we barely had time to speak. Today we both had the day off, which was recommended by the people who organised the seminar.

Today we woke up, and she was....intense. I woke up with her clinging to me for dear life. She was stroking my face and staring into my face. It was quite nice actually. Nice to have some affection. We cuddled in bed for a long while. She seemed.....ok. Her eyes definitely looked brighter, but she didn't say much, just was very intensely affectionate. 

She got up to have a shower, and I went out to have some breakfast. After about half an hour I knocked on the bathroom door, telling her to leave some hot water. She must have had it on so hot, steam was pouring out of the door into our hallway, and the walls were dripping with condensation. I knocked a few more times, and yelled out to her, but got no response.

I opened the door, and waited for the hazy steam to clear, to see her standing there, fully clothed and staring in the mirror. The shower was on full ball, and extremely hot, and I reached over the turned the tap off. She didn't take her eyes off her own reflection. She was very vague when I questioned her, and sweating profusely. I managed to get her dressed (out her pyjamas) and she's in the other room now watching TV.

I assume this weird behaviour is something to do with the seminar? I don't really understand all this new age crap, has anyone else ever been to one of these seminars? Or know someone that has? I've tried googling more information but can't see anything about this specific group. 

Any advice would be appreciated, I'm a bit weirded out right now to be honest.

PlotThickener,13,,44,1r0aj7,,202,"This is a story I've never discussed with anyone aside from those people involved. But I figured it belonged here. For the longest time I chalked it all up to pranks, my imagination, whatever...but hopefully you'll all be able to make more sense of it.

I was driving in a rural part of Wisconsin (which, if you live there, you know is much of the state). Lots of flat farms, country highways named for letters, empty back roads, etc. It was 10 p.m. or later--I don't really remember when, but it had been dark for some time and it was the middle of summer, so it must have been late. 

It was the time of night cars stop moving on the rural roads so it's just you and your headlights and the world around you starts getting really creepy. Plus you're always watching out for deer on these roads, which can just pop out at any moment, so you're kind of on ""yellow alert.""

I'm driving north on a long section of road. There's a big flat farm on my left, mostly empty-looking, probably planted with soybeans which don't grow high. I'm concentrating on the edges of where my headlights meet the darkness to watch for deer, and I think I see one walking out of the farm toward the road.

I tap the brakes, not sure of what I see, but soon I realize it's not a deer. It's upright, something walking on two feet, and it's HUGE. And it's all black. It's still moving, but it's not moving with any kind of walking movement; it's just sort of gliding across my vision.

At this point I've stopped the car completely--in the middle of the road, just watching. One instinct was to hit the gas and drive past, because I could have easily passed it, but I'm not sure if it was about to jump out. I'm not really afraid yet, I'm just frozen; you know those moments where you can't figure out what something is so there are no real emotions? That was me.

Then it comes into clearer view in the headlights. Well, that's not very accurate to say, because it didn't seem to reflect any light. It was like the light moved through it, if that makes sense. But I could see the outline of the figure against everything else that was lit--the road, the trees, etc.

The figure looked like Death. I mean EVERYTHING you imagine when you read the stories--the scythe, the big black hood. It was exactly what you think when you think Grim Reaper, only unnaturally tall and thin. It was so tall and thin it looked a lot like this guy's halloween costume when he wears it after about five minutes or so: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8PoCkNKDGk Especially how tall it was. I mean, ten feet minimum. I think most people think of the Grim Reaper as being as large as a big person, but it wasn't really like that.

But that was my first thought. A halloween costume. It was still summer, though, so not Halloween. But, I rationalize, maybe it's just a prank. But then I pay attention to how it moves to the middle of the road.

It just GLIDES. I see no feet, no hint that this thing is doing anything but flying off the ground, but you can't see feet or anything because the robe hits the ground.

Then, in the middle of the road, maybe ten feet in front of me, it stops.

The hooded face turns--toward me.

It's so slow and smooth, and just plain UNNATURAL, that I completely freeze in the car. My hands are locked on the wheel. The face is turning to me, slowly, perfectly smoothly, and I'm scared out of my mind. Even if this is some prank, this thing clearly means business. Maybe it's some psychopath scaring people, and not just an innocent prank.

It sees me. I don't see eyes, no glowing eyes or anything, just black, but somehow I KNOW that it's looking at me, making eye contact. I got goosebumps even on my scalp; I remember my hair feeling like it stood straight up. I feel like I was literally looking death in the face. My stomach sank like someone just told me a loved one had died. I mean, you do not want to feel this feeling. Ever. The thing stood perfectly still, too, as if considering me or weighing me. I felt really judged, if that makes sense. Like I was being considered.

Then he glides off so fast I don't even see where he goes. The roads are clear again, and then I heard the engine running as if all of the world's sound had suddenly been un-muted.

I drive back home, still frozen, still rationalizing what I saw. A prank, I figure. It had to be a prank, some overzealous Halloween lover setting up rumors of the Grim Reaper walking around the farms. I tell my parents about it, and they're sure it's a prank. So sure that I eventually rationalize it away, and the memory is filed away as creepy, but nothing supernatural.

At about the same time, I heard that a farmer who owned that soybean field had died that night. But it took me a long time before I put two and two together, when I realized that I saw something that looked like THE FREAKING GRIM REAPER on the same night that farmer died. I remember when I first had the thought, and my stomach sank.

It was like the rationalization I had used to remember the story of the Grim Reaper was suddenly stripped away, and I had to confront the fact that I saw something very, very scary.

But what else can I do but live my life?

I went back to college--every time I came back home at night I took an alternate road just because I got the creeps so bad. Had a good semester, mostly A's, had some good times with friends. I drive back mostly during day or evening time so I don't have to revisit those unpleasant memories.

Then my parents tell me that there are more ""Grim Reaper"" stories going around lately, all pretty similar to mine. When you live in a  small town it seems like there are a lot of funerals for old people that you know or at least heard of going on all the time. At one funeral, an old lady's granddaughter cried because she saw she said a big black figure over the casket. My parents heard that story and thought of mine, but they still just treated it as a joke.

I would stay up a lot later than the people in my house (parents + younger brother, plus an uncle aunt and cousin who were spending Christmas with us), and slept in a room upstairs on this little side road in a rural subdivision. No streetlights out there; just the lights that other people kept on their garages all night.

One night I went up to my room at about 2 a.m., and of course the whole house is quiet, and I go to my room and turn out the lights so I can go to bed. I usually throw a glance out the window and you can see most of the side street because the neighbors kept their garage light on all night.

This time the whole scene looks a little different. There's a big shadow looming in the front yard, and it's blocking a lot of light. Then I look closer and I realize it's not a shadow--it's something black that's cutting THROUGH the light.

Then I feel my heart practically stop as I realize…it's back. The Grim Reaper figure.

It was just like before. It cast no shadow. The scythe was there, and the tall hooded cloak, with no face.

The breath went out of me when I realized that, unlike before, this reaper was not looking to the side when I discovered it. It was looking right at our house.

II stood there, frozen again, my finger still on the switch from just having hit the light. It was a windy winter night, and you could see some snow move, but the creature's robe didn't move at all. The same way its movements before had been unnatural, now it loomed like a statue. No flailing around in the wind. Just standing tall, scythe up high, staring at our house.

I looked away, then looked back again. Still there. Looming. I didn't get the sense that it was looking at me, but I still couldn't stop staring.

Then I looked away, and looked back again. This time I KNEW it was staring. Again, it was hard to see--there was really nothing that I could tell that suggested it was looking at me. No evil glowing eyes or anything. I just felt it. Felt the same feelings as before--a rotten pit in my stomach, the feeling of being measured and weighed and considered.

I heard a squeak, and realized it was me. My breath was being squeezed out of me, simply from the fear. Keep in mind I had no idea what this thing would do next. What, fly up to my window? Suddenly disappear? Rip off its hood and reveal a laughing skull?

After a moment, its gaze departed from me, again. I felt good enough to go to my brother's room and wake him up to show him something in the window. It took him forever to get out of bed, but it may have only been a few minutes. By the time he woke up, rubbed his eyes, and listened to the panic in my voice, a few minutes had at least past. I showed him the window but, of course, the figure was gone.

But still, that was it, I knew. The night I saw death.

That was the night my uncle died.

",The night I saw death,246,nosleep
chimera_phantasm,44,,52,1rbg7n,,185,"My name is Ramiel, and I want you to read this right before you go to sleep. Trust me, it’s better this way.

 If it’s the middle of the day for you or perhaps you’re not quite tired yet, bookmark this and read it when your eyes are starting to itch with tiredness, but you’re not nodding off yet. I don’t want you to forget what you’re about to read. 

I’m on the tall, skinny side of my arabic family, I guess I take after my mom in that respect. Though i’m pretty sure she didn’t have this much facial hair. She named me after an angel that is responsible for “divine visions”. I wonder if she knew how right on the money she was.  	

Why does my name and physical features matter? I suppose it doesn’t, but if I’m going to share something this personal with strangers for help or some kind of catharsis, i’d rather you had a good idea of who I am and not just a blank slate.  	

I don’t want you to forget me when this is over. 
	

Before we begin, here’s an interesting fact to wrap your head around: Your brain produces extremely high amounts of a psychedelic compound called DMT (Dimethyltryptamine) two times in your life; Once when you are born to help cope with the pressure it puts on your fragile, infant body during the painful process of birth and once again when you are seconds from dying to ease the burden it puts on your body and mind as they both shut down for the very last time. This is often why people claim to see their loved ones who have long passed on by their side, bright lights from the sky or feelings of elation. 

This process is so strong that it has the capabilities to erase everything in your mind, like a mass wipe of your hard drive. Now you might think that isn’t too important if you’re just starting out your life or simultaneously moments away from it coming to an end, but I ask you to entertain the notion that you possess a soul or an inner essence of sorts; what if that soul, that consciousness, that essence of you simply continued on without the knowledge of a past existence? What if at the moment of death, you saw something so undeniably horrifying and inconceivable, something you’d only seen in fleeting dreams and nightmares throughout your life, that your brain compensates in the only way it knows how, by erasing any prior memory of it before allowing what makes you “you” continue onto the next stage of whatever is out there. Your brains last failsafe, a defence mechanism to ensure you won’t carry the burden with you. But like any kind of defence mechanism, there’s always a bypass...and there’s always a black box.  
	
DMT is a chemical produced by your pineal gland and it is responsible for us dreaming every single night. Not the reason, however. We have no idea why we dream, we just do. As soon we enter REM sleep, our dreams become their most memorable and malleable. It is at this point we have dreams which take proper form, that we feel most real and perceive to be the most accessible, though we seldom ever remember the dream itself. Because like a drug trip, our brain is determined to protect us from that experience...but what if that wasn’t the only reason?

Consider this; The older we get, we sleep considerably less hours. As babies, we sleep for up to 14 hours and by the time we hit 18 years old, it’s half of that amount. What if this is a defence mechanism our brain develops so that we don’t spend too long in “that realm”? No, i’m not talking about “the further” from Insidious or some kind of Nightmare on Elm Street knockoff, before your already horror obsessed minds make some kind of parable to an existing franchise for comfort or relatable aspects. You’re still very much within your own mind, but there’s something else there with you.  

Now I ask you to suspend all beliefs or non-beliefs and read on to hear my story and why I no longer sleep and why, despite being an Atheist, I pray to something, to anything, (hell even Hypnos would be a welcome evil right now) that should my mind succumb to sleep and my body fail me, that I don’t dream. 

I’m a counsellor at my local university, I took on the job in September of last year as a ditch effort to bump up my resume and to reduce rent through living on the campus. It was your usual run of the mill kind of work, talk to terrified 1st years who’d never lived away from home before and were simply not used to their newfound freedom, dealing with homesickness, new friendships, one night stands etc. The 2nd years were dealing with social troubles within their houses/apartments, deadlines mounting and the occasional unplanned pregnancy. The final year students were typically near breakdown over their dissertations and end of year exams, so you’d offer them all the appropriate advice, your own experiences at the university as an example and then ultimately hope it all sinks in. If not, well there’s always next week and beyond that, a private therapist. 

But, like all forms of employment that deal with face to face interactions, there’s always one encounter you never forget. For me, that was Milo Moraga, a 2nd year student studying Psychology &amp; Philosophy. The first time he came into my office, he struck me as a little bit gaunt, his striped long-sleeve top hanging off him like it’d stretched in the wash. Strung out, but shy. That would have been my first impression. I think he sensed my preconceived notions, avoiding making eye contact with me as he shuffled inside. He was apprehensive, sleep deprived, his hair greasy under a black beanie and his eyes laden with heavy dark bags underneath like someone had put on eyeliner while he slept. He sat down, glancing around at the windows and leant forward, cracking his knuckles and rubbing his hands over one another hastily.

*“Hello Milo, how can I help you? I understand you asked for this appointment because of...anxiety? Do you want to tell me about that?”*

 I looked through the brief set of notes the receptionist gave me and tried to study as best I could while he spoke. Nothing that would ultimately help me ascertain the problem, it just gave him time to compose himself. 

He didn’t respond, just kept shuffling in his chair, I guess he wasn’t 100% sure he should come here.  	

*“Your lecturer sent you here, didn’t they?”* I said bluntly, feeling a slight headache come on as I felt an awkward 30 minute session rearing it’s ugly, monotonous head. 

He nodded, but I noticed something in that moment that made me think there was more to it. His expression was almost like he was pleading for his life as he quickly nodded.  	

I leaned forward, placing my hands under my chin and up to my lips as I observed him, I had to be very careful with how I handled this. If he was suicidal, one wrong statement could leave him with a noose round his neck.  	

*“Milo, what happened in the classroom to get you here? Can you tell me that much?”*

He mimicked me, leaning forward as well, though his posture was the furthest parallel from my own, it looked like his spirit was broken. 

*“The lecturer...Ms Armstrong...she was talking about solipsism and I just got...lost within it. Do you know what solipsism is?”*

I did, but I shook my head. I didn’t want to interrupt him when he was being so open. 

*“It’s a philosophical belief that everything an individual perceives is only in his own mind, it is a construct of his own psyche. There is no other human beings, no other individual thoughts, just his or her own...I guess I found the idea kinda comforting and I broke down.”*

 I raised an eyebrow, that’s certainly not a usual response. 

*“Comforting, Milo? You mean to say you enjoy being alone &amp; isolated?”*  

*“No, the opposite actually, I have a lovely group of friends, a loving family and a fiancé, but it was comforting for another reason...if It’s just me, then what hurts me is just me, I know what i’m capable of and it makes any kinds of threats a moot point. It means that..that...”*

 He put his hands up to his mouth and began crying silently, the picture of this situation was getting uglier and murkier the more he explained. 

*“It means that I might not die after all.”*

 I rolled up my sleeves, my flannel shirt was already beginning to chafe me. First signs of stress, I suppose. I looked down at my charm bracelet my wife brought me and took in a deep breath. I knew this was going to be rough. 

*“It’s...it’s my dreams, doc. There’s something in my dreams. I can’t sleep anymore. Each time I do, it’s like I can sense i’m going into that place again, journeying deeper into the void with every evening. I’ve tried taking coffee, shit loads of red bull and any cheap ass energy drinks I can get my hands on...I even took those pills truckers take so they can stay wired for 18 hours, but...well you know the problem, right doc?”* He looked down and started rubbing his hands together again, his knee bouncing as he struggled to keep it under control. 

Withdrawal symptoms combined with sleep deprivation, this kid was getting more tweaked by the minute. 	

*“The problem being that we all have to sleep eventually, no matter how long we put it off.”* I exhaled. *“Milo, I want you to start at the beginning, I know you’re anxious to get some kind of help, but if I don’t know the route of the problem, I can’t give you the correct advice, okay? Now I want you take in 3 deep breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. Can you do that for me? And you don’t need to call me ‘doc’, i’m just a volunteer counsellor. You can call me ‘Rami’ if you like?”* 

He nodded and did as instructed, his demeanour improving slightly with each successive inhale, though this was hardly a permanent solution to his paranoia. I didn’t want to ask at this point how long he’d been awake for, but I could tell it’d been more than a handful of days. Once an individual goes past the 3 day mark, they will begin to lose their grip on sanity and brain cells will start to die. I was silently hoping I could find out the problem to this sooner rather than later.  	

*“Alright”* I picked up my laptop to take notes. *“Go ahead, tell me what started this all off.”*

What follows is the unedited conversation, this is verbatim what was said between the two of us. If I can find the audio recording later, I will attach it to the post.  	

*“Do you know much about lucid dreaming, Rami?”* 

 *“I know a little, just that it’s something practiced and allows for complete control of the dream by the dreamer.”* 

He nods before continuing. 

*“There’s a learning curve to it, you need to lie in bed and shut out all outside sounds and impulses. The typical things really, the sensation to scratch your arm, to roll over, to block out the voices.”* 

He stopped and stared at me with fear. *“I didn’t mean to tell you that...”*  	

*“It’s alright, we’ll get to it later, let’s just focus on the why and not the how for the moment. What made you decide to lucid dream in the first place?”* 

 He shifted in his chair and suddenly looked very timid. 

*“I kept seeing him in my dreams, at first he’d just be a random appearance and then he’d start to try and approach me, friendly smile and hand outstretched like he was greeting an old friend. Never threatening or hostile, just attempting to make contact with me. Though he’d never get to. Every single time, i’d be distracted by something at the last second or my dream would veer off in another direction.”*

He shifted in his seat and closed his eyes before continuing. 	

*“I remember in the first few dreams we had, he’d just be lingering in the background. If I was walking through a street, he’d just be standing with the crowd my brain created and not really reacting to anything but me. I’d see him watch me, but then my dream would shift and I guess i’d just ignore it and carry on...after a few weeks, I began getting better at controlling my dreams. I’d start to mess around with the world I was inhabiting, like Inception I guess but more...personal. I’d turn myself into a member of X-Men or i’d go on a date with my perfect woman, y’know...things that you can only dream of, literally...well that’s when he started to become more apparent. I’d usually wake up before he actually got too close, but I’d always remember the look on his face before I did.”* His eyes widened. *“He always looked so angry...”*

*“Former abuse victim?”* I thought, adding it to the list of potential issues and solutions. I didn’t want to stop him while he was on a roll. I nodded to show my attentiveness and he continued. 	

*“I still remember the first time he managed to speak to me. I was in a park i’d visited as a child with my mother. It was a small piece of heaven in London back then, a mental safe haven when things got too stressful I guess. But this was nothing like I remembered it, the trees weren’t trees, they were corpses stacked on top of one another, some overlapping and...meshing with one another in unspeakable positions to form branches. I could feel the atmosphere almost turn to pure disgust as they noticed me, unable to move or even speak to me. But their eyes, their eyes said everything. Because at first they fixated on me with hatred, then quickly away in sheer terror. They’d seen something far more terrifying than the fate they were already suffering...so...I...”* 

His eyes welled up with tears, unblinking as they streamed down his face.  	*“I looked, Rami. I looked and saw him standing some 40 feet away down the path, his head bowed. He wasn’t moving and yet he was. His body was almost...rippling. The closest way I can describe it is the way a signal on a TV channel in the old days used to bend and flicker when the signal was weak. Every time I blinked, he came closer. I tried for the longest time to not blink, really...I did. But the brain betrays your conscious impulses. The more you try to put off a basic function, the more your brain wills you to do it. When he was 10 feet away, he simply vanished. By the time I had registered that he was gone, I heard a whisper in my ear...he was standing right behind me, I could feel his breath on my neck. Rami...it didn’t feel human.”*	

There was an awkward silence, he took in some deep breaths and shuddered. Obviously reliving the memory wasn’t going to be something pleasant for him but...the way he reacted, it was like he truly had experienced this. I stared at him, nodding and silently encouraging him to continue. When he didn’t, I leaned forward and quietly asked him what i’m sure he was waiting me to ask; 	

*“What did he say to you, Milo?”*

Milo shook his head. *“I’m sorry, I don’t remember. That was when the dream ended. I didn’t see him again in my dreams for a while.”*

We talked for a little while longer, mainly about his anxieties in crowds and eye contact, then our time came to an end and we scheduled an appointment for the following week. 

This would be our last session together.  	It was a Monday morning and i’d just come back from a friends wedding, my wife and I had been drinking so by the time I got to the office I was nursing a hangover, my flannel shirt covering the bruises i’d sustained falling over and my best pair of jeans smeared in alcohol. It was a day my mind was not in the work, I suppose. I just wanted to get home and go to sleep.   

 Milo came in earlier than planned, he looked desperate. He was pulling at his hair, biting his fingernails and pacing constantly. It didn’t look like he’d seen any sleep at all. I sent a text to my colleague asking for security to come over as soon as possible. He was going to need to be sectioned for his own safety. How on earth he’d managed to go this long without his friends or fiancee doing something is beyond me.  

*“I remember what he said, Rami. I remember it clearly now.”* He said between pants and more nail biting. 	

*“Okay, Milo. Well why don’t you take a seat and we’ll talk it out?”*

 He ignored that, but stopped pacing and stared intently at me.  	

*“I’ll be right here, always.”* He put his arms around himself, a self defence mechanism when a persons personal space has been violated. 

*“That was what he said. I heard it again and again every time I closed my eyes.”* 	

He started bashing at his temples. *“IT WON’T. FUCKING. STOP.”*  

All I could do at this point was try to keep him talking and calm until security got here. 

 *“Did this make you afraid to dream, Milo?”* 

 He started laughing, his face showing the complete opposite of his vocal expression. Pure incredulity and fear on his face against the guttural sound of his manic laughter.  	*“You don’t get it, do you? He didn’t mean just when I dream. He meant always. Now I know...now I know for sure.”* 	

He took a deep breath in and his demeanour shifted, he suddenly looked like a man almost at peace. Not content but willing to let go.  	

*“Thanks for listening Doc, sharing this with someone was important to me...and to him. He’s going to have his work cut out for him i’m sure.”*

 And just like that, he got up and left. I followed him out, naturally concerned for him. I watched him leave the building and cross the road.  

Then he did something I won’t ever forget. 

 He turned to me, smiling and outstretched his hand, crying openly as a vehicle struck him. I didn’t even see it coming, I was so captivated by his expression.  	

I couldn’t even bring myself to go over to his body, I gave my statement and went straight home. All I could do was look in the mirror, wondering what it was that was bothering me so much about how I looked and why Milo outstretching his hand was so disturbing to me. When I looked at myself, I didn’t see a 6’0 150lb brown coloured hipster. I saw someone troubled, someone who didn’t look like they’d slept much lately, someone like Milo...

I got a phone call from the hospital later on that evening, Milo was in a coma and on life support. He was non-responsive and likely brain dead. His family were choosing to keep his life support on in lieu of their religious and moral views. I think deep down, they just didn’t want to let him go. I’d been asked to go into his apartment with a member of his family to see if there was anything to indicate why he would willingly stand in front of oncoming traffic.

I won’t bore you with the traveling details, but his apartment was surprising. I was half expecting a filthy, run down place filled with half eaten food and human waste given his obsessive and unstable state. Guess I just watched too many detective/horror movies growing up. 

His place was immaculate, everything was extremely clean and organised, he’d already packed up a lot of his material possessions into boxes with names on the front, this was already beginning to look like premeditation. 

He had a desk beside his bed, this was the only place in his room that showed any signs of his lack of sanity rubbing off on his living conditions. Books on demonology, the science of sleeping, DMT, some sleeping pills and a journal. 

His brother went through the boxes while I took a look at the journal (i’ll include photos later if I get permission from the family, names have been changed and anything too personal will of course be blurred out). It initially contained legible, competent insights into his nightly journeys as he began to lucid dream. But as this other entity began to make himself more known and aware, the content shifts and the writing becomes hastily scrawled, certain words appear larger than others, he questions himself on numerous occasions and draws the mans face more frequently as the journal comes to it’s end.  	

The final entry is barely legible, but it details a conversation he had with the man in his dream and that a reminder that he would be with him always.  After this, there is just a single word on the hardback of the journal, rewritten over and over, almost like it’s been carved in. 	

**“DREAM.”**

Which brings us to the final part of this story; the present. I’m sure you’d all love to discover i’m actually cursed or that this story will follow some typical archetype of horror shorts and i’m moments away from death, passing on a final message. But as i’m sure you’re all coming to realise, that is not the case.  	

I just woke up from a lucid dream, i’ve never had one before nor do I know how I had one, but it was definitely a lucid dream. I was able to control my reality, my own physical form and everything around me. It was here I saw Milo. He approached me slowly and before I could even say anything, he asked me a favour;  	

*“Pull the plug, let me die.”*

I was so taken aback that my rational thought process dissipated and for a moment, I wondered...was this perhaps a shared dream? 	

*“I can’t take the torture anymore, Rami. Please tell my family I love them, but I need to be let go.”*

*“It’s okay, you don’t need to suffer anymore in the real world, i’ll do what I can to convince them.”* I croaked, placing a hand on his shoulder. 

Milo’s smile faded.  	

*“I’m not talking about the torture there, Rami. I’m talking about the torture here...without being able to wake up, he has complete control. I’m his new puppet and he wants to play forever. He has no physical form, this is where he resides. This is where he plays.”*  He looked over my shoulder and back at me, with a sad smile on his face.   	*“Now, he’s chosen you as his new playmate. He knows you’re going to take my place. Look at my journal again, look at the drawings, you’ll need to remember.”*

He turned to walk away, leaving me feeling completely helpless in my own lucid dream.  	

*“Oh and Rami...don’t turn around.”*

I didn’t, but my entire being was willing me to. It’s that same feeling of anxiety you get when you’re home alone at night and you have the feeling something is watching you. A crushing, horrifying feeling. I woke up in a cold sweat and did as he said, I looked over the journal and in addition to scanning the drawings, I found a theory Milo had documented in between the pages of his journal; 	

*“An idea is manifested through suggestive stories and cultural signifiers, we can plant ourselves, a character or a concept into our subconscious and our dreams with enough hints both subversive and subliminal. An idea, be it malicious or noble, can grow and manifest in one mind before being shared to the masses through any kind of information supplement.”*  

The second section detailed a supporting theory;  	

*“Within every story told, fictitious or semi-biographical, exists a universe that we have created that is as real as our own. For how can we truly know if our reality is more valid than the one we have created? How can we truly know we have not just been added into a story of our own by a neutral writer we know as “god”? This reality is as malleable and relevant as the one within which we dream. Our dream world or “coma world” it can be argued, are the realities and our concept of reality is but a dream in itself that our brain creates to escape the chaos, uncertainty and pain of our dreams.”*

You’re probably painting a very good picture of what is happening right now.

I’ve attached an image of the man in this story and i’m sure you’re all familiar with him.  If you are, you’ll understand why i’ve done this.  Why i've made you aware.	There is no Ramiel, that name is a subliminal plant in itself, it means “Dreamer” in Arabic. I described him perfectly for you as a defence mechanism against what is going to happen in the coming weeks, months and years. I gave you plenty of physical aspects for your brain to put together, you only know a basic layer of who he is so that your brain can put in the key elements which will make you trust him. 

You know, it's funny, but I found out what Milo meant by ""Dream"", it's an acronym. 

""**D**ream **R**ami **E**vil **A**lways **M**anifests.""

That's where I got the idea for Rami.

He exists now to help fight off *“him”*.  Because now you’ve read this, read my experience and Milo’s, you're aware on a subconscious level...and he needs new playmates.

 This is no warning, that implies you can do something to change it. You can’t, your dreams are his playground, not yours.  	

You can shrug this off as another horror short if you like, if that makes you feel better and sleep easier. But he doesn’t just strike the night you fall asleep, he strikes when you allow your dreams to become more open and easier to mould. He only enters when the reality is in flux.  But with Ramiel in your head now too, you have a guide, a protector, to help you.  I didn’t. 

At least Milo is at peace, hopefully I will be soon too. I've been putting off sleep for days, I can't keep doing it much longer.  

 I’m beginning to feel drowsy, I took a large amount of sleeping pills before writing this last section, I can’t put off sleeping forever. I don’t know whether i’m going to wake up or not, but at least you’ve all been warned about him. Feel free to reverse google image search the hosted image, learn about him and if you do feel a sense of familiarity, please be careful.

Dream of Ramiel, you will be safe. 

I wish you all the best, you might not know my name or my face, but do not forget my story.  I will do my best to answer any of your questions in the comments later. 

Do not forget about him. 

Because believe me, he won’t forget about you when you fall asleep.

The worst thing about all this? I'm not sure ""he"" stays in the dream world anymore. When Milo looked at me, I think I mistook his expression and his gesture. At the time, I thought he was crying and happy, stretching his hand out to shake my hand.

 Now, I think he was terrified to see his worst fears manifested in the real world and he was stretching his hand out to stop ""him"" getting to me in the real world. 

Why say this now? Well, i've been getting steadily drowsier, and I've felt something breathing down my neck for the last 20 minutes. 

Who knows, maybe it's just my paranoia... 

Sweet dreams.

afewsmallrepairs,11,,49,1rff0q,,185,"There's always some chipper real estate agent waiting at the door with her flyers and her too-big smile and her nails painted to match her pants-suit.  They're nosy, and smothering, but today I see that this one is busy with a bright young couple, pointing out how much eastern light the kitchen gets with one perfectly-lacquered finger, the same goddamn shade of melon-red as her smart little blazer.  I still take a flyer from the cheery wicker basket in the front hallway, out of politeness more than anything.

The house smells like cookies.  It's an old realtor trick; make someone think that they could be happy in this strange new place, picture yourself cozied up on the couch with a plate of fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies and a mug of hot cocoa and suddenly the price doesn't seem quite so steep.  People want to feel like they're home.

It's a candle, I think.  Smells sour-sweet and artificial.

I realize suddenly I've been standing alone in the foyer for a few minutes, staring aimlessly into the house.  Where to begin?  The living room, I guess.

There's a big ugly faux-leather couch along one wall.  The cheap kind you find at Big Lots.  It doesn't serve much except to fill up the space.  It's flanked by two particle board end tables, little doilies on top of these.  Miss Melon-Red Blazer doesn't have much of a sense of style if this is her handiwork.  The room looks like a scene straight out of a 1980s Sears catalog.  I can feel one of my headaches coming on like the low rumbling of summer thunder on the horizon.

There are little dimples on the walls, paint covering old nail holes left behind from family photos that once hung there.  Scenes of summer vacations, children playing, smiling happy faces.  You only put up pictures if the people in them are smiling, right?

Well, the realtor hasn't put up any pictures.  The room feels empty, skeletal without them.

I move into the bathroom.  Nothing special here, more mementos from Walmart in the form of a seashell-shaped soap dish and a tacky plastic shower curtain, but I've found the cookie-scented candle so I blow it out with deep sense of satisfaction.

There are two bedrooms.  One at each end of the hall.  I choose the one to my right, feeling faintly like Alice in Wonderland as the real estate agent babbles away in the sunny kitchen's eastern light.

It's a small bedroom.  The baseboards look brand new even though the house is several decades old; whoever replaced them was an amateur.  This looks like a shitty piecemeal job done by someone without nearly enough time or care.  It's a shame, is what it is.  This would all have to be redone.

They've set up this room as a home office but it should be the children's bedroom.  Where the thrift-store desk and bookshelf sit I can picture two tiny pink beds with matching flowery comforters, sweet shiny stickers placed haphazardly across each headboard as little girls sometimes do.

The headache is no longer approaching, it's *here,* spidery sensations of dull pain spreading across my brain.  I tap my knuckles against the space between my eyes but it holds fast.

Focus.  I brace myself against the doorframe and there it is, the telltale trace of someone's childhood, tiny little tic-marks carved in the wood to indicate height and its progression through time.  I run my fingertips along these marks, still so visible through the fresh coat of paint.  It even looks like someone tried to sand them off -- who would *do* something like that?  Who would try to erase the remnants of someone's *life?*

If I don't leave I might faint, all the blood is in my head with the headache so I do leave, I move down the hall to the other room.

This one is the master bedroom.  Looks like they couldn't afford a bed to properly stage the scene, so this one feels even emptier than the den.  The walls have been repainted, a cheerful robin's-egg blue, but it's wrong.  It's all wrong.

They did a fantastic job covering any sign of the fire but this color, I *hate* this color, it clashes with my bedspread and I would've never slept here beneath this hideous shade of blue -- though there were many nights I suppose I didn't sleep, I lay awake for hours trying to comprehend what had gone wrong, where he was and why he thought he could fool me.

I drop to a knee to touch the outlet in the wall.  It's new, of course, they would've had to replace it.  Faulty wiring that causes fires, well, that just wouldn't do.  When the bank takes a house it can't sell one with such a serious problem.  Sometimes things need to be replaced, resold.  A “fixer-upper”, that’s what they’d call it.

The headache is in full force now yet a small smile tugs at the corner of my mouth when I remember everything he'd promised to do to this damned house, all the little projects he swore up and down he'd finish someday to make this place perfect for me, things that went forgotten when he decided his energy would be better spent fucking any secretary at the office that looked his way.

It wasn't hard.  I went to the library two counties over and did research on arson.  I was careful, used the private browser on Google Chrome and still cleared the history, wore a wig.  I'd seen enough about Casey Anthony to know how careful you have to be, even if she *did* get off -- but no one will ever truly believe she was innocent, she'll be a pariah forever and that's simply not how I planned to live the rest of my life.

I'm really sorry about the children.  My daughters.  I truly am.  I didn't know they'd be in our bed that night.  They were supposed to be at a friend's house but they came home early, someone had pulled someone else's hair and that set everything off like a line of terrible fateful dominoes and the headaches were getting worse and it was probably all for the best anyway.  I didn't do anything that couldn't be fixed with a few small repairs, both to the house and my life.

It makes me so *angry.*  He was still acting like father of the year when every night for months he slipped under the sheets beside me, reeking of some other woman's sex?  He couldn't even bother to take a shower and rinse the stink off his dick but he was still being a model dad, letting our daughters snuggle next to him when the boogeyman came in the dark and mommy wasn't there because she was away at her own mommy's, the perfect alibi for when the police came to tell her I'm sorry ma'am, there's been an accident, could you please come with us?

I'm still crouched next to the outlet when I hear Miss Melon-Red Blazer behind me, inquiring politely if there's anything she can help me with.  The bright young couple has gone and it smells like she's relit the candle in the bathroom.

I straighten, tucking a strand of the long blonde wig behind my ear and smiling in the way that makes members of the service industry smile back at me.

I explain I'm just looking.  The price on the house is so *low,* though, what could possibly cause such a dramatic drop in this recovering economy?

The real estate agent's smile falters and she hesitates.  I know she's bound by law to tell me, to explain what happened here and why the pricetag on a little creampuff in a nice neighborhood is next to nothing.

I know the old saying about returning to the scene of the crime, how dangerous it is and how not careful I'm being right now, but something in me can't resist because I can still see the little matching beds, the stickers across the headboards and the tic-marks on the doorframe and something inside me *needs* to hear her say it, to quantify each and every step I took to get here.

""Well,"" she says slowly, ""about a year ago, there was a fire...""

I nod and smile and as she tells me my story in her own words and somewhere in the back of my skull the headache lets go, the pain in my brain dissipating at last, leaving behind just me and the real estate agent in my old bedroom, standing in the same place where about a year ago my plan went into motion and I set my husband and children aflame.

lynzo,20,,67,1r79t5,,179,"Through years of failed attempts to have my own kids, I yearned for children of my own, well, used to. 

I would travel for hours just to baby-sit my nephews while Helen (my sister) goes for their fortnightly romantic dinners to ""keep the flames of passion going"", in her words.

Playgrounds and parks were my favourite hunts. Toddlers old enough to walk would sometimes totter their way to the bench I'm sitting on just to smile at me. Young children would come up to me and play 'pretend' with me. It's quite a strange phenomenon, but without my trying to, children takes a liking to me. Of course, I'd gotten strange looks from parents, as though I dangled a carrot in front of their children's noses to lure them to me. There were carrots, but just not fr.

I met my BF, Luke, (now husband) some years ago. In the beginning stages of courtship, he would just look at me and smile, and I just thought he was just smitten with me. He's gotten me smitten quickly enough too, with his honeyed tongue. He always seem to know the right things to say. He'd still continue to look at me, and then just smile.

It was only some months into our relationship that I found out he could see spirits. His childhood was shaky when he first realised no one else saw the paler beings. He had since gotten used to them as they would either wander aimlessly or just stay rooted to a spot. Apart from seemingly looking at him, they don't try to communicate with him.

One day, a few months after finding out about his ability, he told me he has something to tell me. For one, he isn't the secretive or romantic type so I guessed it wasn't to propose. He held my hands and looked at me straight in the eye, and said, ""Umm... How should I put this..."" After a few false starts, impatient me started losing my cool and he finally got it out, in the crudest way he could put it (I know I deserved it), 


""You have three little ones following you since the day I met you and that's the reason why I looked your way and smiled at you. I've been wondering, but why are they following you?""


He went on, with a matter-of-factly tone, to explain that the children at the playground were not approaching me, but the little ones following and sometimes playing around me, and that the little ones aren't like the usual spirits he have seen but are much smaller (thus the name ""little ones""). Whenever he just looked and then smiled at me, the little ones were playing with each other and dancing around me. He had never seen other beings interact with one another before. Despite it being a hot day, the chills and the cold in my chest made the weather more bearable.

Before this, I had a failed relationship with a man who loves children as much as I did, but just upped and left, the day after I was discharged from the hospital for my third miscarriage.

horriddaydream,16,,65,1r68c5,,177,"My father always taught me to be kind to everyone.

There was this garbage dump close to my home; I can't say anybody got a thrill out of living closely to the wretched thing, for it stunk all to Hell and the trucks constantly entering and exiting could be an extreme annoyance. I walked on the outskirts of town frequently past midnight, which you may say is stupid, especially if you saw my build and how small of a person I am, and just how difficult it would be for me to protect myself from anyone. 

A few times as I passed by the always-opened gates of the dump, I also passed the man who would enter their limits every single night.

As shady as he was, he had a lot to say.

His name was Terrance and he had been staying in the dump at night ever since it had opened back in 1980. He had long, straggly hair and he claimed that ""this area was just too dry; the job shortage was unbelievable."" He would probably never have his own house. I felt the upmost of pity for him and sometimes I even welcomed him to walk with me. Everybody always seemed to know Terrance. He was like the friendly neighborhood hobo. They would nod to him, wave, give him a few dollars, thank me for being so kind to him even though I would shrug it off and whisper that he was simply good company. 

I asked him where he went during the day and he just said ""everywhere."" He had a huge, black satchel that he slung over his back that probably contained normal homeless materials like paper towels, maybe a few little scraps of food. It always smelled but he smelled in general, though I was too nice to say anything. He claimed that there was a hollowed-out truck near the far side of the garbage dump and he would stay there at night because it was warm, and it was shelter. 

It made me want to cry; just the situation that this poor man was in.

I lived with only my father and so on occasion I would invite Terrance home to have a warm meal, and my father was more than happy about this. He was a kind man as I was a kind young adult, and he completely understood that my heart was in the right place. Terrance knew everything about our family in only a short amount of time and he never once took advantage of us. He was just a man who had no direction after losing his way.

Terrance disappeared for a couple of days. I peered in through the gates of the garbage dump, thinking twice about entering. 

I walked to the back and noticed that there was nobody inside the shell of the truck that he had described to me a many of times. But as I peeked inside the windows, I saw many black satchels just like the one that Terrance was always carrying. Most of them were empty, but others were still shut tightly and looked full. 
I reported the scene.

The cops had found small children of all shapes, sizes, ages, and genders inside the bags. He had been living off of them for years. 

There was a lack of missing children in the area, though some were found to be local. Nobody knew where they had all come from.

He had been inside our house. He had been inside my head.

Now he was nowhere to be found.

horriddaydream,15,,57,1razjr,,151,"A new job with a bad boss with very little pay with customers that I didn't really like. 

That was the make-up of my new job at the bookstore.

We were called ""The Book Chefs"", a little shop on the corner of 6th &amp; Weston Street, whose name I didn't quite understand aside from the fact that, as employees, we were permitted to prance around in these aprons that wore the name of the store, and help customers find the books that they were seeking.

One day as I was stocking the shelves I felt a tug at the back of my apron and I smiled as I whipped around, figuring it was probably one of the other employees attempting to get my attention so they could tell me a funny workplace joke.

There stood a man in front of me, short, hunched, with thick glasses and a balding head - and he appeared to be mentally challenged. ""Hi, Pretty.""

""Uh…"" I caught myself, wondering if I should say hello and ask him what he needed, or respond to his compliment. ""Are you looking for anything in particular, sir?""

""You're pretty,"" he snorted again and then he walked out of the aisle, never taking his eyes off of me. It took a few seconds for me to process the fact that he had walked out of the aisle completely backwards. I watched him walk from aisle to aisle and he watched me, too. A half an hour later and he still hadn't left.

I did what any normal person would do; I told my boss at the back of the store.

The conversation was short and sweet. My boss picked up on the fact that the man was a bit slower, and she reasonably questioned him, ""Are you with somebody, sir?"" He said, ""No, I am by myself"" and she said, ""Are you looking for anything?"" ""No."" ""I'm sorry but you can't stay here all day. If you don't need anything, would you mind leaving?"" 

He crept out of the store, backwards again, and he gave me a wave as he disappeared around the corner. I felt barf in my throat.

That night as I got off of work, my eyes darted all over the back parking lot as I went to fetch my bicycle from the rack. My boss was arranging things inside the building but there were no windows along the back and so suddenly I felt eerily alone. It didn't take long for me to notice that somebody had cut the wires where my bike was located, and it was missing. I groaned and felt the urge to cry. That was a brand new bike and now I had no way home. I immediately panicked and decided that I would have to ask my boss for a ride. She was in the backroom, so I strode over to the door and began to rap on it slowly.

""Janet?"" I asked, hoping she would hear me from inside. Then, louder again. ""Janet!!""

The sound of my bike spokes being kicked could be heard from the woods behind the bookstore. My head jerked around and there stood the man from earlier. 

My heart sank in my stomach.

""Don't come near me.""

He took a few zig-zaggy steps in my direction, holding a small bag out in front of him as he worked his way across from the parking lot. It took him quite a few seconds to get to me from where he had been located and I froze in place as he came within feet of me. 

""I want to show you something,"" he said in his slow, soft voice.

""Please go away.""

He placed his hand inside his brown, leather bag and pulled out a book. Then he pulled out another. He stacked them on the ground next to himself and he nodded toward them. ""I like books.""

I played friendly, afraid he would hurt me if I didn't. ""What series is that?""

""Skin,"" he replied.

He grabbed one of the books off of the pile, and he neared me until he was within such a close distance that I could feel his breath on the front of my face. Then, he shoved the book into my hands.

It was still warm.

It was bound with human skin, stitched with real stitches, still bloody and damp.

My terrorizing screams had scared him away. I'm not sure that they ever found him. 

He had left one of the books in the parking lot in his quick getaway. There were no words written on the pages, but the police suspected that he had been using them as journals.

Odyssey_The_Crip,45,,47,1r4dm5,,150,"Fuck me.
I was told to come here by a friend of mine, having never heard of nosleep. personally I'm not really on board with the idea of having a community of people read my story for personal pleasure, but hey, what ever. 
I guess a little bit of back story is needed here. I live on the nice end of Vancouver city, with my grandmother. I'm in secondary school, and that school is in my general posh-ish neighborhood.  

2 days ago I was Getting home from a long-ass boring day at school, I decided to Fuck around on DayZ until either I died, or fell asleep at the keyboard. At around 11:30 my Dog, Buddy, Decided to be the most annoying little shit possible. So i turned my computer off, and put the little fucker's leash on. At this time of night, the whole block was lights out. I Could barely see 15 feet.
10 minutes of walking later I began to feel a bit paranoid, street light's were flickering, fog was getting thicker. Buddy, on the other hand, was  trotting along rubbing his little schnauzer face in the frosted grass. 
Then, he stopped. Dead in his tracks, then buried his head in my calves. I urged him to keep moving, and after much encouragement he reluctantly followed.
I rounded a corner, going back toward my place, when i spotted a figure in the fog, a big one. Thinking nothing of the fact, just someone else enjoying the fucking weather or something. 
As we got closer buddy started barking, crazily. I urged him to shut up, lest he wake the neighbors. 
Then I got a good look at the figure. It was a man, 6'7 about, pale, He had a brown tweed waist coat, a brown tweed fedora and some brown baggy suit pants. 

As we neared him Buddy grew more and more frantic.
That's when I noticed his smile. The scariest fucking smile you will ever see. He looked like he won the lottery, got laid and inherited a mansion within a period of 2 minutes. It stretched from ear to ear, a yellowed, fake smile.
God, i wish i could have unseen it.
I was within about 3 feet of him, then the smell hit me, It was a mix between pure decay, shit, aged cheese. 

Then, he stopped right in front of me. and said in the most strange voice, like an elderly man trying to be smooth.

""You have a cute dog there, boy.""

""Uh, yeah, thanks.""
I guess something in my voice must have pleased him. or something, cause he chuckled a sick, smokers laugh. I began to move away from him breaking eye contact. Looking back on it, I should have just fucking ran.

He grabbed my arm

""Do you want to see my dog?""
I looked down, and i realized he had a leash too. He yanked on it, and trailing blood, Came the corpse of a maggot riddled dog.
I threw up in my mouth, This thing that was once a dog was missing patches of white fur, it's skin was turning green, bits of skin were missing, it's ear was ripped and an eye was gone. I couldn't even tell what the dog's fucking breed was.

Through his smiling teeth he said.

""Pet the dog""

My dog was oddly quite this whole time,i missed his barking.
I tried to get away, he tightened his grip on my arm then he dug his finger nails into me.

""Pet the dog""

""Please, No"" was all that came out of my mouth.
His smile drained instantly. Into an angry twisted frown, teeth still showing. 

""PET THE FUCKING DOG"" He screamed. yellow spittle flying from his mouth. my arm was turning red from the irritation his brown fingernails were causing me.
I had no choice but to pet the dog. I reached down slowly and ran my free hand along its back. The fur and skin began to peel back as maggots crawled along my palm. My hand was covered in a clear, slimy film. 
He let go of my arm, then shoved me. I landed flat on my ass on the pavement, Then i took off running. My dog was sprinting along with me. Then i heard him laugh, then scream.

""NOW I WANT TO PET YOUR DOG.""

My blood went cold.

I heard pounding on the pavement behind me, and a dragging. 
He was coming after me, pulling his dog along with him. Running 2 straight blocks, i ran down my alleyway, my house was at the end of the block. I flew down the alley, still hearing his laughter and slamming footsteps behind me. I got to my house, ran up the stairs and fumbled for my house keys. As His laughter grew in volume to an unbearable height, i got the door open shoved my dog in then slammed it, and locked it. not even a full second after I locked the door, there was a slam on it. 

He had ran into the door. 

This slamming continued for 20 minutes and then, silence. I waited 5 minutes then called the cops. in less than 10 minutes, they were here. I told them exactly that what happened, they told me they'd book the guy. Until then they told me not to leave the house.

not 5 minutes after they left, i was asleep on the couch with my dog.
I was awoken to the sound of a door bell ringing. I practically jumped off the couch, ran into the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife, and went to the door. thinking to myself, 

""I'm gonna kill this bastard.""

I Flung open the door knife in stabbing motion.
No one was there, Nobody.
Then I looked down, And threw up. 
The fucking dog corpse was sitting there, in a pool of blood.
Nailed into the dog's head was a note

""I don't like it when they run.""

Right now I'm sitting in my house, With no one but my grandmother, who is too sickly to get out of bed. My parents and my little brother are out of town at a dude ranch in the interior of the province. 
Fuck dammit.

EDIT: I'm sorry if there's any spelling mistakes, grammar errors, or punctuation issues. I'm shaking right now

UPDATE: He was standing outside my window today. just standing there, unblinking. i was frozen, and a minute after still eye contact, his head started violently shaking. Like only that part was having a seizure. I ran to grab my camera and he was gone. That spasm his head was having, paired with the smile. was utterly terrifying.

acidmutt,40,,38,1r1qip,,136,"I have a problem and a fear, I fear I am not from here or am even human. 


Ill start with the basics and excuse me for spelling mishaps for I am writing this out via mobile device. I am supposedly a eighteen year old female. Currently living in Canada, although I hail from Debrecen, Hungary. I moved to Canada when I was ten years old. For as long as I can remember I have questioned what I am. Certain signs have always been there. I feel things I'm sure others do but most don't, I see things and I talk to things. 


First weird occurrence, I do not remember life in Hungary at all. I only remember from the age of ten and up. It feels like I've only been alive for eight years. Second I don't know where my parents are. I lived with a woman named Tina and a man named Marco since I moved to Canada up until I moved out a couple months ago. They tell me they adopted me, and that my Hungarian parents went missing and were never found. 


I feel cold all the fucking time. My feet and hands always feel like ice blocks, to the point where my boyfriend can't take the chills he gets when I put my hands around him at night. In the summer even on the hottest days I am always wearing a sweater and avoiding the shade. I love the sunshine. In the winter months it is ten times worse. I can feel my bones aching from being so cold. 


I can't swim, I float but I can't swim or ride a bike. People are either left handed or right handed, I am niether. I can't write worth shit with either of my hands. I try to only eat food I don't have to use silverware for. 


A polar bear follows me. I see him everywhere I go, tried to touch him once but he disintegrated into the air. I see dark figures that roam the streets at night, I see people in my mirrors that aren't there when I look behind me. I've gotten so used to seeing things I'm not even scared anymore. A few have spoken to me, they mainly ask for help. I helped one once but he burned me. 


I feel pain, and I bleed though. I pass out when I hold my breath, I have emotions. I look normal I think. Sorry for the male readers, I don't bleed once a month like I'm supposed to. I don't even have the organs I am supposed to, to reproduce. I have baffled x-ray techs and doctors everywhere. 


My dog not only hears me but he understands what I am saying. He can do all his tricks without hand motions, just my voice. No big? When my boyfriend tries to get him to do a trick just by speaking to him he doesn't know what to do until my boyfriend gestures along with the words. Tina and Marco tell me Oz (my dog) has been with me since and during Hungary. 


I've gone a week without food before I started feeling light headed all the time and gained hunger pains. I didn't lose any weight, I never do. And I never gain any. My teeth were so sharp they used to cut into my cheeks and cause discomfort, but last year the dentist filed them down for me. Baffled. 


I don't think I can see as well as a cat can in the dark but deffintly better then most other people. I've never had friends, people have always avoided me or left me out of activities. 


Tina is a ethologist and Marco is a paleontologist as their professions, why can't I remember.

Sleepwalking_t,34,,55,1r7w1t,,131,"I have been having sleeping problems for about 6 months now. I have troubles falling asleep and staying asleep. I also have issues with sleep walking, serious sleep walking issues. I live in a dorm, on the first floor, and right outside my dorm across the street is the smoke pit for my area. I once woke up sitting at the smoke pit in my pajamas sitting on the picnic table with my elbows on my knees, face in hands.

 
Please, hear me out, I know this doesn't seem supernatural, but I'm terrified and I don't know who to tell. I am going to continue with my sleep walking issues. 
I will not get into specifics on where I was but let's just say I was not in an area you would want to walk around alone at night. It was a community sleeping area, massive tent and I woke up sore, bruised, and covered in dirt. I figured I must have slept walked outside and fallen down. I have woken up standing in the middle of my dorm room, woken up sitting up right on my couch when I had fallen asleep in my bed. 


A few months ago I could not sleep for 2 days straight; no sleeping aids or cold medicine would work. Frustrated, I finally made a doctors appointment for my sleeping problems. I left out my sleep walking because I could loose my job if they knew I slept walked, and was prescribed Ambein. 
The first night on Ambein I still had troubles getting to sleep but they finally kicked in after an hour or so laying in bed. I woke up refreshed but a bit groggy, and got dressed for work. 


The next night on Ambein the pills kicked in quickly and I had , what I thought , to be a deep dreamless sleep. When I got into work my co worker laughingly asked me what the hell I called him for last night. 


"" What are you talking about?"" 


"" You called me last night, crying hysterically."" 


""What?!""


"" Yeah... I was about to get dressed and come over to check on you. You said , ' It's here Myke, it's here!'. Then you started snoring sooo... yeah figured you were just dreaming...""


Completely bewildered I apologized. I checked my call history and sure as shit, I had called him at 0447. 


Strange. I just played it off as a side effect of the Ambein. 
A few weeks went by and nothing else strange happened. I continued to take the Ambein. 


Sometime during the work day I went to show another co worker a funny picture I had saved on my phone when I noticed I had a lot of black photos on my camera roll. I selected the first one and it was my  dark room lit up from the flash. The next one of a different part of my room again lit up by the flash. This went on for 12 different photos: different parts of my room, dark, lit up from the flash. I downloaded an app so I could see the time stamp from the photos. I was definitely asleep; great, sleep me was taking pictures in my sleep.

 
I have started waking up with bruises, cuts, and feeling sore for no particular reason. 


I was staying the night at my guy's house and he told me the next morning  I sat up out of bed and asked him: 


""Do you see it?"" 


""See what?""

 
Silence from me, then I laid back down.

 
He jokingly told me that was the last night he would sleep with me. We laughed but I felt terrible creeping the hell out of the poor guy. 


It's escalating, Ive started seeing things when I'm awake. I see a black form walking into my bathroom while I'm getting ready in the morning. I ignore it, there is no way in hell I'm going to investigate that. Things disappear from my room then show up in the same spot days later. 


I don't know what to do. Please, if you have any advice I'm willing to try anything.

Magnum6,33,,77,1r5par,,129,"Born in the mid 90s, i grew up active, and was outdoors alot. However, as the technological age began, I found myself inside more and more. As I grew, i spent more and more time watching T.V., playing videogames on my Super Nintendo. And when the Sony Playstation came out, my parents couldnt pry me from the screen. As a consequence, my eyesight suffered. Slowly at first, but as i got older, it became an issue. It was never so bad that I couldn't see without glasses, but it was bad enough that i needed them to drive when i turned 17. However, as senior in high school i quickly lost my glasses and proceeded to drive anyways. No wrecks, no tickets. I thought that maybe my eyesight had improved over the few months that i had actually worn my glasses. Oh how I wish I had been right. Halfway between being 19 and 20, i picked up a job as a delivery driver. Easy at first. Until i had to start driving at night. The night I almost ran off the road because I couldn't see through the oncoming cars headlights, was the night I knew I had to get a new pair of glasses. The next day I made an appointment, and 7 - 10 business days later i had my new glasses. Nothing special. Just a simple blue metal frame with slightly skinnier than average lenses. I Wore them all day. And whenever someone asked how it felt to have new glasses, i smiled and would comically sing ""It's a whole new world"", you know, that cute little song from The Little Mermaid. Oh how right i was. As I prepared for bed that night, getting changed, taking a shower. It all seemed normal. Until I wore my glasses into my darkened bedroom. No light was on in my room. And i had foolishly turned off the hallway light before entering my bedroom. Now in total darkness, I realized just what real fear was. You see, with my slightly blurred vision of not wearing glasses, any shadow could be brushed off, simply because i couldn't focus and see what was just beyond the outer veil of darkness that covered them. But now, with those infernal glasses. I could see them clear as day. The creatures from monster stories. My own personal Boogiemen. All sitting around my room watching, waiting, inviting me to lay down and fall asleep right in their midst. Right in my own bed. I stood stunned. Terrified. Not Knowing what to do. When suddenly, one of them spoke. The most terrifying voice I had ever heard. ""Why not run away again child? It amuses us to watch you at night, oblivious to our very existence. Unaware that you lay right where we want you. Each and every night."" I stared blankly, and felt confused. Again? How could i have seen these creatures before and not remember it. Surely I would have some memory. But none came. As if to answer my question, it spoke again. ""Perhaps these will jog your memory."" It brought up its gnarled hand and un-clenched its fist, palm up, to reveal my original pair of glasses. A pair now almost three years old. That's when it hit me. I hadn't lost my glasses. But thrown them away. Into a river. Nearly twenty miles from where i lived. Now more afraid than anything, I did the only thing I could, I laid down in my bed. Removed my glasses, and watched as those terrible Boogiemen, again returned into those empty, featureless shadows, that surround each and every one of us every night as we lay down to sleep.",Glasses,206,nosleep
Dusteratops,14,,29,1r8rf4,,125,"It was a long day of work, and my face was covered in oil and grease of all sorts. I suppose I looked like a coal miner or a hobo as I walked down the road. It was evening, so the crowd wasn't too large. There were groups of ladies, making their way home and spouting the latest gossip. There were solitary people making their way with their head down and their ears plugged in. There was a peculiar man walking adjacent to me with the strangest clothes and a mullet. He wore a robe with a sweater tied around his waste. Then there was Rachel, ahead in the distance. She was my ex-girlfriend who didn't know how to cope with seeing me, so it always turned out extremely awkward. I immediately turned around and talked to the first man I could start a conversation with, who just happened to be the man in the robe. 

""Hey.""

""Hey..""

""Whats up."" 

""Just walking around. So you like to read?"" He spoke in the thickest accent, and I couldn't figure out exactly what is was.

I was carrying a book, and I do like to read. ""I suppose so, I want to be a writer."" I replied, and then we jumped into the thickest conversation about all of our favorite books and the way the world works. He was able to question all of my ideas, and had a detailed answer for each and every one of my questions. Its safe to say I learned a lot from him. 

When Rachel walked by, she simply waved and smiled. I nodded back, but I couldn't help but notice that she felt like something was funny. It must have been the dirtiness of my face though this weird secret humor just continued to resonate off the face of every passerby. It was unsettling.

Mid conversation he asked me what my name was, without even breaking from the previous sentence. I told him my name and reached out my hand to shake. He left me hanging and slammed his palm into his chest and proudly proclaimed ""I am Moko."" 

Then we jumped right back into our conversation, which went on for quite some time. The sky became dark, and we were the only people in the road. I asked him where he was from and he never told me. 

A large chunk of our conversation was about sanity, and the works of the insane. He seemed to know everything about them, and it was unsettling the way his knowing black eyes drilled into my soul. Yet I learned and thought and learned some more. 

He pulled out a napkin and refused the pen that I offered him. He wrote down my number after searching for his marker for about a minute. He promised to give me a call when he got home, for he did not have a cellular. Then we went our separate ways. Oddly though, he went back the way he came. 

There were two girls laughing when we split apart, and I figured it was because of the thick accent my new friend had when he yelled his farewell. 

""He has a funny accent, doesn't he?"" I asked the two girls.

They responded by looking at each other and laughing to some secret joke, then one of them said, ""Who does?""

""You know, that man with the mullet I was just talking to.."" they gave each other another look, but it was without humor. The skin on my neck began to stand on end. They walked away.

I know he has a loud voice. I know they heard and saw him leave. I know I am not crazy. I know- My phone rang. I answered.

""Hey Brian, its Moko. I was thinking I'd come visit you this Christmas. See you then.""

She found some sick bastard on craigslist to murder her unborn child because she could not afford an abortion and she knew she couldn't do it herself. 

She snuck into a decrepit old house where she had arranged the meeting. She walked into a pitch black room where someone placed a bag over her head. He said something about not wanting to know each other's identities.

She wondered why someone would want to do this, and finally worked up the courage to ask. 

""I don't know... It soothes me. Knowing that I'm saving a child from facing this shit sack of a world. No one should have to suffer this hell hole.""

She didn't really know what to say so she just stayed silent.

Before I go to bed, I turn on my laptop by my bedside table, run any pending downloads I still have, open Banshee (my music player), press play and leave it as I drift off to sleep. At times I would wake up, groggy and sensitive to the sound so I would stop the music and go back to sleep. Two nights ago however, what I woke up to was not music. Instead it was the voice of my mother. Telling me something with the sweetest motherly voice I have long been familiar with.

Was I afraid if hearing her voice? Of course not! Everyone at home longed to hear her again. Everyone at home longed so much to see her again.

___________________________________________________________________________________

Sunday night, maybe 2am.

I had just shut down my computer after my nightly gaming session.  I was laying in bed, browsing reddit on my phone, and debating whether or not I was hungry enough to eat another can of spaghettio's, or if it would even be worth the trouble of walking downstairs and waiting for it to heat up. I'm not sure what made me notice it, what actually snapped my senses to the realization...but it was suddenly too **quiet**.

Granted it was 2am, so its not like I was expecting any sort of noise in particular.  My roommate had fallen asleep hours ago, but it was just so *still*.  I'm not sure if any of you know what I'm talking about, but it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  I felt like I was in a vacuum; it was utterly oppressive. 

I'm not sure how long I sat there, waiting for something, before the glow.  A deep blood red light had flooded the hall and oozed under my door, and it was slowly pulsing.  I wanted to call out, to tell my roommate to fuck off, but I knew it wasn't him. I just knew. I don't think I could've formed words if I tried.  The vacuum sensation I had felt was gone, and now, sitting in my tiny bedroom I felt like I was under a microscope. That terrible “like you're being watched” sensation I read about so much hit me like a brick.  I can't explain how exactly I felt, a mix of horror, dread, and confusion.  I wanted to bolt, but I wouldn't have been able to force myself to open that door if I tried.

I managed to shuffle off my bed, and to the floor.  I opened up my nightstand, reaching for my revolver. I needed to feel that cold steel, and the heft of it in my hand. As soon as I picked it up, I was at a loss because for the first time, it just felt like a toy in my hand. I looked back to the door to that glow, and felt completely powerless.  There was a shadow now, someone was standing outside my bedroom door, and I felt like I might as well have been holding a nerf gun.  

When the long scratch started, I felt nauseous.  Like I was 17 again, smoking weed in my room when I thought I had the house to myself and my mom knocked on the door asking why the fuck it smelled like burning leaves in the hall. That sudden weight in my stomach, the sudden dryness in my mouth.

It was like a nail being dragged down the door, from the top of the doorway to the bottom.  I followed the sound with my eyes, and when it stopped, I heard a voice.  “Hear” might not be the right word, because it came from inside my head.

*Michael. Please put down the weapon.  We do not want to harm you, and I do not plan on doing so. Your weapon would be useless anyways, but I respect your autonomy. May I enter?*

This had to be a dream; a nightmare. If every waking moment since I...heard that voice hasn't been an eternity in a waking hell, I might be able to convince myself that it was.

*I wish to speak with you, Michael. We have much to discuss. May I enter?*

There was no fucking way this was happening.  I'm...lucky I didn't need to, because I couldn't have spoken if I tried.  Whatever it was must have known there was no way I would have let it in, because it answered me anyways.

*No matter, you will see us in due time.  We would like to invite you on a journey, Michael.  You will come with us, and see everything you have always wished to. We've known you for a long time, you would say “years”.  You have a week to decide, we will not force you. You will require no luggage, no currency. You will want for nothing.  You will not see your family or friends again, but in time you will cease to worry about them.*  

 *We respect your decisions. I do think however, you only have one real choice.  I will see you soon.*

__________________________________________________________________________________

Then it was all just over...I might have sat there for hours. At some point, I got up and sat on my bed.  When I finally mustered the courage to look out the window, it was already dawn. When I heard my roommate get up and go to work, and finally figured it was safe to open my door.

I am a shell.  I don't know what to do you guys.  I haven't slept. I forced myself to eat something yesterday, but everything tastes of cardboard.  I booted up my computer, but now my *life* just feels like a game I'm sick of. 

I forced myself to talk to my parents the other day, and smile at work, but any interaction I have feels forced and artificial...like I'm just going through the motions. There was no way I could mention what happened Sunday night to anyone. 

He was right...I have only have one choice.  If I don't go with him...with *them*, I'll be trapped in this empty hell. My life feels like a hamster in a cage.

Who the fuck knows what will happen if I **do** go with them...?

kimmiekissies,13,,30,1rgt5c,,119,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before????????? Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out, and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her. I'm kind freaked out now, I'll admit it. [Here it is](http://soundcloud.com/user165636719/a0ynmqy5tete/s-jECMW)",UPDATE!!! Need some advice.

ephique,32,,31,1r5tqd,,93,"Me and my brother were spending some quality time playing old video games from our childhood, just chilling on the couch in my upstairs bedroom when the electricity in the entire house went out. It was just us two home at this point, and it was pitch black outside. In desperation of finding our way through the house we used our phones to take flash-shots, giving us a small update of where in the big upstairs level of the house we were; trying to make our way to the staircase leading down.

We finally did, and from there it wasn't ridiculously hard to manage ourselves to find some candles and what not. We did what we could to drain out the time while waiting out the electricity-problem. Eating sausage rolls, gossiping and having conversations about what games to play once the electricity was back.

It did come back after a couple of hours. We already found ourselves in the kitchen, positioned in the lower level of the house so we brought some snacks and drinks before we inevitably decided to continue our journeys into Donkey Kong: Country, Super Mario World and Castlevania 4 on the Super Nintendo.

Upon starting our Super Nintendo my brother asked me where the remote for the tv was, since we both were too lazy to actually use the power button on the tv. Although the remote was nowhere to be found. While looking for the remote, which we both swore has never been anywhere else than on the coffee-table next to the couch, the electricity ran out again.

My brother expressed as he sighed: ""Oh come on, are you kidding me?"" Being slightly more prepared the second time, we picked up our phones and started taking flash-shots again. After a couple of shots the memory on my phone ran out. I never thought we had taken that many pictures. Either way I entered my image library on my phone to delete the old photos from the first time the electricity went out. I took a good look at the first picture I opened, it was my brother walking ahead of me, just before we reached the stairs. There was a man standing just next to him in the picture.",Where is the remote?,124,nosleep

Where do I begin? I started working volunteer shifts at my local community centre about 6 months ago. I love my job, I get on well with all my co-workers, but something's been bothering me recently. More than bothering me, actually. 

There's been an attack on a child. 

Well - I can't call it an attack, exactly. Everyone's calling it an accident, but I can't believe that. 

Let me start over. This whole thing began when the centre began to hold saturday clubs - an hour or two, every weekend, when kids are given pretty much free reign over the place. We put on activities - cake baking, crafts, that kind of thing - and just generally keep an eye on the place.

We're also there to keep the kids out of the basement. I'd like to say before I start that I've never heard of anything being up with the basement before. I'm not a particularly superstitious person (or at least, I wasn't before all of this happened) and I don't scare easy. 

Basically, the kids have to stay out of the basement because there's a lot of junk down there that could topple over onto one of them, or otherwise get them in trouble. Just to reiterate, this is the only reason I was ever given for keeping them out of the basement.

But kids aren't satisfied by a simple 'it's dangerous down there'. They wanted to know *why*. 

Well, I spun them this cock and bull story about how I'd seen a monster down there once. The other volunteer that day, Julie, joined in on the fun immediately, and soon we had them all believing that there was something dark and horrible in the basement that would snatch them up and eat them if they ever went down there. We're talking about 5-10 year olds here, so the stories weren't particularly gory or scary - but they believed us pretty much right off the bat. 

Maybe that's why things went so weird. I'm sure those of you who've been around children know that they see the world in a different way to the rest of us - what seems to us like childish fantasy might as well be real life to them. 

Anyway. I told them that story three or four weeks before the incident. Every Saturday we'd have these kids in, and every Saturday the veteran members of the group would take on the duty of informing the new members of what horrific fate awaited them should they wander into the basement. With each telling, they'd add details. Some of them were actually very grim - they came up with one about a 'Victorian boy'  (bearing in mind that the community centre was only built in 1954) that had been eaten by the monster and still roamed the halls, crying out to go home. The details got more and more gory - they came up with the idea that the monster would 'mark' its victims with three slashes of its horrendous glistening claws - this was the same week we were showing the Zorro movies on the old projector. 

In short, it was beginning to seem as though 'Saturday Club' had turned into 'NoSleep Junior'. We had complaints from parents about their children being too scared to come in, and so my boss decided it was time to put a stop to the monster talk. We tried everything we could to get the kids to stop talking about it - we played non-monstery games with them, we made apple pie, we even passed the caretaker off as a 'professional monster hunter'. That kept them quiet for a while, and we began to hope that they'd lost interest altogether. 

In the meantime though, I began to feel more and more uneasy locking up the centre at night. I had no reason to be afraid - Julie or one of my other co-workers was usually waiting at the front desk for me in case there *was* trouble, and the Zumba fitness group usually hung around outside until we locked up anyway. In short, nobody could get in without one of us noticing. 

I mention that because the night before the attack I could have sworn I heard someone  - a small someone - crying, all through my lockup. It always seemed like the voice was coming from the next corner, but when I looked, there was nobody there. I even got Julie out to have a look - she said she couldn't hear anything, but I could tell she was concerned. Maybe she just wanted to get home early. I don't know. I told the police I hadn't seen anyone for definite, anyway. 

I wasn't working the next day, but that's when the attack happened. I don't know much about the details - the police told me that Julie heard crying and screaming from the basement, and went down to find two of our regulars, Tommy and Rosie, spattered with blood and crying. When she rounded the corner, she discovered a third child - I wasn't told his name, he was new - lying unconscious beneath a shelf. She confided to me later that while she'd told police the shelf must have toppled onto him, it looked more like he'd been hiding beneath it. 

What sent me to you guys, though, is the other thing Julie told me. Her first instinct, being a mother herself, was to pull the child out from under the shelf and make sure he was okay. He didn't have any of the injuries she'd expect in this kind of accident - no broken bones, not even a bruise. Instead, he had three bloody lines carved into his chest. Three large, horrible claw marks. 

When the police asked the other two children what they'd witnessed, they'd only say 'The monster got him'. The Centre is closed until further notice - I think they think there's some sort of psychopath living there. That's the logical explanation, but somehow I can't help questioning it. When I pass by the closed Centre, I swear I can hear a child crying inside - crying to go home. 

The boy is okay, by the way - apparently he's recovering at home, but he won't name his attacker. He'll only say that 'some*thing* got him'. I take a little comfort knowing that he's alright, but how long will it be before something else happens? Something worse? 

I'm afraid, NoSleep - what have I done?

DakotaKim,23,,40,1raxlb,,85,"Before you skip past this: No, this is not a coincidental Doctor Who related post. 

I don't know if I'm the only going through this. I can't stay here long. The quickest way to explain what's happening to me is with a recap of my day(s)? I woke up in my bed as usual, but the second I blinked, I was in the local train station two weeks ago. My clothing changed accordingly. I looked around and people were giving me puzzled looks. I looked in the passing train's glass and saw that I was bleeding from my mouth and eyes. 

I blinked.

I was in my childhood home, watching my childhood self enjoy a bowl of cereal. He[?] saw me and ran off terrified. My father, who recently passed, ran into the dining room and shot me in the chest. Pain surged from my chest to my brain.

I blinked.

Due to the stress of the situation, I can't really remember where I've been. I just remember fear and pain.

I don't know what's going on, but when I blink, I get ripped from where I am and I open my eyes to a new setting.

Right now, I'm trying my absolute hardest to not blink. I'm at a Best Buy on one of the laptops. My eyes are welling up with blood, and I don't think I can do this for long. I don't know what's going to happen to me. If I leave, I will check back when I can, if I can. My memory is slowly fading.

The only thing that I know for certain is that there is a man wherever I go. I can't see his face, but he looks to be in his late sixties carrying a duffle bag. He's here in the store. Watching me with a smile.

I don't know what will happen if I don't open my eyes. If I keep them shut, will this fix itself? I've gone to over a thousand different places today, and I need anyone's help. If you see a man bleeding from his eyes and mouth, it's me. Restrain me and don't let me go.

Do I need to talk to the man?

I don't exactly know where to turn, like the majority of the sub I'm assuming you share the same interest as me in the supernatural, the other side. I've always been intensely fascinated with it, usually the furthest I went was browsing /r/nosleep or heading into abandoned houses to sate my thirst for the creepy, although, the same routine things quickly became dull and eventually, I slowly got desensitized, bored. This was about the time I started reading 'recipes' for paranormal experiences.


The whole thing seemed awesome, the Midnight Man, One Man Hide and Seek, The Shoebox Telephone. All gave me chills, but I remained quietly skeptical the whole time. Fuck. Why did I have to be so blind. I still can't find the place to blame myself, I mean reading scary stories on the internet posted by a bunch of anonymous people, it would be stupid to take it all for fact, right?


Of all the rituals, one caught my eye, The Three Kings. I'm hesitant to post the link but I feel like it would be naive to think that no one would give it a quick search. http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wbo0u/please_dont_actually_try_this/ A blunt explanation of it would be a recipe where you can contact the dead, and ask them questions through two propped up mirrors.


After reading it I felt like I had to do it. I quickly spread it to a few friends and it wasn't long until hype was built upon the whole thing. Me and my best mate (For his sake i'll call him, Darcy), organized to do this when we had a few friends over for a small gathering whilst my parents were out for the week. Funny enough, at the time the thing I was worried the most about was it not working. We had tried a ouija board once at my request, and nothing happened, we all just sat there fingers on the cup for 10 minutes blaming each other for pushing it whenever it moved in the slightest. They all probably thought I was an idiot. So I thought I would give it a kick, my bright idea would be that we would all get absolutely hammered beforehand so that when it (surely) didn't work we would imagine that it did or at least get really scared in the process. Well at least we had the 'really scared' part down pat.


So everyone came at around 9:00pm yesterday, and it was all pretty normal, caught up, bitched about a few people, had some laughs and it wasn't until around 11:00pm that we started to set up. The atmosphere then was so... amusing of all things. We all giggled the whole time in our stupor, acting as if we were kids in primary school kids about to pull a really lame prank. It all seemed fun then. Of course I had to be the one who volunteered to be the one who sat the throne, eager to show my courage off to my friends. My lifeline was Darcy, if anyone was to hold the key between my life and death i'd gladly hand it to him.

For the sake of the story I'll skip all the tedious setting up and get to 3:33am. We were all fighting sleep by then and I think Sarah and Alistair were already gone, though we were sitting outside that door for so long it was hard for us to miss the time. When I had walked in I was immediately hit by the cool air, though this one wasn't the ghostly cold, it was literally fucking freezing from the fan that had been buzzing on for a few hours. Though something did feel off, it was either the fact that I was in a pitch black room holding a candle to my chest with a chair and two mirrors propped up adjacent to it, or it was that all of a sudden everything was quite. As if the world around me was devoid of life bar the constant drone of the fan. 


I sat down clutching the candle tightly, persistent to not let it go out, suddenly very aware to what i was doing. I remember shifting in my chair uncomfortably for a while but what follows that still remains hazy. I remember trying to call out for answers, ""Who's there"" ""What are you doing?"" ""Is there another side?"". None were answered, just silence, and the buzzing of the fan. I then said something stupid and heard giggling, assuming it was my friends outside I started cracking jokes. The more jokes I made the harder they laughed until I said ""Why arn't you responding, too scared to show your faces?"" and looked into the mirrors. Now, the huge cardinal rules of this recipe is not to look in the mirrors and around about this whole thing turned to fucking shit. The worst thing about looking into the mirrors isn't what I saw but rather the absence of it. I saw nothing, i saw the chair, the fan, but no me. I quickly looked to the other, and greeted by the same emptiness. Then the rumbling began, have you ever been in a house when a plane has flown overhead and the ground slightly shakes? It was like that except the sound emanated from the floor rather than the sky. It continued to get louder and louder until my eardrums felt as if they were going to burst and then I peed myself. The mirrors shattered and sent shards of glass everywhere and my candle was quickly snuffed out, and I screamed, boy did I scream, I legged it out of there like nobodies business and slammed the door behind me. Of course everyone was fast asleep but woken up with a few of my screams and sharp kicks to the ribs. They attempted to calm me down but i was flailing and screaming, I told them we had to get out of my house, but where do seven 17 year olds go at 4:00 am in the morning? Eventually I calmed down and tried to pass it off as a drunk hallucination which i knew was very impossible but it made my mind sort of at ease. 

We decided to get everyone up and camp downstairs in the living room. I felt safer with all of them around me and after much apprehension my tired state got the better of me and I drifted off to sleep. Last night was some of the worst nightmares i ever had, I saw my friends hanging and mutilated, I saw my childhood cat lay gutted on the floor, I saw myself smiling at a mirror. When i woke up, i was upstairs in the room. In between both mirrors, which had been shifted to face me lying on the floor. All my friends had left, when i called them they all gave me half ass reasons and some just avoided the question altogether. 


I'm scared. It is now 6:27 and starting to get dark again and I haven't been into the room since I woke up this morning. Help me, please. I don't feel alone in my house anymore.","Please, help. I screwed up.",109,nosleep
TheeMikeG,13,,34,1r8w1k,,83,"Let me introduce myself. My name is Mike Gordan and I exorcise demons for a living. Yeah, work is hard to find, but I get by. I was born into a normal, loving family, but everyone kind of went their separate ways a while ago. I have an older brother who joined the military, and my mother and father are both pilots, so they obviously travel a lot. After I graduated highschool and was in college for a few years I tried my hand at law. But after I failed the LSAT I got pretty down and didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. I dropped out of school and found myself struggling to get a job and even more so struggling to pay rent. 


Then I found Jesus. And by that I mean I was dumpster diving and found a KJV little orange bible inbetween a moldy sandwhich and a spent tube of toothpaste. When I got to the part about the end of the world and that 666 stuff I got interested, really interested. I’d go to the library and do hours upon hours of research. I learned about the Devil’s crossroads and the Grimorium Verum and the Lesser Key of Solomon and demonic sigils and how to summon them. I watched all eight seasons of Supernatural in two months and got a license online to be a priest. With my trusty orange bible in my pocket I scowered Craigslist for people who needed saving.


At first all I found were people that wanted their homes blessed, their babies baptised, or someone to perform a homosexual marriage. But I had a wealth of knowledge of demons and I wanted to do something a lot more meaningful. Then I found her. Her post was desperate. She claimed to be waking up with bruises and in different rooms or even places than where she had fallen asleep. I messaged her explaining that I was a priest who specialized in demon removal and that I would be happy to exorcise her home. For a modest fee of course. 


She replied immediately that she would pay me whatever I wanted, she just wanted to get rid of whatever was doing this to her. When I got to her house I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. No weird smell, no demonic symbols or texts, nothing. And the girl looked fine aside from some minor scratches and bruises. But she cried and cried and begged me to help her. It was pretty awkward because I’d never done this before, but I played confidence and expertise. I had her sit down in one of her wooden kitchen chairs and I bound her arms and legs to it. I took out my bible and began to read from a page I randomly flipped to. 


“All nations whom You have made Shall come and worship before You, O Lord, And shall glorify Your name, For You are great, and do wondrous things; You alone are God.""


And then she started to scream. Not a normal scream though, a deep, dark sounding scream. I dropped the bible. Mustering up my strength, confident in my knowledge, I snapped out of my state of shock and fiddled in my deep pocket for the plastic bottle of holy water I had purchsed online. I splashed some on her face and was horrified. Her face sizzled and burned. I’m talking like third degree. And that smell, my God that smell; like sulfur. By now she was thrashing wildly in the chair. I bent down and quickly retrieved the bible, then started again.


“And He changes the times and the seasons; He removes kings and raises up kings; He gives wisdom to the wise And knowledge to those who have understanding, He reveals deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, And light dwells with Him.” 


By now shit was falling off shelves, furniture was sliding around, the whole shabang. It was awesome. In my element now, and comfortable, I improvised.


“Jesus I ask that you cast out any and all evil spirits in, around or attached to this woman! Lord,  sanctify this follower of your word, and help me to command all demons to leave at once! I bless this woman, and damn you back to hell!” 


Then she vomited and passed out. Everything stopped moving and all was quiet. When she woke up, she had no memory of what had happened but said she felt much better. The color returned to her face and I knew it was gone. After I untied her she went to her purse and handed me a blank check.


Since that day I’ve been performing exorcisms, and I’ve done so many that things have slowed down almost entirely. I haven’t had a job in months, and rent is getting hard to pay again. So, I used my knowledge to make a deal where everyone wins. I’ve actually got a new customer right now. She’s struggling against the straps, but it’s useless. Once I put the demon in her, she’ll pay me anything to take it out.

BensonHedges1,4,,25,1r2xlz,,77,"I heard the coffee pot drip before my alarm even went off, bizarre, I don’t usually set a timer. I like to go to the gym before I have my coffee. Maybe it was my boyfriend being nice. He typically works the graveyard shift, and sometimes he comes home in the early morning to leave nice surprises. 


“Might as well get up” I said aloud to myself, since no one else was home. 


My cat was absent from the bed, which is also weird, he’s usually by my head in the mornings. As I stretch my legs and arms out, I notice an odd chill run up my spine. Surely it was the weather, New England has a way with inconsistent temperatures, and the blanket over me was not quite fit for winter. It’s November, that sixty-degree weather is bound to disappear sooner or later. I haven’t quite figured out the thermostat, we just moved in, and the heat only seems to kick in on times when I’m not home. Must be the reason we bought this place so cheap...and why people keep selling it. New England is not the place to have a busted heating system. This has been the biggest point of arguments since my boyfriend and I started co-habitating. 


“Get out of bed, you’re going to be late to your class…” 


I said this to myself a few times, in hopes to have motivation to get to the 5:15am class at the gym. I had no idea what time it was, but if the coffee pot is going off, it’ was creeping close to sunrise. I haven’t unpacked the alarm clocks yet, so my phone’s been the only thing reminding me what time of the day it is. 


I thrusted my arms to the floor and pulled my phone to my bed — 2:11 am. 


“What the fuck?! I’ve still got two-and-a-half hours of sleep…and why is the coffee pot on?”


I slipped out of the bed from the left side and stumble to the kitchen to turn off the coffee pot. I’m a coffee lover, but nothing smells worse than burnt-coffee. As I went to flip the switch to off, I realize the time isn’t illuminated on the pot. Directly above on the microwave - nothing. Damnit. The power went out! The drip-sound of the coffee pot was so loud, and it was too early. I was confused. I could even smell the lingering scent of fresh brewed coffee…but it was 2am, my mind must be playing tricks on me. 


I headed back to the bedroom, a little freaked out, but convinced it was just all a coincidence. This hallway seems so much longer in the dark, and I still haven’t gotten used to the layout of this condo. As I pass the bathroom, I notice a shadow out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head and didn’t see anything, except the shower curtain pulled all the way open. Since we’ve moved in, we haven’t used that shower…we’ve got a shower stall in the bedroom…much more convenient. Though, I am sure there was a logical explanation for it. 


When I get to the bedroom - another chill down my spine. This was uncomfortable, it was a winter chill I was feeling. I was sure of that. Something was wrong, but i couldn’t figure it out. 

I need to go back to bed.


I hop in the bed and pick the blankets from off the floor. As I turn on my side, I hear the heater click on. The electricity is back on…fantastic! I start counting sheep in my head to fall back asleep, and keep thinking…”how did the blankets end up on the floor?”


What feels like an hour later, my alarm finally goes off. The smell of burnt coffee has filled the condo, and now I’m frustrated. I should have just unplugged the damn thing. And where is my cat? I have most definitely woken up on the wrong side of the bed. I moved to the kitchen to pour some coffee - and it’s dry. Nothing. I must be imagining things. 


That chill again! I could feel the hairs spike up on my neck - absolutely razor sharp. I decided to skip the gym and start my morning. I remained timid, but continued with my normal routine. As I rummaged around the kitchen, I noticed my cat out of the corner of my eye. He was twitchy, and obviously anxious. 


A few years ago my cat had major anxiety problems, and he developed what my vet called - “Rolling Skin Syndrome”. When my cat got anxious, his skin would roll around his body, it looked almost as if he had a small gum ball moving around beneath his fur. Today that ball was most definitely moving.


He paced back and forth around the house with me now, seeming more comfortable now that I was up with him. Every time I moved to another room, he cautiously peeked around the corner, almost as if he was looking for something. We moved to the bathroom, I started to floss, and then I heard it…drip drip drip. I am sure it’s not the coffee pot, and the house starts to smell again. As I analyze my senses the smell become more pungent. Less of a coffee smell and more of a rancid scent. 


Drip drip drip…


I follow the noise, it seems louder now, and it seems like it’s coming from the bedroom. Surely I would have heard it loud and clear when I was in bed earlier…it seemed so distant then. I enter the bedroom, and my cat stopped dead in his tracks. His skin is rolling again and he appeared more on edge, tail straight in the air and it’s hairs following suit. And that chill, of course, it was back. And my sheets and blankets, on the floor again.


WHAT THE FUCK? 


I’m working from home today, and every time I walk by the bedroom, I get the chills. I’ve resorted to closing the door until I’m not alone. It sounds like the wind is blowing up against the windows in that room, but from where I’m sitting, the trees are as still as ever.

TheGroovyTurt1e,12,,22,1raatv,,76,"So I'm not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told, if only for my own piece of mind.  I'm an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously under-served community.  The hospital itself is old, its been standing since the late 1800s, it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium. 
I've never really encountered anything supernatural, but I haven't written off the existence of such phenomena.  That being said, a shadow in the night isn't enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the night.
So when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty well.  I'd have my admissions, I'd take care of the current patients without issue.  Then one night I got an admission, I'll call this patient Jerry.  Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital, to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any would be physician that trains at this facility.  He has a whole boat load of medical issues, kidney problems, diabetes, high blood pressure.  He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia. 
Before meeting Jerry I was told he's actually a really fun guy, he's always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here.  So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen, I was a little anxious.  The admission was done, the orders were placed and I didn't think more of it.  He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night.  It was around 2 in the morning when I went back to see Jerry.  I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up.  When I went in there, Jerry wasn't in his bed.  Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet, his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor. 
I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying... not crying, but rather whimpering as if he didn't have the stamina to make it a full cry.  I tried putting on a brave face and said ""Jerry whats going on?"" For an old guy, Jerry was quicker than I thought, and stronger than I would have believed.  He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him.  ""They won't leave me alone, they won't let me sleep, they won't let me eat."" 
 He continued on in this line of things the phantom ""they"" wouldn't let him do.  I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home.  As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this, I still needed the blood and this wasn't the first time I'd dealt with a confused older patient.  I helped Jerry back to his bed.  Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK.  Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better, maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient, it was something familiar.  I tied the tourniquet in place, then I cleaned his arm, found my vein and went for it.  I'm not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing. 
I was filling up my vial, it was about half way full, when Jerry started screaming, ""LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE!"" He began to jerk violently, somehow the needle stayed in place, but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerry's body was pulling it back.  I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm, but the needle didn't budge.  In shock I pulled harder, my efforts still could not budge the needle.  In response, I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing.  The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being 3/4 full to maybe being about 1/4 full.  After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerry's arm, leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise.  Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me ""Can you see them?""  I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room.  I walked back to the nursing station, one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming.  I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill.  With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep.  I made my way to the on-call room, which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital.  I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes.  All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerry's eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them. 
I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing, and a senile sick old man.  The only trouble is since then the shadows I've seen in dark rooms seem darker, the lights unable to pierce them.  The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings.  I'm not really sure what to make of it.  In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker, the tapping louder and now I can't shake a feeling that I'm being watched.  ",Night Float,98,nosleep
floydnimrod,21,,22,1rhxtb,,116,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Charlies_friend,20,,7,1rhapg,,81,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,88,nosleep

Terzis28,17,,38,1r6la8,,61,"So, a while ago (about a year ago now) I was sitting on my bed with the laptop on my lap. Next to me was my desk with my lamp on it. I was using an MSN video chat with one of my female friends. 

After talking for a couple of hours with my friend she messaged me (we both did not have microphones) and asked ""What is that kid eating? haha"" i simply replied ""What are you talking about?"" She stated that there was a kid sitting next to me with his hands at his mouth, as if to be chewing and gnawing either on his hands or something that he was holding. Chills ran through my body, but i soon realized that she was most likely messing with me.

I replied ""Seriously, stop messing with me"". She seemed like a pretty good actor considering she wasn't laughing or smiling at all. ""I'm not messing with you, I was just curious as to what he was eating"". At this moment I was getting a bit worried and decided to put her to the test. ""I want you to swear on your life that right now, you see a child next to me who looks like he is eating something"" I requested. ""I swear on my life, that is what I see"" she replied. I was pretty worried at this point and just when I thought I couldn't get much more creeped out, my lamp turned itself off.

I know it wasn't a power surge because my alarm clock was still on, and the standby light on my TV.

This could just be a strangely timed sequence of coincidence, but it sure did freak me out. I left the room immediately.",Child Eating,99,nosleep
Maniac_Mortician,8,,15,1r4jq5,,59,"I am surrounded by death. Mr. Jones on the prep table, currently expelling the blood that gives us life. Mrs. Loughlin is dressed on the side table, waiting for the casket to be delivered. The 4 year old Ryan awaits my oven in the walk in fridge. And the 23 year old, Jill Brewer, is lying in the casket, sitting silently still, waiting for her family to pass by, look upon her pale, lifeless shell, and weep. 

Jones finishes pushing the blood out of his system, and I set to work. I use the needle injector to put the wires into his upper and lower jaw. I pull tight, and twist, like sealing a loaf of bread. He looks at me, with his eyes partially opened and his mouth firm. I grab 2 eye caps, lubricate with Vaseline, and grab my tweezers. One tug of the top lid, one placement of the bottom, and then again to the other eye. He no longer looks at me. He now looks like hes sleeping, if sleeping involved 2 hoses connected to the arteries and veins of your neck. His naked corpse is covered in purple and blue bedsores. They come with the elderly, and especially the cancer patients. Most of these dead who pass from cancer are older, and the older they are, the less they have moved in the months that the infliction slowly ate the remaining life from them. 

A quick threading of the needle send me into cleanup. I baseball stitch his neck, scrub him down, and rinse again. Some skin is slipping on his left hand. Nothing the embalming fluid shouldnt take care of. If it continues, I resolved to just wax it before putting him in the last suit he'll ever wear. 

I look up, just in time to see my colleague wheel in the dark blue casket. The younger worker is  guiding it through the door. He looks pale. *Id probably use the pink dye for him rather than peach. Would make him more lifelike.* I plan the embalmings of the people I meet. Some call it morbid. I call it early planning. 

We grab Loughlin, get our arms around her frame, and place her in the casket. They wheel it to the parlor, and set up the chairs. I take off my gloves, remove my apron, roll down my sleeves, and grab my jacket. As i shut the door behind me, i hear the door buzzer go off. The Brewer family has arrived. The service goes normal, and I tag out with another director to go finish up Loughlin. I prop the door open, get on the gloves and apron, and grab my trocar. I stick the pointed metal pole into his stomach, and vacuum him out. With the plug in place, i rinse him again. I glance to the clock, and a figure invades my vision. 

A little boy in his suit and tie. I panic, and immediatly stop what I'm doing and throw a sheet over the body. I ask the boy his name. He just stares at me. I ask if hes lost? He smiles, and walks away. I follow him. He goes into the first room, and circles back through the office. I get back to the hallway, and hes back in the prep room. I tell him he cant be here. He looks at me, sadness in his face, and looks back to the walk in. He begins to sniffle. I walk next to him, and say ""Ryan, it's okay."" He looks back at me, and stops sniffling. Instead, he holds out his hand to me. I reach for it, and... Hes gone. I open the door, and hes sitting on the tray, in his little suit, waiting for my oven.

TheGraveSin,10,,17,1rdci1,,58,"So I grew up on a farm, cows, chickens, horses, you name it. I usually got stuck feeding and watering the animals while my brothers ran the tractors and threw the hay bales. Dragging the water-hose to each and every animal's water pan was a pain and sometimes I'd catch my younger brother sneaking at the other end of the pasture watering some of the animals I hadn't gotten to yet and it would always make me smile to myself. Sometime in the summer our ducks started dying off, I'd find them smooshed and assumed it was an incident from them trying to breed one another and split some of them up in different pens and thought nothing more of it.   

Then three days later, I found a calf with its body oddly angled and no sure sign of what caused it to die. Nothing else happened for about a month or two. Then I found the horse laid out, freshly dead with sweat beaded all over it as if it had been running all night, it was a young and healthy horse, one of my favorite, and my heart shattered to pieces. I was reluctant to go back the next day, forcing myself to look at my sweet animals and focus on them instead but they were acting oddly, the pigs in particular, who were hiding in their makeshift huts and houses, not even coming when I did my usual call or dumped out the food. I got worried and walked in the pen, getting on hands and knees to look inside their little houses, as soon as I saw their snouts with a squeal one of them ran into me, biting at my arm and face. I toppled backward, kicking it away and dashed over the top of the pen, hurt feelings because they were almost always happy to see me. I didn't tell anyone, just let it go, assuming that at losing so many of my precious pets I was wigging myself out.   

The next time I went out, (at this point it was around winter) because of the cold I asked my mom to help me with the animals. As we were dragging the hose to the dairy cows she stops suddenly and asks ""who's that?"" I look over seeing the usual figure of my brother and just say ""oh it's just Derek Momma"" She shakes her head. ""No, Derek's at Paul's."" A weird feeling crawled down my spine as I glanced over my shoulder at the young male figure. Dropping the water-hose, I stepped in his direction. I could clearly see his dirt-smeared jeans and the back of his hair had the same blond curl of my brothers. ""Derek!"" I yelled, running over to him and reaching a hand out to put on his shoulder. He turned his head in my direction, his bright red eyes meeting mine as my hand fell through air. I passed out then. My mom says that by the time she reached me the figure was gone. After later discussion, my brother swore on his life that he had never once been in the pasture with me. ",On the Farm.,75,nosleep
MissMonstrosity,25,,30,1r5z11,,57,"Hello everyone. I told this story to a friend who told me I should post it here in Nosleep. I'm sorry for any grammatical errors or bad commentary, I''m not much of a writer.

About four years ago I was a troubled thirteen year old, who like most teenagers, didn't get along with my parents.
It was just me and my little Brother, our Mother who spent more time on the computer then being a real Mother, and our Step Father, who in most cases, acted more like a frat boy room-mate then a parental figure.

Anyway this all started one day when my and my Mother got into an argument, only god knows what it was about since we argued all the time  back then. 
All I remember is that I stormed off, taking a backpack of clothes and some food with me, and ran into the woods.

We live on a huge property in the country, and the woods go on for miles and miles in every direction, with only a small creek running through it to break up the never ending amount of trees.
Alot of people might be freaked out by the ominous looking place, but I loved it. I went exploring out there everyday and I knew those woods like the back of my hand.
I ran to the south west, down a large hill that had the creek I mentioned earlier at the bottom of it, the creek itself went on even farther than the woods, cutting through several private properties and stopped just outside of a town over fourteen miles away.
I decided I'd follow to town, where I'd find somewhere to stay the night.
Why not just take the road to town? well we lived in the country, there were alot of crazy people out here, drunks, hill-billies, prostitutes, and a combination of all three. I figured if I took the road I'd only be asking to get raped or robbed.

I'll fast forward a little, about 2 hours later I finally came to the edge of our property.
The property after ours belonged to an old man, we met him in church a couple times. Despite several threatening ""No Trespassing"" signs  I wasn't worried, If he did so happen to come all the way out here and somehow find me, I could just claim to be lost.  I was sure he wouldn't be this far out in the woods anyway. 
Here the woods thinned out a little, and there were several small fields tucked between the trees. I came here before, but never went any further then the edge of the fields.
At this point   the sun was only an hour or so away from setting and I started walking faster to hopefully get to town before nightfall, I ran through the creek that separated me from the field, and slipped on something causing me to fall.
It hurt like hell, later I found out I had broken my toe. It was bleeding badly and I had to limp the rest of the way through the creek and fields.
I came to the end of the fields several minutes later, where a small path, either for ATV's or a tractor, led through the woods.
I never went this far before, but I knew if I kept going straight I'd get to the town within only an hour or so, so I went on.

After what felt like forever of following a twisting path that seemed to go nowhere It finally came to a small circular clearing. There was a fence surrounding it, with a large sign once again threatening anyone who crossed. I thought it was strange, we were hours from any house, why bother putting up a fence blocking off where no one would ever be likely to go? Then again I was going through, so maybe it wasn't all that uncommon. I crawled under the fence, foot still hurting like hell and went on through the clearing. I knew I wouldn't be caught, theres no way there would be anyone out here.
I walked, or more less, limped, through the clearing, on the other side there was another small field, and just my luck, there was a old tree stand in one of the trees surrounding it. 
We have a large hunting community, and hunters often hide out in the tree stands that were often camouflaged in the trees.
I thought it would make a great place to stay the night, since the town was still a long ways away and it was already starting to get dark.
I went up to it and poked my head inside, it was perfect. Just enough space to lay down and sleep if need be. 

I climbed back out and headed back to the clearing, There was a large hill to one side of it, I figured if I climbed up it I could see just how far away the town was. 
Ignoring my aching foot, I limped over to the hill, and right in that moment something hit me on the back of the head. It felt like someone angrily poking me, or throwing a small  pebble
I turned around quickly, expecting to find an angry farmer or hunter, no one was there, it was probably just an acorn or nut falling from one of the surrounding trees.
I laughed at myself for being stupid and rubbed at my now aching head.
For whatever reason, I decided to not try to force my way up the large hill, and instead went to the opposite side of the round clearing, I dont know why, it just felt like something was pulling me there.

About half way across the clearing I stopped dead in my tracks and gasped. I literally uttered  the words ""Oh my God"" Before quickly shutting my mouth in fear someone might have heard me.
There before me, were several grave stones. All ranging in height and design. 
The ground in front of some of them was lower than the rest of the ground, almost as if the coffins underneath had caved in.
I stumbled over to the graveyard, and bent down to try to read the head-stones.
Most were unreadable. Only one of them had enough words I could make out, it looked like two head-stones fused together.

The one on the left read ""G.A Keaton -date unreadable-
The one on the right said ""Harriet Keaton 18?? - 187?""
at the bottom, just visible, was ""Our angels, together in heaven""

At this point, I turned and ran.
I blacked out for most of the time I was running, I ran through the clearing, ran along the path, ran across the fields until I was finally back on our property. 
I only slowed down because it was pitch black outside, and stupid me forgot to bring a flash-light. It was so dark I could hardly see in front of me.
Once again, I'll fast forward, I finally got home after my step father had found me, apparently he went out looking for me, not to ensure I was safe and guide me home, no. 
Only because he wanted to drag me home to make me apologize to my mother.
I didn't care, I happily followed him home.
After finally getting there I found my brother, looking like he was crying, and my mom sitting at the table eating dinner, looking like she didn't have a care in the world. She glanced at me, made a face. And left the room.
Over time I ended up telling her about the graveyard, she found it interesting, and soon enough all my family knew about the weird graveyard in the woods. It became quite a conversation topic in our family, before over time, being forgotten.



One thing I never told anyone though, And the reason I went running out of that place like a baby-
 Was because, shortly after finding that cemetery, I started to hear whispering, and among the trees behind the graveyard, I could've sworn I saw something moving.

 Then, right after reading what was on the one tombstone, what felt like a long boney finger,
Started tapping on the back of my head.

iwillneverbefree,8,,20,1r1p8k,,51,"I'm just your average everyday guy with a job. I cook, I clean, I drink; hell, I even had a girlfriend before all this started going down. If you saw me on the street, you'd walk right by me without a second glance. It's just that I have a job. I'm a Paramedic.

I don't do anything important, I just help those in need. I started doing this because I didn't feel great about myself. I always loved helping others, and I always loved A&amp;P, so I saw this as a logical step. I loved every second of it when I first started. There was no greater high than when your adrenaline kicked in and your hands moved faster than your mind could think. It was ecstasy. This went on for 8 years. Every day I fell more and more in love with my job. My calling. The only thing that bothered me was that overwhelming sense of being in a battle. I thought it was normal; after-all, I was fighting for someone else's life I thought. If only I knew how true that statement was.

It started off with a shadow when I walked onto a scene. I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Maybe it was my constant concern of someone attacking me. God forbid I got shot while working. I should have known something wasn't right when my partner looked in the same direction when I did. I should have known better when he just shut down and barely spoke the rest of the night. This went on for a while, every so often seeing the shadow. Things started to get worse, however, when the whispering started.

At first, they were nonsensical. Sometimes I wondered if they were even there at all, if I was just going fucking nuts. But they were... They WERE there. It only took me losing my first patient to hear them clear as day. They were congratulating me. They were telling me how great of a job I did. I didn't understand then. My mind had been turning on me, it had to have been. ""It's the stress... It's the stress of losing someone"" I told myself on my way home. I sat at home and hit the bottle. Hoping that my next shift would be an easy one... one quiet shift.

It wasn't quiet. I should have known better than to use that word. It's bad luck. The voices didn't go away. They only got louder. Every patient I had I could hear them. ""It's their time"" ""She's ours now"" ""Let her rest"". I thought I was just compensating for losing someone. I thought I was just preparing myself if I lost another one. The more people I lost, the more they got more sinister. ""You're almost ready."" ""I haven't seen one this talented in eons"" ""You can't change fate""... ""Come join us"". I didn't understand right then, but I understood it all soon.

It was a 5 year old male. His heart stopped. I had to save this one, he was just a child, I HAD to save him. We got him to the back of the ambulance and I started my work. Things felt... odd. I felt as if I was in a daze. My vision was blurry, the lights seemed faint against the road. I tried not to think about the voices, I tried to block them out, I did a damn good job until it screamed my name.

""JOHN"". I heard. I stopped, and slowly raised my head to look at the bench seat across from me. It wasn't what you would expect death to be. It wasn't a man in a robe with a scythe. It was just a man in a suit with black eyes. I froze. I had to have been insane. I needed to tell my partner to drop my off in the psych ward when we got to the hospital. His smile was... calming. It was the kind of smile you'd expect a great car salesman to have... calming... but also sinister. His hair was well kept for a man his age, I'd have to say 50's or 60's. His eyes like a void of everything that makes us human, as if they were a black hole that sucked all feeling out of whatever had the poor misfortune of getting caught in their path.

""Haven't you been listening John?"" He said with a caring tone

""You know what you must do... You know who you'll become... Why are you fighting?""

I started screaming at him. ""Who are you?"" ""What do you want?"" ""Why have you been following me?""

He ignored all of my questions. He simply put his hand to the child and started rubbing his head.

""You fought for so long John. You know this is your fate. How much more pain can you endure?""

""What are you talking about?"" I yelled at him as the child's rhythm became worse and worse.

""Don't you understand John, we've been with you since day one! We are who you fight every day... We are the ones who you ignore to do your job... We are you.""

I began to understand.

""John, you must know something."" He said looking at the monitor as it flatlined. ""This will also be your fate. You will die just like everyone else. There's nothing you can do about it""

""Don't you think I fucking know that?"" I yelled grabbing the epinephrine out of my bag.

""JOHN"" He yelled again knocking the epinephrine out of my hand.

""You need to understand the forces that be. When you die, John, you will become one of us""

""The fuck I will"" I said, standing up, but was forced back down by some unknown force.

""It's not something you can change, John. You have so much potential... so much promise... We've been watching you from the day you were born... and we are very, very, excited to meet you""

I stopped fighting. I looked into his eyes and I felt something. Something I wish I never would have felt... I felt at peace. It was if all the stress of saving a life was gone. It was as if I didn't have to fight anymore. It felt like I was being held by my mother again, like all was right with the world.

I sat there and placed my hand on the child. I felt death pass through me. I felt the coldness of the nothing reach my heart and sit there. I understood now. I understood why I am who I am. It was as if everything made sense to me...

iampatheo,11,,15,1rcqug,,47,"  This is my first Reddit post so please excuse my mistakes. I live with my parents and my grandfather, who is my father's uncle actually, so basically not my grand""father"". 
     I am going to jump straight into the problem here because there is something definitely weird going on in our house. There have been this series of events which have occurred throughout my childhood which I have always put them at the back of my mind, maybe because as a child I didn’t look into it enough, but I never forgot. But with the most recent event I can't help but ask you guys for advice.
     The first event occurred when I was around 10 I guess. I was probably getting ready for school or something and the only people in the house that morning was my mom and my grandfather. Mom was helping me put my tie on ( we had a school uniform ) and I remember glancing towards the living room which is visible from my room. I saw my grandfather walk into the living room after which he proceeded to go towards the balcony and out of my sight. I got out my room and I was walking towards the kitchen to get some water. Now, the kitchen is right next to my grandfather's room and it’s on the other side of our house. As I reached his room I saw him sitting there reading the paper. I got a bit surprised because I clearly remembered seeing him in the living room just a few seconds ago and there is no way he could have gotten back here before me or without bumping into me. I asked him about it and he said he had no clue what I was talking about. So, I just put it at the back of my mind.
The next incident happened a year back or so. It was after 11 p.m and I was locked up in my room listening to really loud music through my earphones while doing some reading( I like doing that, getting a whole background score feel for the things happening in the book). After a while I heard my parents banging the door and shouting at me and I figured they must have been knocking for some time. When I opened the door I saw them both standing there with concerned looks on their faces. I asked them what happened and they said that apparently they could hear me crying out  for help from my room in a really panicky way and they thought had probably slipped and had broken a bone or something. I obviously had no clue what they were talking about and they swore that the voice they heard was mine and no one else’s. It freaked me out a little. But even then I didn’t put it together with the incident from all those years back.
     And now something has happened again last night and this time I am pretty freaked out. I was having my dinner in my room as I was watching a movie on my laptop. As I finished I got out of my room and headed for the kitchen. On the way I noticed my mom, dad and grandfather in the living room watching TV. As I walked past my grandfather’s room I saw him. Sitting on a chair by the window. The room was dimly lit but it was enough to see everything. I did a double take. I looked towards the living room and he was still there with my parents!  I looked back and he was still there sitting in his chair by the window. He was looking at me but for some reason I couldn’t see his eyes. Not because they weren’t there or anything but it was as if I was feeling this weird force which was trying to make me look away from there. I also got this head rush which you get when you stand up too fast. As soon as I recovered from that and my head cleared he was gone from his chair. My parents and grandfather were still sitting there in the living room chatting amongst themselves as they watched the TV. I told them what happened but they obviously did not believe me and thought I was making it up.
I really need to know what this is. Is this a doppelganger? And if so what should I do? Is this thing going to be harmful? It hasn’t done anything harmful so far.

WontThinkStraight,12,,11,1rcy69,,49,"I just had a long overdue catch up with Brad, and to check on how [Emily's family were doing since their tragedy](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p22cl/notes/). In some welcome news, they are now expecting a new child to join their family.

Brad had another story for me though; one that has kept me awake  the past couple of nights. I've captured it below to help get it off my mind.


-------------------------------------------

In a universe filled with choices, but with only one life in which to make them, regrets become inevitable. Regrets for things done or left undone, for words said or left unsaid.

At that moment when our life is fading, and we see it all over again... how would we feel about those decisions we've made?  Would we be proud of those moments that defined us? Those moments alone when we think no one else is watching? How we treated those we loved, and those close to us?


Brad was not the only child in his family. He also had a younger brother, Paul. They could not have been more opposites to each other.

Where Brad was brash and wild in his youth, Paul was introverted and contemplative. And like many siblings, their childhood was one of constant warfare with each other. 

Looking back, Brad admits that he was an arrogant, possessive and obnoxious brat. Any of those traits alone would already have given him an excuse to hate on his little brother.

But it was really the fear of the Burnt Man that really started it all. 

As an only child, Brad enjoyed the attention and adulation that brought him. That changed when his brother Paul was born three years later.

At first, Brad had loved the idea of a brother to play with. He imagined they would play together and be best friends. That idea disappeared when he discovered Paul was a useless baby that only cried, smelled bad and demanded constant attention. The second year wasn't much better, with Paul starting to get a larger share of Brad's toys and presents.

It became really bad in the third year when Brad had to give up half his room and share it with Paul. He found they had nothing in common.

Where Brad liked being loud and attention seeking with others, Paul just babbled and talked with himself. Brad loved being outside and active, Paul preferred to stay indoors and draw with his crayon set.

What unsettled Brad though was what Paul would draw. There would be the usual things every child draws - houses, animals, trees and family. What was unusual was every drawing of their family always had an extra person.

Their parents would be there, and Brad and Paul, all drawn in rainbow hues. Right next to Paul would be a mysterious figure drawn in black and red.

The family faces all had big smiles, but the stranger was a disfigured mess: two big black circles for eyes and a shapeless mass for the mouth. In every drawing of the stranger, he was missing an arm and had red streaks running through all over.

Over time, this stranger began to feature more and more prominently in the drawings. Brad and his parents would no longer appear in them - just Paul playing with the stranger inside the house, or outside in the yard.

At first their parents thought it was just a phase, but eventually became concerned enough to ask Paul who that was. He told them it was his friend ""the burned man"". He had always been there for as long as Paul could remember. He never said anything - he just stood there, watching and listening.

They concluded it was just an imaginary friend. Granted, it was a bit more unsettling than having a dinosaur or elf for a friend, but at least Paul wasn't drawing some real-life predator.

One night (when Brad was 8, and Paul was 5), they stayed awake after their parents had tucked them in. Brad wanted to know more about the Burnt Man.

Paul said that he had been in an accident, a fire that had burnt his entire body and face. It had melted his eyes away and made his arm go missing. He was very sad.

Paul didn't find the Burnt Man scary though. He had always been around, and never did anything. Just watched and listened.

Brad told him he was stupid for having an imaginary friend.

Paul yawned, and simply replied that he wasn't imaginary. He was in the room with them right now. In fact, he was standing right next to Brad, watching and listening, as he did every night.

Brad felt a chill go up his spine. He had always been a brave child, but for the first time in his life he felt fear. He looked around in the darkness, not sure if the shadows were his imagination or the Burnt Man waiting for him to go to sleep.

Brad didn't go to sleep that night, and concluded that he needed a room of his own.

He could no longer share a room with his annoying brother and his creepy friend. But he couldn't admit that he was afraid either, so his 8 year old mind came up with an idea.

His plan was simple - to make it so painful for their parents to keep them together they would be forced to keep them in separate rooms. So began their adversarial relationship.

They fought over everything for many years, and often physically. Each prank they played each other escalated into new rounds of retaliation, all to the chagrin of their parents. 

It would take six more years until they moved to a bigger house and they were able to have separate rooms at last before the feuds started to die down. the Burnt Man had been all but forgotten by this time, replaced with pure animosity for each other. 

But on the first night in their new home, Brad remembered waking in the middle of the night and seeing a figure sitting on his bed, watching him. It stared at him through hollow eye sockets, and moaned at him through an open jaw. It reached for him with a horribly burnt hand, the other hung uselessly by its side with the lower half missing.

Brad screamed so loud it woke the house, and the figure had disappeared by the time he blinked. When Paul came into the room to check what all the commotion was about, Brad told him he saw the Burnt Man.

Paul laughed, and said he hadn't seen him in years. In fact, he could hardly even remember him. In any case, he couldn't see him in the room now. Paul closed the door as he left, then reopened it quickly and shouting ""Boo!"", before laughing again and walking back to his room.

For Brad, the memory of it seemed very real though. It wasn't just the terror, but the overwhelming sense of sadness he felt from the encounter.

Another incident was when Paul was 17 and involved in a hit-and-run accident. He was rushed to hospital in a critical condition, and the doctors weren't sure if he would survive. Paul was lying in bed with a coma, with his parents crying around him.

Brad could could see a figure through the corner of his eye standing by the walls. It was the Burnt Man, watching Paul intently.

""Just go already! Why are you still here? You're not wanted. Just leave us!"" Brad remembered shouting at the figure. He got a severe reprimanding from his parents, thinking that he was shouting at his brother.

""Paul is dying, Brad! It's time to put your stupid feud behind. We're family for god's sake. Act like it!"" his father had rebuked while his mother cried.

The words stung Brad, especially since he couldn't explain that he wasn't shouting at Paul. He quietly fumed, then stormed out.

Paul did recover two days later though, and was out of the hospital a week later.

That last incident was 15 years ago. The Burnt Man was never seen again by either of them since. 

Brad had become a serious and buttoned down computer analyst since then. Paul married, had two children of his own, and had saved countless lives through his job as an EMT. They had developed a grudging respect for each other, though their lives had drifted off in different directions over the years.

The Burnt Man was just another long forgotten childhood memory, filed away and never thought of again until recently. Only a recent tragedy brought it all back into sharp focus.

A few months ago, Brad learnt that his brother had died while on duty. He was on scene with other emergency services dealing with a factory fire.

A chemical storage tank had unexpectedly exploded near his location, dousing him in burning chemicals. The flying shrapnel had sheared off his left arm at the elbow.

Paul was 32.

---------------------------

In a life of many regrets, Brad now has one more for the list. He never did let Paul know how proud he was of him, and that despite their differences, he loved him as a brother.

He regrets that his last words to Paul weren't goodbye, but a text message which read ""You suck. I've shat better excuses than that."" It was said in jest about why Paul didn't have time over the weekend for a beer, but it was devastating knowing it would be the last memory both had of each other.

So every now and then, Brad talks to the silence in the room hoping that his brother, the Burnt Man, is still around to hear. Now much older and wiser, he no longer fears the Burnt Man - but fears that the only one listening might just be himself.

One that can only observe in silence, powerless to stop whatever fate awaits him, judging him with regret for the decisions he's made, and is yet to make.

Here's a example, one day, my mother called me into the kitchen to fix something for her. As I was walking through the hallway, my dads hand pulled me into the closet and whispered ""That's not your mother"".


These pranks freaked my out and my little cousins too. One day, my cousins mother told me about this story. I will tell this like how she told me.


*So, I tucked my five year old son into bed, and he went to sleep. When It was time for him to go to school, I called him to get up and come to the living room, I was reading the newspaper while I came across this one article. ""Missing children"" It read. My son then ran to me screaming and crying saying ""A man pulled me into the closet telling me not to come to you!*

ohthankheaven,5,,16,1rbpkl,,46,"I don't have an exciting life. I wake up each morning at exactly 6:30AM, and by 7:15AM I'm starting the engine of my poorly kept up with vehicle and begin my venture to work. I'm late every single day by about fifteen minutes, to be precise. I don't care, they could fire me if they wanted, but I'm the kind of guy who comes to the office, keeps his mouth shut, and gets the job done. They also figure that the fifteen minutes of tardiness isn't so bad, compared to the hour and forty-five minutes of unpaid overtime they sentence me with every day. I would describe my job as dull, repetitive, and relentlessly boring, and correspondingly, so is my life. My house isn't particularly lavish. Living alone as a male really doesn't give your residence that home feeling. I'm not your average lonely, I lack companionship. I do not have a family, I do not have friends. Every day is the same. It's winter time and the days freeze together. 

My alarm goes off, I hit snooze. Again, the obnoxious ringtone I set on my phone crackles out of the tiny speaker, I hit snooze. After a third ring, I'm out of bed and on my way to work. It's freezing this morning and the heat in my car does not work. My weather-beaten jacket doesn't provide that much protection either. I scrape through the day, counting the minutes. 
The drive home from work offers my only source of human contact, and this lies in the sports talk radio station I listen to. Their snide remarks always make me laugh, and I sometimes call in to dispute some of the commentary they are making. It also feels good to have somebody to talk to, especially when you're as solitary as I am.

I don't choose to be this way. I am a single child and my parents died three years ago in a car accident. It was a tough loss, it put me in a downward spiral until I hit bottom, which just so happens to be where I still reside. I try to socialize and be friendly but it seems like I'm lost in the masses. Maybe I should be more interesting, or funny, or wear nicer clothes. I'm not good with these things. I started taking comfort in the internet. For me it felt safer, more secure from the harshness of the real world. Not that the internet isn't any less relentless, the only difference is I'm hiding behind a screen and a handle. I do not have a Facebook. I don't know if it's because I don't see the point of having one or I'm too scared to deal with the fact that I would lack companionship on there as well. I visit my favorite sports websites, browse Reddit, and enjoy YouTube. None of those things could ever satisfy my primal need for a physical partner in life, so eventually, I started using a dating website. A website that I don't feel the need to name. They are all the same anyway. It was slow at first. Slower than it took me to fill out my profile and eventually take a picture anyway. I didn't know what to write about myself, and even convincing myself to finally publicize my life in an attempt to get anyone to talk to was an effort in itself.  Months went by and I received no glimmer of hope. Suddenly, a chat prompt appeared on my laptop.
""Hello"", she said.

Her name is Julie, and she is beautiful. I don't know what she saw in me, but for the first time it is real, it is there. We spoke for years. Endless chat logs, phone calls, video chats. We shared tears, laughs, and something I never felt before, love. 

Two days ago I asked Julie to meet me for the first time, and she said yes. I was nervous at first, but extremely happy. I asked her if she wanted to have dinner, but she said she would rather just come to my house instead. Yesterday she came over, she really is a special girl. We hit it off so well that she decided to spend the night. She really is excited to have me now, I can hear her calling for me now. I have never felt so happy and so confident. There is one thing that is for certain, she will never leave me. Even if we fight, even if we argue, she still won't leave me. We are going to have a great time together, and we are going to play. Even if it turns out she doesn't like the games we play she still won't leave me. 

There is that chance though, that small chance that things won't work out. That chance that the love will fade and that abominable lonliness will come back. It scared me at first, because I can't go back to being alone again. I won't go back. I don't worry anymore though, because Julie loves me and the games we play, Julie loves to be with me, and Julie isn't strong enough to bend the bars of her basement cell.

DickBanditDoneLanded,11,,65,1r1zac,,42,"As a kid, I grew up singing songs of joy with my friends. Fun songs that made me feel like a child. There was one song that I never really liked, for reasons unbeknownst to me, but that one song would become a living hell during my adult life.

My wife packed my son's lunchbox with a pizza lunchables; It was always his favorite one. I had the privilege of walking him to school that cold October morning, holding his hand the whole walk. We talked about toys, games, and then the topic of songs came up.
""Hey, dad...how come you never showed me the song about Josh Jacob Jinglehyper Smith?"" he asked. ""Haha, you mean John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt? I never liked that song, kiddo,"" I replied. ""I thought his name was Josh, like mine!"" He added.

 We got to the school about half an hour earlier than the entry time, so I suggested we go to the playground located around back; Josh agreed and followed me. The air felt relatively dense that day, I could barely see fifty feet away and asked Josh to stay in sight and have a little fun before school starts. I look away at the birds in the trees and I'm startled by the piercing cry of my son, nowhere in sight. I call his name and he says ""Sorry, dad! I fell off the monkey bars, I'll be fine!"" I sighed and laughed a little knowing my kid was such a warrior. I notice Josh riding a swing and laughing with another little boy who also came to school too early. I see his father standing on the side, laughing and I worry about not being a good enough dad to Josh. I start to walk toward the boys and that's when it hits me; I wasn't watching Josh play, none of the two boys was mine. I tried to keep calm but felt the need to yell out his name to locate him. I look around the playground and the school bell rings, announcing the school's opening. The dense, foggy air dissipates and I'm able to see everything clearly. I find a note in the second floor of the jungle gym, it reads: ""I know how hard you tried to avoid me, I wouldn't want the same thing happening with Josh.""

My heart sank and my eyes widened as the note dropped on the mulch and made a thud. I felt every possible emotion at that one point in time. I didn't know what to do, where to go, who to ask for help, so I walked into the school, where I come across a corkboard with pictures of kids on it. All of these children were abducted by a strange man who walked into the forest beside the school. I knew what I had to do, I ran into the woods, clenching the note he had written. ""John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt!"" I hear a high pitched voice scream from the bushes, as I fall to the ground in fear.

 I noticed a building on a hill about a mile into the wild. It was a greenish wooden house, much like the ones mystery inc. would investigate, but this was not a game, this was my son's life and possibly that of many other children. The smell of rotting was emitting throughout the air, and I feared the worst for the status of the kids. Not willing to be detected, I snuck in through a window that was left open and creeped about the dark house with nothing but my signal-less cellphone and my dedication. I was in the basement floor and couldn't see anything, so I turned on my flashlight app. I had no idea I was about to come across one of the most horrible sights anyone could've seen.

 There were mutilated corpses, not just any corpses, but children, kids who I had met through class pictures my wife bought and showed me. The kids were decapitated, burned, sliced, naked. I was scared for my life, I almost threw up one too many times but swallowed it back along with my will to flee. I found a wooden staircase that was old and rotting. The first step I took on it made a loud creak and there was a groan in the distance. I hid behind a giant flowerpot as a huge figure approached the area I was in. I could barely breathe as I noticed this man had blood between his fingernails, as if he mutilated the children with nothing but his fingers. He returned to the room and I followed him from afar. The smell I picked up earlier was much stronger than before and I heard muffled cries coming from the room the man walked into. 
""Say it with me, now, kids!
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt! 
His name is my name too! 
Whenever we go out! 
The people always shout! 
There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schm-"" A kid bit a hole through the duct tape on his mouth and was able to scream while he sang. I heard the kid's name; It was Gary.

The children were all able to remove their mouth bindings and cried in unison for about ten seconds. Then I hear a loud laugh, followed by a ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" At this point, I was enraged. Nobody has the right to scream at kids like that, nobody. I barged in, grabbing this freak by his back-length hair and slamming his face into a table with limbs on it. ""What did you just say to those kids, you motherfucker?!"" I yelled, oblivious to the children in the room. ""You're gonna pay for all your shit, you son of a bitch!"" I said ""Well that's just too damn bad!"" He added ""I didn't know today was the day I'd be found! It's such a shame you've missed your playdate with your son...he was SUCH a nice boy!"" He said, laughing his head off at the sight of my expression. I was cold, I was numb. My son was dead.

 I unleashed my fury on the man, not holding back at all. I knocked him unconscious and tied him down to a giant piece of metal. I broke both his legs and made sure he'd never walk again, then I released the children, many starving and ready to go home. I tugged the slab down the hill and walked alongside the children toward the school. The police had previously raided the woods, but never came across the house in the entire year he had been performing the kidnappings. I called the school and notified the authorities of the serial killer I had slayed and I wanted to make sure he was arrested and would suffer his whole life for what he did to my wife and I. She was hysterical, unable to perform for almost a whole year. We cancelled any holidays and vacations and mourned a year away. We finally concluded that our son was happy in a better place with the rest of his friends. Although my wife and I never had any other children, I became teacher at an elementary school in another state and was happy knowing I had kids who were fun to be around and nice to me. 

One Monday morning, we have a new girl come in and I ask her to introduce herself. She's laughing and she's shy and she wants to whisper something in my ear. ""I'll introduce myself if we can just play today."" She says I promise her, along with the class, that we'll have a free day and she introduces herself and makes friends. I start to like this girl because I never had a chance to have a daughter and always wanted one. She was very sociable and was the class clown.

She stopped coming to school for a week, and out of curiosity, I called her parents to ask about her sudden disappearance. Her mother was crying and I couldn't understand her, so her father came to the phone. I told him about how the class missed her and he told me about a note that was left at their door one afternoon. It read: ""Go through her drawings"" I asked the dad to give me a minute while I did just that. *HE* was in the pictures. Every drawing she made had *him* hiding in the background. There was a folded piece of paper that was thicker than the rest. Little did I know, it wasn't school paper, it was skin; Pressed and cut to replicate a note. ""I thought, by now, you'd figure out I was never human"" I got on the phone to tell the girl's father the news, but all I heard was a demonic, maniacal laughter. I felt a hole in my chest, as the phone line went dead, followed by three beeps and elongated static.","His name is my name, too.",107,nosleep
Brodiche,28,,13,1ra24j,,41,"The Eighth Crusade

On the outskirts of the large city known as Canto; a small cathedral stands unscathed by the horror happening not twenty miles away. There were some smaller towns outside of the city, but most of their residents fled as soon as the vague news reports of “cannibalistic” citizens came flooding in. In the end, those who were smart enough to run at the first sign of trouble were the only ones who made it, the hesitant died along with the rest of the city. 
However, this small cathedral was different. It was located in the middle of nowhere and had been long abandoned and forgotten by everyone, aside from the city itself the closest town to it was almost an hour way and a small dirt road was the only thing that even hinted that there was another world past the miles and miles of flat plains. The glow and black smoke from Canto can be seen in the distance.  
Short flashes of lightning filled the air, just long enough to illuminate a figure on top of the cathedral, his legs swung over the edge of the roof and head leaning against the lighting rod. The faint glow of a cigar intensified as he put it to his mouth. With a small grin played on his lips, he gazed dreamily at the city.
“What a sight. Obliteration has never looked so divine.” He whispered to himself. Images of a crumbling Jerusalem played through his head, “Well, I guess you can’t get much more divine than that.”
Feeling a little foolish for talking to himself again he took one last drag of his cigar and flicked it behind him. The man noticed that there was a thin layer of ash that had settled on to his body. Slightly irritated by this, the man glanced at his watch while getting to his feet, ruffling his short black hair in an attempt to get as much ash off his head as possible. His long black coat blew in the wind as he brushed it off. 
The temperature was dropping fast, it wouldn’t be long until the rain began to pour. The man wondered if it would be enough to quench the flames of the city. The Vatican ordered complete destruction; they wanted nothing standing of what they thought to be a “heathen city”. The man wouldn’t feel accomplished if the flames were so easily disposed of. Glancing at his watch again figuring he had roughly another half hour before the he was picked up and debriefed. He leaned back against the lightning rod, and lit another cigar, daydreaming of the day before.
****************************************

One bite, one citizen, and his work was done. His mission was to just get the ball rolling, nothing more. Being as potent as he was, his victims often became immensely strong. They were puppets, sure; but also unstable. The more of them that were roaming the streets the more dangerous the mop up was for the church. The man was frustrated that he only got one snack, he was tired of the left over’s from corpses and the donations from Italian blood banks. He was craving prey with more… life to it, one he could enjoy stalking before the kill.
The Vatican dispatched him and a helicopter to the abandoned cathedral. Along with being the drop point, the house of God was also were he was supposed to rendezvous with the evac crew. His orders were to simply enter the city, light the spark, and watch “God cleanse the Earth” from the cathedral. 
“You zealots are no fun!” he would tell them “I’m doing “God’s work” for you lazy ass holes, the least you could do is let me off the leash!”
The hungry man could not help but feel disappointed when they were offended. They preached how the last crusade was such a failure due to the fact he had so much “freedom”, the mobs of the powerful undead nearly completely consumed the Holy army.
It pissed him off that they never got over that.
He resolved that it was never really his fault, humans were frail, weak creatures. They are easy to corrupt in every way. None of them could handle the thirst, and they tore everything apart. Turning their victims into, for lack of a better word, zombies. 
The Pope himself preformed the unnecessary but “ritualistic” blessing before he set off.
“Vai quarto Locke e fornire i nostri nemici a Dio.”
“Deliver them I shall.” He sarcastically whispered to himself with a smirk. The helicopter was taking off; it was time to go to work.
Locke could not stop thinking about his one victim, regardless of whom it was he planned to savor every last second of his feast.
****************************************

The man found himself seeking a challenge. In the back of his mind he knew he wouldn’t get one, but the fantasy of a dangerous prey kept his thoughts occupied as he made his way towards the glistening city. 
With the pace he was traveling at it wouldn’t be long before reached the edge of Canto, his long strides covered more distance, faster than a high-end sports car going ninety on an open freeway. The cool night air was refreshing to him, it’s not often he is allowed to roam out in the open like this. He slowed down a bit to prolong this finite feeling of freedom.
Being cooped up under Vatican City for so long had begun to take its toll on Locke’s sanity. Other than living off nothing but the scraps of Roma, he had no real connection to the outside world. It’s not like he longed to live amongst the humans, no, the thought of that made him sick. The only reason he could stand the “Men of God” back at the Vatican was because they were as far away from human as possible. He’s seen them put on human masks, sure, seen them absolve the masses with a crooked smile, seen them preach peace and the word of God to a thousand ignorant faces. No, no, behind their masks, they are every bit a monster as Locke.
The city was drawing closer, massive sky scrapers were lit up in a brilliant fashion. A sense of intrigue radiated from surrounding, smaller clusters of lights. What were the humans doing at this hour? Were they working overtime, tucking the children in, late night binge drinking at the local bar? They were all so very ignorant of the malevolent fury of God that was about to rain down upon them. Sure, it looked pretty from a distance, but Canto was the antithesis when viewed up close. The Vatican made it clear to Locke that this was not a city that deserves pity, even though he never considered giving it anyways, he asked to be briefed on the city’s situation.
Canto was dying, almost all who’ve entered abandoned all hope for it when they saw what a hell hole it has become. Corruption plagued the city’s central government, all of the representatives’ power focused on how to make the wealthy more capable of shitting on the poor. As a result, crime was abundant. Drug trafficking, prostitution, child labor plagued the down town streets. Whole families were often caught in cases of “indentured servitude” as the wealthy put it, where even the children would have to be at the beckon call of the privileged, doing strenuous and dangerous work that led to more than a few deceased children. Anyone who cried foul ended up dead too, it was just the way it went. 
And it was reason enough to cleanse it.
Locke reached the edge of Canto, he could now hear the grumbling sounds of the suffering city, a siren blared unceasingly somewhere among the throngs of buildings. Looking at his watch the man whispered to himself.
“Time to light the match.”
****************************************

Upon entering the city, Locke found to his disappointment, that there was no shortage of easy prey. The homeless aimlessly wandered the streets, practically half dead already, prostitutes looking vulnerable as ever. He was slightly surprised, however, to find a couple of security guards having a smoke outside of a large ominously lit building. A young woman dressed in rags, stumbled past them, she was appeared very exhausted and in need of medical care. The guards just looked upon her and laughed, asking the woman unrepeatable questions. When she didn’t respond to their cat calls one of the men grew frustrated and ran after her. She let out a quick yelp of pain as he put his cigarette out on the back of her neck.
In a very swift motion the girl whirled around, grabbing the guard’s wrist and pulling him close. The man’s face was within an inch of hers, his expression showed that of pure pain. She had broken his wrist. In a split second she revealed a small revolver, put it to the man’s chin, and pulled the trigger.
There was a bright flash, then a spray of crimson red. The man’s body crumpled to the newly painted sidewalk, with a softball sized hole where his skull used to be. The woman was already on the other guard before he was done unhooking the strap to his sidearm. Landing knees first on the guard’s chest she pinned him to the ground. Grabbing a firm hold of her prey’s head, with both hands she lifted up his skull and brought it back down to the concrete. Over and over again she did this, until the guard was pulverized into the sidewalk.
It was all over that quickly. She stood up without a sound, her face expressionless except for a small smirk that crept on the edge of her lips, she bent over to pick up her revolver that lie next to body of the first guard. She shot Locke a quick glance and disappeared around the corner. While the look she gave him was quick, it was more than enough to excite him. She had piercing brown eyes that screamed strength, and short, dirty, black hair that was almost just long enough to veil her left eye. Locke knew her just by that single, short glance. He knew her struggles, knew her strength, and knew her will to survive.
He knew he had found his prey.
The building the two guards were once protecting let out the piercing wale of an emergency siren, snapping Locke out of his mystified state. It was then he noticed the streets were completely empty, not a piece of human filth to be seen. Whoever the guards were protecting called for backup and he had mere minutes to escape. A thought crossed his mind, and made him almost consider revealing himself to the approaching authorities before pounding them into dust. Not wanting to risk compromising the mission, Locke reluctantly retreated into a dark alley way. He scaled his way to the roof tops from there and began the hunt for his new found prey. 
****************************************
The mystery woman’s scent was still live and growing stronger as he strides across the apartment building rooftops. Locke’s mind wandered back to the two guards, how efficiently and violently she dispatched them. Two full grown, armed men could not handle the slender girl half their size. Where can a human learn to kill like that? Without mercy or emotion, just pure unadulterated instinct. After searching for a short time he came across her entering a dimly lit liquor store, only to return moments later with a bag clenched in her fist. 
The hunger was starting to get to him, it was a ravenous gnawing that made his whole body tremble with anticipation. He knelt down on one knee and gazed down at her from the roof tops. Across the street from where Locke sat perched he saw her lean against a brick wall, and begin chugging whatever was in the paper bag. Locke felt his heart sink, he had to stop her quickly or that alcohol will kill all the fun. What was the fun in feeding from intoxicated prey? He let out a small sigh and leapt off the building, and descended to the street below. 
The woman let out a small yelp as Locke landed safely in front of her. A small cloud of dust and filth from the city escaped from under his feet, leaving a small clear circle around where he landed.
For a moment she just stared at him as he rose to his feet. Only a dim street light illuminated the empty street, the only thing she could make of the man was a pair of piercing red eyes that glowed like the moon.
“There is something magnificent about the moment you make yourself known to your prey,” spoke the man. His voice had a crisp, raspy tone to it, full of anticipation and a hint of sensuality.
The woman’s eyes widened at this, not out of fear however; it was more like she just received a jolt of electricity, the grip on her bottle tightened. She put on a smirk and spoke with an authoritative tone. 
 “Listen, I’ve had a long day. I already have had to deal with two assholes today,” she lifted her hands almost defensively, to reveal that they were caked with dried blood. 
“I caved both their heads in before they learned their place, maybe I should take my time with you so I can really make a statement around here.”
The man cocked his head a bit to the side at this threat, amused and intrigued by her intensity. He opened his arms wide as if to bow and took a step forward. The woman reacted quickly and swung the bag at Locke’s head. The sharp crash of the class mixed with the sound of cracking bone traveled all the way down the street. 
The woman expected the perfect stranger to be on the ground bleeding, begging for his life like she has seen so many other “men” do. 
However, the man was still standing. Aside from a small shard of glass that was lodged in the left side of his face, he was completely unfazed by the vicious attack. Locke licked his lips as the remaining alcohol from the bottle trickled down his face.
“Hmm, I’m not much of a whisky man. I prefer a more... ,” he paused for a moment as he watched the panic in his prey begin to rise “… exotic spirit.” 
He began to chuckle to himself, in all reality the whole situation was darkly humorous to him. This is the most pain he’s been in in years, and that is saying something. His chuckle escalated to a howling laughter.
The woman wore a look that held a combination of shock and excitement. Even though she was beginning to panic, a smile spread across her face. Not once in her entire time in Canto has she met a man who could last more than 2 minutes in fight with her, much less one who could so easily brush off a whisky bottle to the head.
She watched as the man’s laughter grew, his bloodshot eyes screamed madness.
“It’s time to put you down you crazy son-of-a-bitch,” she said with a smile. 
She slowly removed the revolver she used to kill the security guard, the aged blood glistened in what little light was available. The sight of the gun just seemed to incite a stronger laughing fit out of Locke. The woman extended her arm and placed the barrel of the gun into the man’s open mouth, and pulled the trigger.
Again, there was a quick flash. His head snapped back with full force, but he remained on his feet, never ceasing his laughter that grew into the howling of a demon. He lowered his head, fixing his blood red eyes on the woman.
He was able to stop his laughter long enough to respond to the horrified look on his prey’s face. 
“What’s the matter baby doll? You seemed surprised you can’t dispatch me as easily as those two security guards,” Locke began to laugh again “Honey, they are nothing compared to a true monster.”     
Locke took one last look at his victim, then opened his jaws to reveal several sharp teeth. The hole left by the bullet can be clearly seen as he made the final move on his prey.                           
****************************************
The man wiped his mouth and looked down at his meal. The woman’s eyes were glossed with fear, but there was an eerie smile that still crept on her lips as she stared blankly into the night sky. 
Locke allowed the woman’s essence to dissolve and flow throughout his body. Fresh blood from a living victim holds a piece of that person’s life and personality. Anyone who takes that essence inherits a part of that person’s life. All their thoughts, feelings, information becomes a part of the predator’s body and soul. 
“Veronica,” He whispered
The woman’s body began to violently shake. She was beginning to reanimate. 
Locke felt a slight pang of worry in the back of his mind. A human of her caliber would be a serious threat as a vampire, everything about her will be augmented and enhanced. 
Locke looked back at the shaking body. 
“Give those zealots hell for me, Veronica.”
Turning around he began to make his way to the edge of the city, the sun was going to be rising soon it was in his best interest to get back to the Cathedral as fast as he can. 
He had lit the match 
“Canto will be devoured by flames by tomorrow night.” Locke finally said with a smile.
                               ****************************************
 The enveloping darkness cascaded across the night sky. Leaving the silhouettes of clouds drift overhead, like veils of moving sentinels, suffocating the very light out of the stars. The scent of moisture and smoke hung thick in the air. The sound of distant thunder boomed across the sky, echoing into the midnight horizon. A light from below slightly illuminated the world, trails of thick black smoke were dressed in the light painted on by miles of inferno. It was as if the gates of hell opened under the earth, releasing and delivering throngs of angel’s utmost nightmares unto God’s domain. The pounding hearts of a million terrified saints could be heard as the sky boomed again. 
Below the heavens, true evil incarnate devoured the world. Sky scrapers wore flames from head to toe, fire danced on the water under decimated bridges, streets were in chaos, destroyed vehicles littered the crowed avenues. Exposed hands and limbs peek out from under of overturned cars, burning corpses are contorted in horrible positions behind the wheel of their tombs. Police stations show no sign of life, a constant siren blares somewhere in the city, with nothing living left to answer. The city, its souls, everything was devoured by chaos.
Well, almost everything.

TheeMikeG,20,,10,1rdk7o,,42,"Hey, all, I’ll try and make this quick because I don’t know how much time I have. My name is Cliff and I live in a nice two-story house in a suburb in California. I have a loving wife and an amazing little princess of a daughter. Today I woke up and went downstairs to see her watching Sunday morning cartoons on our small, discolored TV. She turned up at me and smiled, jumping to wrap her arms around my leg. 

“Daddy! Mom wanted me to tell you that she left a note for you on the counter.”

I rubbed my fingers through her bleach blonde hair before turning to retrieve the note.

Morning honey, it read, have fun today on your father-daughter day! She is really looking forward to spending quality time with you. Maybe take her to that new movie she won’t stop talking about? 	

I set down the note and crept up behind my daughter who had returned her attention the the TV. I sprung, tickling her as she laughed and laughed. Stopping, I gave her a kiss on the back of her head and smiled. 

“So what do you want to do today?” 

She shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t know, can we get icecream?” Her eyes lit up with excitement and she nodded enthusiastically. 

I chuckled, “Yeah, that sounds great. Do you wanna see that movie too?” 

She clapped her hands and giggled cutely. “Yes!” she shouted.

I smiled and pocketed the car keys I had left on the counter the day before. “Ok, go get ready, I’ll be down here waiting.” 

“Ok daddy!” she smiled before bounding up the stairs. “I love you!”

“I love you too!” I shouted after her. I walked towards the TV and shut it off. Yawning, I walked through the eerily quiet house to the fridge. The silence was almost unsettling. I glanced around, looking out the windows for nothing in particular. 

“Almost ready!” yelled my daughter from her bedroom upstairs. 

I shook my head with amusement. I could remember the first time I saw her in the hospital. I promised I would care for her like no one else. So far I had kept my promise, and we’ve been inseparable since. Guilt struck me as I recalled how much I’d been working lately and hadn’t been home to spend time with her. My wife had been telling me late at night when I’d finally come home how our daughter would spend most of the day crying in her room asking for her daddy. Today I was going to make it all up to her. Right after I grabbed a snack. 

I smiled to myself and opened the fridge. The decapitated body of my wife tumbled out and knocked me to the floor, covering me in blood.

I screamed and scrambled backwards until I slammed into the cabinets under the sink. My daughter came skipping into the kitchen holding a knife in one hand and my wife’s head in the other. Her face was distorted as if she was screaming when the blade fell. “I’m almost ready!” she giggled before smiling real wide. “There’s just one more thing I need. Then we can spend the whole day together.”

I got to my feet but took a nasty cut to the leg. I managed to get past her and upstairs, and into my bedroom behind a locked door before she reached it. I can hear her slowly dragging the tip of the knife against the door. She keeps saying “Daddy, please come to the door, I miss you!” She might even be crying, she sounds so sad. I already called the police, I just wanted to leave a tangible record of what’s happening. But I’m sure I could handle this on my own right? I mean she’s a little girl! I might just go to the door now. What do you think?

youngsterjose42,3,,10,1rd8lb,,37,"My mother once told me a story, her sister had an encounter with the paranormal that eventually lead to her suicide... this is that story.

My mother had a sister once, I remember my earliest memories of her, she was always so depressed and I always asked why was she sad. She never had an answer. My mother told me it all started one night when she came home from work. She was walking the streets around midnight heading home when she noticed a man walking behind her. It wasn't the first time she had been followed by this man, Only difference was... this time he tried to talk to my aunt. He asked ""are you happy with your family? aren't you tired of living in a house of religious fools?"". She was scared and asked ""who are you?"" and my mother told me as soon as he stepped out of the shadows my aunt saw his face he looked rather normal except for his long hair and ember red eyes. He smiled and said ""your people call me the devil"" and she started to run. She ran as fast as she could. Eventually my aunt got the house of my mother and she explained what happened. My mother tried to calm her down, my aunt was breathing heavily and could not control herself. Soon enough she passed out.

A few days pass by and my mother sees that my aunt has a serious problem. She didn't go to work for about a week and she felt as if she was not safe at my mothers house. So she moved back to my grandmothers house. They were extremely religious and for some reason my aunt felt safe at her house. The same night she moved back in to her mothers house something happened that drove her into being institutionalized. It was around 1 in the morning and my grandfather and grandmother were fighting. My aunt knew she was awake because she could see her mother. she was in the kitchen and she was looking through the crack in the door. she suddenly felt something brush up against her arm. Her breath taken away, her eyes wide open, she turns around and sees the man claiming to be ""the devil"". He says ""tell me whats wrong. I know, I know something's wrong let me take you away from all your troubles"" she screamed as loud as she could until her mother and father came into the room, they turned on the lights and she kept staring at the empty space next to her bed. My grandmother started yelling at her ""are you crazy?! do you have any idea how late it is?! why are you screaming?!"" she kept going and going until my aunt finally screamed ""the devil, he's after me mom!"" my grandmother was religious, still is, but for some reason she did not believe my aunt and they put her away in a hospital for about a month or two.

While in the hospital my aunt told my mother what she saw in there. They had to put her on several medications before she stopped seeing the man. Every now and then she would try to fall asleep in the hospital while the man watched she said she heard him bragging ""you know they'll never believe you"" or ""you know they cant see me"". When the lights went out she closed her eyes. She could hear his threats, she could hear him mocking her life. She always kept her eyes closed she did not want to see his silhouette even less his ember red eyes. She described him as a physical being yet at the same time he did not exist. At some points she thought she was arguing with herself until she realized the voice was overlapping her voice, her thoughts. She had nightmares almost every night in that hospital. Around 2 month goes by in there and she pretends to be fine they let her out a week or so later. 

My mom did not hear of her for about 3 months after she got out of the hospital. My mother was worried and she sent out search parties she called cops. Yet she never found her. Turns out she was hiding in the woods. She didn't want see anyone, my aunt told my mother that she never gave in. I don't know the way my mom told me I can only assume she was lying. She told me how she lived in the woods for a few months living off whatever she could find. She explained to my mother how he never left her side, he was always there talking to her, he did not want to let her go. My mother told me that the last thing my aunt told to her was something this man, ""the devil"" said to my aunt "" i want you"" she ended up killing herself a week after. She was weak and brittle and was basically a walking corpse. A few members of the family came to her funeral, not many though that's what my mother told me. My grandmother did not go. She was embarrassed of her daughter and the fact that she killed herself.

A few months later after the funeral my mother gets off work around 8pm its still light out so she thinks ""why not visit my sister she needs it"" so she walks to the cemetery. It was almost sunset and my mother told me she sees a man placing flowers on her gravestone. My mother has never seen this man before and she starts running towards him as he walks away she starts running faster. He disappears into the woods and just before he did he looked back and my mother saw his ember red eyes.

We often spent the night at each other's houses, but when we spent the night over at his house I would always try to get him to agree for us to sleep out in his huge treehouse, we would stay up till dawn eating candy, chips, and playing playstation until our eyeballs hurt. I always asked him if we could sleep outside because the first and only time we ever slept in his house, I saw this ghost. The ghost himself was a tall man wearing a black coat with a big black hat that sort of looked that that cool hat that Hugh Jackman wears in Van Helsing, and he didn't have a solid or not solid form, I know that sounds weird, but it was like he was there, but wasn't at the same time. I guess the best way I could describe it would be like really thick black static in the shape of a really tall dude wearing a cloak and hat. Well my best friend's little sister would always talk about this guy in the hat, I think the exact way that she referred to him was ""The guy in the hat"", but we were to busy doing our own thing to ever listen to her, to us she was just my friend's annoying little sister that wanted to follow us around and do what we were doing. Well that night while we were playing video games, I glanced down his hallway and at the very end of it there was the man in the hat, but I had only glanced, and when I did a double take, he was gone, so I just ignored it. That sort of glance and disappear thing happened like 2 more times before we went to bed. Now what happened next is what made me never want to spend the night in his house again. We fell asleep just fine, no nightmares, no spooky visions before closing our eyes, but around 3am, no, not exactly 3am, I was young and scared and didn't look at the time, so I'm just guessing it was around 3am, every single radio in his house turned on at the same time and at full volume, and it wasn't music or even just static that played, it was this really deep and low pitch rumble that came out at full blast. It didn't say anything, I don't even know if it was a voice or anything, all I remember is that it scared the living shit out of me. His mom got up and shut off all the radios and yelled at us cause she thought we did it as a joke or something, and wouldn't listen to us when we said were where both sleeping when it happend. My family moved away about 6 months or so after this and I haven't heard from my friend since, I don't know anything about the house or the land or if there was a murder there or whatever, it's just something that happened to me as a kid and something I'll never forget.",I was about 13 when this happend at a friends house.,59,nosleep

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""Is she your imaginary friend?""

""I guess."" 

Amused, he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall, whispering quietly. ""What's your friends name?"" he asked her. 

""Her name is Helen Mary"", she said. 

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

They moved last week. ",The Woman Standing in the Hallway,40,nosleep
blkmagick,8,,6,1r8old,,32,"My father was in the military, which meant that we moved around a lot as I was growing up. One of the places we moved to was Pensacola, FL. We moved there right before 8th grade started for me, and we lived in military housing so we got to live in a two story house for the very first time. I was excited; I got my own room and my own bathroom right across the hallway. 

Things were great, until after a year of living in the house when things started to get strange. I was home alone talking to my boyfriend on the phone when I heard a large crash in the kitchen. I slowly walk in to see what happened, and one of the cabinet doors were wide open and bowls were all over the floor. I quickly pick up the bowls and put them away, freaking out. I was in there just five minutes earlier and everything was closed; there was no way for the cabinet to open on its own. I ran up to my room and locked my door until my family came home. When they returned, they asked why bowls were all over the floor in the kitchen. 

A week after that incident, I woke up suddenly out of a deep sleep, gasping for breath. I looked at my doorway and I see a girl standing there. She was wearing an old white nightgown stained with blood, and she had long black hair. Her throat was slit and hastily stitched up, along with her lips being stitched together. Her eyes were gouged and missing, and her hands were chopped off. 

Thinking it was just my imagination, I closed my eyes and reopened them, only to see she had moved closer. With each blink, the closer she would get, so I threw the covers over my head and prayed that she didn't touch me. I ended up falling asleep and awoke in the morning with her nowhere to be found. 

Over the next year, she would appear every other week, just watching me. I got used to it eventually, because I thought it was just a chronic bad dream and she didn't do anything to hurt me. It wasn't until after we moved to back to Michigan did I get really scared. My sister and I were talking and sharing stories about our house in Florida, and she told me something troubling. She mentioned that if she had to use the restroom in the middle of the night, she would always use my parent's bathroom in their room instead of the one across my bedroom. I asked her why, and her response was:

""Because I would always see a girl in white standing outside of your door and it scared me.""

Knowing that I wasn't the only one that saw her terrified me, because I knew it wasn't just a dream. I still wonder if she appears for the new family that's in the house and who she is and what happened to her. I have to say though, I'm just glad to be out of that house.

I’ve never had suicidal thoughts myself, I’ve been depressed but that’s just life, you can’t be happy all the time. 

**Most** people don’t think of the repercussions that can happen when they have suicidal thoughts as they just think that no one cares about them so they assume that they don’t have a reason to live and just want to end their lives.

Isn’t it weird how one thing can change your life drastically? From good to bad? I don’t know, I can’t explain it but I’ve always found it weird how one thing in the universe can make your life go from being good to bad or vice versa.

                                                                                                                                                                                              


My dad had a great friend (no names) once who was amazing, he had a job that he enjoyed a lot which was him being a train driver.

My dads friend was driving a train to Glasgow when out of nowhere, a person jumped onto the tracks and died instantly. When this happened, my dads friends life just stopped, I can’t really explain it myself as I wasn’t the driver, he was. 

But can you just imagine driving a train, not seeing/seeing a young person jump in front of a train whilst not being able to stop the train from hitting that person? With their blood splattering the window and tracks. I mean the average speed limit of being hit by a car going 30 miles per hour can kill you, just imagine being hit by a train going like 5 times faster than that.

After that happened, my dads friend was just at a loss, he felt like it was his fault as he was the driver. Nothing my dad said, my dads other friends and his family could cheer him up and his life was just spiraling downhill and it was just one thing after another that made him even more depressed and aggressive.

We were the same age and she looked just like me. She would come to school and even stay all night at my house but no one else could see her. She wanted to be seen so badly.Sometimes she would get angry.One time she was so mad she scratched my arm and told me if I said anything to anyone she would hurt my parents.  She was always there staring at me, she wouldn't even blink. One day I started to cry. I was scared. my mother finally asked what was going on and I told her. ""Its Madi mom my friend she's mad at me.""The look on her face went from concern to questioning. ""who's madi honey"" I didn't want to answer her madi was in the corner of the room ripping her hair out and her eyes had grown dark.I told her she was my friend but no one could see her aside from me. My mother at that point thinking it was some silly kid thing began to joke around. ""oh and what does this madi look like?"" I told her she looked just like me and my mother froze.

lovelylizards,4,,4,1rc40h,,29,"I've always loved pictures, it's like capturing memories to look at later. I take them any chance I get. I guess you could call it an unhealthy obsession. Being a little homesick lately, I've been going through old albums. I wish I hadn't.

I invited my sister, Nicole, over. We poured a couple glasses of wine and got out photo albums, scrapbooks, whatever we could find. It was nice having a change instead of my boring routine, but I'd definitely pick that over what happened next. 

After a couple drinks, a few laughs, and tons of pictures, we started to notice something. There was a man in every picture I was in. Just standing there, in the distance, smiling. At first I thought it was just a coincidence, but the more I looked, the more I recognized his face. I've seen this man before. He looked like a normal man, roughly 6 feet, brown hair, bright green eyes. The one thing that was off is that he was always smiling. I didn't think too much of it, it was getting late. Nicole went home by then so I decided to head off to bed. 


I usually never have nightmares, a few in a year at most. Tonight was different. I don't know if you'd call it a nightmare, but it was enough to scare the shit out of me. I was in a dark room, with nothing but a chair and a window. The window didn't open. I could see that man. He was behind a tree and just looking at me, mouthing some words I couldn't make out. Soon after, he started walking towards me slowly. He walked right through the window, he was just about to walk up to me when I woke up in a sweat. I wasn't sure what this meant, or why I was so terrified by it but I shook it off and went back to sleep.

The next day was rather normal. I was out running errands, as usual. It was when I was in Best Buy that I saw that damn guy again. Just smiling at me, staring at me with those bright green eyes. I decided to go up to him. 


""Excuse me, sir. May I help you?""


Nothing.


""Sir?""


Again, nothing. 

After what seemed like forever, just as I was about to walk away he said something. 


""I've been waiting for this.""


""Um, waiting for what?""


""This, you."" 


I got really uncomfortable, and felt it was best to walk away. On my way out the door I heard him say quietly ""Have a nice day, Jennifer."" Okay, how the hell did this freak know my name. I just wanted to go home and sleep. I left the store and continued on my way home. 

As I walked up to my door I found a photograph. It was of me, getting into my car at Best Buy. I was hoping this was just some prank because I didn't want to think of the alternatives. I looked on the back and one sentence has never scared me so much


""I've waited too long."" 


I had no idea what the hell this meant but I was getting sick of it. I didn't know what to do so I decided it would be best to just go to bed and get some much needed sleep. As I laid down and got comfortable, I heard a scratch by the window.

sgtatarms123,1,,13,1r20rb,,30,"I have been getting singular phantom door bell rings at my house, that only i am able to hear, my mum and dad don't hear anything.

The first instance was about 5 months ago, i heard a singular door bell ring at 7am, it woke me up, and i didn't think much of it. Later that day i asked my mother if she heard anything and she said no you're dreaming.

Now im not a crazy person, i am probably the most sane person you would ever meet, in addition i don't do drugs, or drink

So i don't think much about it, thinking my parents their old im young, young people have better hearing than old people.

But this keeps happening around the same time 7am, and im thinking who the heck is this, is this some joke is this the delivery man?

No it wouldn't be a delivery this early ever

Whenever im home alone i have the habbit of whenever the door bell rings i don't answer it, so it was about 4pm one day and a singular door bell ring happens, i tip toe and peek out the front window, i wasn't very fast so i saw nothing, and it never rung again.

A month later, its about 6pm, singular door bell ring, im there in 20seconds, nothing, front gate not moving, again me alone in the house.

Am i imagining all this? there is no way i am not crazy

Coincidence or not, a few days later my mum is in the house, the door rings, my mum answers, its my elderly neighbour.

So i think to myself so it was her all along, all those times i never answered the door it was her, even the times at 7am, shes old ok old people wake up early... ok case closed right.

Today

4:53am singular door bell ring, wakes me up from my sleep, i am not freaking crazy, you know how a door bell sounds, its long it lasts about 3 seconds, i am awake and i can hear the second half of the ring all around my house

I go back to sleep because i was tired, then it rings again at 7am... i tell my mum when i wake up says she didn't hear anything

Heres the good part my dad thinks im crazy too so bought some cctv security cameras and has installed one at our front porch

Today I rewinded the tape to 6:45am, 

I see two lumps laying vertically on our front porch, it is two people in sleeping bags

Skip forward to 6:55am

They get up, I see two men one wears a long brown coat and a black hat, he is big and fat but i couldn't see his face, the other guy is thin and small, he was wearing grey sweat pants and a grey sweater...

Him i saw, his face was skinny and pale almost half skeleton he has yellow rotten teeth

7:00am

I see him ringing our door bell then go back to sleep in his sleeping bag same with big fat guy, they zip themselves up before you could see their heads but here they zip themselves all the way up, and inch away like caterpillars, out of camera view (this took 3mins)

WTF - was this their sick way of saying thankyou for your hospitality 

(I rewinded the tape further they came at 3:09am and started sleeping on our front porch)

I think the ring at 4:53am meant the time they showed, i might have been in deep sleep the other times idk. I also think they hop our fence, I told my dad to put a camera there too, called cops shown them this, there's a patrol car outside our house right now.

WILLingtonegotiate,11,,5,1rdxhm,,29,"Well to start things off I have a hard time convincing myself that any of this is supernatural. Just extremely weird, somewhat scary. It may be due to the fact I worry about my families safety, more than anything. Well, I will start from the beginning.

We moved into our new home around the end of August. We resettled here in San Antonio due to my wifes employer requiring her to live here.  I say ""new"" home because it is just that, a NEW home. The neighborhood is new as well. All the homes are brand new the oldest being around a year old. We love the area. Awesome neighbors, rural setting, though stores still within walking distance. 

We know absolutely nobody in this town, so we have pretty much stuck to ourselves in the short time here so far. We live in a 4 bedroom house, with our three children's rooms upstairs and my wife and myself sleeping in the master bedroom downstairs. Our room is literally 10 feet from the front door. I say this because my story revolves quite a lot around that very front door.  

Around our third night in the new home is when it started. DING......DONGGGGGG!!!! The second part of the doorbell sound was separated by about 2 seconds. I don't know why I find that eerie.   DING......DONGGGGGG. 
DINGDONG DINGDONG DINGDONG
These three were quite rapid taps on the doorbell.

I must have woke on the first ring but did not quite have my mind working yet, much less my body. I open my eyes and hear the long drawn out sound of the doorbell being pressed firmly. Then three rapid taps. My room is completely dark, only lit by the blue lights of the alarm clock. This same clock showed me at this moment it was 2:30 am. 

""Wtf"", I thought. I immediately started fidgeting in my drawer for my handgun, it's a Glock 23 with an extremely bright light attached just under the barrel. It would be quite handy in a few minutes.  I grab a magazine, slide it in and chamber a round. With a flick of the switch the super bright beam illuminates my room and my clear path to the front door.

As I sleepily stumble my way to the front door I hear another rapid ring of the doorbell followed by a deep, loud, booming knock.  I check through the peephole and can make out the top of a mans head, as if he were leaning on the door, listening for any type of movement coming from within my house. I place my weapon on the door around where I figure this persons head to be and I speak.

""Who is it?!!"" I shouted

My question was greeted by only what I can describe as the loudest silence I had ever felt wash over me.

Again I shout, ""Who is it?!!"".
And I hear him for the first time.
""It's me, Daniel"", replied the dry, calm yet exhausted voice of the man outside my door. 
""I do not know a Daniel!"" I replied sternly. ""What do you want?"" I asked.
""I've been left here, I do not know where I am and I just need a place to sleep."" Replied the oddly calm voice just inches away from the barrel of my gun.
""You have 3 seconds to leave my property or I will shoot you where you stand!"" I said this with a very loud and booming command. In retrospect this seems harsh and I am not proud of it. It was after 2am and I was worried for the safety of my family. I mean no ""good"" person would do this type of thing to a stranger, right?

I start to count, ""1...........2"" just then I look out the peephole, and no one is there. ""3"", the 3 was noticeably quieter than the previous two in the countdown. I have a bathroom just off the foyer and it's window has a clear view of the front door.  I peer out of it, no one there. I think to myself ""okay, he got the point."" Oh shit what if he didn't and this asshole is now taking revenge on my wifes car or worse my baby (truck). I decided I would need to go outside, against my inner monologue telling my white ass to stay inside.

I enter my room to grab my shoes, and got a shock as my wife broke the silence.

""You are not going outside after that!!!"" She exclaimed. She must have heard the entire thing.

""Do you want this asshole screwing with our cars?"" I asked.

""I could care less, you are NOT going out there!!"" She again rattled off.

""Baby, go back to sleep I will be fine."" I assured her.

I get my shoes on, go to the front door and that is when I saw something so  simple yet extremely terrifying. The door had been unlocked this whole time. I do not know why but this had a huge effect on my nerves at the moment that it was noticed. I check the bathroom window once again a quickly snap open the front door while sweeping every bit of the front porch with the barrel of my weapon, the beam from it's attached light painting my yard as if it were the broadest brush in the pale. Nothing. I step outside and onto the wet grass. I check the side yard closest to my door, and then start towards the driveway. The vehicles looked fine as I could see them clearly due to the very bright street lamp illuminating my driveway. No sign of ""Daniel"". I start to check the other side of my home when I hear it. Thinking of it right now sends chills all the way down my body. 

""I'm right here."" Replied Daniel in a scratchy but clear whisper.

This was so chilling at the time, that I could not bring myself to turn around right away. It felt as if he were inches from me. Right behind me, staring. I feel a little embarrassed to say it took quite a lot of courage to turn around, but when I did, I was surprised. Daniel had not been directly behind me, but about twenty feet away, sitting on the curb beside my driveway facing away from me. His silhouette small and twig like. There was a lot of light coming from the street light across the street yet he seemed strangely dark. As if he were able to escape the lights grasp ever so slightly. I remedied this with the light beaming from beneath my pistol. When I illuminated him, it was not what I was expecting. 

Maybe my being terrified at the moment had me thinking irrationally. I was expecting an old bearded ghost of a man waiting for me to peer into his cold dead eyes, only to grasp my soul and rip it out through my throat, I know, too many movies right? This was a noticeably unkempt young man but not dirty, more of a grungy type of look going on. He was wearing a vertically striped orange and green striped tight fitting sweater, he was african american and seemed to be in his early twenties. He sat there seemingly in no hurry to turn around and greet me, legs stretched out into the street, hands placed palm down stretched out behind him, fingers noticeable grasping at the blades of grass between them. 

""What do you need?"" I rattle off, with an understandably shaky voice.

""Only what I asked for."" He replied, again way too calm for the situation. 

""I suggest you get up and move on before I call the police!"" I say. I crinfe now thinking of how I reacted to this young man. 

""That will be fine, would you do that for me, would you call them for me?"" He spat back, as he peered slowly over his right shoulder at me, his eyes closed tight seemingly due to my extremely bright light beaming into the back of his head.

""Sure, do you fucking realize how close you were to being shot man?"" I ask.

""Why on earth would you shoot me? I could have walked into your home, without ever knocking, right?"" He said this the way a mother would say it to her child when revealing she knew a secret the child thought nobody knew.

""Alright, move the FUCK on dude, NOW!"" I shouted but noticeably terrified now.

He rose to his feet, seemingly in one movement. Turned to me, his hand stretched out as to block the beam of light so he could open his eyes and look at me. He opened his eyes which were noticeably bloodshot and just looked at me, staring as if he were asking me to lower the light, which I did. As I did this he showed me his hands first palm then the back of his hands like a magician would when assuring his audience he had nothing up his sleeves. He brought his hands to his face and covered it, while rubbing it quickly as someone would while washing their face. He slowly lowers his hands to his side and then looks straight up into the sky, and then slowly down towards me. He smiled, and said in a hushed but very deep voice. 

""Call them motherfucker!""

I raise my weapon back up and start to back into my driveway towards my door, every few steps I make towards my door he makes one towards me.

""Call them motherfucker!"" He screams. As if he knew what the outcome of the call would be.

""Take one more fucking step, and it will be your fucking last!!!"" I shout, my finger fighting the urge to squeeze of a round into his torso.

He stops in his tracks, cocks his head at an angle and presents a very dramatic frown. Followed by a snarl. His face seemed to twist and contort while staring at me with the most anger I had seen on a human face, ever.

I get into my home grab my phone a run upstairs to a window to get a view of this motherfucker while I call the police. My wife was already up there, she must have been watching the whole thing. I quickly dial 911 while ushering my way to the window. As I peer down at him, he slowly looks up at us, still snarling.

""Call them, motherfucker!!!!"" His scream muffled a bit by our walls but still noticeably louder than before.

I get the operator on the phone, never breaking eye contact with Daniel.

I explain everything to the operator as they assure me she has officers on the way.

She calmly starts to ask for more details. What is he wearing, physical description, what has been said, did he physically attack me, was he still there, did he have any weapons, do I have any weapon? The questions seemed to go on and on. She then says.

""Sir you should be able to see the lights from the unit arriving, can you see it?"" She asked

""Yes!"" I exclaim.

She then asked for me to stay inside until the officers knock at my door. I immediately head down stairs and there is the knock.

""Poh-leece!"" A male voice shouted.

I opened the door, and was greeted by an officer. The cop was about mid 30's, portly and visibly sweaty. 

""You called in a disturbance?"" He asked.

""Yeah, did you grab him? I replied.

""Hell no, is he still here?"" He snarked. 

""Well he was ten seconds ago."" I said.

We both walk out into the yard where we had stood. No sign of Daniel. I explained everything to the officer as I have just done to all of you. He seemed to believe it all and was also a bit shaken. 

""Damn, that's some crazy shit!"" He said with a look of astonishment.

""You're telling me!"" I replied. 

He retreats to his car for a few moments and comes back. He explains that a family had just reported their 17 year old son missing. Their son was african american, tall, and most importantly his name was Daniel. He explained further that Daniel was a diabetic and they worried he may be going into some sort of diabetic fit. Everything started to fit perfectly. There was a reason he was so irate and up and down. This wasn't a maniac, it was a young man that was simply ill. My emotion went from scared for my family, to scared for this young man. As we are standing there in my yard, the cop and I. We hear it.

CRACK!!! ..........CRACK CRACK CRACK CRACK!

Five very noticeable gunshots rang out. Followed by my neighbor, a 60 something asian widow, running from her house, handgun swinging wildly back at her home. She was screaming, quite literally bloody murder.

As I stand there paralyzed with shock, the officer quickly draws his weapon and starts shouting commands.

""Put the weapon down, now!"" He screams thunderously.

""I killed him!"" She shouted while simultaneously throwing the handgun to the ground recklessly.

The officer orders her to the ground, approaches her slowly and quickly handcuffs her. He starts to search her, stands her up, walks her to his car and retrieves the thrown weapon. All while I am standing there in horror.

He shouts for me to go into my home and stay in there.  It turns out Daniel saw the lights about the same time I did. He must have quickly ran to my neighbors and ran through an unlocked door. My neighbor found him standing in her living room, naked and apparently slamming her cats head into the wall. She said he had the cat by the tail and was swinging it violently into the wall, blood splattering everywhere. She retrieved her handgun and shot him 5 times, running out her door immediately after.

I was told he was dead before he even hit the floor. She hit him with three bullets. One through the neck, one through the thigh and one, the fatal one, through his temple. I met the young mans family, who actually was pretty hostile towards me. They wanted, quite surprisingly, to sue my neighbor for wrongful death or some shit. I cannot judge them as I do not know what they must be going through.

Oh yeah, I forgot the craziest part. After the police officer ordered me back into my home, my wife and I found something that send chills down our spines. Lying there at the foot of our bed, a pair of shoes and socks. You guessed it. They were Daniels.

One of my co-workers, Will, used to work in LA, moving his way up the ranks as a screenwriter, but moved to my city for his marriage. We both started talking one day about how we love to write and started tossing ideas back and forth. We both have a knack for the horror genre and decided that we would work together on writing a horror screenplay. This was about a month ago, and as of yet we haven't been able to sit down and work on anything together. 

On saturday we were both working and took our lunch break at the same time. We started talking about when we could get together to work on the screenplay and that's when the story came up. Will knows how much I love anything creepy and how invested I am in the paranormal, so he shared something another one of our coworkers, Chelsea, had told him. 

After he told me her story, I had to meet with her. She worked on Sunday and I asked Will to talk to her to see if she would be okay with discussing it with me. Yesterday I received a text from Will saying that Chelsea would really love to talk to me about the situation. 

One thing I should mention is that i have a family history of being involved with the paranormal. I have had many of my own experiences along with helping out friends of friends with questions they have about the topic. 

So yesterday I went in to talk to her about what had happened and this is what she shared with me:
She has a son who is about two-years old named Lucas. A week ago Lucas woke up in the middle of the night screaming at the top of his lungs. Chelsea ran to his room and tried to calm him down, but nothing seemed to work. She decided to take him into her room to sleep with her, but when she did this, he freaked out even more. She said that Lucas was fixated on one corner of the room and kept staring at the corner, repeating ""No, no, no..."" over and over. This obviously creeped her out, so she took him out of the room and he seemed to calm down. A couple nights ago, the same thing happened, but this time he pulled the sheet over his head as though to hide from something that was standing in the corner. The second night he freaked out, she had to take him on a car ride around the block just to calm him down.

She said that her room has always felt off to her and that she often gets the feeling that there is a presence in the room with her. I asked if she owned any pets and she told me that she has a dog. Chelsea then proceeded to tell me that the dog has acted strange in the room before as well. 

I asked her if there was anything else important I should know and she shared that her older son had said he saw a ghost in her room the other day. I'm not sure it's linked though, because he happened to ""see"" the ghost after the first incident with Lucas.

After I had asked her all of my questions I told her to start paying attention to certain details and to note them as they happen. I gave her my number and told her that if anything happens or if she has any questions, she should call me. At this point in time I don't think she has anything to worry about, but I told her that I would like to come visit her son and her house to see if I can get a reading on anything. 

I'm not sure when I'll be able to visit her house or if anything else will happen, but if something does happen, I'll make sure to update those who are reading this.",My Co-worker's Son,35,nosleep

I’m writing this because I simply cannot sleep and there’s something I really need to tell someone, and I find this reddit to be a good place to do so. It is something that is not what you’d consider in the domain of classical horror stories, like zombies or ghosts. It is not, because it was, and I’m afraid still is, real. 

It is so real that it happened 11 years ago, when I was only 7, on a cold morning of December. As you can see, not the night of 31st October. Just the placid, boring morning of 7th December. I was in bed, and I knew my parents were already out, they liked going on morning jogs together. It was a Sunday and my head was throbbing. I have frequent migraines and that 7th December migraine was particularly bad. So there I was, feeling shitty and thinking about lunch, when I moved and my bed creaked. The house was old, like proper old, and we had just moved in (in this regard that part of my life did sound like the beginning of a cliché horror story). I thought it was just temporary anyway, once dad left his job we would leave to California.

When I was a kid I had this habit of putting a pillow over my face when I had a migraine, normally one of those useless small pillows always hanging around. They were always cold, and the cold felt good on my forehead and cheeks. It might sound a bit stupid to you, but to me, it felt good for a few seconds. On 7th December I did this and suddenly, I could not remove the pillow.

I tried to remove it with all my strength, and whoever, whatever, was pushing down, gave in. It was more or less the strength of a skinny teenager. I started panicking, scared, my legs twisting and my heartbeat shooting through the roof. I didn’t even wonder what was happening. I managed to catch a breath and then it happened, all of a sudden. I heard the light switch of my room go out, and the blinds closing violently, and the pressure on the pillow suddenly increased. Twice, then tenfold. It was no longer the strength of a human being but something else. I felt my mind slowdown from the lack of oxygen and I stopped fighting. I felt a strange calm wash over me. Whatever was killing me was impossible to fight, it was like there was a ton of stone over that pillow. I saw a light, my vision going white and then tunneling, and I heard whispers. I was dying. I felt scared then. I put my hands over the pillow, but there was nothing there, and I only felt the hairs of my arms standing up. My hands were not smashed as I expected. My young brain could not make sense of it, but I remember 
being scared, really scared. That’s when I heard a bark.

My dog, Thor, had heard me twist and struggle in bed and had come, to my lucky rescue. The pressure immediately disappeared, the blinds opened and the light turned on and that’s when I felt it, sliding over my right arm, like a hand caressing it, but a dead hand, callous and cold hand, and I felt it, whatever it was, turning and hiding under the bed, like a snake hiding under a rock. Thor kept barking madly, teeth showing and ears back. He was a German shepherd, huge for the standards. Then he neared my bed, looked under my bed, growling and then stopped. He sniffed once, then twice, looked again under the bed, and then climbed on top of the bed and licked my face, where I laid, regaining my breath and control over my limbs, which had gone a bit numb. I remember hugging Thor and almost crying.

I told it to my parents but they did not believe me, they thought it was the migraines and started talking about a psychologist or psychiatrist and bad grades at school. I remember being angry with their reaction, but over time it faded. It took some time for me to sleep again and Thor always slept in my room, sometimes even with me, but there were never any more issues. I never even remembered it from time to time, it was just a scary, traumatic memory my brain just erased. For 11 years, I slept over that memory, over whatever was under my bed.

We moved out a month ago, after 11 years, to a new modern house in California, where my bed doesn’t even have space under it and I love it. My dad sold the house to this young couple who were his friends, who didn’t have much money, but loved the retro feeling of the house. Back then, I didn’t even remember that scary event 11 years ago.

That’s when, as I was laying on my new bed yesterday, I remembered, along with all my morning nightmare details 11 years ago, my dad complaining the other day at dinner table how John and Mary, the young couple, haven’t phoned or said anything about the house since they started living there.

I went to get Thor in my bedroom. I can’t stop thinking about it and I hope they are alright.

sinbysilence,9,,2,1r49de,,28,"Okay. You have to believe me. And what I'm about to say is going to make you not believe me. But please, be patient with me.

You're not real. At least, the you who is reading this isn't real. You only exist because my mind tells you to exist. Regardless of how unbelievable that sounds, I know it to be true. You're helping me cope. You're helping my brain stay active.  And, I believe, to some degree, you're helping keep me alive.

Since there's no better place to start,  I'll just start at the beginning. Back before I knew you existed. Back when you had the possibility of being real.

Back when my normal life got catapulted into this current situation.  I lead a very mediocre life. Living paycheck to paycheck, small group of friends, and no one in my life worth falling in love with. I was on my way to work, just like every other day. Stopped to get coffee. Lit my cigarette as I left the gas station. I began my morning commute.  It was all very routine. Until the car pulled out in front of me.  I stood up on my brakes, but still hit him at an abrupt 45 miles an hour. I ran the red light.  My seatbelt burned my chest.  My head  was blasted by the air bag. My femur protested against the impact until it snapped. The pain was dizzying.  Disorienting. I dug for the phone that flew out of my hand. Mom was still  on the line, crying. She heard what had happened and was over an hour away. But her and dad where on their way.

Now this is what I believe may have happened next. I think I remember getting out of the car and being put on the stretcher. I remember the god awful pain of having my leg reset on the side of the road. That had to be real, right?  It hurt so badly. It was the most earth shattering pain I've ever felt. Once I got to the hospital I was drugged and put to sleep to prep for surgery.

I faded in and out all week. After four nights, I woke to a conversation with my mom. I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night and, considering the drugs in my system, I was very much alert. My mom snapped to attention when she felt me stir. I look at her as though she was a stranger. I'll never forget the confusion I felt as I asked her...""who are you? ""

""It's me, Em. It's mom.""

""Where am I?"" I cried, tugging at the IV on my hand. 

""You're in the hospital,  sweetie.  You were in an accident. ""

""Was it bad?"" I begged for an answer. ""Was it bad?"" I was more hysterical the second time.

I never got an answer. Even when I woke up the next morning she acted as though the conversation never took place. And here's why: I never woke up. Instead,  my brain started to build my new percieved reality. Looking back on it, I think that conversation we had was the last real one I had. Because the accident WAS bad. Because I am still suffering from it, to some extent.

Suffering may not be the best way to put it. Sure, the first two months were brutal. I had to relearn to walk. I had to have help getting in an out of the shower. I had headaches. I got dizzy and sick often. I couldn't work. But it had to seem real.

Now,  life is amazing. I've met the person who made me believe in soulmates. I'm back at work - they even transferred me closer to home and gave me a raise when I came back. Remember how I was the one who ran the red light?  The guy I hit doesn't want to sue me. My life couldn't be anymore perfect if I wrote it myself. Because I have wrote it myself. My brain has created a life to make everything seem normal. I would have never questioned it if it weren't for the other night when I caught a glimpse of reality.

""Nurse...nurse...I think she's waking!"" 

Mom?

Opening my eyes felt like I was fighting a week without sleep.

""Where am I?"" I mumbled.  I hurt. It made no sense.

""You're in the hospital,  baby. You were in an accident, but it's okay. You're going to be okay. I'm so glad to see your eyes.""

Accident? I don't remember anything in my recent history that would have landed me in the hospital. I've been overly precautious these past five months. I voiced my confusion out loud.   ""What accident? I've not been in an accident since June."" 

I saw mom's face fall from optimism to sadness. I asked again, ""what accident?  Was it bad?"" I was scared. Scared because I didn't remember an accident. Scared because of how badly I hurt and didn't know why.

""Sweetie, you've been here since June.""

And then I understood. Why she was so happy to see my eyes. They had been shut since June. 

""Is it bad?"" But before she had a chance to answer, I was drifting again. And the next thing I knew,  I woke up in my bed with my boyfriend at my side.

Since that night, I occasionally catch bursts of their conversation inside my hospital room. Remember how I said I think you're helping to stay alive? 

""She's showing good brain activity. That's a good thing. Unfortunately,  it was a nasty bump to her head. But we've seen people wake up from comas after months, years even. So long as her brain remains healthy, there's no reason not to hope for the best.""

Sounds optimistic,  right? So why am I scared?

I've built an amazing life inside my head. I'm afraid I'll have to leave it. I'm afraid that I may soon wake up.

BumpinRapTapes,10,,9,1r0hla,,25,"So I got a call from a telemarketer, nothing weird about that really.  But before I hung up the automated voice started spitting out stuff like my address, age, stuff like that.  And then my social security number.  Then a list of my room mates.  And then I was concerned.  I waited until the machine stopped, expecting some numbers to press for more info or whatever so I could find out what's up and get myself off their call list.  All the lady robot said though was ""The Intermed company thanks you.""

Reasonably concerned I started doing some research, after ignoring a bunch of message board sites  I finally found what I think was the Intermed site (in like the fifth page of results).  This is all it said:

""Intermed is at the forefront of the organ trade market and thought processing innovations.  All our services are backed with industry leading research and proven by numerous customer testimonials.  Many of our customers are satisfied to the point of frequent return, and we pride ourselves in maintaining our client pool.  Products and services offered by our company are backed with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime maintenance, all available with a phone call.  Hereditary conditions of the mind and body are often the only thing holding you back from reaching your full potential.

Never again will the flaws of your fathers keep you from the life you deserve.  Even the best and brightest are far from perfect, and we strive everyday to make you, the perfect human being.""

Nothing else.  White page, black text.  That's it.  I decided to backtrack to the message boards to see what I could find.  This led me to some random sites and eventually I found a few message threads of people sharing stories similar to mine.  A weird robot caller with way too much information.  One guy got the call in the wee hours of the morning and totally laid a boner kill on a sweaty night with his lady.  They all seemed to be on the same hunt I was, except for one username that I saw pop up on a few of the sites, he called himself ASimpleCipher.  All this dude did was sing Intermed's praises, how he and his friends had used their ""products and services to tremendous avail"" and ""would recommend to anyone!""  All very cheesy and all seemingly marketing plants.  Since that was my best lead I decided to make an account on one of the thread sites and try and get in contact with him.

I sent him a rather aggressive message, which may've been a mistake looking back.  But regardless, and unsurprisingly, I got no response.  I decided if worse came to worse I'd just deal with it when it came up.  I put the whole thing in the back of my mind.  For a few months.

Then ASimpleCipher responded.  Here's a copy and paste of our correspondence:

[Me]  Hey man it's really obvious you work for intermed, you're not fooling anyone.  I want to know who you are, what intermed is and how you got so much of my information.  And I want MY private information deleted from your database, and I want off your call list.  Immediately.  I will not hesitate to get a lawyer involved if this goes any further.

[ASimpleCipher]   I appreciate your interest in my company, Ben!  As always, customer care is a top goal at Intermed.  My representatives tell me that based on market research, you would be a prime candidate for our products and services.  As a courtesy, we like to know as much as we can about potential customers, so as to provide the best quality care possible.  Like you, I once felt a terrible weight in my life, one that rendered me incapable of reaching my full potential as a human being.  When doctors could not help me mend the flaws given to me by generations past, I took matters into my own hands.  As it came to pass, that effort is what gave way to this current business venture.  You may hesitate at terminology like ""Thought Processing"" and ""Organ Trade"", but let me assure you the danger begins and ends at the television screen.  So, if I may, I'd like to draw some common ground between yourself and I.  We do share many similarities.  As a young man, I was plagued with severe asthma (like yourself) from my mother's side of the family, leaving me unable to compete physically with my peers.  This lead me to more intellectual endeavors as I began to mature into an adult.  Cruel as fate is however, I soon discovered I'd inherited a more severe form of my grandfathers autism.  His genes riddled me with social anxiety, and I was thus outcast from much of any community I was ever a member of.  In spite of my flawed genetics I was only more driven to clear the blemishes of my being.  Nothing, I vowed, would hinder my quest for perfection... of the perfect human being.  Given to me from my lineage, however, was the savvy and cunning of generations of businessmen.  

Years, centuries it seems, passed while I honed my craft and built my empire.  Once one is outcast from society, one develops a strong callous to sympathy.  Under a mutual agreement of confidentiality between you and I, I will admit to using almost every associate of mine as merely a means to my own end.  Well, that end is Intermed.  Intermed is my true brainchild, as it were.  I will also admit to misleading you a bit, giving the facade of a full staff under my employ.  Let me assure you I am fully capable of operating this venture on my own.  Let me also assure you your personal information is safe and sound, as I said, I only aim to ensure the best service possible.  Never miss a detail is a creed I operate under.

Enough business however!  Even a jaded outcast such as me has need for camaraderie!  During my time working in the shipping industry I found myself in Northern California in the early 1960's.  My business associate at the time was a rather unstable man.  Every bit of his free time, it seemed he would study the art of coded language, ciphers, cryptograms... whatever one may call them.  Strangely, he got me very interested in the art and it has since become a favorite hobby of mine.  Of course his were much more complex than anything I cared to attempt, he was also versed in astrology and loved to incorporate knowledge of the stars into his little puzzles (This earned him quite the sinister reputation after we parted ways).  On the other hand, I preferred to leave little clues here and there, woven into my business dealings.  Now imagine what fun it would be if someone figured out my little puzzles!  All that work of building a persona of mystery!  Unravelled by a thread I'd left loose for some cunning soul to pull!  Really, I thought someone would've found it by now.  Even after everyone I've tried to sell Intermed's services and products to it is you, cunning lad, who has finally made contact.  Very clever, indeed.  Of course you saw my companies website.  I admit it is a bit sparse, a work in progress.  Reducing my mission for Intermed to a single paragraph however, I did put in a bit of extra effort.

I have been rambling though, I do apologize!  Thank you for inquiring about my company, I hope my response has eased any concerns you may have.

I really don't know what to make of this guy.  It really can't be some prank, the guy knew I had asthma as a kid.  How?  I have to say that I've never experienced such an air of creepiness from pure text.  Something about the way he composed his message was off.  I don't know.  I can't make a lot of sense out of any of this.  I stopped my investigation there, being as I have seen too many horror movies and don't like the idea of rabbit holes.  It's been a few months since and I haven't heard anything from Intermed or ASimpleCipher.  I check the thread site every now and then.  I did go back and check out the Intermed website again.  I'm really not one for puzzles, I can't make anything out of it.  So I'm submitting it here to see if someone is more ""cunning"" than me.  I hope so.

NeonPaint,12,,6,1ra0o4,,26,"I need someone to help me. I need to actually be able to go to sleep and not worry about what I'm going to wake up to. I need it to stop.
The past few days have been enough to make me pack up and check myself into the crazy house. It would have to be better than this. 

I work at a nursing home. It's not a luxurious job for sure but this nursing home makes my job interesting. It's haunted. I know it sounds stupid but it really is. We have a shadow that haunts one room and our residents will act in ways that will set you on edge. I guess the most recent example is Dessy, I obviously cannot provide you her real name but this is a nickname I have given her myself. 

Dessy is a cute little old woman. She is the grandma you wish you could have. We've always had a pretty good companionship. A couple weeks ago she changed. Her appearance and her personality completely shifted. Her eyes become sunken in, hair was constantly messy when it used to always be well groomed, teeth started to turn a nasty yellow, and her feet...dear god her feet...they looked like they belonged to a creature who only resembled a human in the slightest way. The best way I can explain her feet is that they looked like long fingered hands with jagged finger nails, they didn't look like they belonged to some little adorable woman of 92. 

She started saying *things* to me. There was one conversation that has stuck with me. 

""Dessy, do you want to go to the dining room tonight?""

""Fuck...fuck...you little **whore**.""

""Excuse me? Why are you saying that? Honey, you can eat in your room, I just wanted to make sure...""

""How does it feel whore? Little slut you fucking slut you whore you **SLUT**.""

""You need to stop being mean. How bout we go into the bathroom and you can go before dinner?"" 

At this moment, she shuffles into the bathroom with me and I grab her pants to pull them down.

""You fucking slut. Does he do this to you? Does he put his hands in your pants? Does he fuck you with his hand? He fucked that little virgin c--t......virgin....whore slut **fuck** you...with his hand....virgin c--t c--t c--t."" 

I went white as a ghost. I was close to Dessy but this old woman never knew anything about me other than my age, my name, and that I wasn't married. I never spoke a word to her about anything sexual but she knew *things*. My personal life isn't something I want to share but her mentioning those last words did relate to me in a very personal way. I looked at her as if the devil himself were standing in front of me. And then she smiled. I can't explain to you guys the smile this woman gave me, how it made me cringe, how it made me sick. 

Fast forward from that moment to a few days ago. Stuff starts happening to me at my house. It began with scratching. One night I heard scratching coming from the walls then it was above me in the ceiling then back to the walls. I didn't think it was too scary until it started to follow me around the house. If I went into the kitchen, the scratching would follow. I couldn't get away from it. But I soon realized there are **much** scarier noises out there.

The moaning is what followed and it's been driving me to the brink of insanity. Every night I hear this awful moaning. Like someone is in this house crying out from a pain I can never imagine. I get up, I search for who ever or what ever it is. If it sounds like it's coming from the living room, I run to the living room but as soon as my feet hit the carpet, the moaning is now in the kitchen. It plays with me. Toys with my mind and makes me run around here on an endless hour consuming search of where it is coming from. If I even want to know where it comes from.

The sound is so sad but it feels unmistakably evil to me. I can't explain it but when I hear it, I know it's a cruel joke. I know people say that they are sensitive to spirits all the time but I have always felt like I have been. I can't sit down and talk to them like all these psychics out there but I will get random thoughts or names or feelings. If a spirit is around, I usually can get a name and maybe a fact or two but *this* has no name, nothing. 

What it does have is a moan that makes me instantly nauseous and it has a *smile*. I haven't seen it in its entirety but I got a glimpse of something that has made sleeping and living here nearly impossible. 

One night when the moaning was louder than usual, I went on the pointless search again trying to find it and figure out a way to stop it. When I walked into the living room, I saw a shadow and it had a smile on it's face that made me throw up right there. It made everything in me want to come up in my throat. After I cleaned up and calmed down, I realized that the smile was familiar to me. Maybe that's why it caused me to get sick, it could have been that my body knew instantly where that smile had been before. Sweet Dessy showed me that smile that day in the restroom in her room. She has never smiled at me like that again, but I can't handle the thought of seeing it again whether it's with or without a face.

The moaning and that smile haunts me. It keeps me running around my house every night because I want it to **STOP**. I haven't had a real nights sleep in days.  I'm exhausted and I'm working a full time job on a quarter tank of energy. Things I usually love to do, I don't have the energy to do. I always liked to post comments on reddit but it's been a couple weeks since I've even done that because the thought of actually reading a post and commenting is too exhausting, it's pitiful.

Two nights ago I was having a wonderful dream. There was nothing odd or creepy to it, just a dream. I woke up in the middle of the night as some people tend to do but then I have wondered since if I ever really did wake up at all. From my bed I watched as 2 figures cloaked in crimsom, one considerably taller than the other, walked into my room. The shorter of the two turned to look at me as he shut off my alarm clock. I woke up the next morning several hours after my alarm was supposed to go off. Did I unplug it in my sleep? Did I even set it in the first place? I didn't want to consider any other options. Last night however tipped the scales in the other direction.

Last night's dream is still fresh on my mind. I was on a mission to stop a bomb going off. I had a key and as I raced through the city streets I checked my watch every block to see how much time I had left. I made it inside the building, rounding the last corner, checking my watch one last time and saw that I had just 2 minutes to spare but when I looked up I was no longer dreaming. I was on my couch, looking eye to eye with the hooded figures as they sat only inches away. They were green, withered. The red of their cloaks matched only by the red of their irisis. No glow to be found, however they had perfect white teeth. The smaller of the two had the larger smile, clearly taking pleasure in what he was about to do.

 ""I'm sorry but we can't let you do that."" 

It was then that I noticed a small familiar watch in his hand and didn't really realize what he did as he removed the final 2 minutes from the timer. I was back in the dream, staring in horror at the monitors of the console I was supposed to have reached in time. Millions dead, cities in ruin, more carnage then I have ever witnessed. I broke, fell to my knees and cried until the building's security came and apprehended me.

I was getting ready for work, my job is night cook at a local restaurant.
I left the house, noticing the cool air of November,
And as the chill whispered into my lungs, I felt,
As cliché as it sounds, as if I was being watched.

I looked around, nothing was there.
But when I finally shrugged it off, and got Into my car,
I noticed that my mirrors were all fogged up.

Normally, this wouldn't even bother me, as It's so easy to get out of my driveway. 
But tonight, everything seemed wrong.
As I turned the key, and my engine started up,

I heard my radio move to static, from channel to channel, instead of the usual classic rock station.
Living alone, I have no reason to believe anyone would tamper with my car. I don't have neighbors nearby, and My dog would have warned me if someone was messing around.

Again, I checked my clock and shrugged it off.
I'd be late if I didn't hurry.

As I reached the switch off the static, my radio stopped, 99.9FM. 
And I heard a whisper, at first I thought I was going insane or dreaming.
But I turned the volume up, and could barely make out the words,
""kill...me.......Kill....me...""

When I came in to work one morning my boss was wandering around the workroom looking disgusted.  She kept going between the bathroom and her desk- trying to work but getting nauseous every so often.  Apparently, when she'd rolled up in the parking lot that morning, she'd found something on the pavement.

A wet set of dentures.

We all laughed at how weird that was, and set the things gingerly on a pad of paper towels in the backroom.  No way were we putting a pair of raw dentures in the lost and found tub.  We forgot about them before lunch.

Later that day, though, this guy came in.  I ended up knowing him as ""Irma's Nephew"".

He limped in and asked if we had any books about dentistry.  I told him I didn't know where to find them off the top of my head and proceeded to do a search on the computer.  As I typed things in and scanned our holdings, he kept staring at me.  His eyes seemed too large and white, popping out against his skin.  He kept chewing his lips and the sides of his cheeks.  It was so fierce, so intense and obsessive, it looked painful.

Then he said: ""Teeth.  C'mon, gimme anything about teeth.  How they grow....""  And trailed off.

I was rattled but I managed to scribble a number down on a scrap of paper and gesture towards the nonfiction section.  He hobbled off.

Twenty minutes or so later, it was the top of the hour, and my turn to do a ""walkabout"".  ""Walkabouts"" are a thing our library system made up to make sure nobody is being harassed or molested out in the stacks.  We're supposed to check all the blind spots in the building every half hour.

So, I was doing my walkabout when I spotted Irma's Nephew sitting on the floor between two rows of books.  He glanced up at me, stood, and as I was moving away, caught me.  His hand on my wrist made me nervous, but I looked back at the circ desk and saw Vikki watching us like a hawk.  Somehow this made me brave.  He told me he needed my help, that these books weren't helping.  So I asked him what else I might look up for him.

""No,"" he said, ""I need to talk to you, to someone, to someone, to anyone.  My aunt, she...""  And he trailed off, eyes bugging.

Sadly, money doesn't reach super-far in the library world, and I hadn't been trained on how to properly treat a mentally ill patron.  As a fail safe, I went with gentleness, since he had a hard grip on my wrist.

So, I asked him to talk to me (looking back over my shoulder at Vikki).

This is the best version I can write of the garbled story he told me.  I could just say: ""And then he told me a spooky story"", but that wouldn't explain why I'm jumpy. I apologize that this is long, but I'm trying to get this out in an accurate way.

""I’ve got an Aunt, named Irma, and she pretty much raised me.  She’s like my mother, but she’s been gettin’ on, gettin' on, you know, and recently she’s been forgetting things.  I need these books for her.  She’s got a problem.  A real….. strange thing goin’ on.
	
“Last summer she got all her teeth pulled.  Got dentures instead.  And she hated them, said they always felt funny in her mouth, and I TOLD HER! we’d go get them refit, recast, but she’d still hate them.  She’d just spit them right out onto the carpet and glare at me with her mouth-skin all sunk-in and puckered up.  I’m the only one of the family that visited her anymore.  So that meant she blamed me.  I was the only one around to be hateful to.  Fuck.

""In June, she started doin’ this thing where she’d say she lost her dentures.  Whenever I went over to see her, she’d ‘lost’ them and I’d scold her because dentures are damn expensive.  Pardon me.  But she’d say it’s no problem and grin big.  I’d look all over- turn the house upside down, and not be able to find them.  She’d say “They’ll turn up in no-time” and wave her hand at me like this.  

""The weird thing is that they would.  I’d come over again and she’d have them back in.  Clack them at me and laugh.  Everytime.  Clack, clack, clack.  And laugh.  Clack, clack.
	
""She, uh, she just kept losing them.  I tried talking to her neighbor down the stairs, Lucy, to try and help her out.  Lucy is a nice woman and said she’d check on her when she got the chance.  And she did good.  When I hadn’t been able to visit in a few days, I’d get a text or call from Lucy lettin’ me know everything’s alright with Miss Irma.  
	“Only I got into a car wreck.  Was laid up in the hospital doped out of my brain on pain killers for who-knows-how-long.  Doctor said I’d broken my thigh-bone.  I didn’t see Miss Irma for a long time.  I think I got a call from Lucy at some point but it’s a foggy.  I remember answering and Lucy just murmuring, murmuring something I couldn’t understand.  It must have been the drugs.  It must have been.

So, eventually, I’m better, and I go over there.  I try knocking on Miss Irma’s door.  She never gave me a key, but she always bustled up and let me in.  I knocked and knocked and she didn’t come, so I got nervous, you know?  I went over to Lucy’s then, to see if she had a back-up key, or could call the building manager.  But I when I knock on her door it just kinda…whoosh…opens.
	
I call her name, but nothin’.  So of course I go in, cuz maybe they both in trouble.  But Lucy is nowhere.  Her apartment is just… empty.  Except, just as I’m leaving, I see something pink on the floor.
	
{Here, the guy paused, licking his lips again.  It seemed to me he was winding up his courage, or working past something particularly horrible.}

""It was teeth, ma’am.  Dentures.  A top and a bottom, both.  The top was kinda falling off the bottom, was at an angle.  Like they’d just been dropped and left.  
	
“I knew Lucy didn’t wear dentures, so this scared me a lot, because Miss Irma might be wandering around lost with her dementia.  She’d started forgetting my name.  She could be anywhere, doing anything if she was spitting her teeth out again.
	
“So I run.  Run and find the janitor that sometimes cleaned up the stairwells and he looks at me like I’m crazy.  He says “I thought your gramma moved out last month.” I say “No, sir, you are mistaken.  She can’t have gone nowhere.”  And he says “Well, I ain’t seen you nor her in that time.”  And I argue with him but eventually he comes with me and unlocks the door.   
	
“Inside Miss Irma’s the tv was on, but, she wasn’t in her chair where she’d sit for hours and watch tv.  I mean, she’d sat there so much it had left an impression, her shape.  But that wasn’t all she left.  She also left her teeth. {He was giggling a bit hysterically at this point}
	
“No, not the ones in Lucy’s place.  These were different.  These were more.  These were MORE.  All over.  Pairs and pairs of false teeth were lying all over Miss Irma’s apartment.  They were on bookshelves and on the kitchen table.  The biggest pile was around her chair.  I was confused at first.  There was no way she could have collected all these teeth by herself.  I certainly only bought her the two pairs.  She didn’t have no friends to bring her sets of teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth.
  
""And they were different, too.  As in, some were little.  Like, tiny white baby teeth, just little gappy chips.  And others were big and wide and long.  And some of the sets, I don’t know how they could fit in a person’s mouth.  they were full of fangs and tusks and.

“And it makes no sense.  I can only come up with one idea.  She was on her own for a month, except for Lucy.  I know Lucy didn’t bring her all those teeth.  The only thing I can think is that she was growing them back herself.  That, every time she had ‘lost’ and found her dentures before, she’d just thrown them away and grown a new pair in her mouth.  Then that set would fall out and she’d grow more.  And then they must have started growing strange in her mouth.  And she's gone off somewhere wandering wandering, I can't find her. I don't..  I need help for her.""

I peeled his hand off and somehow got out of there.  I went back and handed him some paper I think had a number for psychiatric help on it.  Really, I went back to the staff bathroom and sat against the wall for a while, breathing and feeling really strange in my stomach.

When I left work, I had to pass the set of dentures my boss found in the parking lot that morning.  I found myself staring at them.

Chenigin,8,,9,1r6b7r,,24,"When I was ten my parents divorced. Soon after I moved into an old house in Orange County CA with my mother and stepfather. This house had a nice floor plan but needed major work. With all the remodeling being done to the house it was not uncommon for my step father to walk around at night to check up on and see how the house was holding up. One night I was laying in bed when I heard heavy footsteps outside my bedroom window. My room was located at the side of the house. Me being young and naïve I automatically thought it was my step dad. I heard the footsteps walk into the garage and enter the house via the garage door. I knew this was the time to go to the restroom because well.. their was an adult and he could protect me from my fears of the dark. When I heard the footsteps walk past my door I slowly opened my door and called out my step fathers name. At the same time I stuck my head out my door and saw the back of a boot I never saw before turn the hallway corner. This made me reconsider how safe it was to go take a leak. I heard a sound in the kitchen.. the distinct sound of the drawers opening and a hand shuffling through its contents. After what seemed like an eternity I decided to call out to my stepfather again, this time slowly creeping out of my room so I can get to the corner of the hallway. As soon as I started to edge forward I heard the heavy footsteps make a b line straight for the front door.. I started to pick up my pace so I could get a good view of who it could be. When I got to where I could get a good view of the door I saw something I would never forget. The door slammed shut and the lock turn to the lock position. As if someone had the key and was locking it from the outside. By then my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I ran to the door to see if I could see who was in our house. When I opened the door I saw nothing... No sight of someone running away.. no evidence of anyone ever being there in the first place.. Just 10 year old me.. standing in the dark.. Suddenly the fight or flight instinct kicked in again.. but instead its the opposite instinct.. fuck! I'm ten.. I am by myself in the dark.. someone just broke into the house! I slammed the door shut and ran into my mothers room. My stepfather right away called the cops and propped a chair to the front door and the garage door so even if someone had the key they could not open it. The cops showed up and didn't find a single thing. No footprints nothing.. My mother turned on me and said it was just my childish imagination making up things.. I started to doubt myself after the years... Chucking it as what my mom said.. my youthful imagination.. I am 24 now.. I don't sleep walk nor have I ever. If it was a dream... I never had one like that ever since. If anyone has any ideas on what I might of experienced please.. I am all ears. I always wondered what other people would have to say about this. Glad to have found Reddit that's for sure. ",Still think about this all the time,33,nosleep
BensonHedges1,2,,14,1r60t4,,22,"I'm writing this from my phone, I needed to get out of the house. I'm sitting at Panera Bread and my boyfriend thinks I'm nuts. In the time I posted my last update to now, Things got worse.

 It was so bizarre - my boyfriend got home around 5pm yesterday and went to take a nap. He worked a detail after his shift, so I was home alone for the most part. I did my best to stay away from the room. My cat just growled.  
There was a good hour of him sitting at the doorway...growling. For anyone that knows him, he's has the most amazing temperment...he never hisses or growls. The entire time my boyfriend was in the room napping, NOTHING. He thinks I'm crazy because I begged him not to sleep in that room...he went to work at 10pm last night, and I slept on the couch. Remember that wind? I have no fucking clue what it was, but I was on a conference call and heard a small rumble from the room. I ignored. Apparently whatever is happening - ignoring makes it worse. A couple minutes later, another rumble, and a smell. I lied when I said the worst smell ever was burnt coffee. This smell was like death. Not the death that a cat drags in by the tail. And then another rumble. As soon as my call was over, I rushed into the room, febreeze in hand. I can't explain it exactly, but as I opened the door to the bedroom, all of that windows made a loud thud like they were closing, but they were open. I sure as hell didn't open them. Is it even possible for them to thud OPEN? What the hell. Against my better judgment I went into the room. It's day time, what can happen, right? There was a stain on the floor - just a big dark stain... I don't want to say blood because it's not mine and fuck this supernatural shit. It got bigger though, like water expanding. I could see it growing, but I couldn't tell if my mind was playing tricks on me. 
I ran.
Fucking ran.

What the hell is my cat seeing? I wonder if this is just my mind playing tricks on me. 

I've had some trouble posting this today - but I haven't been home, and I'm returning tonight. My intention is to sleep in that room. I want to know what's going on, and why it's getting so cold. I'm getting the chills thinking about the chills.

BiohazardTyrant,3,,10,1r4rao,,20,"So to begin, I was eleven years old I believe...

My father had brought me to a friend of his' house. Or rather farm.

I was excited because I had befriended the son of my fathers friend, for stories sake I will call him James. James had a older brother who was a year and a half older, so I was eleven, James was twelve and his brother thirteen. We had all played around the barn and fields plenty of times before. This time though it was a celebration of some sort, I wish I could remember why but anyway, they had been in this house on this farm for about half a year. Tonight was the big party, as in the most vivid thing I remember about that night. The cut off pigs head. Literally just cut right off, and sitting on a support beam about shoulder high to the adults. The body was dangling from a chain for a while, until they skewered it onto a metal pole and roasted it whole over a fire.

I really wish I could remember why they were doing that but sadly I cannot. In any case, me James and his brother were just running around like we always did like idiots. They had all of the farm as a playground and plenty of space to play. We began by walking over to the stalls where they kept the horses and cattle. The sheds were HUGE, and seemed to be endless to a younger kid as myself. 

After about a half an hour of walking through corridors left and right in the dark we started hearing noises, but not normal ones... Like chains being hit on metal and slammed into the ground, then grunts. We all took off running following James' brother who quickly let out out to the closest exit. None of us knew what the sounds were because of the fact the farm had been out of commission for about thirty years. Nothing alive should have been in there. 

We quickly made out way back to the farm house, the big one where all the adults were partying and tried to talk to them about it but of course they had all had a drink or three and ignored us laughing it off as childish imagination. 

For some reason. Some stupid god forsaken reason, James said we should go back out and just play in the field where there was a little light away from the adults and we listened. Once the three of us were out there it turned into a ""I dare you to go out in the field"" game.

We each took turns going farther and farther out into the night. Finally we all ended up ignoring the occurrences from earlier and started playing hide and seek. Bad idea. Very bad.

James and I were hiding in the tall grass near the side end of the barn and his brother came running out faster than I have ever seen anyone run, screaming bloody murder, to get away as fast as we could, get to the adults! James and I ran to him, and stopped dead in our tracks, quickly seeing why he had been fleeing. 

There we were, James, his brother and I all standing still, like sacks of meat staring to the treeline where we saw it. There were three if I remember correctly faces. All white and elongated, just weirdly shaped about six feet off the ground, and then came the true horror, the glint off the blades they were holding. 

We all ran.

Faster and faster we ran.

I turned around two times and I regret it to this day for the fact they were even closer than I thought blades outstretched trying to mince us up and drag us back into those hellish woods. 

We finally made it to the adults. The only thing I remember after that was that damn pig head, cut off, and just sitting there, I could see the spine, and every last vein... we tried telling the adults but they just laughed. None of us left the main barn after that for the rest of night.




About a week later my friend Chris came over, and had the worst part to share with me. He had been having these night terrors of these creatures tearing at him and chasing him through his own new home.

Then he told me his family had left the farm, and moved to the city.

Then he told me why. He was attacked.

Then he showed me, and lifted his shirt up, showing me a scar which I know he did not have before because we used to swim together all the time. He never had a mark there a week before. But now, across his stomach he had a fully healed scar of about ten inches going from left to right, like he had been gutted. But the scariest fact like I said was that it had not been there one night, then he woke up with that kind of scar. 

His family moved because of that, that day. And never returned to that farm.

I have long since lost touch with him, he became very paranoid after that and I just cant forget that.

Figured I would share it with the community, I do hope if any of you take anything away from this, if you see a creature, with a white face, long arms, and a huge blade by a treeline. Run, just run. And try to forget about it.","A tale of a Farm, and three young kids.",30,nosleep
JordanThirstExile,11,,34,1r857m,,22,"It started with the roses. Ever since I was a little girl I loved them. I loved the scent of them, and the colors they came in. I loved them so much that my mother had planted a few rose bushes outside our house so when it bloomed I could sit and stare at those beautiful roses. They bloomed in shades of white, and pink, but my favorite rose was red like satin. It reminded me of my mother and the way she always drew roses on her letters. 


Fast forward to the time I was 14 years old. I was never a popular girl, by far, but I wasn’t unknown either. I didn’t have long blonde hair or blue eyes, but I had talent, a slim body, and an obsession for roses. All my friends knew how much I loved them. They’d buy me perfume in a rose-shaped bottle, or a dress with red roses on them for my birthday.  I made the best out of what I could in high school being a short, brown haired, green-eyed girl. 


It was the day before homecoming when the boy I’d secretly been in love with asked me to the dance with a white rose. I swooned and he took me to the dance the next night. (I, of course, in a rose dress and him in matching colors.) He had brought me a white rose corsage to match my dress. We danced all night, and we continued to date until high school ended. After our senior year we went our separate ways and stopped talking. But this didn’t bother me, I hadn’t time to waste when I was busy with my roses.


In college I had been taking Art classes in my third semester when I got a call one evening informing me that my mother had pasted away in the hospital. 
The following Tuesday we attended her funeral. My father had picked out the colors. We buried my loving mother in pink roses, because she was a former cancer survivor, and we were blessed to have her as long as we did.
For the months following my mother’s death I became deeply depressed. The only thing that eased the pain from losing my mother, were the roses. When they bloomed in the spring my sprits suddenly lifted. The roses were my life, and I don’t know what I’d do without them. 


2 years go by and I ended up meeting a nice guy who joined my ecology class. His name was Dylan and we immediately hit it off. He gave me everything a girl could’ve ever wanted and treated me like a princess. I loved him more than anything in the world. We talked about moving in together and buying a house after college. We talked about getting married and having a daughter named Rose for my love of roses. His handsome blonde hair and chiseled feature would make a beautiful baby.


We went through college and eventually graduated together and got married. We lived in a small townhouse in Vermont for a long time after that. After trying many times to have the baby I so desperately wanted, the doctor came to tell that I was infertile. Dylan tried to tell me we could always adopt, always have a child if I wanted, but I didn’t. It wasn’t fair! If I couldn’t have a child that was my own flesh blood, how would she share the love of roses like my mother did with me? 


Again for a long time I became mute. I could not eat or sleep. Dylan became very distant and we hardly spoke. Everything we had was gone. Nothing made me happy anymore. Nothing would until I had a baby rose. I would look out at our garden and wait for them to bloom, but even then the roses did not make me happy. 


It was the next winter before I found out. I knew something had gone wrong because all of the roses had turned over black instead of falling off and dying. Dylan had come home late that night and seemed very stressed. I decided that night while he slept I’d go through his phone. 


He had 3 missed calls and a text from a girl named “Lisa”. The text read:
“You HAVE to stay home tonight! She won’t stop crying unless you’re here! –Lisa”
Who wouldn’t stop crying? Did someone care that much about my dear Dylan to cry when he’s not there? I remember him saying he worked at the office with a girl named Lisa, so I decided to send her a text replying, “Get her to stop crying, I can’t be that important.” 


After that I waited for a reply for several minutes before I got a reply back.
“Of course you’re important to her love! You’re her daddy! And she needs you here! Just take off work this one night!”


WORK? SHE though HE was at WORK? He was supposed to be at work all day! And WHO’S daddy was she talking about? 


I carefully went through his address book in his phone and found her home address. I silently walked downstairs, and out the door, grabbing a hoe from the garden before leaving in the car.


I knew the black roses meant something was wrong. 


I returned a few hours later with his “baby” in our car. I left her there while I waited behind the house. About an hour later I see Dylan walk out the front door to leave, when he suddenly stops when he sees the child in the car with the windows up. 
He screams “ALLISON!” 


Is THAT the things name? So it IS his! At this point I was furious! 


As he went to unlock the door to retrieve the child, I pulled him backwards so he fell into the garden. I picked up the hoe and shouted “ALL I WANTED WERE THE RED ROSES!”


The hoe dug into his head once, and I felt all the love I’d ever had for him release, into the small, tiny bits of pieces that were once my loving husband. When I was all through I tossed his body into the cellar along with his companion’s. At least now the black roses are blood red once again.


 A beautiful thing, the roses are. 


Little rose lives with me now and she has just enrolled in preschool. She loves the roses as much as I do, but her favorite ones are the dead petals. 


“So pretty!” she said, “Even after they’re dead!” 


I always agree with her on that. Sometimes she asks where daddy is and I must tell her, “Simple, Prim Rose, ask the petals!”

I froze as soon as I looked towards the front of the house. I saw something short, maybe 2-3 feet walking on two legs. It was walking in the direction of my porch or front of the house. I thought it was kinda strange since I live out in the suburbs and something like this would easily be noticed by any of my neighbors. The funny part is we both made eye contact, it noticed that I was looking straight at it. As soon as it did it ran away, and I ran after it. When I turned the corner there was nothing. I ran around the whole house just in case it was running circles around my house. Nada. So yeah I saw that once. No biggie since I havent seen it again or it hasnt messed with my garden.

cmd102,4,,4,1r2xzg,,21," unexplainable experiences are not completely abnormal for me. Every house or apartment that I've lived in, I've seen or heard something that would make a lot of people hide under a blanket or leave the house all together. The man at my window was one story of mine that never fails to make whoever I tell shudder, so I figured I'd share it here.

It began when I was 7 or 8 years old. We lived in an older house, but not one that would instantly stand out as ""creepy"" or ""unusual"". We didn't live in the middle of nowhere, but rather on a street lined with houses on both sides of the road. It was a fairly quiet neighborhood, the kind where the rare car that came down the street would often break up a game of football or hockey that was being played by the kids that inhabited almost every house. It wasn't perfect, but it was great. I was a very happy child. 

One night, I was plagued by a very odd, yet equally terrifying nightmare. I dreamt that I was in my bed, in the room that I shared with my older sister. I sat up and looked out of the window that was next to my bed, which sat in the one corner of my bedroom flush against the wall. The window overlooked the back yard, and in that yard stood a man. He wore a long black coat, a wide-brimmed black hat that hid his face from me, and a black suit. On his shoulder, there sat a very large black bird with red eyes. I stared at him for what seemed like forever, before he looked up at my window. The only features of his face that I could see were his eyes, which were a deep red, just like the bird's. Just as he made eye contact with me, the bird left his shoulder and flew straight at my window. When the bird got to the point where it would have inevitably smashed through the window and probably eaten me, I woke up. I was on my side, facing my sister's bed that was situated in the exact same position as mine, but on the opposite side of the room. I stared at her as she slept soundly, terrified and unable to go back to sleep. I decided that the only way I would get any rest was by looking out my window and proving to myself that the man wasn't really there, so I rolled over and sat up. My curtains were already pulled to the sides of the window, since my bedroom was on the second floor of a house in a decent neighborhood,  we didn't really worry about anyone trying to peep on my sister and me. The second I looked at the window, he was there. Even though he was impossibly directly outside my window,  close enough that he should have left fog with his breath, I still couldn't see any features of the man's face except his blood red eyes. I did what many children would do, I laid back down and threw my blankets over my head. I eventually fell back asleep, despite being scared out of my mind.

The man visited me several times a month for several years after that, always just staring at me through my window during the darkest parts of the night. When my sister moved out, I started sleeping in her bed,  across the room and away from the window. I didn't see the man anymore. 

One day, I was cleaning my room in preparation for my friend to sleep over that night. I knelt on my old bed, still there for when we had guests,  to clean the window. I pulled the curtain aside (as a teenager now, I valued my privacy), and saw a handprint on the glass. It was bigger than my own, but I didn't think anything of it. I had assumed one of my friends had left it there. I sprayed the cleaner and wiped it away with the paper towel, but the handprint remained. A little grossed out, I went over it again, a little harder to scrub the print away. It was still there. That was when I realized that, despite not seeing him anymore, I still received visits from the man with the red eyes.

I just kept clicking through - that was my greatest vice. I could have let it rest. But with every story, my blood pumped faster, my breath came quicker.

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

My stomach is in knots, every heartbeat a hammer blow against my sternum. My hands are shaking. My breath comes in stecatto bursts. I can't hold on much longer. The anticipation is mounting, building to orgasmic frenzy. I found it, the ultimate high. Or rather, it found me. All I had to do was believe. All I have to do is turn around.

My faith is sure, and I know it with every fiber in my being:

This night, I had a friend over. It's not related to the woman or this story at all - it was planned much earlier. I needed some help with my new place so she'd help me and sleep over because we had no idea how much time it would really take.

She had to leave really early, before 7 AM, so I thought I can just sleep until 7 and then go.

But as soon as she went out, I felt something weird. As if there's someone still with me. Someone watching me. I just knew someone is there.

Kind of like when I lived with my parents and I just KNOW they're here even though the door of my room is closed. And I know so I have to get up and check.
That's how it was. 

So I got up to check. Nothing, I couldn't see anything but I could still feel it. I figured the feeling would go away when I look around the apartment and see that there's nothing there. It didn't. It just felt like I was chasing after something and it kept getting away. Like when you try to hold onto something really slippery. 

I felt helpless and very hopeless in that moment. It was much deeper than just not being able to find something I felt was there - it was just an in-general feeling of misery and despair, not related to something specific. 

So I figured maybe I was just getting sick, maybe I was too tried, too stressed, maybe it's really nothing, and I went back to bed. I fell asleep really quickly. 

Then the doorbell rang, I woke up. It felt like I slept for hours and hours, but in reality it was only like 6 or 7 minutes. I went to open the door, guess who it was? The woman.

Yeah, I was terrified and for a moment I thought - I'm done. It's over. Byebye cruel world.

It  wasn't  regular fear, like you'd be afraid when you know there's a reason to, like a gun pointed or an angry dog. It was more like fear of the dark, you don't really know what exactly you fear but it's still scary.

And just to make it clear, once again - she doesn't LOOK scary. She looks normal.
She speaks in a normal tone, with a normal voice. But there's just something about her that makes me want to get away, but in the same way intrigues me - I feel that I HAVE to know.

So I was really holding back the ""what the fuck are you doing here you mad bitch"" rant that was forming in my mind, I just greeted her instead because seriously, what good could come out of getting pissy? Not like that would help now.

She says hi. I'm like uh,umm, yeah, hi. And then she tells me she just wanted to visit me to see how am I doing, how's life, etc, etc. So I'm like wtf, you saw me yesterday and the day before, and the day before. She ignores me. She asks to come in but I tell her I was just planning to get out, I have things to do so  I wouldn't be a good host right now. She says she doesn't mind it all. I say I feel embarrassed about having such a messy home. Maybe when I fix it. I know  she knows I'm lying. But I just HAVE to say that. I can't tell her the truth. She just walks in and I immediately escort her out.

And the truth is, I just DON'T want her in. I can't let  her. I know she can't do anything more than she could do in the hallway, or from the door, or in the park, or in an alley, or anywhere else really, but I just didn't feel like letting her in (and still don't). I know it was rude as fuck but so is trying to force someone to let you in their house at 7 in the morning.

She keeps trying to get me to make her coffee or breakfast or something. And the pushier she gets, I get less afraid, more angry. She then asks me about my old town, my friends, family, my new friends, my new place, what am I planning to do here. I don't tell her shit, I just ramble about unspecific things, getting more and more angry. 

She makes me feel dizzy. Not in a Oh-so-nice-and-cute way. In a very bad way. In a I-could-pass-out-or-even-die way.

Somehow I get through the conversation, and then she just suddenly stops talking and stares at me. ""You're really not going to let me in?"" I explain to her, again, that I'm going out now and the place is a mess.
So she glares at me and nods. ""Alrightttt"".

I really thought she was going to attack me - I was really waiting for her to try to hit me or stab me or whatever.

But she turns around, then she turns back to me and says ""See you soon. Maybe I'll come again tomorrow."" I tell her it'd be better if she just lets me invite her when I'm ready for visitors, when I can actually provide a good stay for a guest.
""But *friend's name* stayed the night?""
I get terrified again - bitch how the fuck do you know, but I just say that friend is helping me with the apartment.

She nods again. And then she says bye, see you. And walks away. Turns around once again, stares at me, and says ""I still can't figure it out. That's why I just have to come back, like you had to interrogate me at the park."" And then walks down the stairs. I try to stop her, but she ignores me. Won't talk anymore.

Now the thing is, nothing about her, except the knowing my great-grandmother part, seems supernatural, otherwordly. She seems like a silly, but creepy lost cause. And if it wasn't for my grandmother's warnings and the woman claiming to know Magdalena, I'd even consider her a cute wackadoodle. But I still have NOTHING to explain WHY my grandmother appears to fear this woman and NOTHING to explain HOW could she, a woman that looks not a day older than 30, have known my great-grandmother that died over 30 years ago.",Who is this woman ?

-----

For several years now I've had this story inside me like lead shot in my gut. I've considered telling it hundreds of times over, but the sheer magnitude of it has always stopped me. With six months of therapy under my belt, I figure it's time. I know now that I won't be free of this thing until I write it out. Settle in, because I can't tell this story in ten thousand characters or less. I'll be lucky to get through it in twice or three times that. It's hard enough to sum up everyday life, and this story is anything but.

I had a recurring dream when I was really little. I would wake up in the dream, and standing beside my bed was the most beautiful lady I had ever seen. Long, straight hair and long, flowing gown, both of the purest silver like captured moonlight. She would smile at me so sincerely, so lovingly, as she sat down beside me and began to speak.

The words were comforting like a lullaby, but I couldn't understand them. Though she spoke quietly, her voice seemed to echo through the room, through the universe, backwards and forwards in time, begging to be understood by my adolescent brain.

I always tried to stay in the dream as long as I could, but eventually I would drift back off to sleep in the dream and wake up to my mom gently rousing me for breakfast.

My mom died when I was seven, and the dreams stopped. Well, I prefer to say she died. She was murdered. I hate that word. It's so cold; it falls off the tongue like shards of glass.

My mom was a health nut; protein shakes, weight lifting, yoga, the whole lot. Above all, she loved to jog. We had several acres of untamed land around the house. She always woke me up about an hour before dad went to work so she could go take a forty-minute run through the forest and along the creek; it befell dad to make me breakfast and get me ready for school.

They found her by the lake south of the house. And hanging from the old weeping willow in the middle of the pasture. And scattered across the countryside in a ten-mile radius around the house - but that was mostly after the funeral. All told, the casket had about two-thirds of a person inside when we finally buried her. They never found her head.

We used to be a close family - me, my sister, my mom and dad ... Losing mom, and losing her the way we did, splintered us. Dad lost himself in his advertising job. My sister turned inward, and fell into drugs and alcohol, when the kids our age figured out how to get ahold of it. Besides his job, dad's other mission was to keep his girls safe from all harm, and he took that one even more seriously. Leanna got it a little easier since she was four years older. I was taken out of school. Dad hired a tutor to homeschool me. I wasn't allowed out after dark. I wasn't allowed out without supervision. Unless I was being taken to town for some reason, I wasn't allowed to range out of eyesight or earshot of the house.

I started writing obsessively. Mom taught me how to keep a journal as soon as I could hold a crayon. I still have my very first one; the pages are filled with scribbles in different colors, and some pages are nearly colored solid. I guess I thought that good writing should fill as much of the page as possible. I remember how unabashedly delighted mom was to see every single entry. I guess writing is my way of honoring her memory.

I took mom's death hard, but it was a long while before I really understood what it meant that mom was killed. Dad told me that a very bad man had taken my mom from us, that she was dead, that she'd never come back. All things considered, he handled that conversation pretty well. Nothing could have softened the blow, though. My mommy was gone. I loved her and wanted her, but I'd never see her again. She was dead, and death meant people were gone forever. We weren't a religious household, so at that young age I was coming to grips with the fact that mom didn't exist anymore. There was a hole in my world. It was like that feeling when you go to grab something like a can of Coke without looking at it, and you end up swiping at the air because that can wasn't where you expected it to be.

I healed in time. For several years I was just chugging along, going through the motions, numb to the outside world. Closing myself off was easy; the outside world mainly consisted of our house and the clearing around it. My dad was mostly an authoritarian figure when he was home, always vigilant but never available. My sister babysat me when dad was gone, though she usually left me entirely to my own devices. She was homeschooled too, but she could drive; sometimes she would simply leave me at the house and go off to do Big People stuff. 

That Big People stuff, as I've written, consisted mainly of shooting up with her friends, or scoring more dope.

She had been chasing her high for ten years straight when I turned eighteen. Leanna had been living with her junkie boyfriend for a couple years. She was never able to hold down a job for very long, so she would spread her legs for a dealer until he let her move in. That was how she kept up her habit. When that didn't work out, she'd beg dad for more money and find another dealer to fuck.

It was a miserable, shady life for her, and she would have kept going until it killed her. And it did.

-------

My dad got the call at four in the morning on a Tuesday. I remember waking up, bleary-eyed, to see him looking like death warmed over. I had only seen that tortured look on his face once before, and I shot straight up, wide awake, when I saw it that night.

""Leanna,"" I said.

He nodded. My heart sank into my stomach and stopped beating. She was living in the city, a forty-minute drive away. A long, miserable forty-minute drive away. Neither dad nor I spoke a word. He sat stoically, knuckles white on the wheel, crying silently. I might as well have been dead myself. I stared at my lap, taking in nothing, thinking nothing, feeling nothing. Where my heart had been was a gaping hole.

Dad led me by the hand into the funeral home, and sat me down in a chair where I waited motionlessly as he went to identify the body. I heard his wracking sobs as he came back to get me some time later. I reflexively turned towards the sound. The funeral director and another man were practically holding him upright as he stumbled across the lobby. They took me up and walked us to a private area with a couple of couches, where we both collapsed.

I sat on the couch, mindlessly pulling at my hair, gazing at my father as he poured out his grief. He had always been a reserved man, but the dam had finally broken. We had no family but ourselves. Mom had grown up in a foster home, and had no love for the people she called her ""fake parents."" My biological grandma had a stroke and passed in her sleep. My grandpa followed not long after, as old widowers are wont to do. I never knew either of them. If we had any extended family, we never knew them.

I half-noticed the little hank of hair tangled around my hand. I hadn't felt it when I ripped it out.

Dad cried for a long time, eventually slumping sideways into his couch. When his voice was gone and his sobs came without tears, he stood up. He seemed to be carrying the weight of a thousand suns on his shoulders. At his slight nod in my direction, I stood up myself, and we walked together to the car. He pulled out a rumpled piece of paper and his phone, and dialed a number. We were at a motel fifteen minutes later. We went to sleep in our clothes.

The next few days were a blur. There were arrangements to be made, and that was dad's job. I went to town and bought us clothes and toiletries to keep us going while we stayed at the motel.

The funeral was a small affair back home. We laid her to rest in the plot next to mom's. Dad and I were the only mourners. A minister said some words, we each tossed a handful of dirt on the grave, and it was over. It was over.

-----

We stepped through the doorway and into our home. Quiet pervaded the empty space, the sort of quiet only found indoors. Clocks ticking, a gentle hum from our air conditioner, our breathing and the stecatto hitches as one or the other of us suppressed a sob.

We stood alone in an empty house, our bodies kept upright through some force of habit or instinct in the absence of warm blood flowing through our veins. My sister had imparted some vitality into this place, unbeknownst to us, even after our mother's murder. As our Leanna died, so died the house. I might have turned to see the land itself had withered, without so much as a shrug.

Dad pulled the door shut, and the click of its latch, impossibly loud against the quiet, signaled the start of our new life, or merely the end of the old.

I glanced at the clock: almost noon. The gears in my brain began turning, cast about for something to fill the time until bed, and found nothing. It then latched on to the only activity left, and my feet carried me to the stairs with sliding steps. They balked briefly, as if puzzled by a reason to lift off the ground more than half an inch, and then continued. A minute later, I fell backwards, collapsing onto my purple comforter. My toes brushed the carpet from time to time, but that didn't matter. Nothing did. Apathy sang me a lullaby, and the world faded away.

My staggered footsteps echoed through the tunnel, meshing with the steadfast crashing of many feet behind me. Searing hot agony blazed through my side. I had to keep running, I had to reach the end before -

I snapped upright, eyes unfocused, drenched in sweat. I bent forward reflexively and threw up bile into my lap. I sobbed, and choked on my own vomit. I coughed until my throat was raw, until the vessels in my eyes popped, and then collapsed sideways.

Good morning, world.

quietgrl,12,,7,1rchof,,20,"I had moved to Minnesota months ago, in order to get away from some strange phenomenon happening to me in Philadelphia since May 2013. I don't know what to call these things... ghosts, phantoms, spirits? However, my friends and family aren't judging my experiences as real accounts of the paranormal, they believe that I'm slowly losing my mind. And sometime... I wonder if that's the case too, if I'm simply falling into to some form of schizophrenia. 

I decided to share my stories here, so maybe I wouldn't have to feel much like a freak or that I'm going crazy. Or maybe I just don't want to feel alone with this. 

Well, I had a week to relax again, without anything strange happening to me. However, I had that feeling again that things weren't over and was just getting started. I am anxious all the time, ready for the next creepy thing to happen to me, and I'm not even sure if I can call my life “living” anymore. I rarely sleep, I barely function at work, and I'm losing a lot of weight from the lack of eating. 

My only distraction these days seem to be stupid videos on the web and chatting with the cute neighbor named Charlie. I don't share with him about my “experiences”, because I don't want him to look at me with those same pitying eyes that my friends and family give me.

Although last week, I did dare to ask Charlie if he had noticed anything strange in the neighborhood. He gave me a funny and confused look and I had to try my best to explain what I was asking, without really explaining the truth of my situation. “Oh,” I said, waving my hands as if the movements would untangle my nervous words, “You know... I mean, do you notice anything weird or any weird stories from others in the neighborhood?” I was trying to figure out if I was the only person who had a ghost following them.

“No.” Charlie said, shaking his head slowly in thought. And then his baby blue eyes lit up, “Well, yeah! If you mean if there are any weirdos here, yes we have a few, like anywhere else. I am a bit weird, for example.” “Nah.” I blushed towards him, “You're not weird at all. You seem very normal to me.” And very cute, I wanted to add, but I kept that thought to myself. 

Well, after a while of nothing happening to me, I didn't exactly catch onto the next bizarre incident right away. 

It must have been nearly 3am in the morning, when I heard a man singing loudly outside, “If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe... I'd been married a long time ago! Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?” At first, I was a lot annoyed for having my sleep disturbed by the most unlikely song, but then it was kind of funny that someone really seemed to like this song and thought it was a good idea to bellow it early in the a.m. 

Then another thought came to me, that it may be the voice of Charlie, proving me wrong about my earlier opinion that he wasn't weird. It sounded a little like his voice and I couldn't help but wonder if he was drunk off his ass and having a bit of fun tonight. I rushed from my bed and peered out the window, my eyes slowly adjusting to the darkness outside. The only thing I could see was a shadowed figured of a man, non descriptive, as he shambled towards the direction of the pathway between my house and Charlie's.

I giggled to myself, before heading back to sleep, knowing that I would tease the guy tomorrow about his choice of song. I slept peacefully, as the night faded back into silence. 

The next day, I did run into Charlie, a silly grin on my face. I told him how I spotted him in a chorus of Cotton Eyed Joe, stumbling towards his house, at 3am in the morning. He gave me the most confused lemon face that I ever saw on a man and replied, “Well, I don't know who you saw, but it wasn't me. For one thing, I was asleep at that time, dead to the world. And second of all, I hate that song! I don't even know all the words to it, let along could sing the chorus.”

“Hmm.” I said, a bit confused now, because I swore it was his voice that I had heard. “Hey,” he smirked, “I did tell you that we have some weirdos among us, right? It was probably Mr. Roy, who lives about two houses down from us. All he ever does is drink and he only seems to leave his house during the night to avoid conversation and eye contact with any of the neighbors. I wouldn't be surprised if he had a few too many last night.”

I agreed with that explanation for the time being, but I wondered if Charlie was somehow covering up an embarrassing moment that I had caught him in. 

The next night, the singing happened again, this time at 2am with a loud chorus of, “Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?” I rushed to the window and again I could only see a shadowed figure, shambling towards the pathway and disappearing around the corner leading to the front of the houses.

I felt uneasy about the movement of the shadow, as it didn't seem exactly like a human's walk at all, and very unlikely for even a drunken one. It was a combination of stops and jerks forward, like someone moving a puppet on a string. And sometimes the shadow seemed to jerk too far ahead, causing the figure to appear a couple of feet in the matter of a blink. I wasn't sure if I was just overly tired and seeing things or maybe not. I decided to go back to sleep and forget about it.

The next night, I was awaken by the man singing the song loudly again, this time at 1am. I had left my floodlight on before bed, a light that illuminates my driveway. I eagerly peered out of the window, hoping to see the guy's face this time, whether it would be Charlie's or the weird neighbor's. This time, the figured shambled directly in the path of the bright light and still his face was nothing but a shadow. There was no hint to any of its features, just a shadowed figured that belted out, “Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?”

I was frighten, shutting my curtains, and hiding under my blankets. I slept with my bedroom lamp on for the rest of the night, just like a little kid. Later in the day, I asked Charlie if he heard the singing man last night or any time this week. He did not. And again, I felt as If I may be hallucinating these things.

Last night, I heard the man singing again, this time at 12 midnight. And I refused to leave my bed and look out there, not wanting to see that shadowed figure shambling by, moving many steps ahead in the matter of seconds. I figured, it was all in my mind, that it would go away if I just ignore it. That's when I heard the creak of one of my floorboards at the end of my bed.

I sat bolt upright and could see the shadow standing at the foot of my bed. Its darkness seemed to stand out much bolder than the darkness of the room, a silent silhouette of a man, who just stood there and said nothing for a while. I was too afraid to move or to call out to my sister who was asleep in the nezt room. I just stared at the figure, barely breathing, waiting for it to move or flinch.

In a voice that was deep and demonic, it sang out, “Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?”

At that moment, I lost my shit and began to scream, as I flipped out of my bed and hit the floor with a huge thump. I began to crawl my way towards the door of my room, but that thing... it grabbed my ankle and began pulling me back towards it! I kicked, flailed around on the floor, and cried out, “No, no, no, no! Let me go!”

My sister burst into the room,flipping on the lights, her eyes wild and her voice wavering, “What's happening?!” The shadow man was gone and I broke out into tears, still very afraid but so relieved that it wasn't there anymore. After some moments of hysterical sobbing, I was able to tell my sister what had happened. I thin this time, she believed me.

I don't know if the whole thing was just a horrible nightmare or if I'm somehow hallucinating. However... that grab from the shadow man felt a lot real. I can still feel the memory of that grip on my ankle, a rough and cold hand, that eagerly wanted to pull me in towards it. I can't sleep with the light off now...",Cotton Eyed Shadow,27,nosleep

How it starts is that I am laying in my bed and I am slightly awake but I cannot move or speak. I can how ever see what is going on so there is that. While in my bed it feels like I have a huge weight on me and I cannot move. I do however, try to edge myself over to side of the bed in hopes of waking up because I don't want to feel that way anymore. 
There has been one time where I woke up several times on to be slammed back down onto my bed. That time managed to freak me out so much that I ran out of my apartment and did not return until later that day. Another time I felt as though I was dragged off my bed and dragged down a hallway that seemed like it was at an elementary school only to never reach the end. 
I thought it was a ghost, for lack of a better terms, for awhile but I could not gather enough evidence to prove it. I do not rule it out though. I have had not physical harm come to and it happens so often sometimes that I end up ignoring it and just get annoyed by it. Oh I almost forgot that this usually happens from 12-4 am if that makes any differences. I have wanted to film myself and maybe record what I might say during these happenings. That may give more insight on it.

Myzrath,5,,8,1r5zd8,,17,"I came from a universe where things twisted and changed at the mercy of my infinite will. But here everything was the same. Every day I awoke encased in meat, trapped in the same skin I’d loathed for so long. I interacted with the same people I hated, and wondered why I couldn’t have been born across the ocean. My will and infinite vision was no use here: No matter how vivid my dreams were, they were meaningless and intangible. I spend endless nights staring at the mist and midnight skies, longing to revert to my true form. I dreamed of another existence that was so real, so overpowering that it choked out this disappointing joke  you call reality. Things are woven into the fabric of your world that you will never see or comprehend. And I longed to see them again.


I came from a place where I never had to question sanity, because there was no such thing. There was only the boundless infinity of thoughts. I was nothing, yet I was everything. I had no body and I had no pain. For vast, uncounted ages I soared through the bleak darkness of space, savoring the isolation and the pain it brought. My soul was seared by the fire at the hearts of stars, and my dreams were inspired by black holes sucking entire galaxies into oblivion. I wandered for eternity, but suddenly, it was over.


And I awoke in this prison of meat, wondering why the stars were so far away.


 I wondered why I had these new emotions, like hatred and longing. I was jealous of the other meat puppets for having better skins to walk around in. Or for living in a nicer house, or fucking a better looking slab of meat. Slowly I began to forget everything. And only in dreams can I remember true freedom: the boundless infinity where I once roamed as a collection of particles calls to me, and soon I will return.

I came from a dimension where my dreams, desires, and fears were nonexistent. I had no one to envy, no one to despise. I was a subatomic particle with the fury of a dying star, and now I’m trapped inside a walking corpse waiting to die.

The vomit had soaked through the covers, moistened my legs, and cooled by the time I decided to move. The clock read Too Early; I had slept for nearly sixteen hours. Whatever. Once my mouth was rinsed and the bedding had been bundled up and tossed in the laundry room, I padded into the main living room to watch infomercials.

Dad was up at six. I didn't notice him until he slumped back into the couch beside me. He was the first to speak.

""Morning,"" he said quietly.

""Mm,"" I agreed.

""How long have you been up?""

""Since four.""

""I came in to check on you several times. Looked like you were having nightmares.""

""Yeah.""

""You were crying. Tossing and turning. I tried to wake you up."" He pulled up the sleeve of his robe to show me some scratches. ""You, uh, thought I was a bad guy.""

My eyes misted up as I drew my knees up to my chest. Words began to spill out. ""I'm sorry --""

Dad cut me off. ""Shh. It's fine. I know you didn't mean it.""

His voice was so gentle. The authoritarian figure that had watched over me with a stern gaze was gone. The fierce strength behind his eyes was broken, and this man had no fire left. All at once, the protectve shell of numbness cracked and shattered. I wanted my daddy. Without a word, I crawled over and laid my head on his shoulder. Two weeks ago, this act would have been inconceivable. Two weeks ago, Leanna was alive. Some shred of rational thought in the back of my head noted with muted shock that the roles we had played every day were nothing more than an artificial construct, an act we played out every day.

Dad wrapped me up in his arms, and we cried together until I lost track of time altogether. Inevitably, the tears stopped flowing, though neither of us made a move away from the other for another hour. Who was left to prop the two of us up but each other? We sat watching infomercials, one after the other, neither of us really caring for anything but the hypnotic power of the glowing screen.

My stomach growled. I remembered that I hadn't eaten. In the same breath, I realized that my head was pounding. I clutched at my stomach.

""Eggs okay?"" my dad murmured.

I nodded, still bent over.

Dad lifted his arm from my shoulders and stood up. In the span of that motion, the weight fell on his shoulders again and he walked slowly to the kitchen.

I scarfed down the eggs unceremoniously and thanked my dad. After that, I retired to my room and spent most of the day at my writing desk, staring at a blank sheet of paper. I took regular breaks to stare out the window at the trees waving in the wind.

Eventually, the sun sank below the treeline, and I began nodding. As I did, my heart skipped a beat. Would I wake up tomorrow tangled in the sheets, fearing that unknown terror at my heels?

In the end, I told myself that it was irrelevant. Sleep is inevitable. I still couldn't shake the feeling of impending doom, that I might face that terror again. As I slipped under the covers, I cast about in my mind, looking for anything to ease my fear. A memory came, of a lady in silver. The dream I had when I was little. Suddenly I missed that lady. I couldn't recall her face, but the feeling she brought with her was clear as day when I thought about it. She made me feel safe, protected, warm.

Tears leaked from between my closed eyelids. I missed my mom. I missed my sister. I wished I could dream of that lady just one more time. Nothing was more important. I dwelt on her memory, and the aching desire for that little bit of relief spread through my body until I craved her like a starving girl that smelled pizza.

I fell asleep thinking of nothing else. And then I woke up.

She was standing at the edge of my bed, and she was beautiful, an angel wrought in the finest, purest of silver. And I did't hurt. I stared at her, and she was beautiful, and she returned my gaze, a quizzical look on her perfect face. And she was beautiful. Her hair and gown flowed behind her in slow motion, defying gravity. She opened her mouth as if to speak, then closed it and paused and lowered her gaze. Her eyes drifted back up to me, and ...

""Can you see me?"" Her voice was the choir of heaven, the sweet whispers of a thousand mothers cooing at their newborn children. It echoed through time and space, it echoed within my mind, and my heart lifted up higher, higher, until the echoes died away. I found myself smiling, tears of joy misting my vision, blurring it into a shine of silver against the darkness of my room.

I could only nod.

""You can understand me."" Her accent was stilted as though she was deaf; I got the feeling that speech was mostly unnecessary for her.

I collapsed as the sorrows, heartbreaks, and betrayals of my past bled from my soul, all at once. A moment later, I was at peace. I sat up in a fluid motion, turning to the silver lady before me.

""Yes. I was hoping I'd dream of you. I'm so glad you're here.""

""This is no dream.""

I laughed. ""How could this be anything else?""

""I do not know. But I promise. No dream.""

I considered this for a time while the lady waited, motionless save for her gown and hair. Some part of me knew that nothing this apparition would tell me would ever be a lie. Nevertheless ... ""Alright. I'll just stay up all night, then. That should make it pretty obvious."" I grew serious. ""Will you stay with me? Can anybody else see you?""

""You called me. Not sure how. Usually death calls me. But no one will die here. I don't understand. You know death. You should not see me now.""

My jaw would have been hanging open, except I seemed incapable of registering surprise that could overpower the warmth radiating from the ethereal lady in front of me. As it was, I responded, ""Hmm,"" a sound less consideration than contentedness. ""Well, what are you?"" I said, after a lengthy pause. She responded with a pause of her own, dropping her gaze and softly stroking her chin. And then, I felt a whisper in my mind, the gentlest touch of wind as something made its way inside. Her eyes lit up, and I felt her happiness. She could communicate without speaking, I suddenly knew, and this way was much faster, more precise. I tried to think back at her, and she didn't respond. A look of confusion passed across my face, and then I understood that I'd have to project myself back for two-way communication. Telepathy wasn't nearly overpowering as the sound of her voice, or maybe I didn't have anything left inside me to soothe and fix. I realized that I had a thousand questions, and we began to converse; to an observer, it would appear as though I was having half a phone conversation. I can only summarize our exchange:

She didn't seem to know what or who she was. She had no name. She simply popped into existence one day.

""What's your earliest memory?""

Dark-skinned, brutish people in caves. A woman being raped while her child watched. A fleeting moment, blurred, before her world became darkness, a state she termed sleep.

Holy shit.

She came and went, and sometimes she was in many places at once. Rarely she was everywhere. The last time that happened, she described lots of people starving or shooting at each other. Patches on shirts and overcoats: triangles and stars. The holocaust. She was everywhere then.

Holy shit!

My jaw was, in fact, hanging open now. ""You were everywhere? In the entire universe?""

No, not the entire universe. Just the earth.

""The oceans too? All the land?""

No. Only where there were people.

""Why do I feel so much better when you're around?""

She shrugged, lines of sadness creasing her face like cracks in polished diamond. The tragedy of her expression threatened to break my heart, as though I was watching a snake eat a kitten. Suddenly I saw myself as a child, myself and my mother. I knew this to be the last time I would see my mom alive. The silver lady was embracing her, weeping tears like liquid pearl. I could see a swirling darkness surrounding the two of them, there but not there. The more closely I examined the miasma with this second sight, the more sinister it became. I began to see through it, as though it was a portal to another dimension of gnashing, swirling teeth and rotting flesh. I felt a cold, alien intelligence invade my mind, and then I was a bug under a microscope. My mind was aflame with pain and disgust, pushing through the dull opiate warmth of the lady's protection. The demonic thing was plotting, yearning, and I could taste its desire with my own tongue. My vision began to fade to black, and I was immersed in inky, single-minded hatred of unfathomable depth. Time lost its meaning, and then I was back in my room, unsure if a second had passed or a century.

The lady nodded, filling my mind with her own, and I understood; I had seen the hunger in the world, a faceless, timeless entity whose only purpose is to consume and destroy. And before me stood the force of light.

Dawn broke through my window.

Some weird things have been happening the past few nights and if I could get a quick response in case ""something happens"" that keeps me from coming back, that'd be nice.

This might have been a bad idea, but I read about Astral Projection and started trying to practice it but I've had no luck.  But since then, I've been hearing things before I sleep and when I wake up.

A few weeks ago I started hearing the sound of boiling water coming from my kitchen in the middle of the night; after that it was quiet conversation; and after that it was the sound of a light switch being turned on and off.

In the mornings I hear scratching, and speaking and I can't pinpoint where it could be coming from.

What happened last night is what made me scared enough to write about this.  My eyes were shut as I was trying to fall asleep, and out of nowhere I heard typing on my keyboard, which is only a few feet from my bed.  I was too scared to open my eyes and look, so I acted like I was asleep.  This morning I saw a new icon on my desktop, it was a jpg, eventually I opened it and it was just black.  

I deleted it off my computer completely.  I've chugged a few Monsters (Energy Drinks) so I don't have to sleep tonight.

I remember a story arc in Grey's Anatomy, where the ghost of a doctor's dead lover followed her around and only she could see it. That's when I stopped watching the series.

I was eating cereal, watching reruns of Scooby Doo. I couldn't recall cereal ever tasting better, and I couldn't recall Scooby Doo ever being so entertaining. But that's how it goes when the embodiment of good is sitting beside you on the couch, giggling musically at the television. Today was a day of firsts for the both of us. Dad walked in at some point, looking haggard as I had ever seen him. His eyebrows shot up when he saw me curled up on the couch, neatly groomed and with color in my cheeks. I gave him a half-smile, equal parts enthusiasm and sympathy. Make no mistake; I hadn't forgotten my sister's death, but no therapy on earth could have matched the aura of the silver lady. I stood up smoothly, walked the three paces across the living room, and wrapped him in the biggest hug I could muster. He was apparently speechless, but when I looked up at him, I saw that the worry lines around his eyes had softened a little.

I reflexively looked back over my shoulder at the silver lady, and she expressed her joy at my desire to comfort my dad. I smiled at her, and then glanced back at my dad, who was looking at me quizzically now. I brushed my hair back over my shoulder and smiled at him again.

""We're going to be okay, Dad.""

He only nodded and wandered off. He had taken time away from work to grieve, and so he had not even dressed himself. In the silence that followed, I looked around. I had to laugh, and then I was shocked at the inappropriateness of my laughter. Sitting on the couch was a ghost that only I could see, a ghost that magically took away all my pain and trouble. Yeah, I must have snapped. Two deaths was one too many. My laughter had drawn the lady's attention. She looked at me and frowned a little. I shook my head at her, incredulous, and turned away. Things like this didn't just happen to people.

I was grateful, though; at least I didn't get the ghost of deathly melancholy or something. There wasn't much of an earthly nature that could upset me, with her around. That and the fact that I had an entire day to kill considered, I decided I might as well make the best of it. Everyone grieves in their own way, I suppose? Jurassic Park was showing, and I figured I'd go see it. The movie wasn't for several hours, though, and so I grabbed up my things and went for pancakes at IHOP. The silver lady sat across from me, and I couldn't help but laugh. The entire restaurant was going about its business, and yet, here sat a figure so obviously paranormal as to be hokey, like a ghost bride, her hair and gown blowing in a wind that only she could feel. She noticed my disdain and expressed a mild indignance within my mind. I shrugged it off and asked her what she could expect from me, but quickly shut my mouth and looked around when I realized that I looked like a total schizophrenic.

I still had an hour to kill after breakfast, so I decided to spend off some of my allowance; though it had been meagre from week to week, I had saved up almost a thousand dollars over my sheltered years. I drove down main street and visited several little boutiques, built into the slightly-renovated shells of old department stores and hotels from the town's conception way back at the turn of the century. Several tops caught my eye, and the lady waited patiently as I tried each one. I asked her what she thought of them from time to time, but she didn't seem to have an eye for clothes, having probably worn the same ghost dress for hundreds of millenia. I was just wrapping up at the last store, preparing to break another fifty dollar bill, when a little girl in front of me in line turned around.

She smiled wide and began tugging on the hem of her mom's skirt.

""Mommy! Mommy!""

""What is it, honey?"" the woman asked, a little exasperated but apparently feeling indulgent.

""She's so pretty, mommy!""

The mother looked at me and smiled, and I smiled back. ""Yes, she's very pretty, hon. Now come on, we've got to get to the bank."" She half-walked, half-dragged the girl out of the store; the girl's eyes were locked back over her shoulder, that cheesy grin still on her face.

I would have felt flattered, except the child wasn't looking at me. She was looking five feet to my left. Right where the silver lady was standing. My heart dropped right onto my stomach.

A sense of surprisingly smug satisfaction filtered through my mind simultaneously with a surge of grief and longing. Satisfied though she may have been about my reaction, the silver lady desperately wanted to follow the girl. Suddenly I was along for the ride, as the silver lady's desires became my own in our shared headspace. I paid quickly at the checkout counter and trailed along behind the mother and daughter as though in a daze. We walked out into the sunlight and I sneezed as my eyes adjusted. Their car was parked twenty paces from the store.

By the time I had halved the distance between us, they were pulling out. And then shrapnel was everywhere. I dropped to the ground reflexively and was peppered with safety glass. Truly in a daze now, I staggered to my feet and wandered, it felt, towards the smoking ruin in front of me. Their little blue sedan was wrapped around an old steel truck. I walked up to the passenger side window, got as close as I could despite the truck, and felt a warm breeze blow past me. The silver lady was in the car then, embracing the husk of what had just been an adorable baby girl.

Blood trickled from every orifice in her head. Her skull had split open from front to back, stretching her face oddly, and she was staring vaguely off into the distance, blinking out-of-sync, one eye and then the other. A couple arterial spurts sprayed the chrome bumper of the truck. One moment there was a girl fighting for life, and the next there was a life-sized gory mannequin.

I never got used to that part; when life leaves the body, the body ceases to be a person and becomes a shell, inanimate as though it never breathed or laughed or ate or drank.

Sound returned to the world, and I heard choking, gurgling screams. ""Oh my god, oh god no, my baby, oh god no."" My legs went out from under me. I sat down hard on pavement, kicked my legs until I bumped softly against the curb. The silver lady was crying again.

I don't know how long I sat there, but the next thing I knew, the street was lit up with red and blue lights. The din of sirens was crashing through my skull. I was nearest the crash when it happened, and so I had to give a statement. I must have done well enough at it, because the police let me go with the promise that I come in later to write everything out. The driver of the pickup was clearly drunk, and he must have been going twenty over the speed limit. I made my way back into the boutique with stuttered steps and asked for a phone. My dad was there in ten minutes flat.

I stared out the window blankly all the way home, held aloft solely by the presence of the silver lady. Dad tried to get me to speak several times, but his words were a dull chatter in the back of my mind. I closed my eyes as the tears began to roll down my cheeks. I curled up inside myself, and felt a welling spring of warmth rise inside of me as the tightness lifted from my chest. I fled into it, covering myself with the warming blanket of the silver lady's loving embrace like a child afraid of the dark. I breathed deep and opened my eyes. My gaze was drawn down to my own body. My skin had taken on a silver-white glow and an opalescence like polished marble.

I glanced over at my dad, wondering if he was seeing this. My heart skipped a beat as I took in the dark, sickly-hued vapor sticking to his skin like lake fog on a cold morning.

""Sarah? Sarah, what is it?"" he asked, seeing my face tight with shock and alarm. His voice was jarring; I could hear new and unfamiliar tones of worry and sadness layered within it. But I couldn't respond. I was busily looking around at the world, which had taken on an alien cast. The flora radiated crystalline hues and the sky boiled with color like something alive. I could see the air itself buzzing with activity.

""This is the true world,"" I thought to myself in a voice wholly not my own. ""We seem to have ... merged."" I felt my inner eye flipping through my memories and thoughts like the pages of a book, each moment replayed and recast in the new light of a foreign perspective. Simultaneously I felt my mind open to a tome of memories not my own, as though a hidden eye within me had opened for the first time. So much suffering, so much death. I was a failure. For aeons I had tried to stem the tide of pain and misery that ran rampant across the earth like a plague, but all my efforts amounted to a drop in the ocean.

I was being shaken. My mouth tasted of ozone. Dad had stopped the car, and I realized I was doubled over and screaming. Dad was near hysterics, trying to get a response from me. My voice, shaky and otherworldly inside my skull, said, ""Sick ... stomach. Home. Please, take me home.""

Benlightenment,1,,7,1r3pbk,,13,"So, my auntie used to work for a millionaire. Not the best kind though, the kind who got the millions by being lucky in the national lottery. He only won about 6 million or so, but it was enough to get him a fancy ass house, and to hire my aunt as a housekeeper/general helper woman.
His house was a kinda half-new project. There was an old bit of land with an old house sat on it just outside the city they lived in, which he bought up, and then built his house around that one. And then his garage, and a private gym... he wasn't clever with his money (and my aunt was stealing some too, which she went to prison for eventually, but that's another story).
So in the end, the guy pretty much bankrupts himself on silly business ventures and cars. He has to sell the house. At that point, I was staying with my aunt for a week or two for a little holiday, so she asked me if I wanted to come along while she had to clear some stuff out. Me, coming from a crappy little town, jumped at the chance to have a nosy around a millionaire's mansion.

Once we got there, my aunt took off into the kitchen, which is where Mr Millions was (his name was Lee, really). They basically said I can have a wander round, play on his Dreamcast (that was a mega thing for me at the time) and just don't mess around with stuff I shouldn't. Understandable.
So I wandered off, walked through a few of the mega living rooms with leather sofas and stuff. It was all pretty old, but I think that was more just because he'd bought it to look that way. I sat down and messed around on the Dreamcast for a bit, but got bored playing Quake and decided to go have another wander. He had a swimming pool, but I didn't have my trunks, so I was kinda lost for something to do. I figured I'd just go down the other end of the house where I hadn't been and see what else he had kicking around.

So, the house itself was a pretty standard layout. You know the mansion in Resident Evil 1? The entrance hall kinda looked like that, only it was dark colours and wood rather than white. Upstairs was basically just one long landing corridor which had loads of doors off it to bedrooms and stuff. At the very end was a double-door, which I'd never been through. Given the way the doors looked, I assumed they were part of the old house which he'd kept, so I went to have a look.

Inside was a pretty tiny room, considering the house. Probably could've fit two or three double beds in there at most. One side had a couple of armchairs and a little table, and the rest was like a little library, with a couple of bookcases free standing and the opposite wall to the chairs being a full bookcase wall, which was amazing to me at the time.
I figured there had to be something in here I wanted to read, so I went up along the wall of books just having a look what was there. It was all pretty standard stuff that you'd expect to buy just to fill up a bookcase. Dickens, Austen... that kinda stuff.

Now, from where I was, I couldn't see the doors anymore, cause the bookcases were in the way. So, not paying attention, when they slammed shut, I squealed like a girl and jumped almost out of my skin. Given the size of the house, I figured it was either the wind or someone closing the doors, not realising I was in here.

It wasn't, though. To this day, I still have no idea who did it (I say who rather than what, cause what is crazy) but both the doors were shut tight. But that wasn't the odd thing.
On the doorknobs was a book that had been placed there, balancing. So yeah, my gut is already going a bit weird at this point, cause that's just odd. The cover had bright colours though, so I assumed it was someone playing a prank. As I got close enough to read, I saw what it was: a kid's book. Innocent enough. Except for the title. 

“I See You”

It was some kind've of Peekaboo book for kids, but that didn't matter at the time. As soon as I read it, my blood froze and I ran out of there like a little bitch. 
I still don't know whether it was one of his family or not. The house has been pulled down since, though from what my auntie told me, the half that he built around is now a protected building, so it's still there, in pieces. 
She said it was haunted too, but that was only after I'd told her the story. It's about 10 years on now, and I still dunno what happened that day. Given that my aunt was thieving from the guy... it's not like I can ask him either.",The millionaire's library,20,nosleep
lamented_dreams,4,,8,1rgqu8,,14,"I love the dark. I really do.

I don't mean going gothic and pagan and all that, but I do like the dark. I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos, researching diseases and the supernatural, and writing stories.

Anyways, I've recently come across a quote from a game called 'Knock Knock'. And let me say, it's utterly terrifying for not just the player, but the watcher too. There's nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the game.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside."" —Knock Knock

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

DjFlamefist,14,,2,1reoey,,15,"So i was staying at my aunt's house because she was going away to Iceland for a couple of days, and i had to watch her dog for a bit. Poor bastard couldn't be left a lone, now could he? I have experienced minor things in that house before, like things vanishing and reappearing and things like that. I guess there could be some logical explanation to it, but i have always been sure there was something fishy going on in there. I wasn't afraid though, haven't had any ""problems"" before. At the third day, the day before they returned, it happened. Although it was a normal day, no problems what so ever, i heard someone ring the doorbell. I thought fo sure that this was my aunt returning early from the vacation for some reason, but it felt... odd. I brought her dog just to stay there for a second line of defense as i was opening the door (The dog was a basset hound for those who might wonder). I opened the door and i saw two weird guys there, they looked like they have come from a party or something, atleast they looked drunk. ""Hello"", i said in my own language ofcourse, didn't expect visitors from other countries. They looked weirdly at eachother, dog barking like flipping fuck at them. ""Is this Norway?"" they answered, Surely that must be a weird question to ask. ""Yes, i suppose so, where are you guys from?"" i answered, trying to be as polite as i could. ""Oh, nowhere, was just checking with ya'"" they said with a weird look on their face. ""Umm, do you need to borrow a phone or something? surely that must be the reason you are here?"" i said. ""Well, we were just checking with ya'"" they said, with the dog between my feet still barking like heck. They looked at eachother and left. They went about 8 meters away from the house as i was closing the door. Thought it'd be impolite not to say goodbye, so i opened the door again to ofcourse... say goodbye.
They weren't there. Nothing was there. Everything was as usual, the dog had stopped barking, and i was left with a question: Is this real?.

I am sure that they couldn't have gotten more than 2 meter away from their spot while i reopened the spot, even if they ran at full speed. Even then i would have seen them.

funnyguy135,2,,5,1r3dcj,,13,"When I was younger may family moved around a lot.  One of the places that we lived in was a town in New Jersey.  We were only there for about 1 year but the events that occurred will leave a lasting mark on me for a life time.  In order to protect the identity of people names will be changed.

During the summer when I was around the age of 13 my family moved to New Jersey.  Upon moving I quickly befriended my neighbor, James.  James and I began hanging out a lot and soon he started introducing me to some of his friends.  I soon became friends with these people and joined their little friend group of 4.  Pretty soon school started up again and I began meeting fellow class mates.  I made a few new friends but I mostly stuck with James and those people.

One day during school I left class to go to the bathroom.  Upon entering I noticed that someone had clogged the sink with paper towels and turned on the water.  Luckily I got there before the water started flooding over so I turned it off, cleaned up the sink and went about with my business.  When I got back to class I told Henry (one of the people in my friend group) about what someone had did.  He began to chuckle and told me I was funny.  I asked what he meant and he turned to me looking confused.  He asked, ""Wait, you don't know?""  I said I didn't know what he was talking about and he told me he would explain after school.

At the end of the day I went to go meet Henry so that he could explain to me what he was talking about.  I walked outside and saw James, Henry and Tim (the other member of the group) waiting for me.  I asked what was going on and they said they would explain.  They told me that about 5 years after the school was built, before any of us were born, a boy had been killed in the bathroom that I had used earlier.  They told me that he was being bullied and the bullies thought it would be funny to give the kid a swirly (a swirly is where you hang a kid upside down, put his head into the toilet and then flush it).  Any way what the bullies did not expect to happen was the kid to drown.  The bullies thought he was just being a pussy so they left him on the ground.  The body was later discovered later in the day when another kid went to use the bathroom and saw that he was not breathing.  The bullies got into some huge shit and were expelled and got into some trouble with the law.  After that there had been strange occurrences of toilets or sicks being clogged, strange noises being heard, toilets flushing on their own or even for some people seeing a little boy soaking wet standing in the middle of the bathroom.  The school had been putting it off as tricksters trying to scare younger kids but people honestly believed what they saw.  At the end of the story I told my friends that they were bull shitting me but when they kept trying to convince me so I got frustrated and went home.

The next day in the school the guys were still on me about the whole murdered kid and how he haunts the bathroom.  I didn't believe a word of it and started to get really mad at them.  We got into a fight and I didn't speak with any of them for a while.  About a month after our fight Henry left to go use the bathroom.  He was gone for 20 minutes and the teacher asked me to go check up on him.  I agreed and left go see what was wrong.  I walked into the bathroom and saw no sign of Henry but only a small puddle of water on the ground.  I figured that this was just some elaborate trick that the guys had set up to try and scare me.  I started saying out loud, ""Really funny Henry but you can come out now cause what ever you're trying to do is not working.""  Thats when I heard a slight whimper coming from one of the stalls.  I opened it to find Henry curled up in a ball on the ground soaking wet.  I knelt down and started shaking him and yelling for him to get up but all he did was lay there whimpering and slightly rocking back and forth.

I ran to go get a teacher and then brought her back to the bathroom.  When we arrived Henry was no longer curled up in a ball but now standing up in front of one the mirrors just staring into it.  The teacher ran over and asked what was wrong but he just stood there staring.  She started to pull him away and he look at her and said, ""No...I need to stay...he told me to stay...that i'm going to join him.""  The teacher asked who told him to stay and then after another second of silence Henry burst into tears and said, ""The boy...the boy tolled me.""  For about the next week Henry did not show up in school and James, Tim and I got worried so we went to visit him at home.  When we got there his mother answered the door and when we asked how he was she said that all he does is stay up in his room and when ever they asked him to leave his face changed and he said he was to afraid.  We went up to see him and when we got up there all he did was look up at us and then look back down at the floor.  We asked how he was doing and he didn't answer.  After a few minutes of silence Tim blurted out, ""So what happened Henry?""  James and both gave him a nasty look and he just shrugged.  Henry looked up at us and said that he saw him.  We asked what he was talking about and he said he saw the boy.  That they had stared at each other for about 20 minutes before the boy started walking towards him saying that he had to stay with him and join him.  Henry started to back away but that only angered the boy as he lunged at Henry.  Henry said that he was all of the sudden drowning in the toilet and he heard his name called and so he sat up and then collapsed to the floor.  I then entered the stall and tried to get him and the rest we already knew.  We all sat there in silence before with out a word got up and left.

Henry stopped coming to school and after a few months we heard that he had moved away.  We stopped talking about him because we refused to believe what he had told us.  As the school year came to a close my parents informed me that we were moving again.  I was upset because I would be leaving my friends but also slightly relived.  I stayed in touch with James and Tim but over the years we grew apart and the whole long distance thing stopped working.  The last I had spoke to them they said that they hadn't seen or spoke to Henry since that day we all went to see him.  I hadn't seen Henry either but to be fare I was purposely trying to avoid him.  I grew up and one day while reading the paper I saw a story about a man who had drowned in his own home.  His name was Henry Goldmen.  I figured that this couldn't be the Henry that I knew so long ago.  But there is still apart of me that wonders that maybe Henry was telling the truth and maybe what ever tried to kill him the first time waited years before trying again but this time it succeeded.

The_John_Deere,11,,14,1r800l,,14,"I thought i would be safe from stuff like this, that these sorts of things wouldnt happen to me for a long time. Honestly, I didn't. Hell, I especially didnt expect it to be at school. 

I've dealt with ghosts before, more than I can count. I can normally help when people have problems with the paranormal, but now I'm the one in need of help.

I assume many of you remember u/inaaace's stories about Rose and the orange, correct? How could you not, that was one of the biggest things on this sub all year. This encounter/series of encounters is like that.

It started about a month ago. I'd have a dream that I wouldn't remember, and then at random points in the day I'd remember having that in the dream. Every day more and more instances of déjà vu would happen. This week has been the worst. I remembered my dream on Wednesday, and everything tht happened Wednesday I knew would happen, like us having a substitute in French, a pop quiz in Trigonometry, and a surprise workout at Track.

Last night, I thought I had a normal dream. Just regular stuff. Until *she* showed up.

This girl has bothered me sine freshman year. She's a bit of a weirdo, and all my friend think she likes me. The feeling is not mutual. Anyways, she popped up in my dream with the creepiest damn smile I've ever seen. And ten everything went black. I don't know if the dream ended or I just forgot the rest, but it just stopped. 

I came to school today thinking everything would be dandy, and it was, until 8th period seminar (my school has a ""free period"" that we go to every other day, and the class we go to during that block alternates every time). I walked in, and she sat next to me. Awesome. Just what I need. 

For most of the class I felt her eyes on me, and everytime I looked over she had a smile that grew gradually bigger. By the end of the period the smile resembled the one from the dream *exactly*. I was extremely freaked out, and it was probably showing, too. I looked over one more time, and then te entire dream flashed back to me. She had been holding something in the dream, some small enough to fit in her hand. As soon as I remembered this, her eyes locked with mine, an then she reached into her bag, 

And held out an orange.

I have to go back to that class in 2 hours. I don't know what to do. Nosleep, please help me. I don't think I can handle this one alone.

Edit for words. Sorry I was in a rush to write this.

EDIT 2: 15 minutes left in class, nothing really noteworthy has happened. Seems like she's backed off a bit. I still feel her eyes on the back of my head, though, so I'm bracing myself for when class is over.

EDIT 3: sorry about the delay, early track practice. The remainder of class was extremely uneventful except for the last 5 minutes, during which she got that freaky smile on her face and started slowly moving closer to me. When the bell rang, I bolted. Didn't want to stick around any longer. 

But what's really freaky is what happened around the end of practice. We had a workout today, and on our cooldown I could have sworn I saw her, behind the trees or on the other side of the road. I just ignored that though, and it's all been pretty good since. I just got home, so I should be safe. I'll keep you guys posted if anything else exciting happens.",I didn't think this would happen to me.,28,nosleep
Pretending_To_Care,2,,10,1r6wgf,,14,"It was around 1am, when Steve and I stumbled upon the railroad tracks that lead out of our small village. 

""You know, about two miles down the track, there's an old church that's been abandoned. I hear it's a place for Devil worship."" Steve was grabbing a branch just off to the side of the track. 

""Fuck that."" I snapped. 

""Chicken shit?"" Steve smiled. 

""No! I just don't think it's a good idea. Rick said he'd been there during the day with Alan, and there was blood all over the place and a stick that had been used to stab something.""

""How would he know that?""

""There was blood on it.""

""Well look, I've got a stick! How's about I stab anyone if they get near. Or you, for being a pussy."" Steve began jabbing towards me like some sort of fencing opponent. 

""Fine, we can go, but you lead the way, big man."" I agreed. 

We hiked down the tracks for about an hour and a half, maybe longer if you count the couple times we stopped so Steve could smoke from his pipe. The church was in sight. 

As we got closer, we notice a faint light pouring out of the broken door at the front of the church. When we were within twenty or so feet from the side of the church when we crouched behind some trees in the woods. 

""Do you hear that!?"" Steve gasped. 

""Hear what?""

""That chanting.""

We fell silent for a few seconds, but in turn were met with more silence. Nothing. 

""Look, let's creep around front and see if we can get a look inside."" Steve was already headed toward the front before I could object. 

It's a surprise that if anyone were inside, they didn't hear us. Steve was stepping on every stick his feet could've found.

As we placed our backs against the wall of the church, we could hear shuffling against its concrete floor, then silence again. 

Steve leaned over to me ""Right, on three, we both take a quick look... One, two... three.""

We probably should have booked it as soon as we saw what was inside, but shock had totally frozen us in place. 

Upon looking inside, we were met with the dead stare of about thirty fully cloaked people. They knew we were there, and they just stared at us. Behind them was a bloodied lamb, and beside it, a man holding a stick.

Now I'm no expert, but I thought sacrifices were conducted with a blade. NOT by gouging what must have been a couple dozen holes in the body of your sacrifice. 

""Jesu- Oh my God man, fucki- RUN!""

We ran as fast as we could for about ten minutes before I pleaded Steve to wait for me. I couldn't run any more. I had to catch my breath. 

""What... the FUCK was THAT!?"" Steve gasped. 

""I, don't know. You fucking idiot. I told you we shouldn't have gone anywhere near that fu-"" I stopped abruptly.

Behind us was a mob of people carrying flashlights.

""Get down!"" I gasped. 

We laid silently in the dark of the woods for what seemed like forever. We kept our heads down, trying not to breathe. The only indication about where they were was from the lights they carried, and then the worst possible thing that could've happened, did.

In succession, all the lights that were just on, went off. We were blanketed in darkness with this group of men, no more than thirty feet away. We only heard the crackling of branches and the shuffling of leaves for the next few seconds before we heard a voice nearby, grumble a faint ""We have seen you. Come out.""

I couldn't see Steve, but I knew what had happened. Steve bolted off further into the woods, snapping their attention right at us. I could hear him sulking as he ran harder and harder, but they were catching him. I remained silently on the ground as they disappeared. 

I must have laid there, not making a noise for fifteen minutes. What just happened? I was worried sick about Steve. They got him, I just had this feeling, they got him. 

Eventually, I crept my way back home and snuck into my room without waking my parents. I contemplated waking them up to tell them what happened for a while, before I broke down and did exactly that. Sort of. 

At this point, it was around 6am, and dad was getting ready for work. I told him that Steve and I were in the woods and we got spooked by an animal and lost each other running, so I just came home. I told him I was worried Steve might have gotten hurt and that we should call to see if he was okay. My dad is a sharp man, and knew something was up, but didn't question me. He just nodded his head and said ""Okay. ""

We contacted Steve's mother, who confirmed that, surprisingly, Steve was home. After a few more minutes, my dad concluded their phone conversation and reassured me Steve was okay. 

Around noon, I drove over to Steve's house to check in on him. When I got there, he signaled me to follow him up to his room. 

""They know who we are."" He said. ""As I was running, they yelled my name at me. These people, they know who we are.""

I froze.

""If they know who we are, then they live in our village.""

""Exactly, we-..."" Steve stopped himself. ""What do we do?"" He asked.

Theresa92,5,,7,1r3wvr,,12,"I have been reading this subreddit for a while, so I upgraded to pro so I could post my own creepy stories. Depending on the response, I have plenty more.WARNING: sorry for the length . Rather be thorough

So a little background, I'm a First Nations female living on reserve and I was probably around 15 when this happened... As a native women I have always been very spiritual.

The house I was and am currently still living in is about 4acres in the country on reserve and the area by my house is surrounded by trees on 3 sides, with a long driveway. There's a path just off the trees line that I used to love too walk but to get to it you need to do a bit of bush whacking. 

So one day I'm out on a walk on these trails with my 3 dogs; Ginger (mix breeds of something), Maggie and Charlie ( both black labs). The trail I'm walking goes for about 1km before you reach a sort of T intersection, go south and in .5 you reach these sand dunes or head north and there's acres and acres of trails. As I'm walking with my dogs, I get to this intersection when I hear Ginger start to whimper, she's nudging me trying to get me to head back home, I think this is odd  but my other dogs are fine so I brush it off and keep walking as Ginger takes off running home with her tail between her legs. 

Feeling adventurous I go north to do some exploring. 2 dogs in tow. I get another kilometre before a coyote comes across our paths. Dogs growling , coyotes looking at us, growling. That is till it looked behind us, kinda whimpered, and took off. Still didn't think much of it. What I was paying attention to was the howling coyote close to us and close to probably 5-10 of them I can hear howling not to far in the distance. 

Decided it was time to take my growling dogs home far away from the pack of coyotes coming for us. 

Everything was going fine on the walk back, coyotes got close then they got distant. Dogs were happy, that is... Till we got to that damn T intersection. It was like a fricken flip got switched. My once happy dogs started whimpering, I felt them nudging me on both sides, they started kind of running up ahead before they would turn around, realize I wasn't with them and they would come back by my side, nudging me to go faster, whimpering, tail between their legs. I was  scared... Then I heard it .

2 claps, right behind my head. I'm I'm the fricken bush ! I turned around slowly and ... Nothing. I grab the biggest branch I could find and start walking. 
Double clap, keep walking
Double clap, maybe it's an animal, but what kind of animal makes that noise right behind your head ?!? 
Double clap, turn around.., still can't see anything !!!
Double clap, keep walking
Double clap, little people, centaurs, bad spirits ? 
Double clap, I want to run all the way home but force myself to walk because running seems like it would make the being watched and followed feeling so much worse... 
Double clap, scared me, scared dogs...ALL...THE WAY...HOME... followed me all the way to the tree line, my dogs were scared all the way home, till we hit the tree line..then they were happy...

I ran to my mom crying, warning her not to let anyone walk the trails alone anymore. I still can't, not alone. 

I don't know what followed me home, but I know that whatever it was, it was very bad..",Followed home by something while walking in the bush,19,nosleep
angelcot,3,,1,1rh91p,,12,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep
Marksman46,3,,3,1rftnd,,12,"Have you ever looked in a mirror, and you were a little off put by your expression? Or looked at yourself in the mirror and realized that the person looking back at you, is you?

I walked beside my friend, and as we walked, we talked. I can’t remember what we talked about, but all I remember is this bland, superficial conversation about nothing in particular. Conversations like these bothered me; they didn't seem real to me, just like sounds, verbal ""things"" that hold no real meaning. And as I thought about our conversation, I wanted to make it more real for me, to give our little talk some depth, and just before I asked her a meaningful question, I tripped. I startled awake, rubbed my eyes, glanced at the clock but the time didn't register in my head. I realized that I needed to go the the bathroom. I shuffled over, dragging my feet to be sure I didn't trip or stub my toe, flicked on the lights, squinting from the brightness, relieved myself and turned on the faucet; I ran my hands under the cool water, threw some water on my face, picked up the towel and wiped my face off. As my eyes adjusted to the light, I looked at myself in the mirror, and my reflection was... smiling at me...I considered that I may have been dreaming, or hallucinating, but my cold damp hands and the pain of the bright light was all too real. I did what I would usually do when in this sort of disbelief and rubbed my eyes some more, hoping I was still just a bit drowsy. 

But nothing changed. 

I looked at myself and was quite curious. I felt my face with my hand to see if I was actually smiling… It certainly didn’t feel like it. Normally this would creep the hell out of me, I would, on any other occasion, scream or run away, but I just stared at the reflection, looking into my eyes as if they weren’t mine. A genuine happiness. I haven’t felt that way in far too long. I felt calm. But suddenly, as though something dropped to the ground, the feeling of calm had broken, like a shattering vase, a feeling welled up inside me. 

A tightness in my chest.

Like someone had just punched me, it was one of a gurgling frustration. I would be happy if it weren’t for this stupid house, things are constantly broken, and this wretched family; it all torments me, every day of my life. That’s when I heard the voice of my father from couple days earlier “Because I said so.” the words resonated in my mind, I could feel my teeth gritting, the sound made my skin crawl... but the reflection just kept smiling back...taunting me. The shrill sound of my mother’s voice beckoned in a continuous annoying ringing in my ear…I shook my head to clear my thoughts but the ringing was still there. I peered over at the clock and looked at the time. 2:34... 2:34... 2:34…2:34? It's late.

I couldn’t possibly sleep now, I was simply too stressed. I had school tomorrow, but I had to deal with this.

“Let me sleep” I muttered half to myself, half to the voices and that face in the mirror. This was when I noticed the mirror had stopped reflecting my actions, and just was a still image of myself smiling. I became angry at this point “What is wrong with you…” I said to it, hoping it would stop. “Just go the hell away!” I growled through my teeth. Feeling rather violent I stared back into my eyes, trying to counteract that incessant grin with my anger. ""No."" It's mouth didn't form the words, but the sound just streamed out of it. The ringing got louder and louder, I tried to cover my ears but it felt like it was coming from inside my head, the voices began circling me and taunting me and that terrible ringing. Then it all just stopped. Was it over? I just wanted to go to sleep so I could continue my broken life. It started laughing, a laugh that sounded unmistakably like my voice... But it was a sound I had never made before... a sound like... true laughter... this was new to me. It bothered me. I was envious. Why can't I experience that kind of happiness? He bothered me.

I had enough. 

The voices all faded away but the mirror kept smiling. “STOP!” I yelled as I punched the mirror, the blood was quick to run down my arm and the few pieces of mirror were stuck in my hand, I could feel them scaping at the bone. The remnants of the mirror on the wall reflected nothing but my angry scowl and bloodied arm. I stared at my hand. It didn't hurt, but I could lightly see the reflection of my own face in the bloodied shards. It still smiled. IT STILL SMILED. ""NO."" I slammed my hand against the counter, the blood spilled all over the room, on my shirt and face.

“And so it happened, Blake had snapped;
though In his own mind, he was trapped.
Broken and confused he wanted to die.
But all he could do was simply cry.”

“The lights flicked off, his mother shrieked, in the other room;
scared, as though she could feel her impending doom.
His father had been up all night drinking
While Blake was pondering and thinking.”

“The sound of the window outside smashing,
rang in his mind, terrifying, echoed the crashing.”

“NOW OF ALL TIMES!?” Blake shouted furiously.

“We enter Blake’s house to a horrid scene,
the smell of blood, nothing was clean.”

“The sanctity of his mind, and house violated,
with adrenaline and fear, his pupils dilated.“

“Sprinting to the kitchen he grabbed a tool,
a knife, very sharp, for he was no fool.
Not afraid to risk his life, with nothing to live for,
This life. And the criminal, he did abhor.“

“Creeping through the house to find the thief,
He heard a loud scream, though very brief.“

In his parent’s room he finds the two mangled corpses, the floor already soaked in blood. His parents had been completely mutilated, each had been stabbed numerous times, now slumped on the floor, eyes still open. A figure stood overtop the lifeless corpses that were once his parents, hunched over, with a bloody knife in hand, the tall man was half visible in the moonlight that came through the window. His skin fair and pale, his face, was itself a conundrum... it was an inexplicable quality. His face looked… off. Like an optical illusion where all you can do is stare and ponder. His fingers were skinny, the joints looked massive in comparison. He looked almost inhuman; but he was unmistakably a man. 

“Awkward” echoed in my mind; perhaps for lack of a better word, as he edged toward me.

""You didn't..."" I said to him.

“‘You’re welcome,’ I stated in a soft, warm voice
to Blake who accepted my words without much choice.”
“I followed him back to the kitchen, as he put the knife down,
The blood dripped from his hair, as heavy as a crown.” 

“‘Its done, its over.’ He quietly muttered to himself.
‘We can sleep now’ He put the knife on the shelf.”

“I climbed back out the window, never there was a mess;
as Blake walked, he had no more stress.”

“His house unviolated but his mind still tainted,
to this new life, he will never be acquainted.”

My wits came back to me. Cold blood streamed down my arms. I walked calmly to the bathroom and looked at the cracked and bloody mirror, the counter was a mess. Between the cracks I see my face, depressed. Sad to the point of a complete bleak. The frown. That was more like it... That makes more sense to me, no longer that disgusting smile. I saw a tear on his face. It was of blood. Feeling around on my face, I felt a drop of blood. Blood on my face? Then I felt something that I did not expect. 

A smile. 

My mind twisted. Reality as I knew it broken, demented, distorted. I looked again at my hand... The shards of glass still glistened in the light, even covered in blood. I saw a piece of bone fractured. I glanced again at the clock, 3:07... ""When did that happen?"" I said, as recollections of what had just happened streamed back into my mind. Did I wake up my parents when I hit the mirror? Then reality hit me in a particularly cruel manner.

For a moment, dead silence.

“MOM, DAD!” I yelled as I sprinted across the house into their room. There they lay. Bloody and mangled bodies, multiple stab wounds on both of them, in the torso, the chest, the legs, the knees, even the face.

I hugged them, soaked in their still warm blood. Yelling at the top of my lungs, “I’M SO SORRY! I’M SO SORRY!” 

Like a pin dropping, the tick of the clock in their room brought me to how real this was.

But only one thought reverberated in my mind. 

This is going to totally ruin my day... 

After about 20 minutes, the blood grew cold, and the corpses began feeling rather stale. I walked around their room, looking for my next day’s lunch money, and as I was walking out, I slipped in a pool of blood. With a loud crash, I continued to lay on the floor for quite some time, I silently muttered to myself

“Dammit, now I need to get some new clothes.”

I began pacing toward my room, taking off my shirt, frustrated by this inconvenience. I threw it on the floor, and it made a sloshing sound. ""Maybe I can wash it..."" My mother had done my wash up until now. I took a shower and put on some new clothes. Clean at last. 

I walked back into my parents room. I stared a little while. Maybe 2 or 3... hours. It was so… Peaceful. This should’ve happened a long time ago.

When I remembered that it was time for bed. 

I began laughing. Laughing as I never had before in my life. Overjoyed. More genuine than any laugh I have ever had. 

Time for bed? I don’t have a bedtime anymore. No one to yell at me. No one to tear my mind apart. I laughed and laughed until I heard my alarm clock go off in my room. 

“Oh, time for school!” I said with a grin on my face.
But without my parents here to test me, this was no race.
Me? This house was now my place. 
I'm here to stay, for I had left quite a trace.
",Reflection,15,nosleep
Dectrek,2,,4,1rbx7r,,13,"All my life I have never believed in luck. It’s just some stupid phrase coined from the minds of jealous or self-absorbed people saying, “Aren’t I the greatest, I just won $50,000 off the lottery! I’m so lucky!” or, “Can you believe that he just won 50 grand off the lottery, that son of a gun.” Now just because I think that luck is a bunch of crap doesn’t mean that I gamble. Oh I gamble alright, I gamble until I’m rich and drunk at the same time. I’ve been to Vegas with my friends, Ron, Jerry, and Max a ton of times and they always say, “Wow Rob, you’re so lucky!” and I’ll either ignore them, or I’ll be too drunk to hear them. I was addict when it came to gambling, but one night, that all changed.

It was another Vegas trip with the guys. I had lied to my company telling them that I was going on a “business trip” and they had completely bought it. I even was able to use company money to pay for the trip! We checked into our hotel room and decided that tonight, we were going to live like there was no tomorrow. I played craps until I was running low on money so I went to the blackjack table and counted cards until I was well funded for the rest of the night. We drank and we drank and we drank until we could barely see anymore. I started to black out so we went to the streets.
	
Now the next events were blurry and I don’t remember all of it. I think what happened was that my friends were telling me that I lucked out at blackjack when one of them said something about me cheating. I got all offended and started taking hits at him and I think we got in a fight. Next thing I knew I was in an alley and was starting to black out, probably not such a good idea to have had that much to drink, and that’s when every turned black.
	
This is when it happened. First, everything was dark and I couldn’t feel anything but then I heard voices. They were cheering all around me that sounded like something exciting was happening and then I got the sense of feeling back. I was lying on my back and there were voices all around me, cheering as if it was a football game. Then the lights went up.

I was blinded at first but as my eyes adjusted to the light, I saw thousands of people sitting in stand around a stage that I was on. I was laying a colorful wheel, something you would see on the wheel of fortune, and I couldn’t get up. Beyond the crowed was darkness and the only light came from a huge light bulb that was about 10 yards from where I was laying. A man was standing on the stage and was holding a microphone.
	
“Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome too our next contestant, Rob Johnson!”

The crowd went wild and the wheel started to spin, slowly at first, but it gained speed quickly. I was beginning to feel sick when I heard “Jerry, press the button when you’re ready!” and the wheel began to slow down. As it slowed I heard the man on the stage yell, “Let’s see how luck our contestant is!” too which the crowed started to yell out colors that they thought the wheel would land on. The wheel stopped on the color green, and the crowd screamed with joy. All around the room the color green was shown with the words “Bad luck” on them. I was deeply confused when I heard, “Well it looks like Rob wasn’t too lucky, stay tuned for our next contestant,” too which I blacked out.

I woke up at the hotel in bed, where I instantly began to contemplate what happened during the night. I came to the conclusion that it was all just a dream and that my friends found me in the alley that I passed out in. They had driven me back to the hotel where I slept the rest of the night away and was now waking up from a drunken dream. Ron came into the room where they asked me if I was ok and what I was doing in that alley, too which I replied, that I just had had one too many drinks. They gave me some water and then told me to get ready for breakfast. The rest of the day was ok up until we went back to the casino at night. I was losing my fortune at craps again so I thought I would count cards at Blackjack again to refund my losses.

My count revealed that the next card too be thrown was going to be a four and I had 17 points on the table. He had thrown 4 aces, kings, queens, jacks, 10, and so on and so until 4 to which he had only thrown three. I knew that there was no possible way that I could lose so I went all in He picked up the next card and laid it on the table, and what I saw I couldn’t believe. He had laid down the ace of spades which I distinctly remembered getting three games ago. I just sat there in disbelief as he ranked in all of my money.
	
I ran to the atm and took 5000 dollars out of my account and ran back to the blackjack table where I counted cards until that was all I could think about but every time my calculations revealed what the next card was, It was always a card that made me go over 21. I kept running to the atm and running back to the blackjack table but I always lost. My bank account was swept clean that night; all of the money that I had worked hard for year after year was taken away from me in a few hours.Ron, Jerry, and Max all said that it was just bad luck but I couldn’t believe what happened that night. It had been a terrible night, but not as bad as what happened when I feel asleep.

I was back on the wheel, and everything was exactly the same as the night before, except I got a new color! This time, I landed on purple which lit up the room with the word “Truth”. When I woke up, it was the next day, and my friends came in and brought me too breakfast. That day, my company found out I lied to them about the trip when all of my bank account money disappeared, and I was fired. The bill for the trip was sent to me but I knew I wouldn’t be able to pay for it. That night I was back on the wheel being spun again for a new color.
This continued for ten days, each brought a new horror such as “pain” or “divorce” to which I was beaten up by some muggers and then divorced by my wife. On the eleventh night, I was standing on the stage with the man holding the microphone. “Let’s give it up for Rob Johnson everyone!” The man yelled and the crowd went wild. I was ushered off the stage and was taken into a room with the guy who had the microphone.
	
“Nice job Mr. Johnson,” He said, “The crowd loved you!”
	
“What was that?” I asked, “I demand you tell me at once what is going on.”
	
“Oh, I’m sorry, you must be very confused. I’m Chris Armstrong, and I run this show. You see whenever someone new comes along, we take the number of big sins that that person had committed in the past 24 hours and we have them face the wheel and its consequences that many times. You had 10 total major sins in that past day so you faced the wheel ten times. You sure put a show on for the audience!”
	
“Sins?” I asked.
	
“Oh yes, you committed theft, gambling, murder you name it! You cheated at blackjack, you became drunk, you beat up a few people, and you committed more theft. We haven’t seen a suspect like you for a while!”

“I don’t remember anything like that!” I snapped at him.

“That’s probably because you were drunk when most of it happened. Don’t worry though; you’ll have plenty of opportunities to make up for them later.”

This is when a thought occurred to me, he said I committed murder but I didn’t remember doing, or who I did it too.

“Wait… who did kill?” I asked suspiciously. 

“You don’t know? I thought it would have occurred to you by now. Let’s see if I can make you realize who. You got into a fight with him after you left the casino. You hurt him pretty bad, and in your drunkenness, you killed him. When he came here, we thought that instead of making him face the wheel, why not have him push the button that stops the wheel from spinning. It was an attraction that brought in a larger crowd than usual.”

That’s when I remembered him saying “Push the button when you’re ready Jerry” and how I had gotten into a fight with one of my friends about me cheating at blackjack.”

“I killed Jerry?” I asked in horror, but then a new though came into my mind, “Wait, if Jerry is dead and he pressed the button to stop the wheel, then does that mean I’m…”
	
“Yes, you are dead,” Chris said as if he knew exactly what I was about to ask, “You died of alcohol poisoning when you passed out in the alley. The past 10 days have been a simulation. Mr. Johnson, welcome to Hell.”

Lucky me.

nisyldaed,10,,10,1r6mcx,,11,"Someone once said ""The greatest strengt is to know your weaknesses."" Luckily I found that out quite Early. 
You might say that I've been blessed with a keen perception, so I always tended to grasp certain concepts and situations quicker than the peope around me, which quickly lead me to thinking that I was somehow superior to others.
Letting these thoughts and thus my hubris overtake me : that was and still is my greatest weakness, but ironically the very cause of my Pride allowed me to realise this very thing, so whether it's a blessing or a curse might be your own perspective.

My story begins with something that should have been a regular day at my university, you know: attending courses, not paying attention, browsing the internet on your phone, etc.
I can't really get into detail here, 
because my memorIes of what happened are really blurry, but I remember a loud crack, a bang and loud rumbling. The next Thing I know is waking up in the local hospital.
From what I've been told, the corridor I walked through that day collapsed without any reason and buried 5 students beneath it. I was the only survivor.

NOw, that event didn't really help with the aforementioned pride, quite the contrary:  I convinced myself that somehow I subconsciously saved myself from the collapsing ceiling and that my surival once again showed that I was better than the others wo died.
Once I fully realized what I just thought I couldn't help but feel disgusted by myself, but this was only the beginning of my descent.
Of course I went back to university after a fEw days, since I only had some bruises and a boken finger, and that's when the prideful Thoughts became more frequently and more aggressive. Word of my survival got around pretty quickly, since it's a small university, so everyone I knew and some people I didn't know came up to me and talked like I was some kind of miracle survivor, or in some cases even a hero. And, needless to say, I absolutely loved that. I also began to notice that I began to be more condescending towards other people. Sure, I've always had my share of disrespectful thoughts about some persons but ever since the accident I sometimes said things aloud and I Always hit them where it hurt, it was pathetic to watch.

After a few weeks things started to go bacK to normal, people wouldn't talk to me that much anymore and this bothered me to no end. They wern't giving me attention anymore. Had they forgotten what I waS? Had they forgotten that I WAS SUPERIOR?
It couldn't go on like this, they needed to be reMinded, reminded of the greatness that was mE, no, IS ME!

Remember the quote from the beginning? I think it's bullshit. Because one of the greatest strengths is actually to be a good liar. And what a great liar I am – I've been lying to you all the time!
They still haven't figured out that I blew up the corridor. Still don't know that I indeed survived the collapsing corridor by an accurate calculation. 

And next time I'll be showing them my true greatness, it will be a lasting reminder.",Pride,21,nosleep
TreasureHouseofDoom,16,,62,1r396v,,12,"Channeling Aunt Lucia’s strength and wit, remarkable as both had always been, I felt myself fortified for what lay ahead, but that didn’t mean I was completely unafraid.  Fear and anxiety are nearly interchangeable in certain situations, and shedding them completely is not always the wisest approach.  Composure maintained, I dealt now with redirecting the bases of these emotions into something productive and controllable.  I remembered my mother’s fearlessness, the way she seized every opportunity to create and do good, the inner power she exuded. This I channeled, too.  Sisters in unison (one living and one passed on) to strengthen me, I was sure I carried now a shield of sorts.  Across the miles, as if she knew the battle I faced, I could almost hear my mother say, “Keep your head up, Julianne.  Stay focused.  Do good work.”  This was her mantra, and as far as I knew, it had never failed her.
Laughter rose from the study again, and I was about to step through the door, open myself to the onslaught, when I caught the fragrance of chocolate on the air, warm wafts from just beyond the door from the foyer to the hall.  I heard the voices of children, conversation and giggling, just beyond that, too.  Instinct told me this is where I was needed most.  Dulcie wanted me to follow her into the study, and in her realm, there was no telling what might happen, but Mary’s presence was just ahead of me, and it was possible I would have the opportunity to observe more of the events that had led to terrible schism between friends.
Doors shut and power out, the hall was dark, and the musty odor of rooms not allowed to breathe hung in the air.  I tried but couldn’t recall if I had smelled this odor the night before.  The chill and dank fragrance felt captive, too, as if I were stepping into some forgotten time and place.  It was completely possible that I was, that I had discovered some portal, that Mary had provided one.  Passing doors, I heard the sounds of the once living in other spaces, the turn of a music box in a nursery, the zip and knock of a trestle-powered sewing machine, probably a Singer like the one my mother used as a plant stand at home, the coos of a baby and the lullaby her Mama sang.  These memories, vital and vibrant, empowered me, too.  There was good energy about this place, and I allowed it to circulate now through me.  
Three doors I passed to either side, and I was just about to open the door to the kitchen, when a fourth door to the right opened slightly.  Through the slim space provided, I heard the singsong voice of Dulcie, coy and friendly, beckon, “Won’t you come play with us, Julianne?” In the background, the festive tones of a calliope rose and fell, and I found myself reminded suddenly of a wonderful memory from my childhood.  My siblings and I had been treated to a day at the North Carolina State Fair, where my mother had introduced us to a man she knew from antiques auctions.  He’d shown us the most glorious old calliope, and he’d had a real pet monkey named Clayton the Scoundrel.  
These are the old tricks of angry spirits, to tease some memory out of us, exploit and make it vile, distract good people from good works.  I knew this, but I longed, too, for simpler days, days when my sister, brothers, and I were among familiar people in a familiar place, days when we were too young and innocent to recognize the darkness in others.  
‘Julianne,” familiar voice from the kitchen prevailed, and as I reached for the cool brass doorknob, I knew immediately whom I would find on the other side.  
“Aunt Lucia,” tears stung my eyes, but joy filled my heart.  Three years she had been gone, on the other side, only her voice to guide me, so much more than most others ever had again of a loved one, but now she stood in front of me, poised, pretty, powerful.  Emanating from her in golden beams was the very energy she had radiated in life. “How can this be?”
Aunt Lucia’s smile was warm invitation into the kitchen.  ‘Forgive me, but I worried you wouldn’t get the fudge just right.’ And she laughed at me as others of our family often did.  I was neither a baker nor a cook, ‘but she is a Kook!’ my sister might have said.
‘These young ladies have just introduced me to Vassar fudge.’ And now I saw Mary at the island in Seth’s ultra swank kitchen measuring out white sugar.  Across from her stood Dulcie, her expression perplexed.
‘Miss Lucia, wouldn’t it all be better with more sugar and perhaps a little more cream,’ she asked, but Aunt Lucia only laughed sweetly.
‘Well, Sweet Dulcie,’ she began as if she had known Dulcie Moseley for years, ‘why don’t you tell me.  Isn’t it a Moseley who sent this recipe to you from Vassar, and didn’t she help to invent this sweet confection?’ Aunt Lucia had such a way with children always.  ‘Never ask a yes or no question,’ she had often told me. ‘Always engage a child.  If necessary be wrong so that they may be right.’ I remembered this as she winked at me over Dulcie’s golden head.
‘Well, no, Ma’am. My Aunt Mae did send this, but she isn’t a Moseley; she’s a Baker, on my mother’s side,’ and she and Mary burst into laughter as if her aunt’s being a Baker who sends fudge recipes was just about the funniest thing they’d ever heard.
‘Or she could be a Boiler or a Cook,’ Mary giggled.  I watched in some awe as the two girls exchanged looks of pure love, deep respect, and as my Aunt mitigated whatever memory might endanger this momentary union. 
Now she turned to me, expression earnest, voice so soft I practically had to read her lips to understand her words. ‘Mary is a pip and an angel, but there’s deep sorrow about her, and Dulcie really is a sweet girl, good and kind, but the anger that rages in her spirit is pure fire. You must handle this all very carefully, cautiously, and you mustn’t lose either your temper or your control.’
This was the way of the women in my family.  Always they’d presume that the younger women were ready for anything, too, that we could accomplish anything we set our minds to, that our minds over matters-at-hand would suffice.
“How did I get myself into this mess,” I said out loud, and Aunt Lucia raised finely sculpted eyebrows, as if to ask, ‘You mean you don’t know?’ and suddenly I was reminded of the walk through the cemetery, the prank gone too far, the Ouija board I’d promised my mother I’d never used.
‘How you came to be in the middle of this is no longer the issue. What matters is how you plan to get yourself out.’ And her insistence that I must disengage myself only after my promise to Mary was satisfied was implicit.  There really was no other way.  Now she only mouthed without even a hint of whisper, ‘Don’t bring home any hitchhikers,’ and I understood her warning.  There are people who live their lives under the shadows of dark, sad spirits, hitchhikers who will never find their paths home. To be under such shadow would be detriment not only to me but also to anyone who loved me.
“But what do I do?” I asked Aunt Lucia.  And perhaps some answer would have come if only I had been strong enough to hold this lively memory open longer.  Instead, I felt the collapse of these exhausted spirits in front of me, and in moments the vision in the kitchen they had never known had faded.  Only red and black trim against the swank white and stainless of the kitchen Seth’s mother had designed remained, or so I thought at first, but as I investigated more closely, I found the buttery print of a child’s right hand smudged where Dulcie had stood only moments before. Moving closer to it, I thought about tearing a paper towel from the roll that stood upright just beside the sink to press it down for some evidence of this impossible reality, when suddenly it combusted to tiny flames and the sizzle against the stainless island carried the salty tingle of tears.
The nature of my gift is such that I cannot press spirits to reveal themselves, and even if I could, I don’t believe I ever would.  Instinct dictates that as little engagement as possible is always the best mode, and it’s a rule by which I live my life whenever possible.  But I knew I’d have to take a more proactive stance to accomplish what we all—Mary, Dulcie, and I—needed, and for that I’d have to examine the house. 
I thought back to the night before, almost literally decades ago considering the journey along which these girls had brought me, and the things Seth had told me about the house.  I knew, for instance, that his father had discovered a secret compartment in the study, that old photos and tintypes had been stored in the tin handkerchief box found in the wardrobe that stood in his parents’ room, that the hall was part of an elaborate addition to join the kitchen to the rest of the house, and that the Ouija board was strictly taboo in the Jefferies household, just as it would have been in mine. I knew, too, that the kitchen was not built in 1870 when the house had been, and that the original kitchen must have stood just past the rock wall in the farthest portion of the back yard.  I did not, however, know where the Ouija board had come from originally, and now I wondered if it had been in the house when the Jefferies had moved in or if it had come into the house with them.
I’d have to go to the study to begin my investigation.  The notion sickened and worried me, but I gathered myself for the inevitable.  My mother had long taught me that the most direct way to gain protection from spirits that might harm you was to go to the Big Guy himself.  Some might laugh at this, but faith was and still is much more than a crutch for me, and anyone who believes in the fires of Hell must embrace the comforts of Heaven, too.  Opening the door to the study, I pushed it open so that the door knob bounced lightly against a chair just to the left of it.  Colder air pushed into the space right in front of me, and I shivered as if I were outside in a snowstorm.  Dulcie was here now, I knew, and she had been waiting for me.  

“Our Father who art in Heaven,” I began, voice bold and strong, “Hallowed be Thy name,” The chandelier above the Dr Jefferies broad mahoghany desk swayed slightly at first and then began to spin from the center, reminding me of the whirl-a-round at the park. “Thy Kingdom Come, Thy will be done—” 
And now Dulcie laughed with much more depth than a child might have, cold echo of the anger that was eating away her soul, interrupted to say, “I’m not the Devil, Julianne. I’m only a little girl, afterall.”
And I strengthened myself for the tantrum I felt welling in her, “On Earth as it is in Heaven.”
“Look at me, Julianne.” And it was all I could do to not make direct eye contact with her, but I did see that she was as pretty in what came close to flesh as she had been in the picture, innocent and sweet looking, and completely mesmerizing in her charming presentation. If I had not known what I did, if I could not recognize the hate that burned her from the inside out, I would have reached to hold her, stroked her golden ringlets, played dolls or drawn with her just as I would have my own little sister, but there was no denying the tenacious embers of her eyes, even as I avoided contact with them.
“Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us,” And now her laughter was maniacal, sad and laughing all at the same time.
“‘Forgive us our trespasses’,” she mocked, “and who is the trespasser here?” The question hovered between us and then seemed to take on an energy all its own as the accessories on Dr Jefferies desk and the loose items throughout the room rose and began to spin as if convection of Dulcie’s anger moved them.
“Lead us not into Temptation,” I continued, spirit emboldened with every word of the prayer I had known by heart ever since I had been a toddler, “but deliver us from Evil—“
And Dulcie’s angry laughter swelled to a cackle that rattled the house, but then it fell, too, as the little girl so consumed by anger became increasingly exhausted as I continued, “for Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, Forever and Ever. Amen.”
I knew the entities that had exploited Dulcie’s sorrow and loneliness were not dormant and would not give up so easily.  Stronger now, I added, “Dear Heavenly Father, Give me strength for the challenges I face, and cast all unkind, mischievous, or evil spirits from my presence.  Wrap me in your loving arms to protect and fortify me.  I ask these things in your name. Amen.”
And now the room became silent, its energy subdued, and the objects that had spun around me lowered then settled in relative proximity to where they had been to start.  I breathed deep solace and was happy to find new warmth about the room and to detect the spicy scent of candles burned perhaps days ago in the air.  For the time being, this was a study almost like any other.  Now I set my task to discovering its every secret free from interruption for awhile.

Spudz_OCD,6,,5,1rgcw5,,10,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

So I approached her because what my grandmother told me just wasn't enough. 

She was in the park, on a bench with anther woman.

I said hi, and at first I started just saying random stuff like the commenting on the weather and such things, but then I decided to ask what I want to know. I asked her if I can talk to her about it, and the other woman excused herself.

I asked her a lot of questions, but basically all she told me was that if I really am not Magdalena, she can't tell me all those things.
Though she said if I am her, and she finds it out, then I'll be sorry for lying, because a deal's a deal and you just can't run from it. She said she'll know if I'm lying to her because she always knows. I
 was pretty scared so I tried explaining to her that I really, really, REALLY am NOT my great-grandmother, but she told me ""Don't bother"", and explained to me that if I AM Magdalena, she'll know. ""How will you know?"" ""I'll be.. seeing you around.. so I'll know easily."" Creepy, stalker-ish, creepy.

I asked HOW could I be Magdalena - it's been a LONG time. Even if she was alive she'd be OLD. But she just giggled and wouldn't explain. ""Can't tell you now. You'll probably find out one day. Actually, it may be very soon"".
I wouldn't stop asking and making remarks at how impossible it is, but she just said ""It happens. And she wouldn't be the only one, you know"".

And in the end, she said something like ""Let's say I believe you - but if you are lying... We're friends, but that doesn't mean you can just forget a deal. A deal is still a deal even if we're friends. And you're not being a friend right now."" 
I tried to say I'm NOT lying, I was like ""I'm not.."", but she cut me off , ""Just in case."", she said and then got up and  started just walking away, but she came back and said, almost laughing ""I was on the bench first, you're the one that should go now"". 
So  I got up and as I was leaving, after I said ""Bye"", she said ""Bye bye... IRINA."", with an eyebrow raised and a smirk. As in ""I know it's not Irina but whatever I'll say it for now."" Like if someone says ""He's just a friend"" and then you'd say ""Sure... FRIEND"". That kind of tone.

I'm not sure if I should be afraid.
I mean she didn't do anything to me and she doesn't seem to even want to anything to ME as me, as in really me, not Magdalena, but it's still creepy. Especially the ""I'll be seeing you around"" part. That's basically ""I'll be looking at you"". Kinda scares me.

Should I, actually, could I, do anything now? Or just ignore it?",Who is this woman ? (Part 2),14,nosleep
