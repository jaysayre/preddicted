christph,17,14,1rbddr,25,As we head into the implementation of the new health care bill I have to say that I am extremely worried because the affordability track record of selfsustaining guaranteed issue plans in the states that have tried them Tennessee Vermont Maine Washington and most recently Massachusetts is not good The statewide guaranteed issue programs have all failed people with serious illnesses even more so than the high risk pools which everybody understands from the outset will lose money so they are funded by a tax on other insurance generally  making them in some cases much more affordable for chronically ill people than the state plans because they are high actuarial value plans which the chronically ill need But they are very hard to get intosome states even have lotteries So I think it beehooves us to learn more about Canadas healthcare system and the best place to do that is directly from a reliable source Canadas healthcare agencyhttpwwwcfhifcasscaPublicationsAndResourcesMythbustersaspxSo I would like to point to this interesting series of articles they have on their site called Myth BustershttpwwwcfhifcasscaPublicationsAndResourcesMythbustersaspx Basically Myth Busters addresses myths about healthcare in Canada Some of them bust myths which are the result of heavy exposure of Canadians to memes which are being pushed in the US but which are inaccurate For example Myth User Fees Ensure Better Use of Health ServiceshttpwwwcfhifcasscaPublicationsAndResourcesMythbustersArticleViewacececdbaspxThe evidence on user fees is clear it is time to put this policy zombie to rest Generating revenue by essentially imposing a tax on illness is not good policy If the goal is to ensure better use of health services finding and eliminating inefficiencies across the continuum of care holds much more promise Myth Activitybased Funding Leads to Forprofit Hospital CarehttpwwwcfhifcasscaPublicationsAndResourcesMythbustersArticleViewfcacdedfdccdaspxThis Mythbusters explores how activitybased funding ABF is really one piece of the hospital funding jigsaw Implemented carefully it can play a role in reducing wait times and enhancing hospital accountability Myth The aging population is to blame for uncontrollable healthcare costshttpwwwcfhifcasscaPublicationsAndResourcesMythbustersArticleViewffcbbfdebfbcaaspxHealthcare costs dont inflate uncontrollably just because there are more seniors Boomerangst as it has been cleverly dubbed isnt based in reality so say the experts Myth If a drug makes it to market its safe for everyonehttpwwwcfhifcasscaPublicationsAndResourcesMythbustersArticleViewfcafcffaadcbacafbbadddaspxDespite the various measures in place to enhance drug safety adverse drug reactions remain a leading health concern for Canadians This Mythbusters issue clearly outlines why the inclination to believe that drugs on the market are safe for all is false and where we are making progress in postmarket drug safety Myth Most physicians prefer feeforservice paymentshttpwwwcfhifcasscaPublicationsAndResourcesMythbustersArticleViewbebbecdabaadedbaspxThis Mythbusters article takes on the commonly held belief that physicians prefer working under the feeforservice payment model Myth Emergency room overcrowding is caused by nonurgent caseshttpwwwcfhifcasscaPublicationsAndResourcesMythbustersArticleViewaffeadbedffaaspxResearch suggests that simply reducing noses through the ER door and introducing more primary care physicians alone will not resolve the backlog ER overcrowding is a symptom of a larger set of issues that cannot be addressed by the emergency department  or even hospitals  aloneThere are dozens more herehttpwwwcfhifcasscaPublicationsAndResourcesMythbustersaspx,1385249105.0,Since Americans are very curious about Canadas healthcare system take a look at their informative Myth Buster publications,39,politics,hot
