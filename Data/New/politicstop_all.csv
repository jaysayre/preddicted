priority contacts list  The list is in the data file linked above and Ive also copied the names and numbers belowWhen you dial the number youll be connected to an intern sitting in front of a clipboard or computer screen with check boxes  Wasting your breath with longwinded discussion helps no one  Keep it as clear and simple as possible and be kind to the person youre talking to they control whether your message goes up the chainHi Im calling to ask representative X to support Rep Holts repeal the surveillance state act HR   Im very concerned about PRISM and XKeyscore  Please pass my message along to the representativeIf you are not asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent dont provide it  If you are a constituent make sure they get your zip code  If you are asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent say Im calling Rep X in connection with his role on the house judiciary committee where she is making decisions that affect me directly and Id like my message passed along though I am not a constituentII  Call your own reps  Heres the link to find their contact informationhttpwwwusagovContactElectedshtml  Use the data above to let them know youre familiar with their voting record and it will be influencing your vote  Again keep it brief  Ask them to support Holts Repeal the Surveillance State Act HR III  Reach out to friends and family and get them to call  This is the second most important thing you can do  Especially family that are in the districts of high priority contacts  For every person you convince to call you are doubling tripling quadrupling your impactEvery step you help them take increases the probability they will callLooking up their reps for them and sending them the phone numbers probably doubles the chances theyll callExplaining the situation how to talk to interns as I explained to you above then dialing the phone for them and sticking it in their hand probably puts you close to  successIV  Share this post or

sensitive private data about its customers with the governmentCISPA would override all other federal and state privacy laws and allow a private company to share nearly anythingfrom the contents of private emails and Internet browsing history to medical educational and financial recordsas long as it directly pertains to a cyber threat which is broadly definedCISPA does not require that data shared with the government be stripped of unnecessary personallyidentifiable information A private company may choose to anonymize the data it shares with the government However there is no requirement that it does soeven when personallyidentifiable information is unnecessary for cybersecurity measures For example emails could be shared with the full names of their authors and recipients A company could decide to leave the names of its customers in the data it shares with the government merely because it does not want to incur the expense of deleting them This is contrary to the recommendations of the House Republican Cybersecurity Task Force and other bills to authorize information sharing which require companies to make a reasonable effort to minimize the sharing of personallyidentifiable informationCISPA would allow the government to use collected private information for reasons other than cybersecurity The government could use any information it receives for any lawful purpose besides regulatory purposes so long as the same use can also be justified by cybersecurity or the protection of national security This would provide no meaningful limita government official could easily create a connection to national security to justify nearly any type of investigationCISPA would give Internet Service Providers free rein to monitor the private communications and activities of users on their networks ISPs would have wide latitude to do anything that can be construed as part of a cybersecurity system regardless of any other privacy or telecommunications lawCISPA would empower the military and the National Security Agency NSA to collect information about domestic Internet users Other information sharing bills would direct private information from domestic sources to civilian agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security CISPA contains no such limitation Instead the Department of Defense and the NSA could solicit and receive information directly from American companies about users and systems inside the United StatesCISPA places too much faith in private companies to safeguard their most sensitive customer data from government intrusion While information sharing would be voluntary under CISPA the government has a variety of ways to pressure private companies to share large volumes of customer information With complete legal immunity private companies have few clear incentives to resist such pressure There is also no requirement that companies ever tell their customers what they have shared with the government either before or after the fact As informed consumers Americans expect technology companies to have clear privacy policies telling us exactly how and when the company will use and share our personal data so that we can make informed choices about which companies have earned our trust and deserve our businesscopy pasted from the above linked PDFCISPA really is the Big Brother law,1335275621.0,This is

Zenkin,1043,18663,swseu,3042,Reddit Inc has obviously not been as gungho about stopping CISPA as it was about SOPA No big deal We understand that you are a corporation and you have your own interests However I strongly suggest that Reddit Inc takes a serious stance against CISPA If there isnt a movement by the corporation then it will be done by the people Two ideas I propose removing Reddit from our AdBlock exceptions list on May st This will continue until Reddit Inc decides to join us in opposing Cispa Also beginning on May  there will be a boycott of purchasing Reddit Gold Thanks for the ideas guys A week long boycott going through May  until May  Seven days of redditors not using RedditIf they join us on or before May th we will not need to do the boycott If they join any time after May  then the boycott needs to continue as planned It will not be very convincing if we just wuss out three days into a demonstrationSo what do you think Do you like the idea Will you actually do itEdit Changed the date to May  so that rFIA will not endangered by the blackout My badEdit  Herehttpwwwredditcomrideasfortheadminscommentsswutlookingforadminsupportagainstcispainthe is a link to a thread for the admins Give it some publicity and hopefully we will hear from Reddit personallyEdit  Along with AdBlocking we should do a Reddit Gold boycott No one purchases gold memberships until we see action Any positive reinforcement on this and Ill add it to the list ImplementedEdit  HerehttpwwwredditcomrevolutionRedditcommentsswgytcybersecurityroundtworeddithivemindvsus is a link to some other great web activism We dont have to stop at CISPAEdit  Okay a lot of people are leaving messages about how we need to hit the politicians I couldnt agree more but I also accept the fact that this is less likely If we could get some people to send letters and make phone calls to their representatives it would be much more effective at mitigating future bills that negatively affect us Can someone write up an exampletemplate so that we can send these letters en masseEdit  Awesome InfographichttpiimgurcomgaPbjpg that gives some explanation of CISPA vs SOPAEdit  Making requests for the FBI to send you all the information they have on you Might be a good heads up to see some of the types of information that entities will be able to share with each other A few thousand requests should be a pretty clear headsup Linkhttpgetmyfbifilecom to info about getting your FBI file Better idea Let me knowSerious Edit Alright so there are a lot of people who will not surprisingly refuse to leave reddit for a week Since this seems to be so intolerable Ive gotten an interesting suggestion  For the days that we have our protestboycott people should make accounts with something such as ANTICISPAPROTESTxxx where the xs are for a random number so you can all make these accountsNo use of your normal username just the protesting one This will keep Reddit informed about our dissatisfaction with their stance on CISPA and also allow people to take a bigger advantage of our tierstyle boycott No use for the serious boycott only ANTICISPA accounts for the people who still want to make an impact Can I get some feedbackAn honest thank you to POTATOINMYANUS for this seriously brilliant suggestion To the administrators I am making a request for two things If the admins absolutely cannot under any circumstance blackout the site then have them write an incredibly detailed blog post much like they did about PIPASOPA so that users can be informed motivated and encouraged to take action on their own Using the blog post to effectively spread the word across the entire site will show the users just how much of an impact CISPA has on all American internet users Have the admins explicitly state that while CISPA does not really affect reddit INC all that much it does dramatically eliminate many safeguards for user privacy and expectations of anonymity Have them explain that while they cannot black out the site that they are using their voice as best they can to explain to users that they need to advocate for themselves and how they can do itThank you to SwampySoccerField for this great idea in communicating with the adminsI am not trying to make this an antiReddit campaign You allow us to communicate very effectively and we thoroughly enjoy using your site I know that we can come to an agreement But please show us that you are listening Show us that you are trying to do something that can benefit hopefully with some good politically motivated action everyoneSUNDAY EDIT Again thank you so much You guys have been awesome Linkhttpwwwredditcomrannouncementscommentssxdxvaquicknoteoncispaandrelatedbillschse to the administrators response Thank you for responding to us and starting to really help us out here Lets not think that this thing is over it is only the beginning Herehttpwwwredditcomrpoliticscommentssyifredditorsitstimetotakeactionfourbillsare is a link to the start of our movementMonday Edit No response from Reddit Inc AdBlock is on I hope to hear from some of you that youve started to protest alongside me Still looking for a better solution but havent been getting a lot of response I was thinking that we could push the idea of using throwaway accounts with ANTICISPA in the name closer to May  Maybe if Reddit sees some outcry theyll actually want to take a stance before we abandon the site for a week Keep up the good fightFinal Edit Sorry about the delay Ive had a lot of things going on so I wasnt able to log in late last night This will be my last postcommentanything on Reddit until the st I hope all of you were serious when you said youd join me For those of you who simply can not resist Reddit I ask that you kindly stop using your normal account Make one called CISPAPROTEST and postcommentvote with that You guys have been great Ill see
