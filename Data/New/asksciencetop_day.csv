leftylouis,10,3,1rp7zv,7,So far my understanding of light is that it is radiation of an photon or a wavelengthin this case it isnt a particle But i know that by the decay of an electron to a lower shell there will be energy wich will be emitted into a wavelength and if has the right ammount of energy then we can see it  so is it that in a lightbulb that you force a lot of electrons through wire that doesnt really allow them to pass but how do they release radiation in this way and how does a LED do this about the electron You have a neutron with betadecay udd to uud the up is a bit lighter then the down so there is some excess energy wich is a electron and a positron anti electron the electron has a negative charge nad the proton a positive but doe this charge mean a constant emission of photons wich makes electromagnetism wich keeps makes up the electron shells and what does the negative charge do i am probably a bit on the wrong path with this story but i dont really know how to ask my questions but i hope this makes senseand ofcourse now knowing if a electron is a particle or a wavelength isnt really helping me either because it is hard to think something is not a particle but but a wavelength and then what is a wavelength but in some situations it is hard to understand that there is a particle without mass etc etc i dont want to spend too much time on this but i allready gave up on even thinking about it i just want to learn some basics so i know what is going on while doing chemistry instead of just using electrons interacting with protonsThanks,1385714678.0,How does a Lightbulb or LED emit photons  from electron to photon,10,askscience,top_day

leftylouis,10,3,1rp7zv,6,So far my understanding of light is that it is radiation of an photon or a wavelengthin this case it isnt a particle But i know that by the decay of an electron to a lower shell there will be energy wich will be emitted into a wavelength and if has the right ammount of energy then we can see it  so is it that in a lightbulb that you force a lot of electrons through wire that doesnt really allow them to pass but how do they release radiation in this way and how does a LED do this about the electron You have a neutron with betadecay udd to uud the up is a bit lighter then the down so there is some excess energy wich is a electron and a positron anti electron the electron has a negative charge nad the proton a positive but doe this charge mean a constant emission of photons wich makes electromagnetism wich keeps makes up the electron shells and what does the negative charge do i am probably a bit on the wrong path with this story but i dont really know how to ask my questions but i hope this makes senseand ofcourse now knowing if a electron is a particle or a wavelength isnt really helping me either because it is hard to think something is not a particle but but a wavelength and then what is a wavelength but in some situations it is hard to understand that there is a particle without mass etc etc i dont want to spend too much time on this but i allready gave up on even thinking about it i just want to learn some basics so i know what is going on while doing chemistry instead of just using electrons interacting with protonsThanks,1385714678.0,How does a Lightbulb or LED emit photons  from electron to photon,9,askscience,top_day
DudetheGuy,9,5,1rpj3t,3,Just like the title if we were to build a space elevator that went up as high as the international space station would the person in the elevator experience zero gravity at the top of it The reason I was wondering is because I thought the feeling of zeroG was caused by falling and missing the ground and am not sure if its the same with the elevator Any answer would be appreciated thanks,1385732547.0,Is there zerogravity at the top of a space elevator,8,askscience,top_day

Rostifer,6,2,1rozo5,4,So Im reading this book The Man in the High Castle Its about an alternate history where the Axis win WWII Anyway in the book the Germans have drained the Mediterranean in order to make more farmland For quite a few different reasons this sort of thing doesnt seem possible to me water displacement issues the saltiness of the sea bed also it seems like it would just take way too longSo what do you think Is it possible If so how would you do it What sort of problems might a project like this cause Edit Grammar,1385704516.0,Would it be possible to drain the Mediterranean Sea in order to grow crops in the sea bed,6,askscience,top_day

axtolip,7,1,1rodeo,5,We have a source that emits one single photon This single photon goes throught a beam splitter that has a  of probability of sending it through one path or another Eventually these two paths cross each other If we dont try to measure through which path the photon went could we say the photon has taken both paths If so would these two photons be able to interefere once the paths cross Would it be possible to measure said interference,1385682852.0,Quantum erasers is one single photon capable of interfering with itself,6,askscience,top_day
