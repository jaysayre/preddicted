Meltingteeth,184,228,1rjd61,939,Quick background This is back from my tier support days at a university This generally involved me sitting at a desk waiting for students to bring me their computers when they had some sort of issue however occasionally I worked with staff members and various departments across campus This happened during my final weeks at this job I received a call from the head of the relatively small Reference department The department head was a crotchety old man COM who submitted trouble tickets like he was trying to win the lottery He had been working at this job for a solid decade and was stubborn as a mule COM had said that his computer was running ridiculously slow Checking old tickets I saw that he had complained of this three times before The first time they had wiped a solid amount of trash programs files and registry redundancies This legitimately helped him The next two times he had demanded that they take it to the workbench for servicing because it was still slow and there was obviously something wrong Both times they found nothing I massage my temples as he talks and tell him Ill be right over to look at itTen minutes later Im in COMs office looking at his computer Its nothing fancy just a Dell Optiplex i and  gigs of RAM He didnt need it for anything other than database study and library cataloging Predictably COM tells me quote The damn thing is far too slow and never speeds up when you people bring it back from repair I wish you would just fucking replace it already IBM computers are absolute shit This little bit was important because it showed me that he had absolutely no clue what kind of computer he was usingNow I have a pretty high patience level but I get particularly annoyed when users say you people and swear at me I inspect his computer and theres nothing urgently wrong with it He has an Ask toolbar installed but nothing thats eating resources or bogging it down After a few more minutes of COMs bickering I have a fun idea and tell him that Im going to take it over to the workbench transfer all of his files safely and give him a new processor and more memory I usually try to keep terminology as simple as possible with users but the larger words are always there to boost user confidence and add flair So I take COMs computer over to the workbench and grab a pail of cleaning supplies As you can probably guess from this I spend the next ten minutes dusting out his computer and wiping every safe surface down with Clorox wipes By the time Im done the computer looks brand new I even snagged an i badge from a shelved unit in the back and put it on the front I bring the shiny new model to COMs office I tell him that Ive upgraded his memory as well as installed an i processor and ask him to try it out Right away I get Jesus Christ thats much better out of him I stick around for another minute to change some accessibility settings for him and leave his office as he provides me with a low Thanks kid The influx of tickets from COM fortunately stopped for the rest of the time I was there however I wonder to this day if he took my replacement as an example of how to acquire new equipment At the very least it shouldnt have been too hard for helpdesk to outfit him with a new mouse and keyboardTLDR Angry older user demands a newer faster computer Clorox wipes and a sticker are the best upgrade,1385513663.0,My computer is running too slow replace it with a new one A case study on the placebo effect,1167,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week

Techsupportvictim,41,199,1ral73,850,Gent comes in to our store a couple of weeks ago Issue with his laptop I dont actually recall what the issue was in the end but we needed to send it to our repair depot At least three days out of his hands as many as seven He needed to back up his stuff cause apparently he never had in the almost year he had had it So we had gotten him a hard drive showed him out to set it up etc Game plan he goes home backs it up and then drops it off and we send it out With luck they dont have too many machines and its back fast Roll forward two weeks and he comes in to drop it out off morning Saturday To be shipped via a third party that doesnt pick up on Saturdays to go to a center that isnt open on Sundays anyway Im not the one doing the paperwork but I can hear the whole thing from my postTech taking it in tells him that it will go out Monday with luck by delivered back on Wednesday maybe Thursday To wit the guy yells out him that he is leaving to go out of the country first thing Monday morning and must have his computer for the trip Now remember this all started two weeks ago and we could have sent it out that day if hed been backing it up like a good user double since he uses this for business it seems The tech explains to him that this is not a repair we can do in store because we dont have the proper tools and parts and they would take a week to arrive even if we could get them And according to the notes he knew two weeks ago what needed to be done All very calmlyThe guy yells for a manager and our lead tech comes over Hears the whole convo hears the guy ranting about what are you going to do about it  and with a totally calm and straight face simply replies A lack of planning on your part doesnt equal an emergency on ours Ive heard it said several times on the web but never in the wild,1385226351.0,A lack of planning on your part   ,1049,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week

Meltingteeth,145,143,1rguyg,645,Background My first IT job involved me doing Tier  support at a University This basically involved sitting at a desk waiting for users to come to me with issues which was pretty awesome Phone troubleshooting sucks However I would occasionally get a call from across campus or a remote location that would require me to go there personally This was no problem I generally enjoy the exercise and fresh airSo about a week into this job I get a call from our University Records department to come help with a monitor issue No problem someone had logged it from a previous ticket that it had a failing VGA port that would likely eventually fail The monitor wasnt swapped because at the time it was still perfectly functional albeit a tad finicky when it came to bumps and the user had a dualmonitor setup I grabbed another monitor up and hurried over to the building where it was located I knocked on the door to the targeted office what greets me is a scowling middleaged woman SW for short who practically drags me inside The conversation went something like thisSW Finally Ive been waiting here staring at a blank monitor for ages It had been ten minutes At this point I notice that her second monitor is also offMe Im not sorry I see that your second monitor is off Is there something wrong with it as wellSW No I dont use that monitor because having two screens is inefficient and overly complicatedWut But you could have put your work on the other  Screw it Im not here to change her work style I swap out the monitor which does in fact have a faulty port while SW continues to rant Me Well that should do it Customer service reflex Is there anything else I can help you withSW Yes actually cringe My damn scanner is too slow when I try to scan documentsMe Ok lets take a lookSW proceeds open a PDF file from email The file opens in Adobe Acrobat Pro the default prints it out the department was using an Inkjet at the time which took an extra minute places it on the scanner and selects the scanners stock program to scan the page into an oddly highresolution JPEG Cringe whiplash This of course takes a few minutesSW See The damn thing takes forever to scan and Im emailed  of these documents every dayMe Well could we possibly lower the quality of Wait that document you just printed from that file and scanned is that the same process you use for all of your other scanned documentsSW Yes i have to scan these into an image for our record system and I cant lower the quality because then some of the signatures dont showShe was printing documents from Adobe Acrobat Pro and scanning them into images for whatever system she had to store them in using the default program that came with the scanner I noted that this program had a big obvious Scan as JPEG function with a few sliders one of which controlled resolutionI then spent the next ten minutes showing and writing the process for saving the image to a JPEG directly from Adobe Acrobat Pro She had apparently been doing this open print scan and save process for months I took an early lunch after that one and pondered my career pathTLDR Irate recordkeeper finds a wildly inefficient process to keep records Tier  employee saves department hundreds of dollars,1385434808.0,Basic Googling or even asking someone else would have saved  man hours,788,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week
Rhywden,119,122,1r99ob,638,This is another story from back when I was one of the admins for a mediumsized students dormitory  connected clientsPhysical layout consisted of  houses connected by fiber with every house sporting several Netgear managed switches thus providing  Mbit connections So one evening I was sitting in my room and reading when someone knocked on my door Internet is downFirst thing to check Local issue Tried connecting to the router remotely  no dice Not only is the Internet down but the whole network Went over to the server room and logged in locally and discovered that the router was alive and kicking also the uplink was fine but the connection to our network was borked Around that time a fellow admin showed up who forgot more about networking than Ill ever learnHowever he too failed to spot an immediate source of this error Uplink  fine No errors in the logs Blinkenlights on the switches in the server room are indeed blinking and showing not only connected ports but also active onesWe tried several things over the course of the next hour but did not find anything TCPdump didnt show any incoming traffic on our network facing cardUntil by pure chance or maybe desperation we rebooted the switches Because the network suddenly came to life again and ground to a halt mere seconds laterOkay time for another reset this time with TCPdump to watch whats happening And thats when we saw it A TCP packet which consisted entirely of zeros yes even the leading bytes which should include stuff like source and target port and just one single xF somewhere And it flooded the network for the short time it workedWe then worked out what had obviously happened Some computer in our network broadcasted those malformed packets which in turn caused our switches to freeze in such a state that they appeared to still be working I kid you not if you didnt watch them closely youd notice nothing  it was just that the pattern of blinking and steady lights didnt change over time as it usually would in a live networkThe solution was to pull out all the cables and connect them one by one until the switch failed again That way we discovered the culprit  who wasnt home at the time of course He later told us that he came home to discover that his PC which he had left on to complete a slow and huge download had bluescreened which obviously didnt agree with his NIC which then decided to retaliate against the cruel world in the only way it could,1385167866.0,The TCP packet of death,760,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week
ChoppingOnionsForYou,161,157,1rkp0i,638,I work in a school and because theres just me and Im somewhat lazy I use remote access a lot to updatefix computers round the school If I know Im going to be some time Ill start what I want lock the computer and come back to my desk leaving a LARGE sign stuck to the screenkeyboard saying words to the effect of Mrs ChoppingOnionsforYou is using this PC DO NOT TOUCH ITJust this very lunchtime I decided that the best policy with a PC so infested with malware and crap that nothing ran with anything remotely approaching speed was to nuke it from orbit rebuild it I left the OS rolling out and not  not  but  notes stuck to various places on the PC monitor and keyboard telling anyone NOT to use the machine I ambled off to snarl at some kids fix other issues with the knowledge that by the time Id done that the machine would be ready for the final phases of rollout  viz Making sure Office was properly registered our school database software installed and local printers set up correctlySure in the knowledge that my notes would deter ALL comers I attempted to log onto the PC remotely only to find that someone had beaten me to itArriving at the PC I found all my carefully scribbled notes removed littering the desk in their uselessness as the VERY SAME teacher whod listened to me tell a child NOT to let anyone log onto the PC sat there smug in his knowledge that the PC was now working againMe So despite my copious notes telling you NOT to log on you decidedUser Its OK itd finished updating so I thought I could use itMe Long and hopefully eyeglazingly boring description of the rest of the process required to bring the PC to full useThe user cowed by my grumpy annoyance slunk off to teach his classSure it would have been better if Id removed the PC completely brought it back to my desk and done the rollout here but theres nothing quite like the knowledge of a PC rolling out in a classroom to galvanise me to my fastest worktldr I think you all know the policy on jelly babies by now  if I have to explain it againEdit For all of you kindly suggesting that I remove power to the monitor  I thought about this because it seemed a sensible option but theres BOUND to be one user who actually thinks to restart the damn thing  and while I can always restart the WDS rollout it adds to the time The only sure solution is to remove the PC back to my cupboard,1385564725.0,No no  just ignore my signs I didnt WANT to work on the machine anyway,795,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week
Sounderhawks,138,193,1rn4x4,591,I was told to post this here after putting it in a thread in rtechnology Hopefully its something that will make you laugh Im finally at a point where I laugh about it Please forgive me if it isnt too clear Its been  years since then and Ive been out for  years in college so some of the real technical details have fadedAboard Al Asad in Iraq there was a huge morale drive I was in the Networking Division of unit on base We had a few extra IPs We attached a large NAS to one of our Staff NCOs machines so that if we ever got in trouble theyd just tell them to take it down If it was a Sergeant or below theyd probably end up getting ninjapunched and losing rankAnyway when night shift came on I monitored was able to que up and download most of the Al Asad Morale Drive which at the time was supported by G aka the IT department at the General Officer level When the time to return home came we had close to TB of movies music and TV shows We were somehow acquiring great quality copies of the newest episodes of TV shows I remember getting the newest episode of Generation Kill within  days of it airing back in the USFlash forward about  months and my unit is deploying out to what at the time was a small presence MEB for those who know what that is Camp Bastion When we arrived there wasnt much and we did a lot of work to repair the damage the unit we were replacing had done Since this was our units first full deployment into Afghanistan we took pretty much the best people we could forward in every department This means we had lots of experience in our unitWhen we arrived we were told we dont have a morale drive because we dont have the resources to manage it Well we had more IPs than we needed at the time so we threw that old NAS up on the network We password protected it to our unit to preserve bandwidth This worked fantastic for about two weeks until our S happenedFor those of you who dont know S is the logistics part of a unit They decided to give our password out to various units on the base in exchange for favors Withing  days our unit could barely do any work because our bandwidth was being hammered We decided to change the password againUnfortunately this pissed off the whole base The next day we had calls and emails from angry Es and above asking why the base morale drive had been taken downThis all happened fast so we still werent aware that it was the S who got us in the mess We start replying to the emails like this This is our units asset This isnt the bases server Therefore we are the ones who decide if we will allow access to everyone outside our unit Currently the bandwidth it was using was cutting into performance on our mission critical systems When infrastructure improves we will consider restoring access to the morale driveThis did not go over well There is no fury quite like that of an entitled Master Gunnery Sergeant Soon enough G comes calling asking about access to the morale drive We tell them no for the aforementioned reasons They respond that they have the power to take anything off the network and order us to hand it over to them so they can administer itWe say no because we have a portion of it only accessible to us which had a bunch of things like cracked software cracked versions of LAN games etc We had built an internal network to our department so that after shift change people could hang our and blow off steamWe saw the writing on the wall so we had friends back in the states ship another of the same model NAS out with extra hard drives We backed everything up to that NAS then hid it in some space in one of our legacy servers racks Finally we wiped the harddrives and repeatedly dropped the original NAS until it wouldnt turn on anymoreWe took the broken NAS with the blank harddrives to G The final straw for turnover was their Information Assurance Manager deciding that he was confiscating it because it was a security vulnerability to the internal network Thats the one thing we really couldnt fight since he just has a senior officer sign off on itFor the next couple of months all of us had strange issues with our admin permissions being adjusted and other random annoying netadmin trolling commenced What they didnt know is that we had the domain admin password because they left it in plaintext in a startup scriptAt this point it probably seems really petty and it was However when youre deployed for several months these petty things build up We were pissed because we felt like we were A being punished for trying to provide a service that didnt work out B our stuff was taken with no compensation and C G were fucking with us just because they had nothing better to doAfter we started having random things disappear from our share drive we started counterattacking them Things escalated a bit but they didnt really know how we were getting in Certain people started taking liberties with our billet of being information security personnel They reasoned they could tap into other peoples harddrives if they were connected and delete anything that didnt belong on an official government networkThat all changed when someone deleted the wrong persons pornographic material Technically no porn is allowed on the network This means no naked pictures emailed from the states etc Well apparently these were naked pictures of this guys wife that went missing He took his harddrive to the Colonel of G and had it given to the IAMThat launched a pretty long investigation into my department that ended up with several senior NCOs being relieved of duty and even sent home earlyIronically that wasnt the worst investigation I had done to memy department while deployed By that point I actually knew my rights and was able to skate freeTlDR Attempted to have a morale drive for our unit since one wasnt up Entitled senior enlisted decide their happiness is more important than the bandwidth we needed to run our servers Leads to netadmin troll war between us and a superior unit This leads to a serious investigation and relief of senior leaders This also made our CO mad because it made the unit look bad and we were basically annexed into HQ instead of being our own department and thus got thrown into the mix of a bunch of shitty billetsIf you guys like this one I have one more long one like this about the same department getting investigated on a different deployment That one is my personal favorite because it was the perfect storm of incompetence witch hunting and a command trying to deflect attention from gross misconduct from the senior leadership ,1385641253.0,Tried to implement a media share drive in Afghanistan goes horribly wrong xpost from a thread in rtechnology,784,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week

deshe,83,160,1ri4te,554,  All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced Gather around yall and hear the story of Elijah the most eccentric ISP user of them allIt happened in the year  I was just a  years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my countrys largest ISP telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living I was half decent at my job so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints at nightThere were three of us during night shifts Me a business sector support representative and a shift manager The explained how things work in the land of the night  I would get calls from ordinary customers and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif  the nighttime customers are batshit insane but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah the most batshit insane technically inept socially handicapped short tempered internet user of them allOh I remember the first time I encountered Elijahs presence It was a second order encounter but the waves of fuckingcrazy hit me like a truck The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset No I said no I am not going to help you with that Because that is criminal and not my job way to go Maria Show him whats for After some time she eventually wore him down we have a nohangup policy and he left the conversation steaming Was was that Elijah I asked a question whose answer I already knew Yes she said he wanted to hack ltgeneric dating sitegt and asked me to tell him their IP addressFast forward several months At this point I am a top notch night rep the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets Oh yeah I was getting a lot of attitude I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times and he always was a hoot for example he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesnt know English so I should translate it for him All in all he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction I felt for him which is exactly why I was not ready for things to comeI remember that night all to well The sea was angry that night my friends Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies I had a night shiftAt first things were working out as well as they ought to The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone  a narrow portion of the day just shy of three hours long between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasnt able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor These hours are usually almost completely call free up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at AM in the middle of the week and decided hed rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleepThe phone rangI picked it upThis and that ISP this is deshe how may I be of my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semisentences in a voice I

All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp Elijah I interrupted I cant help you any further We were on the phone for over half an hour there was actually a call in the queue and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support I

deshe He sucks John you could teach him a thing or twoWell thanks I said doing my best to conceal my laughter I decided not to come forward Elijahs intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually wasAnd that was that the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back an all time Elijah classicEPILOGUEI kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time He was never violent or rude just an utter loon He was not a good person he was of the harassing mysogenistic types which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep versions of the tales of Elijah but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and boltsSeveral months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could I was still getting emails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient They decided they should not deal with him anymore They complained and the security chief complied issuing a formal restraining order from the police Elijah was now formally a persona nongrataFast forward three years I am not working there anymore I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch One friday evening out of the blue I get a phone call from an unrecognized number I took itHelloListen I have a picture OK OK that didnt actually happenWhat actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days and well aware of Elijahs shannanigansDude he told me get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOWSo I did There was an episode of A Star Is Born which is the local equivalent of American Idol They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones The guy on the screen was horrid He was fat and obnoxious wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had And his voice oh my god this voice He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus That voice was horrid but it was also oddly familiar It took me about  seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessingThe song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly Well Elijah they said you should never sing in public Ever Now people who audition for A Star Is Born should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered but not our unaware Elijah No nobody talks to Elijah like that He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit spitting at the judges shouting and yelling trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by securityApparently this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show And each time was a sight to see though after that last one he became again a persona non grataPoor

curriedavenger,34,54,1rbh79,328,I previously worked in a computer shop that had a repair section behind the store  We specialised in Apple products and as I worked in the retail section my colleagues and I were the interface between our technicians and our customersOne day a businesswoman walked in with her laptop and demanded that we get her computer working as she cant check her email  A quick check at the service desk in the store revealed that the computer would not boot at all and that it was likely an issue with the motherboard requiring the computer to be formally booked into our onsite service system to arrange for parts and service  I informed her of our labour prices explained how upon a complete diagnostic service we would be in touch with a quote for repair and approximate time frames she can expect to have certain milestones in the process to be completed withinHaving agreed to that I begin getting her details to be entered into our system  She gives me her phone number but when I ask for an addressYou dont need that actuallyNow how she expects to know what I need I didnt understand and I explain that given the extent of work that will be done we have to actually have a billing address since she was not paying upfront  particularly important when the actual problem has yet to be formally diagnosed so we cant really take prior payment since we dont know what the extent of the repairs will beI dont want my mailbox filled with your fucking flyersI explain that our service centres database of customer details is actually separate from our marketing department and that our company does not mail out flyers so there is no risk there  I also explain that without a billing address our checkin software will not process the repairShe reluctantly agrees and I print out the form for her to sign  I watch as she grabs my pen off out of my hand despite having a pen in front of her anyway and begins to cross out two of the three paragraphs in the terms and conditions of the service request  the ones pertaining to contact details  These paragraphs state that we will only ever use the details to contact the customer in regard to this particular service job and that we will never use the details for marketing purposes or otherwise forward the information to any other entityI ask her what she is doing  I dont want to be harassed by telemarketersI ask her to read the parts of the contract that she disagrees with not that I can negotiate different terms but so I can address her concerns like any decent salesperson  I explain again that the only reason we can contact her under this very contract is to speak with her in respect to this repair job and show her the wording that says just that  I also inform her that our terms are not subject to negotiation and I cannot accept her computer unless she signs the full set of termsJust get it doneShe slides the service agreement towards me grabs her handbag and walks out  I now have a broken computer and no valid contract to show for it given that I have not yet signed off on it  The computer is in limbo and I cant do anything with it until a fresh agreement has been signed  However I do have her phone number  I call her to let her know that he computer having been left here without a valid agreement means we cannot service it and we may be forced to treat the laptop as being abandoned  As it was not currently working it had little value and at the close of business it would be left outside of our store for her to pick up unless she requests that we hold onto it  Naturally she yells at me to hold on to it until she can get back to us  I inform her that there is a storage fee of  per day until the service request is completedShe starts going off her goddamn rocker and there is so much sound pouring out of the phone that its grabbing the attention of our other customers even over the obnoxious pop music that we plebs in retail must endure all dayA few hours later she storms into the store with a toddler in tow screaming at our youngest salesperson  a  year old girl  about how we are extorting her  I step in and apologise for making her come back and get the new agreement printed out  She tries crossing out the contact terms in the contract AGAIN and I stop her staying I cannot accept alterations or deletions and she will either need to take the agreement asis or leave with her computerShe then goes quiet and her anger rolls back like the water on a beach just before a tsunami is about to hitand starts sobbing  Sobbing and reading the terms she had earlier deleted  People are now staring at us and I become aware that it appears that I had handed her a letter telling her I never really loved her or something especially as she cried over the contract and continued to sob as she signed it  She grabbed her kid and left without saying a wordHer husband was an asshole too but thats a story for later,1385252369.0,Not so fine print,382,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week

Gambatte,37,88,1rodh8,232,I was sick and tired of the company so I was breaking out my notice was in Off to better and brighter places or at least so I thoughtAs a result of handing in my notice I was transferred to the training school to help administer the training courses until my final day My job now basically consisted of sitting on a computer reading a thousand or more pages of Megatokyohttpwwwmegatokyocom a day I was intrigued by the early insane antics of Largo but I lost interest in the story later on about the time I discovered the Order of the StickhttpwwwgiantitpcomcomicsootslatesthtmlSo Im chilling out on a Friday morning doing nothing in particular when one of the instructors comes down Turns out the PFY from S is for Standardshttpredditrlvnp was on a course there Or at least he was meant to beThe conversation between instructors was essentially as followsgt  Is PFY in the officegt  No  is he meant to be heregt  Well hes not in the classroom no ones seen him at all todaygt  The trainees got paid yesterday didnt they Last time they got paid which was fortnightly PFY went out drinking all night and showed up nearly two hours lategt  What punctuality requirements were specified in the contracts you could be hit with major penalties for being late or not showing up even to internal coursesgt  He said he had a flat on the way to class so I asked him to show me the flat tire When his spare didnt have a puncture he said hed stopped to get it fixed  despite the fact he was already running late When I asked why he didnt call from the garage to explain his lateness he said his cellphone was flat and the garage wouldnt let him use their phone When I asked him to produce a receipt for the repair he finally broke down and confessed hed been lying the whole time and that he actually got drunk and slept through his alarmgt  Whaagt  I know right I let him off with a warning  I didnt care much that he was late but dammit you do not lie about it and especially not right to my faceSo the instructors all disappeared down to the classroom to further question PFYs classmates in case one of them had received a phone call or text message from him Instructor  stuck around for a while calling the local medical center police station and anywhere else he could think of that PFY might be that would be a legitimate excuse for his absence Having had no luck he joined the others in the classroomFunnily enough one of the guys at the company BF had been dating a girl GF that worked as a nurse at the local medical center He had come over that morning to pick up some training materials for his PFYsSo it had come down to me and BF in the office when the main office line rang As the only official member of the training school in the office I picked it up Who should it be but the PFYFrom my previous experience with PFY I could tell by the thin reedy voice he was using that he was not well  the kind of selfinflicted not wellgt PFY Is  theregt ME Hes just down in the classroom Ill see if hes availableI put the phone on mute and walked the portable down to  who was just heading back to the officegt ME  its PFY and by the sound of it he is capital H capital O Hung Overgt  Oh this should be good took the call right next to my desk in the office so I was privy to his end of the conversation PFY claimed that he was at the local medical office  knew this was false as hed already checked there PFY claimed he was having liquid nitrogen treatment for warts The medical facility only received one delivery of liquid nitrogen per week on a Tuesday morning which was completely used up by Tuesday afternoon This was common knowledge to anyone that had been through the procedure before It was also required that you clear it with your workplace before going to the medical facility for anything minor minor being anything that didnt immediately prevent you from working PFY claimed he was in a treatment room with GF BF said that GF had just finished a double shift about an hour previously and had been sound asleep in their bed when he left for work that morning about half an hour ago so that was definitely not true then asked the PFY to put GF who was supposedly in the room with him on the phonegt  Im sorry if this is embarrassing for you GF but youve got one of the worst voices Ive ever heard on a femalegt  gt  Get your ass in here as soon as you can PFYgt  gt  Yes you are very much in the sYes the PFY had decided that the best course of action rather than confessing to going out and getting drunk and sleeping through his alarm again was to lie about it and when caught in that lie to impersonate a femaleFALLOUTAlthough I left the company before seeing the whole spectrum of the fallout I know the entire incident was promptly written up by  and passed on to HR for disciplinary actionThe immediate response from HR was Its not April  is this some kind of joke that I dont

Gambatte,15,39,1rlvnp,153,About a year after the events of T is for Testedhttpredditrjrxi I was leading a small group of technicians in a field office Our support area was the network connecting multiple other devices which had their own specialized support teams the interface devices and the systems that collated and correlated the dataOne of the listed tasks assigned to all new as in fresh out of the training courses technicians was to produce an overview of all of the systems in the office This was quite involved and usually ended up requiring the production of at least three documents each of which would be approved by the supervisor of the team for the relevant areaSo on a semiregular basis a new batch of fresh technicians would arrive in the office theyd complete their listed tasks and receive a pay rise on completion of their on job training book and become available for further training and promotion Generally the OJT book could be completed in a couple of months with a little bit of effortExcept for one particular pimply faced youth PFY He slacked off and never bothered to progress his OJT book at all Much like the PFY of T is for Tested his attitude saw him bounced from department to department Suddenly eight months have passed and the training department is trying to schedule him on a course for further training with a view to promotion when it becomes apparent that he doesnt meet the requirements having still not completed his OJT bookQueue mad rush to get it completed in under two weeksHis system overview hit my desk I picked it up and read through it and immediately wondered why someone who was in such a desperate rush to get it completed had taken the time to Photoshop a photo on page one so that the pictured screen read PFY IS THE MASTERNaturally the write up was a mess Sections that should have had pages of information were covered in four sentences Sections that should have been covered in four sentences went on for pages and pagesSo heavily annotated with the required corrections the draft was returned to the PFY It was not uncommon for three drafts to be required five was not unheard ofWithin two hours he submitted the second draft having changed only one paragraph And again the same comments were madeThe third draft was the same  one paragraph changed despite pages of required corrections I pulled him into the office closed the door and went over every required correction I did everything short of dictate the required text to himFourth draft  one paragraph And the fifth And so onBy the time I was about to reject his eighth draft I was pulled into the office by my supervisor SUgt SU Whats going on with PFY Im catching some flak from the training department over his OJT book and they tell me one of the last things hes got to do is your system overview Has he done itgt ME Well hes triedgt SU What do you meangt ME reaching into hammerspace Heres his latest draft  number eight as I recall Ive already annotated it with where corrections or more information is required Every one of his drafts that I have rejected has had this information and most of the time the information hasnt changedgt ME also from hammerspace For comparison heres an overview that meets the required standardMy supervisor quickly flicked through the two documents and rapidly agreed that the produced overview did not meet the required standardWhich is when the fun startedIn order to assist with the rapid completion of the overview PFY was assigned to my department I was given strict instructions he was to be given all the support he asked for and no other tasks until his overview was up to standard He had  access to the system every reference document except for the previously accepted standard meeting overviews and access to the personnel who knew the system inside and out namely me and my team of PFYsA further three weeks pass Once PFY learned he was to receive no tasks until the overview was completed he spent the time watching DVDs and playing PS  for comparison I received eight drafts in seven days then he was explicitly given nothing else to work on I received two drafts in three weeksEventually with a great deal of encouragement read punishment that increased with each passing day between submissions an acceptable overview was completed and PFY was out of my hair and off on a training courseAnd then his performance review form arrived Again by virtue of him bouncing around so much the time he spent with his thumb firmly implanted in his rear pretending to work was more than with anyone else I tried to pass it off to his previous supervisor PS seeing as hed actually done some work for him but he bluntly refusedSo I filled it out honestlyThe form then went to management for approval and thats when the REAL fun startedApparently PSs manager did not agree with my review PS also disagreed with it when they confronted me about it I mentioned that I had specifically offered PS the chance to fill it out but he had refused to do sogt PS Youre only giving him a bad review because you dont like himgt ME I offered you the chance to fill it out Wait are you saying that I review on factors other than performanceThen PS dropped the bomb he had previously had the PFY of T is for Tested working for him who had filled his head with how much I sucked to work for how I hated my PFYs and how I loved to throw my weight around bully them and so on Despite having known me for years PS had decided to believe this rubbishI was beyond livid at this point I had reached a point where anger gives way to calm resolve in a way I suspect is similar to a fullblown psychotic break I took a deep breath picked up the nearest phone and made a couple of callsMy entire team of PFYs assembled Individually and as a group they all swore that I was one of the better supervisors theyd worked for and had no knowledge of any kind of bullying or harassing actions on my partThe IC from T is for Tested arrived hed transferred to that office not long after I had and laid out the truth of T is for Tested independently verifying that the lies that had been spread about me were completely baselessMy supervisor arrived and verified that the drafts the PFY had handed in had not met the required standard and yes we had an independent source to verify againstPFYs poor review stood  not that it even mattered he was promoted immediately after completing his training course which obviated all performance reviews poor or otherwise from his prior levelPS received an unofficial verbal reprimand for his gossipmongering which he promptly blamed me for He went out drinking to forget his selfinflicted troubles eyed up the wrong girl at the bar made the wrong smartass comment to her enormous boyfriend and ended up with a fractured eye socket and three titanium plates holding his face togetherKarma never worked so well in my favor beforeIt occurred to me later that the old maxim people are often guilty of the very sins they loudly decry may apply and talking in confidence to PSs PFYs revealed that the more he liked them aka the more they would go boozing with him in the weekends the better their performance reviews would readUnfortunately because of the fallout of this event I was never in a position where I could pass that information on to management without it looking like a move from malice or spite rather than a genuine desire that the procedure for conducting performance reviews be followedBrowse other volumes of the

IsilZha,36,30,1rghh8,115,Alright thought Id share a headache I had to endure this AugustSeptember its a bit of a long story as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every single pointSo heres the deal We got a school district thats desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN They had  schools running single T pointtopoints to the District office DO which then ran it over a multilink Tx to the County office for web filtering and internet One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link They have an ASA firewall just a  at the DO that has their public IP  the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet Obviously this presents a problem Each school except the one next door is limited to  Mb internet bottlenecked further by having to share  Mb on the main line out In practice they got between  Mb and  Mb woohooAll the schools have their own subnets and DCs Traffic flows from the schools to the DO through the DOs ASA and out the CountyBehold a diagram  httpiimgurcomVxMvPpngJust to curb the concern Ive changed all the IPsThe routers are mostly Cisco s  the switches are HP procurve managed layer  switchesNow they brought us in cause at the time their IT department consisted of two people It now consists of one for the entire district That madness is beside the point of this post though This started a year ago  my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them  Mbit links to the DO and a  Gbit link from the DO to the County Office COWe only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design then nothing until early this year The district met with ATampT and ATampT drew up their own plans completely disregarding what we had presented Oh and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings So the first thing their own IT department hears about whats happening with the upgrade is when his bosses come to him with This is what ATampT is doingAnd what ATampT came up with and started working on wasis to put it lightly atrociousTo start off with  ATampT ran  months behind They were supposed to have links ready at the schools midsummer for the change over to avoid disrupting the schools Instead they got the link at the DO and  other links up  days before the start of school So the first thing is that we need to minimize downtimeSo heres what ATampT did httpiimgurcomLNAWPbUpngNote I removed the T links in the chart above to unclutter it  they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the changeoverThey ran Mb fiber to each school site and the CO and  Gb to the DO Yes thats right to start off with the DO gets a Gb to take in all the connections but the link out to the CO is only  MbSo anyway they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber and handed off the connection as copper at each site except the DO  where they handed it off as Fiber A single fiber link Are you seeing another problem here That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites including to the CO  so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASAATampTs instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO Just plug each site into a switch at each site and itll all just work I kid you not What about all the subnetting Oh you dont need to do any of that oO Before we heard this ourselves they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent who is a complete jerk and more of a hinderence than anything that it would all be plug and play and just work We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN informationOther issues No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port The routers are full  no more connections available The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has inside and outside It will not handle VLAN tagging at all None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN taggingEven though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports they refused to give us more of them all the others are disabled even though it would be a  minute configuration That will take a change order How long would that take About  weeksIn fact ATampT refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work When calling their ENOC center which is the number provided for support to setup your connection did nothing more but repeat just plug it into a switch at each siteThe project manager went on a  week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in After talking with our contact at ATampT for days who had been talking as though he were an Engineer suddenly reveals Im just a salesman God this is explains so muchAlso yes they installed a link at the site next door that already has a direct fiber link to the DOSo to recap ATampT provided a completely flat solution and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network Wouldnt work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO        Seriously they wanted us to just flatten the entire network Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in and send it out ATampT has and still continues to stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their craptacular plan workIts clear from the design they came up  They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO  A salesman probably designed this garbage  it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs as well as putting in crap they dont need at all the link at the site next door  HERP DERP LETS CHARGE YOU MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINKFrom here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn not just from ATampT FMLWe got a layer  VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DOSo I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration Holy crap is the command line clunky and the command paths make little sense For one backspacing doesnt work  so any mistakes start over Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command Start overGet through that and get the web interface up WTF is this The GUI is convoluted and clunky  it takes  steps to configure a port andor VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did The fiber wouldnt come up either normally on HP switches it just works Screw this  we call up HP to help us with the configurationTurns out the switch is actually a COM switch rebranded as an HP switch  gt We have to setup the fiber port as this weird hybrid port to work Okay  we also get  ports setup for out VLAN to the CO and  setup for in VLANs of the schoolsCome back the next day  plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch Nothing  we look  fiber link shows down Look at ATampTs equipment link is down Its only been  days and the link at the DO is down So come back a few days later succesfully test sitetosite and now we also have a new Cisco  to be the router for this new madness  As well as  more s one site has an older router with only  ethernet interface and another is so old is only MbThe third  is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch that ATampTs fiber is plugged into and route them to the DOs network for various services Exchange school applications etc  Then it goes out the ASA into the  which sends it to the COs VLAN on the HP switchThis had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic which actually became usefulSo we got this all setup run some connectivity tests beforehand and got the goahead to swap DOs link to the CO over so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IPIts one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff   We had been talking with him and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end which included moving to a different subnet  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for  weeks  And he wont be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while hes goneSo were all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going  He doesnt respond  To anything  We head off for the day never getting a response from him expecting well be stuck for  weeks nowhe sends the schools IT guy the info late that night and indicates hell answer the next day  Finally we get ahold of him the next day and swap over that part goes smooth  we can now pull Mb at the DOOnce this was done I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers and preconfigured the two new s for the new stubnetworks and routing  We went to the first site swapped the gateway over  successSort ofOnly getting  Mb  Test from DO again still getting  Mb  Another stumbling block  At this point its x better than what the school was used to well troubleshoot that part later maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth  no errors or problems on the equipment onsite for now we should get more schools up and runningNext school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets okay thats working good  Get the next site go to plug in and swap over oh ATampT brought their link in at a building on the opposite end of the campus from the T and core stack claiming there wasnt enough room  there was plenty of room they were lazy about running the fiber it was just easier to run it where they did  gt  Ended the work day on that noteThe next day we had a plan  grabbed one of those s meant for another site put it in to handle ATampTs link swapped the gateways confirmed up and working  This school already had a  that was used for the T  we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new  for  This site got full bandwidthNext stop is two sites that are next door to each other  The last sites were doing  Both of them get the  Mb problem  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion I route the upsteam back through the T  Now we can get Mb down  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is  I suspect I know what the problem is will start looking into it the next dayAs it turns out ATampT between the switches they installed onsite and their own internal stuff had the Duplex randomly set to half full or auto  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto or for that matter why they werent even consistant about it  The  Mb issue was caused by ATampTs links having duplex mismatches all over the place After getting the run around for an hour with ATampT we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them set them all to auto  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect  whewAt this point today we still have one site with just a T link  ATampT has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it  Again they dropped the ball on this and didnt put in the request until late August  We dont expect the permit will be granted for  months  Additionally weve had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a Gb link  We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the Gb  Still waiting on that  So its not quite done but the worst is over at least,1385425123.0,Tales from a NetAdmin Ep   The NetAdmin vs

voltagesA few weeks after the events of M is for Musophobiahttpredditrj the very same pimply faced youth PFY as starred in that story had done very little but bombard me with how amazingly fantastic he was at everything to do with IT and technical support Arrogant egotistic totally up himself  these words barely do him justice He would constantly tell everyone around him about his monster computer which would simultaneously run  WoW accounts and Glider  grinding his latest set of accounts up to level cap which hed then promptly sell on eBay But he considered himself too cool to actually play WoWSo basically the worst kind of scum you can find in ITOn this particular Friday morning I was at my desk on the third floor and he was midspiel about he awesome he was in his previous role at the IT department when I received an email from the IC of the building the IC had recently been upgraded to a full office and it was time to move his PC The IC was all sorts of stupid stories for another time but at least he knew that he didnt know about computers so had put the request through to my teamWe did this stuff all the time but I was down a few team members due to some recent departmental reshuffling and everyone else was busy I tuned back into the PFYs selfaggrandizing rantgt PFY basically I was running the entire IT team which made the actual supervisor look bad so he got me transferred over heregt ME PFY the building IC needs his computer moved Seeing as youre so good at IT it shouldnt take you long to move his computer from his old desk to the new one rightgt PFY Thats easy Half hour topsgt ME Well we dont have much on this morning and its the IC so take your time do it right Hell be a massive PITA if its not done right the first time Hes getting a second screen added as well which is already in the officegt PFY SureSo about two hours pass and I come back from my morning vitamin D session to find PFY sitting in the office checking his emailsgt ME Have you finished moving the ICs computergt PFY Yeah it was easy like I saidgt ME Okay another jobs come in soand I left it at that PFY was trying to get promoted to my IC position or at least a position at the same level on one of the other teams so in the back of my head I thought I could take him at his word that the job was doneI should have known better Actually I did know better but I disregarded my instinct its okay I would pay for my hubris laterSo PFY is set to work on some other task and we go about our dayAbout  pm PFY gets a call and has to go to another department for the rest of the day I make a note to follow up with that department so as to make sure he hasnt just taken off early for the weekendAbout half an hour to closing and I finally get hold of someone at that department Theyre basically closed and noone has any idea that the PFY is meant to be there I make myself a note to reprimand the PFY first thing on Monday its not a good idea to be lying to take off early on a Friday when youve got your hopes up for a promotionClosing time finally arrives and I start to head out of the building My exit route just happened to take me past the building ICs new office where I see him looking behind his screen with a very confused expression on his facegt ME Hey IC whats upgt IC Oh my computers not going for some reasongt ME When did this startgt IC Oh I havent used it since its been in this office  Ive been in meetings with the boss all day Thats why it was the perfect time to get my office movedgt ME Give me a second Ill see what I can doI look behind the screen and notice that there is no power or VGA cable plugged in Hmm weird Maybe they forgot to supply one with the second screenCheck other screen same thingAt about this point I let out an expletive that could be heard clearly throughout the building as we were on the third floor having it heard on the ground floor was quite an achievementI checked the back of the computer No cords there either No power no ethernet certainly no VGA cablesSearching through the ICs old desk I found all of the cables in a tangled mess After spending the next half hour untangling them and connecting them into the appropriate sockets I had the ICs computer powered up and working on both screens Of course I then had to sit through the boot up and log in sequence to make sure that everything was working correctlyBoth the building IC and I did not leave until an hour after closing that nightCome Monday morning PFY was late getting in some excuse about a medical appointment just like first thing every other Monday I quickly consulted with the building IC who promptly approved my plan a quick call to the front desk let the security guards in on it tooYou see access to each floor was controlled by an RFID tag When the PFY arrived that day he gained access to the elevator and stairwell but found his card would not get him through the third floor door Eventually he tailgated someone else through the door and made it to the officeHe dropped into his seat by the large whiteboard that we kept current outofoffice task assignments on so as to know where a particular PFY should be if they were not immediately on hand and started cursing about the broken access control system and how he could build a better one himselfI picked up the phone and made a call Within minutes the building IC arrived with his boss in tow followed by a security guard I met them at the office door and brought them to the PFYs deskgt PFY Whats going ongt ME I tasked you with moving the ICs computer on Friday did I notgt PFY Yeahgt ME And you told me you had finished it did you notgt PFY I did finish itgt ME THEN WHY DID THE IC AND I SPEND AN HOUR ON FRIDAY NIGHT MAKING IT WORKgt PFY It must have broken after I leftgt ME Oh I see  so every single cable just disconnected themselves moved back to the original office and put themselves in a drawer did theygt PFY Whagt ME Turn your head to the right and tell me what is written across the top of the whiteboardgt PFY Task Locationgt ME Across the topgt PFY A job is notgt ME Continuegt PFY A job is not completed until it is testedgt ME Correct So given the way that the job was completed on Friday I must conclude that you either chose to ignore this offices standard procedure for completing work or that you are so incompetent as to not be able to determine the difference between a working computer and one with no cables connected to it AT ALL or that you did almost nothing for over two hours lied about completing the job and hoped you wouldnt get caughtgt PFY Bugt ME interrupting him midword near trembling with ragegt ME SHUTgt ME UPgt ME None of these options are suitable for a person to continue working here either in this office or for megt ME Compounding the matter is the fact that you lied about an out of office job on Friday leaving the rest of the team to pick up the slack while you took off for an early weekend Ive been in touch with the department head to confirm both on Friday afternoon and again this morning and no one asked for you to go over there nor saw you in the buildinggt ME Your card access to this building has been limited to unclassified areas only and will be revoked completely as soon as you leave the building You are to report to the general resource pool immediately  Ill be calling your new supervisor to let them know that youre on your waygt ME to Security Guard Please escort this man out of the buildinggt ME to PFY Get the hell out of my buildingPFY was escorted away by Security and IC came up to megt IC You looked like you wanted to swear at himgt ME Because I didgt IC I still think we should have kept him around to scrub the toiletsgt ME So he could do a terrible job of that too Better to just be rid of himPOSTSCRIPT Two weeks later HR sent me the performance review form for that particular PFY I sent it back with a note saying that he no longer worked for my department with a full transcript of the reasons whyThey sent it back apparently hed lasted longer working for me than any of his previous departmentsI filled it out  brutally honestly My final line While PFY does show some technical aptitude his unwarranted arrogance leads him to have a lackadaisical and borderline insubordinate attitude which prevents him from gaining any significant experience in this roleMy counterpart at the general resource pool where people who are still under contract but unable to perform their duties end up later told me that he had put him in a team that was clearing bushes from outside a company building The following day he had to move him to a team that was painting a wall as he was unable to follow the safety instructions for using the

Cloudedguardian,40,22,1rcp13,98,Hi TFTS Ive been a lurker for over a year now and Im certainly no IT girl but I think this still counts and that youll all get a kick out of this I am known by my local friends as The Smart One and as such when one of my local friends had a tech issue Im often asked if I could sort it out for them Its often as simple as reading the manual they tossed in the recycling and pressing the right button if not just turning it on and off againWell one day the only girl of this circle that I actually consider a friend rather than an acquaintance asked me if I could give her a hand Lets call her Red Red wanted me to help her sort out her Notebook as I had a rather nice laptop that Id gotten for graduation that I had to quote Done some cool crap with Well shes my friend and I like learning about computers so I figured I could give it a shotRed pulls out her Notebook turns it on and logs on before clicking Firefox to load up her internet My eyebrow immediately went up when it took no less than five minutes for her Google homepage to come up Im doing a checklist in my head of what could be slowing it down like this and start asking the obvious questions To me anywayMe Well have you cleared out your cache recently It could just be as simple as old files gumming up your systemRed My whatNow I knew that there was a possibility I wasnt using the correct terms as my Dad had for the longest time been the techy of our family and everything I knew was from what he and my American gamer friend had taught me Dad always called what I was thinking of The Cache and so I didnt know what else to call itMe Errr its like a bunch of cookies and information pieces that your computer accumulates as you surf the web Some sites are especially bad for it and you can get up to a couple thousand in an hour with them Cheezburger for instance Theres a program you run to clean it out let me see if you have onHere Reds Grandmother who had been listening in the background cut me off Oh no theres a button on that fox browser thing that does thatI blinked trying to figure out what she was talking about Then I realized that she was talking about the Data management window that you can bring up I resisted facepalming by keeping in mind that I was probably using the wrong terms and therefore it could be my fault that they were confused Me Errr no I think thats the browser cache Im talking about a different one on the computer itself sorry I might not be using the proper termsGranny Well I dont think clearing the computer is necessary the browser fixes that stuff Reds probably just downloaded some weird thing and has messed it all upAt this point Red and my eyebrows were both starting to twitch and so she made the wise decision of pulling me up to her room so I could fuss with her computer in peace As I struggle to get anything to load Red asks me if I really thought it was a computer cache thing slowing it down As I searched for an anticirus a cleaner anything I said it was a possibility before giving up and asking her what antivirus she had She said she didnt know what I meantMe Like uh Norton or McAfee Red Oh No I aint got that WhyMe Well I think you might have a virus Theyre really easy for your computer to pick up if you dont have a proper antivirus Its probably whats gumming up your systemRed Ohhh What are you doingI was at that very second looking up a free antivirus and cleaner that a Tech blogger of mine had mentioned with the intention of downloading and using them in the place of Norton I explained as such and Red told me bluntly not to I looked at her with a look of uttermostMe WutRed I downloaded somethin like that a little while ago and it just made things worse So dontI figured she had downloaded one of the scam ones and tried to explain that I think I lost her in the second sentence so I gave up and just said that it wasnt a Proper antivirus but this one was a good one that I had heard recommended by many people She still wouldnt let me download it As she took her Notebook back with me conceding defeat I suggested that if she didnt want to download the free one she could always go to Staples and buy Norton I added that it was what I had and would clean repair and kill all the virus and it was very simple to use It was megaonsale at the moment and wouldnt be a bad idea She told me shed think about it but it was a lot of moneyAbout a week later my sister Black and I seen Red with a brand new laptop I asked her what happened with her Notebook and she said that since it was so slow shed just gone and bought a new one I blinked Me So it wasnt a virus Cleaning it didnt help Well that suRed Oh no I didnt clean it or nuthin I just chucked it and bought a new one insteadMe Wut Black Please tell me you didnt throw that Notebook in the trashRed Nah its too much hassle to try and throw computer junk in the trash My friend actually wanted it if you can believe it So I let her have itMe Ddid you at least get Norton for your new computer Like does your new laptop have some sort of an antivirusRed Nah it doesnt need that junk Its all fast and new Im not gonna have any problems with this baby at allBlack You are going to become this stores best buckin friend aintcha AhouTLDR  Friend buys new laptop for over  rather than spending  on an antivirus,1385308054.0,More

samuraitechnician,13,21,1rourb,96,I worked for a large multinational telecommunications firm a long long time ago We worked with the local telcos to get customers data from here to there We worked with T lines k leased lines ISDN and satellite reception We dealt with modems and multiplexers Packet switching was the latest and greatest thing with HDLC and X Componentlevel work consisted of reprogramming eeproms in the packet assemblerdisassembler PAD and replacing bad diodes and caps Everything else was plug and play or card swappingOne time a handful of the field technicians from around the country were chosen to form a team for a media project We converged at the hotel and partied with the managers and a good time was had by all The first day on the remote site consisted of orientation planning and cablingethernet Yay Something new to learnSamurai your job is to terminate the ethernet cables with this RJ crimper You know the color codeYup I said proudly I wasnt yet really a samuraitechnicianI was skinny and youthful but I knew enough and I wanted to impress the managers I knew the color code in my sleep I could recite it forwards and backwards and on this particular day I could do it hungover I never handled a crimper but I assumed it was just like punching down a  or  so whats to know I wired all  ends of all the runs with BlueWhiteBlue OrangeWhiteOrange GreenWhiteGreen and whatever was laststraight throughMind you this is a remote project We are all miles from home and everything was prepackaged and shipped by our companys technical centerNeedless to say there were intermittent problems It was hard to diagnose and the managers were on the phones with the engineers for hours until it came down tomeWhat did you doUm Everything Ive done up to this point was always with premade cablesFortunately there were enough RJ plugs to cover my blunder and I learned TA and hey Look T pinout is almost the same Whaddya know,1385699825.0,Never assume even if you have to impress,117,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week
Gambatte,42,26,1rg6w8,89,In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium and thus a star was born This was of course very embarrassing for the cloud who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of fusionNot so long after that I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platterA brand new system was being introduced and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running On the plus side it had already completed acceptance testing so it should be a matter of plug and play Oh naiveté is a wondrous thing Should was most definitely the operative word thereThere existed a system for passing classified data between two systems This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for its own purposes using a unidirectional link to the data bus  in fact passive was the first word in the link equipments name The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not at that time at least have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuitOnce the equipment was finally all installed on my end I was able  with some coaxing and the elimination of some huge security breaches for example the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network  to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully Huzzah Great success And many drinks were hadBut twas not to be so simple Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations things became more complicated The remote locations RF equipment would lock up after every transmission We would not receive data from them when the link was up And so on Over time we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link which handled the data packets in a different way causing the equipment to lock up We got that fixed but we were still not receiving data from the remote locationEventually after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests I flicked to the last page There I found a summary of the testing results which came down to a single linegt Some tests successful with remote location  all other locations failed all testingWhich was exactly the problem wed been having  and when  had replaced some equipment it had begun to fail as well So these were all known issues from the original testing regime but the project manager had signed off on it accepting the new system into service rather than sending it back to get the issues fixedheaddesk  tableflip  locateandreattachheadWe eventually determined that the reason that remote location  had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for   so when the equipment was replaced the new equipment did not contain that library The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that featureAs the system experts SE started to pack up their gear on their final day before the  hour flight back to the States one of them turned to me and saidgt SE Im glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out once that firmware is in everything should run smoothly for yougt ME Yeah Well see what happens with that I dont know if management will be happy to pay manufacturer for the license And they really need that memory for more important featuresgt SE Any other problems before we head back to the hotel Is the data injection working wellgt ME Wait What data injectionQueue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available Apparently the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system replacing a rather error prone manual process The way the system was actually working insofar as it had on occasion actually worked the manual process was still required but was read from the new systems screen rather than via a voice channelThis design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device which was shown in the documentation as a bidirectional link not unidirectional  despite having the word PASSIVE or UNIDIRECTIONAL written next to it on every externally referenced diagram these were missing from the diagrams included in the design documentAfter the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed I received an official commendation  although Id rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the systems hard drives a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive I could have bought a nice boat at the suppliers listed price The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number although others have estimated it as a low eight Had the system expert not made that one offhand comment to me someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into itTwo technical project managers were reprimanded one for designing a system that could never possibly work and the other for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five although he was already leaving anyway so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetenceAfter that the project was never mentioned againBrowse other volumes of the

jooiiee,28,41,1rpivn,96,I am on paper a student in a school that specializes in IT and that lets students that have the knowledge help with IT related things During my ½ years at this school I have helped with rouge DHCP servers several times WiFi overhauls server builds installs and fixes Nobody in house knows nix network redesigns and a fair share of both student and teacher laptop issues and troubleshooting  IE I have had a lot experience and everybody knows me and talks to me if they need help including the principals Every year we have about  new students starting that gets a brand new laptop This is usually not a problem and the first interaction I have with said laptop is when I borrow one to see the specs of them but this year that was not the case This year some smart fella decided to without notice give us active directory connected computers I heard this day two of the term when the principal old tech and teacher spoke about students not having logins and since we study windows server I instantly told them that this would be a problem The answer I got was that the central IT department was promising that it would be safe and that they would have local admin so they can install software and they would not be able to sign in on one another computersA few days go by and we finally get the accounts for our  affected users to the email of the local so called PC tech He printed the lists and put them in his room while we gathered our forces two d grade students to start giving them out to the students that for a week had not been able to use their brand new computers But do you think we got the lists when we got there No we did not But this story is not about how the the so called PC tech prioritized a single d grade student that broke his computer the day before over  students that has not been able to use their computers for a week Or how he yelled at me when I told him to re prioritize This story is about something worse After we distributed the logins to the students doing our best to make sure the right student got the right account I said I did not thrust the system and asked for a testing system and was promptly given one As it turns out everything that central IT had said was wrong and I had to go in to the principals office close the doors pull the curtain and explain that the students could use their own logins to gain full admin on all of the computers Including all of the teachers computers And all of the principals computers And then showed him on his own computer when I accessed his files The alarm bells rung and a few scary days later central IT had fixed the AD so students could not log in with admin right on teachers computers any more We could finally breath again But fear not the story is not over yet Remember I told you the school specializes in IT Its only a matter of time before the students try hacking each other something that is not a problem in it self as long as they play nice and so far they have always done that Ye old hosts file patch and desktop background prank the stuff you did when you were young But remember that they can use their own credentials to log in to other laptops with full admin privileges and not only prank when the computer is left unlocked Not that very good Once again central IT promised a solution and last week I heard the solution was done Note that the first issues were in august but all has been fine and only the nice students have figured out what they can do with their friends laptops but I did not trust the solution again so I grabbed my testing laptop once again and checked if their solution worked It did not and resulted in a new email to central IT telling them to get their shit together since it was broken This may seem crazy but this is just bad IT and bad IT is not what this subreddit is about This subreddit is about the absolutely horrible act from the local so called PC tech to central IT after he was CCd in a mail earlier today where they asked for help with testing if they had fixed it This was his response it central IT gt Hello NAMEgt gt Sorry I could not answer your mail earlier I have been on vacation th november And after that I have had still have lots of stuff to do regarding student laptop issues cases and lots of stuff on the janitorial front gt gt New things come from the central IT department all the time that we on the school have to adapt to and that really takes from the active worktime in all sorts of ways gt gt I will try to dedicate time to this in the beginning of next week and see what is new then gt gt Have a nice weekend No that is how he writes I just translated it from swedish The best part The so called PC tech has no idea what AD is and how it works so he does not understand the problem As a effect of that the issue was not on his table This issue has taken a total of  minutes of his time that he has spent reading the emails that he was CCd in and that is the only thing he had to do But he just lashed out against the guys that tried to fix our problem HOW THE FUCK WHAT I DONT EVEN HE WORKS IN IT WHATI would not expect better from a regular user but this guy does it support himself What Oh and this is also the guy that told me you have to be hard and mean against the support agents to get what you want I was nice and calm and got exactly what I wanted but that was above his understanding TLDR Of course he did it was a rhetorical question ,1385732227.0,Did he just send angry emails to central IT because they are trying to fix our

uni I attend Mostly my duties include answering phones fixing peoples moble wireless settings and explaining what I am not allowed to do in terms of hardware and OS support  However during the summers some workers are transferred over to a off campus facility where we help cycle computers New purchases are imaged added to a domain and have special software deployed based on where its going Old relics leaving service  are KillDisced scavenged for parts and then shrinkwraped and prepared for recycling Its not a bad gigIn order to maintain some degree of CYA when computers arrive to be outprocessed and recycled we keep them for  days before wiping them This is so that if a professor forgot the picture of his kid or the staff member needs that one spreadsheet they left on the machine it can still be recovered Most of the time the previous owner realizes their mistake early on and we get their files for them and put them on a physical media for the user to pick up at their convenience Too bad that Most of the time is not  All of the timeThis particular incident began with me arriving caffeine in thermos book in hand for another day of processing I walk to the stack of old towers and grab a choice specimen noting the paperwork According to the paperwork I can wipe it  I trundle this bulky box to my workstation and begin setting it up for its last rights  I used to sing Daisy Daisy while i worked but then someone told me it made me seem like a sociopath I laughed and said  no im just grunt support I am about to pull the trigger when my boss pokes his head back and asks if i have processed Professor Derpingtons computer yet I look hopelessly at the pile of processed machines behind me Then as if it were fate I double check the paperwork from the computer I am currently working on lo and behold its Derpingtons Not boss I have the tower on the table and I was just about to press goWell the Prof forgot some tests and Important research data on there and he needs them so dont kill it yetOk should I get his files off for himNo he says he needs them ASAP Hes coming here to get themI double take Professors and administrators almost never descend to this particular facility Theres even a pool going as to whether or not the CIO of the uni could find this building on a google map  The idea of a Bambieyed professor navigating our wire strewn technological reliquary of a faculty is novel if not terrifying Soon the professor arrives luckily he is not a professor from my department and I have never met him before I walk him through several rooms each stacked with components from various eras of computer development before ultimately arriving at my workstation I sit him down in my chair and boot the PC for him He gets logged in and begins going about retrieving his files I step away for while I figure I can be more productive than just standing about while Professor Derpington moves files So I go take care of a few menial tasks and come back to find the good Professor standing and perusing the shelves The monitor has been switched off but the computer seems to be working overtime based on the volume of the fans Sir are you done I move to turn the monitor back on I can shut it down and walk you to the exitNO WAIT he reaches out to stop meI reactivate the monitor and immediately I am greeted with a familiar sight The windows file transfer dialog with its loading bar animation and rapidly changing text appears and demonstrates that files are being moved to the professors external hard drive Hold onGB of files are being movedfrom a folder labeled NOT PORNMy discovery happens in an instant and suddenly the screen goes black as the professor presses the button and the window to Windows closes again that is private Students should not be rooting through professors filesyes sir my mistake I begin walking out  Give me a call when your finished I round the corner and keep walking I fight to keep the laughter down until I am sufficiently far enough away I double over and laugh for a while eventually i regain my composure and continue going about my work until I am summoned by Derpington Lord of Not Pornia So what happens now he demands as he disconnects his hard drive and powers down the machine I explain our procedure and about how we wipe data He demands that he wants to witness the wiping for security reasons I was disappointed because I wanted to see what was GB of Not porn wasFor Science But he stood by for  minutes as killdisc did its magic I escorted him out and he thanked me and

Smith,28,8,1rjppo,42,So heres a quickie and its a common tale of what happens when a user receives a virus alert and how it put a smile on my faceThis afternoon with the first major snow storm of the season crashing into the area and with the tickets piling up because everything seems to magically break due to the Thanksgiving holiday approaching in the United States I decided it would be a good time to take lunch before dealing with the storm I was in the mood to spend a worthwhile lunch break in my own style Pizza with some Battlefield  Multiplayer and to top things off a cozy spot in a conference room Why the conference room Well Windows and apparently snows a new thing in this area so I would hate for all of the telephone poles to be taken out So I grab my personal laptop which happened to be with me grab some pizza from the lunch room and situate myself in the conference room I connected my personal laptop up to the network launched Origin and began a download of Battlefield  Not a single moment after I clicked download my mobile phone starts to ring Its one of the small business users I supportThe conversation began with the user sounding extremely worried and very panicked They received a cold call from someone in Dallas likely a spoof saying their new lap computer in the users words had a virus and that they mustnt wait to get the virus removed I paused for a second knowing all too well how these cold calls work I checked the number calling me as a sanity check and confirmed its the userss secondary line Odd for this user to be calling me on thatThe conversation then progressed in a very short amount of time to me explaining that this new laptop one which I had specifically set up and locked down specifically for this user is perfectly fine and that the person calling unexpectedly happened to be a scammer Of course also a major security risk if the user doesnt adhere to my advice The user informed me that they were on the phone with the cold caller at which point I proceed to tell them to hang up Fully expecting the user to doubt my advice based on previous conversations with them about simple email issues I remained on standby watching the download progress of Battlefield  I hear a thud on the phone followed by the user yelling a quick swift storm of words that went along the lines of Go away evil scum followed by the voice of the user back on the line with me in a very calm but still panicked voiceI spoke with the user to explain why those types of calls are bad and put them back at ease to ensure their computer was fine The user doubted me here and I simply had to explain to them that everything was okay and that these types of calls happen regardless of whether or not you have a computer I explained the concept of war dialing just to be sure they understood English is also not the users primary language although I am capable of speaking some others to an extent if they prefered and why and how the cold callers broke some telecommunications laws based on the users situation I lastly finished up the call as Battlefield  began to install explaining how call spoofing can lead to tricksI wrapped up the call by thanking the user for running their concerns through me this user was the first one who Ive dealt with who did not follow through and bid them a Happy Thanksgiving I took a much deserved bite of my pizza joining a  player Battlefield  server to vent some stress out on Paracel Storm and Siege of Shanghai With the tickets continuing to come in along with the snow piling up I can only hope that Thanksgiving will be a relief and not an oncall user apocalypseTLDR Lap Computer virus OH MY,1385523425.0,Good user,50,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week

Rhywden,119,118,1r99ob,644,This is another story from back when I was one of the admins for a mediumsized students dormitory  connected clientsPhysical layout consisted of  houses connected by fiber with every house sporting several Netgear managed switches thus providing  Mbit connections So one evening I was sitting in my room and reading when someone knocked on my door Internet is downFirst thing to check Local issue Tried connecting to the router remotely  no dice Not only is the Internet down but the whole network Went over to the server room and logged in locally and discovered that the router was alive and kicking also the uplink was fine but the connection to our network was borked Around that time a fellow admin showed up who forgot more about networking than Ill ever learnHowever he too failed to spot an immediate source of this error Uplink  fine No errors in the logs Blinkenlights on the switches in the server room are indeed blinking and showing not only connected ports but also active onesWe tried several things over the course of the next hour but did not find anything TCPdump didnt show any incoming traffic on our network facing cardUntil by pure chance or maybe desperation we rebooted the switches Because the network suddenly came to life again and ground to a halt mere seconds laterOkay time for another reset this time with TCPdump to watch whats happening And thats when we saw it A TCP packet which consisted entirely of zeros yes even the leading bytes which should include stuff like source and target port and just one single xF somewhere And it flooded the network for the short time it workedWe then worked out what had obviously happened Some computer in our network broadcasted those malformed packets which in turn caused our switches to freeze in such a state that they appeared to still be working I kid you not if you didnt watch them closely youd notice nothing  it was just that the pattern of blinking and steady lights didnt change over time as it usually would in a live networkThe solution was to pull out all the cables and connect them one by one until the switch failed again That way we discovered the culprit  who wasnt home at the time of course He later told us that he came home to discover that his PC which he had left on to complete a slow and huge download had bluescreened which obviously didnt agree with his NIC which then decided to retaliate against the cruel world in the only way it could,1385167866.0,The TCP packet of death,762,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week

Sounderhawks,138,192,1rn4x4,595,I was told to post this here after putting it in a thread in rtechnology Hopefully its something that will make you laugh Im finally at a point where I laugh about it Please forgive me if it isnt too clear Its been  years since then and Ive been out for  years in college so some of the real technical details have fadedAboard Al Asad in Iraq there was a huge morale drive I was in the Networking Division of unit on base We had a few extra IPs We attached a large NAS to one of our Staff NCOs machines so that if we ever got in trouble theyd just tell them to take it down If it was a Sergeant or below theyd probably end up getting ninjapunched and losing rankAnyway when night shift came on I monitored was able to que up and download most of the Al Asad Morale Drive which at the time was supported by G aka the IT department at the General Officer level When the time to return home came we had close to TB of movies music and TV shows We were somehow acquiring great quality copies of the newest episodes of TV shows I remember getting the newest episode of Generation Kill within  days of it airing back in the USFlash forward about  months and my unit is deploying out to what at the time was a small presence MEB for those who know what that is Camp Bastion When we arrived there wasnt much and we did a lot of work to repair the damage the unit we were replacing had done Since this was our units first full deployment into Afghanistan we took pretty much the best people we could forward in every department This means we had lots of experience in our unitWhen we arrived we were told we dont have a morale drive because we dont have the resources to manage it Well we had more IPs than we needed at the time so we threw that old NAS up on the network We password protected it to our unit to preserve bandwidth This worked fantastic for about two weeks until our S happenedFor those of you who dont know S is the logistics part of a unit They decided to give our password out to various units on the base in exchange for favors Withing  days our unit could barely do any work because our bandwidth was being hammered We decided to change the password againUnfortunately this pissed off the whole base The next day we had calls and emails from angry Es and above asking why the base morale drive had been taken downThis all happened fast so we still werent aware that it was the S who got us in the mess We start replying to the emails like this This is our units asset This isnt the bases server Therefore we are the ones who decide if we will allow access to everyone outside our unit Currently the bandwidth it was using was cutting into performance on our mission critical systems When infrastructure improves we will consider restoring access to the morale driveThis did not go over well There is no fury quite like that of an entitled Master Gunnery Sergeant Soon enough G comes calling asking about access to the morale drive We tell them no for the aforementioned reasons They respond that they have the power to take anything off the network and order us to hand it over to them so they can administer itWe say no because we have a portion of it only accessible to us which had a bunch of things like cracked software cracked versions of LAN games etc We had built an internal network to our department so that after shift change people could hang our and blow off steamWe saw the writing on the wall so we had friends back in the states ship another of the same model NAS out with extra hard drives We backed everything up to that NAS then hid it in some space in one of our legacy servers racks Finally we wiped the harddrives and repeatedly dropped the original NAS until it wouldnt turn on anymoreWe took the broken NAS with the blank harddrives to G The final straw for turnover was their Information Assurance Manager deciding that he was confiscating it because it was a security vulnerability to the internal network Thats the one thing we really couldnt fight since he just has a senior officer sign off on itFor the next couple of months all of us had strange issues with our admin permissions being adjusted and other random annoying netadmin trolling commenced What they didnt know is that we had the domain admin password because they left it in plaintext in a startup scriptAt this point it probably seems really petty and it was However when youre deployed for several months these petty things build up We were pissed because we felt like we were A being punished for trying to provide a service that didnt work out B our stuff was taken with no compensation and C G were fucking with us just because they had nothing better to doAfter we started having random things disappear from our share drive we started counterattacking them Things escalated a bit but they didnt really know how we were getting in Certain people started taking liberties with our billet of being information security personnel They reasoned they could tap into other peoples harddrives if they were connected and delete anything that didnt belong on an official government networkThat all changed when someone deleted the wrong persons pornographic material Technically no porn is allowed on the network This means no naked pictures emailed from the states etc Well apparently these were naked pictures of this guys wife that went missing He took his harddrive to the Colonel of G and had it given to the IAMThat launched a pretty long investigation into my department that ended up with several senior NCOs being relieved of duty and even sent home earlyIronically that wasnt the worst investigation I had done to memy department while deployed By that point I actually knew my rights and was able to skate freeTlDR Attempted to have a morale drive for our unit since one wasnt up Entitled senior enlisted decide their happiness is more important than the bandwidth we needed to run our servers Leads to netadmin troll war between us and a superior unit This leads to a serious investigation and relief of senior leaders This also made our CO mad because it made the unit look bad and we were basically annexed into HQ instead of being our own department and thus got thrown into the mix of a bunch of shitty billetsIf you guys like this one I have one more long one like this about the same department getting investigated on a different deployment That one is my personal favorite because it was the perfect storm of incompetence witch hunting and a command trying to deflect attention from gross misconduct

curriedavenger,51,125,1rbq0v,565,Follow up story to thishttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsrbhnotsofineprintAs I said before I worked in a computer shop that had a servicing department behind the storefront with the retail staff acting as the interface between the service department and the customersNow like most service departments the technicians dont work weekends but the retail department is open  days a week so people are constantly dropping stuff off and picking it up  no real issue it just means that nothing is getting fixed during the weekendsIt was a busy Sunday which was unusual for this particular store and staff were handling customers  An impatient looking guy walks in and saunters towards the back of the store  no big deal its where the entrance to the service department is but we also have a lot of accessories in that section so the staff think nothing of it  Nothing until we see him peering through the sliver of glass in the doors to see inside the service section and stock roomTurns out one of the technicians had come in because they were working on a friends laptop and came that Sunday to install a replacement motherboard which arrived on Saturday with some other stuff for the store before their friend had class on Monday  As long as the labour time was logged and paid for within reason it didnt matter to management when the work was doneHe starts pulling on the door which is locked by keycard access  He then starts knockingThe technician a lovely lady in her midtwenties was on her phone talking to her friend to get the password for the account to finish testing the machine following the parts replacement  Having seen this guy she gets understandably nervous and moves out of sight of the doors windowThe man gets upset and starts waving his arms in exasperationIs she fucking ignoring meThe customer I was dealing with nods towards this guy and tells me to sort him out  I thank him and move over to stop this guys impatience from escalating  I introduce myself to the man and ask what I can help withYou guys need to sort this out  Im here to pick up my wifes laptop and your staff are all ignoring me  That one out back is on the fucking phone  Im parked in a loading zone and I cant waitI apologise and say I will get things moving  I look up the guys job number on the system and I remember the computer and his wife that had dropped it off about two weeks earlier  I inform him that having diagnosed the system and what parts are necessary his wife was twice left a message with a total charge and asking for what to do next from about ten days ago  We only heard back from her on Wednesday four days ago to go ahead and order the parts and she was informed that it would take at least until Tuesday morning to get the parts delivered installed and the system testedI know that but obviously Im here now and Im not leaving without itNow I have two options  I could ask that our technician install the motherboard which arrived on Saturday with the other parts or I could tell this guy that technicians dont work on Sundays and the computer will not be ready until the allotted service period unless he is willing to pay for an urgent service twice the regular hourly charge for the entirety of the job with the intention of the technician taking the extra cash if she agrees to do itThis is bullshit  I can see her back there  Right now I am looking at her right now he said as he pointed at her  She was on the fucking phone  You should prioritise your customers in the store for fucks sale  What kind of outfit is thisAt this point I have decided that there is no way our technician is going to bend over backwards for this asshole and he clearly is used to bullying others to get what he wants  He continues arguing about getting his computer out today and I explain why that was not going to happen Technicians do not work on weekends His computer actually needs to be tested after reassembly to ensure the fix worked The girl in the back was not working today and I could fasttrack the computer into being repaired by Monday afternoon at no extra charge if he signs a waiver saying that he just wants the part installed and does not want us to test the reassembled machineThis took the better part of fifteen minutes  He eventually decides to come back on Tuesday having essentially accomplished nothing by his current visit  He leaves the store in a huff  Two minutes later he returnsI need to use your phone  My cars been towed  And you WILL be paying for itYeah we didnt pay for it,1385260108.0,Giant toddler makes noise,690,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week
deshe,83,155,1ri4te,565,  All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced Gather around yall and hear the story of Elijah the most eccentric ISP user of them allIt happened in the year  I was just a  years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my countrys largest ISP telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living I was half decent at my job so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints at nightThere were three of us during night shifts Me a business sector support representative and a shift manager The explained how things work in the land of the night  I would get calls from ordinary customers and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif  the nighttime customers are batshit insane but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah the most batshit insane technically inept socially handicapped short tempered internet user of them allOh I remember the first time I encountered Elijahs presence It was a second order encounter but the waves of fuckingcrazy hit me like a truck The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset No I said no I am not going to help you with that Because that is criminal and not my job way to go Maria Show him whats for After some time she eventually wore him down we have a nohangup policy and he left the conversation steaming Was was that Elijah I asked a question whose answer I already knew Yes she said he wanted to hack ltgeneric dating sitegt and asked me to tell him their IP addressFast forward several months At this point I am a top notch night rep the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets Oh yeah I was getting a lot of attitude I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times and he always was a hoot for example he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesnt know English so I should translate it for him All in all he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction I felt for him which is exactly why I was not ready for things to comeI remember that night all to well The sea was angry that night my friends Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies I had a night shiftAt first things were working out as well as they ought to The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone  a narrow portion of the day just shy of three hours long between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasnt able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor These hours are usually almost completely call free up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at AM in the middle of the week and decided hed rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleepThe phone rangI picked it upThis and that ISP this is deshe how may I be of my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semisentences in a voice I recognized as Elijahs Listen I have a picture You get me A picture And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol Do you understand meHello Are you there I have a picture and IYeah yeah I heared you the first time Elijah Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background I guessedNo you

proceeded to explain to him how to set this picture as a wallpaper  the mother of all mistakesAs soon as we were done even though youd expect him to understand what we are doing somewhere along the way he went ballistic  I am not making a simile here his head literally shot off his head and went into hyperbolic orbitWhat the fuck did you do This is not what I wanted Cant you do what you are told All I wanted you to do is take thispicturethatihaveandputitwherethemycomputerandthebananaphonebadagerbadgerhurpdurpdurp Elijah I interrupted I cant help you any further We were on the phone for over half an hour there was actually a call in the queue and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support I knew I was to blame for the deterioration of the situation  much more than this semi capable screwloose  but I had no choice I had to do what I was trained to do delegateElijah this problem is beyond

that guy Listen all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming oh my god I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft againSo I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop which only took  minutes  and all was goodGee thanks  Elijah said you are much better at this than the other guy what did you say his name was deshe yes deshe He sucks John you could teach him a thing or twoWell thanks I said doing my best to conceal my laughter I decided not to come forward Elijahs intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually wasAnd that was that the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back an all time Elijah classicEPILOGUEI kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time He was never violent or rude just an utter loon He was not a good person he was of the harassing mysogenistic types which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep versions of the tales of Elijah but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and boltsSeveral months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could I was still getting emails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient They decided they should not deal with him anymore They complained and the security chief complied issuing a formal restraining order from the police Elijah was now formally a persona nongrataFast forward three years I am not working there anymore I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch One friday evening out of the blue I get a phone call from an unrecognized number I took itHelloListen I have a picture OK OK that didnt actually happenWhat actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days and well aware of Elijahs shannanigansDude he told me get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOWSo I did There was an episode of A Star Is Born which is the local equivalent of American Idol They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones The guy on the screen was horrid He was fat and obnoxious wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had And his voice oh my god this voice He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus That voice was horrid but it was also oddly familiar It took me about  seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessingThe song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly Well Elijah they said you should never sing in public Ever Now people who audition for A Star Is Born should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered but not our unaware Elijah No nobody talks to Elijah like that He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit spitting at the judges shouting and yelling trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by securityApparently this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show And each time was a sight to see though after that last one he became again a persona non grataPoor

Gambatte,74,105,1rduku,386,Before the beginning there was nothingness  a void so complete that the passage of time  even the very concept of time itself  was meaningless Then the nice universe from the interstitial dimension next door popped in for a cup of tea and some biscuits having brought them with it because  as one would expect by its very definition  the larder of the eternal void was quite empty and generally just messed up the whole boundless void With a sigh entropy set to work slowly cleaning up the whole mess so that it could back to the lovely timeless nothingness that it had had going on before this most annoying interruptionShortly after that I was supervising my team of pimply faced youths PFY when a job came in to check the coolant levels in a lovely piece of high voltage equipment Being a simple job I collared the nearest PFY and tasked him to go carry out said checkHe promptly returned bearing the bad news the coolant levels were low and would require replenishmentSeeing as I had a fairly new team of PFYs of which only one had replenished said coolant levels previously I assembled the group and informed them of said taskgt ME Any questionsgt PFY This coolant Is it hazardous What PPE personal protective equipment should we be usingOh ho I thought A learning opportunitygt ME Excellent question PFY I shall direct your attention to the Material Safety Data Sheet application that each of you has on your desktop From there you can access the safety details on everything and anything you might be exposed to So your job is nowgt PFY to look up the coolant MSDS sheet and see what PPE we needgt ME Well done Once youve done that gather the requisite items and let me know once everything is ready to begin  Ill come up to make sure that you do it properlySo the herd of PFYs gathered up the job sheet and ran off to perform the task as described I later learned that the PFYs became concerned with such details asgt Specific personal protective equipmentgt Respiratorygt None requiredgt Eyesgt Goggles or full face splash shield when dealing with hot liquidgt Handsgt Use insulating gloves when extensive exposure to solid state or high temperature liquid state is contemplatedgt Other clothing and equipmentgt Use heat protective garment when exposed to large quantities of heated vaporandgt Compound is known as the universal solvent and does dissolve at least to some extent most common materials So after a considerable period of time far longer than it should have taken really but not longer than I had expected I was asked to come up to the equipment to supervise the coolant replenishment procedureI arrive to find two PFYs in full face shields rubber aprons rubber boots and rubber gloves A third was standing by with a full set of breathing apparatus on ready to engage should the first two be overcomeThis seems a little excessive I thought Aloud I instructed them to beginAs it turns out the PFYs had broken the task up into groups The one PFY who had done this before had promptly volunteered to move the hazardous chemical in its sealed container up to the coolant replenishment point while the newer PFYs looked up the data sheet and collected the requisite PPE for handling Of course he had also been kind enough to volunteer the name of the chemical compound for them to enter into MSDS before he left to do soAs the coolant began to pour into the system a priceless look of realization slowly crept across the faces of the PFYs as it dawned on them what the dangerous sounding dihydrogen monoxide actually wasFALLOUTThe PFYs were credited for their strict adherence to safety then given further instruction on how to interpret information from the MSDS databaseThe devious PFY was promoted to IC a few months later and is still one of the very best Ive ever hadBrowse other volumes of the EncyclopædiaAhttpredditqywlBhttpredditrtjrCDhttpredditpwforEFhttpredditqkzrGhttpredditquffhHIJKLMhttpredditrjNOPhttpredditrgwQRSTUVhttpredditrdukuWhttpredditqiiXYZwith credit to MagicBigfoot,1385340315.0,Encyclopædia Moronica V is for Volatile Chemicals,491,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week

curriedavenger,34,58,1rbh79,322,I previously worked in a computer shop that had a repair section behind the store  We specialised in Apple products and as I worked in the retail section my colleagues and I were the interface between our technicians and our customersOne day a businesswoman walked in with her laptop and demanded that we get her computer working as she cant check her email  A quick check at the service desk in the store revealed that the computer would not boot at all and that it was likely an issue with the motherboard requiring the computer to be formally booked into our onsite service system to arrange for parts and service  I informed her of our labour prices explained how upon a complete diagnostic service we would be in touch with a quote for repair and approximate time frames she can expect to have certain milestones in the process to be completed withinHaving agreed to that I begin getting her details to be entered into our system  She gives me her phone number but when I ask for an addressYou dont need that actuallyNow how she expects to know what I need I didnt understand and I explain that given the extent of work that will be done we have to actually have a billing address since she was not paying upfront  particularly important when the actual problem has yet to be formally diagnosed so we cant really take prior payment since we dont know what the extent of the repairs will beI dont want my mailbox filled with your fucking flyersI explain that our service centres database of customer details is actually separate from our marketing department and that our company does not mail out flyers so there is no risk there  I also explain that without a billing address our checkin software will not process the repairShe reluctantly agrees and I print out the form for her to sign  I watch as she grabs my pen off out of my hand despite having a pen in front of her anyway and begins to cross out two of the three paragraphs in the terms and conditions of the service request  the ones pertaining to contact details  These paragraphs state that we will only ever use the details to contact the customer in regard to this particular service job and that we will never use the details for marketing purposes or otherwise forward the information to any other entityI ask her what she is doing  I dont want to be harassed by telemarketersI ask her to read the parts of the contract that she disagrees with not that I can negotiate different terms but so I can address her concerns like any decent salesperson  I explain again that the only reason we can contact her under this very contract is to speak with her in respect to this repair job and show her the wording that says just that  I also inform her that our terms are not subject to negotiation and I cannot accept her computer unless she signs the full set of termsJust get it doneShe slides the service agreement towards me grabs her handbag and walks out  I now have a broken computer and no valid contract to show for it given that I have not yet signed off on it  The computer is in limbo and I cant do anything with it until a fresh agreement has been signed  However I do have her phone number  I call her to let her know that he computer having been left here without a valid agreement means we cannot service it and we may be forced to treat the laptop as being abandoned  As it was not currently working it had little value and at the close of business it would be left outside of our store for her to pick up unless she requests that we hold onto it  Naturally she yells at me to hold on to it until she can get back to us  I inform her that there is a storage fee of  per day until the service request is completedShe starts going off her goddamn rocker and there is so much sound pouring out of the phone that its grabbing the attention of our other customers even over the obnoxious pop music that we plebs in retail must endure all dayA few hours later she storms into the store with a toddler in tow screaming at our youngest salesperson  a  year old girl  about how we are extorting her  I step in and apologise for making her come back and get the new agreement printed out  She tries crossing out the contact terms in the contract AGAIN and I stop her staying I cannot accept alterations or deletions and she will either need to take the agreement asis or leave with her computerShe then goes quiet and her anger rolls back like the water on a beach just before a tsunami is about to hitand starts sobbing  Sobbing and reading the terms she had earlier deleted  People are now staring at us and I become aware that it appears that I had handed her a letter telling her I never really loved her or something especially as she cried over the contract and continued to sob as she signed it  She grabbed her kid and left without saying a wordHer husband was an asshole too but thats a story for later,1385252369.0,Not so fine print,380,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week

transferred to the training school to help administer the training courses until my final day My job now basically consisted of sitting on a computer reading a thousand or more pages of

StickhttpwwwgiantitpcomcomicsootslatesthtmlSo Im chilling out on a Friday morning doing nothing in particular when one of the instructors comes down Turns out the PFY from S is for Standardshttpredditrlvnp was on a course there Or at least he was meant to beThe conversation between instructors was essentially as followsgt  Is PFY in the officegt  No  is he meant to be heregt  Well hes not in the classroom no ones seen him at all todaygt  The trainees got paid yesterday didnt they Last time they got paid which was fortnightly PFY went out drinking all night and showed up nearly two hours lategt  What punctuality requirements were specified in the contracts you could be hit with major penalties for being late or not showing up even to internal coursesgt  He said he had a flat on the way to class so I asked him to show me the flat tire When his spare didnt have a puncture he said hed stopped to get it fixed  despite the fact he was already running late When I asked why he didnt call from the garage to explain his lateness he said his cellphone was flat and the garage wouldnt let him use their phone When I asked him to produce a receipt for the repair he finally broke down and confessed hed been lying the whole time and that he actually got drunk and slept through his alarmgt  Whaagt  I know right I let him off with a warning  I didnt care much that he was late but dammit you do not lie about it and especially not right to my faceSo the instructors all disappeared down to the classroom to further question PFYs classmates in case one of them had received a phone call or text message from him Instructor  stuck around for a while calling the local medical center police station and anywhere else he could think of that PFY might be that would be a legitimate excuse for his absence Having had no luck he joined the others in the classroomFunnily enough one of the guys at the company BF had been dating a girl GF that worked as a nurse at the local medical center He had come over that morning to pick up some training materials for his PFYsSo it had come down to me and BF in the office when the main office line rang As the only official member of the training school in the office I picked it up Who should it be but the PFYFrom my previous experience with PFY I could tell by the thin reedy voice he was using that he was not well  the kind of selfinflicted not wellgt PFY Is  theregt ME Hes just down in the classroom Ill see if hes availableI put the phone on mute and walked the portable down to  who was just heading back to the officegt ME  its PFY and by the sound of it he is capital H capital O Hung Overgt  Oh this should be good took the call right next to my desk in the office so I was privy to his end of the conversation PFY claimed that he was at the local medical office  knew this was false as hed already checked there PFY claimed he was having liquid nitrogen treatment for warts The medical facility only received one delivery of liquid nitrogen per week on a Tuesday morning which was completely used up by Tuesday afternoon This was common knowledge to anyone that had been through the procedure before It was also required that you clear it with your workplace before going to the medical facility for anything minor minor being anything that didnt immediately prevent you from working PFY claimed he was in a treatment room with GF BF said that GF had just finished a double shift about an hour previously and had been sound asleep in their bed when he left for work that morning about half an hour ago so that was definitely not true then asked the PFY to put GF who was supposedly in the room with him on the phonegt  Im sorry if this is embarrassing for you GF but youve got one of the worst voices Ive ever heard on a femalegt  gt  Get your ass in here as soon as you can PFYgt  gt  Yes you are very much in the sYes the PFY had decided that the best course of action rather than confessing to going out and getting drunk and sleeping through his alarm again was to lie about it and when caught in that lie to impersonate a femaleFALLOUTAlthough I left the company before seeing the whole spectrum of the fallout I know the entire incident was promptly written up by  and passed on to HR for disciplinary actionThe immediate response from HR was Its not April  is this some kind of joke that I dont

LeeMoriya,155,47,1rkfoy,202,So we had a little problem with Minecraft on the computers at the school I work at as an apprentice tech Im the youngest member of staff at  Personally I love Minecraft but games arent allowed at the school and if a senior staff member saw everyone was playing the game wed be in a spot of trouble so I made it my mission to resolve the problemEach student has their own home folder and there is a shared drive students can store their work or for teachers to store resources for lessons I searched every single students folders for Minecraft and deleted dozens and dozens of jars and exes I also deleted a copy off the shared drive The problem is we cant outright block the running of applications on the shared drive because we have other software stored there the kids use so we had to use a blacklistLess than a week later it shows up on the shared drive again under a different name different hash we blocked it and moved on It happened again the next day tooI searched the students again and  results came back with Minecraft their names were added to a list I didnt want to get any of them in big trouble because hey Id be doing the same thing The problem was they werent just running regular Minecraft they were running horrible installers plagued with toolbars and other malware this is a big nonoThe first offender was caught playing the game at lunch time I personally walked up to him and told him the rules regarding games even stating that I liked the game myself but it wasnt okay in school He ignored me completely I assume this was because the school is also a sixth form and he must not have seen my badge that says IT Technician and not Studentgt So thats how you wanna play it I thought to myselfHe was banned from the library and was written up on our behaviour system One downThat same day I deleted Minecraft from the shared drive  times and it was added back again and again with no details on who put it there That was a week ago and policies are now in place to restrict Minecraft entirely using I believe some clever restrictions on the appdata folderToday I did another search for the hell of it one result came back a kid from my list I sent and email to the year group rep and she said she would have a word with him Kid decided to grass up his friend the last student on the list the mastermind who was copying the game off his memory stick they were all written up and banned from using computers at break and lunch times for a monthOperation Minecraft Purge is a success,1385554391.0,Operation Minecraft Purge,249,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week

theunusualsuspect,15,23,1r9cpz,176,So this was maybe a year ago but I just havent sat down to right about itI used to work for a small ISP that provided DSL via resold ATT circuits They also resold T circuits and things of that nature On top of that they also provided pointtopoint wireless access VOIP webhosting and emailProviding support for resold internet really isnt as bad as you think  especially considering I was T and only caught escalated cases that got past our call center Simple stuff And VOIP never really caused any issuesWhat did cause issues was email We actually hosted our own email server I couldnt tell you what we used off the top of my head right now but it was linux based all of our software was And thats fine  it was free and simple Only it wasnt updated regularly or everSo eventually we arrive to the day in question As you may have guessed we have a form on our website anyone can use to send our sales department a question Now we can all see the emails that come in from that form so everyone in the office knows when something is submitted Well we started receiving a series of interesting emails After a quick google search it turns out its a very basic SQL injection used to essentially retrieve the password for an email account Thing is if you grab the right one say our network administrators email password well thats when the trouble can start especially considering email account usernames are the same usernames used for webhosting logins Or so I thought  its actually much simpler to abuse the system we were using Ill get into that in a minuteSo me and my coworker inform our network admin He takes a look and bans the IP abusing the form That was it Fantastic We have no idea whats been accessed I inform everyone I can and they assure me our network admin will take care of it And that is that as they sayWell not a few weeks later we are getting absolutely flooded with spam Our internal email accounts and our customer email accounts It gets so bad that we actually start getting black listed by Domain Name Servers and other ISPs Im talking verizon yahoo charter  it was just unbelievable So as our network admin is looking for a solution me and my coworker investigate on our ownNow i mentioned earlier that we do webhosting right Well guess what Email is hosted via that server as well Which isnt that big of a deal What is a big deal is that if you have a webhosting account it turns out you have unfettered access to EVERYTHINGSo how it works if youre unfamiliar is as followSSH into our server we allowed the access And from there all you had to do was keep ing and you would eventually land in the highest parent directory where you could freely view all of our fucking user accounts Oh and you didnt need a password to get into them YOU COULD DO THIS ON ANY ACCOUNT One other thing  sudo commands freely fucking available And theres our god damned problemSo now were a god damned ISP that when I check was responsible for  of the entire spam coming across the internet Thats a shit loadOf course this was immediately brought up to our network admin and the owner I dont know how to emphasize absolute and total despair but they DIDNT FUCKING BELIEVE US You know what they blamed it on Spoofing FUCKING SPOOFING Sorry it still infuriates meThey tried implementing solutions but nothing really panned out  which you know is because someone had unfettered access to our shit It was a constant fight until the day I quit My coworker quit the same day It was interestingI have a whole mess of other stories that Ill eventually get around to but this was just the one that stands out to me,1385170486.0,SQL injection Ill just block the IP,199,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week

Gambatte,15,38,1rlvnp,154,About a year after the events of T is for Testedhttpredditrjrxi I was leading a small group of technicians in a field office Our support area was the network connecting multiple other devices which had their own specialized support teams the interface devices and the systems that collated and correlated the dataOne of the listed tasks assigned to all new as in fresh out of the training courses technicians was to produce an overview of all of the systems in the office This was quite involved and usually ended up requiring the production of at least three documents each of which would be approved by the supervisor of the team for the relevant areaSo on a semiregular basis a new batch of fresh technicians would arrive in the office theyd complete their listed tasks and receive a pay rise on completion of their on job training book and become available for further training and promotion Generally the OJT book could be completed in a couple of months with a little bit of effortExcept for one particular pimply faced youth PFY He slacked off and never bothered to progress his OJT book at all Much like the PFY of T is for Tested his attitude saw him bounced from department to department Suddenly eight months have passed and the training department is trying to schedule him on a course for further training with a view to promotion when it becomes apparent that he doesnt meet the requirements having still not completed his OJT bookQueue mad rush to get it completed in under two weeksHis system overview hit my desk I picked it up and read through it and immediately wondered why someone who was in such a desperate rush to get it completed had taken the time to Photoshop a photo on page one so that the pictured screen read PFY IS THE MASTERNaturally the write up was a mess Sections that should have had pages of information were covered in four sentences Sections that should have been covered in four sentences went on for pages and pagesSo heavily annotated with the required corrections the draft was returned to the PFY It was not uncommon for three drafts to be required five was not unheard ofWithin two hours he submitted the second draft having changed only one paragraph And again the same comments were madeThe third draft was the same  one paragraph changed despite pages of required corrections I pulled him into the office closed the door and went over every required correction I did everything short of dictate the required text to himFourth draft  one paragraph And the fifth And so onBy the time I was about to reject his eighth draft I was pulled into the office by my supervisor SUgt SU Whats going on with PFY Im catching some flak from the training department over his OJT book and they tell me one of the last things hes got to do is your system overview Has he done itgt ME Well hes triedgt SU What do you meangt ME reaching into hammerspace Heres his latest draft  number eight as I recall Ive already annotated it with where corrections or more information is required Every one of his drafts that I have rejected has had this information and most of the time the information hasnt changedgt ME also from hammerspace For comparison heres an overview that meets the required standardMy supervisor quickly flicked through the two documents and rapidly agreed that the produced overview did not meet the required standardWhich is when the fun startedIn order to assist with the rapid completion of the overview PFY was assigned to my department I was given strict instructions he was to be given all the support he asked for and no other tasks until his overview was up to standard He had  access to the system every reference document except for the previously accepted standard meeting overviews and access to the personnel who knew the system inside and out namely me and my team of PFYsA further three weeks pass Once PFY learned he was to receive no tasks until the overview was completed he spent the time watching DVDs and playing PS  for comparison I received eight drafts in seven days then he was explicitly given nothing else to work on I received two drafts in three weeksEventually with a great deal of encouragement read punishment that increased with each passing day between submissions an acceptable overview was completed and PFY was out of my hair and off on a training courseAnd then his performance review form arrived Again by virtue of him bouncing around so much the time he spent with his thumb firmly implanted in his rear pretending to work was more than with anyone else I tried to pass it off to his previous supervisor PS seeing as hed actually done some work for him but he bluntly refusedSo I filled it out honestlyThe form then went to management for approval and thats when the REAL fun startedApparently PSs manager did not agree with my review PS also disagreed with it when they confronted me about it I mentioned that I had specifically offered PS the chance to fill it out but he had refused to do sogt PS Youre only giving him a bad review because you dont like himgt ME I offered you the chance to fill it out Wait are you saying that I review on factors other than performanceThen PS dropped the bomb he had previously had the PFY of T is for Tested working for him who had filled his head with how much I sucked to work for how I hated my PFYs and how I loved to throw my weight around bully them and so on Despite having known me for years PS had decided to believe this rubbishI was beyond livid at this point I had reached a point where anger gives way to calm resolve in a way I suspect is similar to a fullblown psychotic break I took a deep breath picked up the nearest phone and made a couple of callsMy entire team of PFYs assembled Individually and as a group they all swore that I was one of the better supervisors theyd worked for and had no knowledge of any kind of bullying or harassing actions on my partThe IC from T is for Tested arrived hed transferred to that office not long after I had and laid out the truth of T is for Tested independently verifying that the lies that had been spread about me were completely baselessMy supervisor arrived and verified that the drafts the PFY had handed in had not met the required standard and yes we had an independent source to verify againstPFYs poor review stood  not that it even mattered he was promoted immediately after completing his training course which obviated all performance reviews poor or otherwise from his prior levelPS received an unofficial verbal reprimand for his gossipmongering which he promptly blamed me for He went out drinking to forget his selfinflicted troubles eyed up the wrong girl at the bar made the wrong smartass comment to her enormous boyfriend and ended up with a fractured eye socket and three titanium plates holding his face togetherKarma never worked so well in my favor beforeIt occurred to me later that the old maxim people are often guilty of the very sins they loudly decry may apply and talking in confidence to PSs PFYs revealed that the more he liked them aka the more they would go boozing with him in the weekends the better their performance reviews would readUnfortunately because of the fallout of this event I was never in a position where I could pass that information on to management without it looking like a move from malice or spite rather than a genuine desire that the procedure for conducting performance reviews be followedBrowse other volumes of the

IsilZha,36,26,1rghh8,119,Alright thought Id share a headache I had to endure this AugustSeptember its a bit of a long story as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every single pointSo heres the deal We got a school district thats desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN They had  schools running single T pointtopoints to the District office DO which then ran it over a multilink Tx to the County office for web filtering and internet One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link They have an ASA firewall just a  at the DO that has their public IP  the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet Obviously this presents a problem Each school except the one next door is limited to  Mb internet bottlenecked further by having to share  Mb on the main line out In practice they got between  Mb and  Mb woohooAll the schools have their own subnets and DCs Traffic flows from the schools to the DO through the DOs ASA and out the CountyBehold a diagram  httpiimgurcomVxMvPpngJust to curb the concern Ive changed all the IPsThe routers are mostly Cisco s  the switches are HP procurve managed layer  switchesNow they brought us in cause at the time their IT department consisted of two people It now consists of one for the entire district That madness is beside the point of this post though This started a year ago  my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them  Mbit links to the DO and a  Gbit link from the DO to the County Office COWe only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design then nothing until early this year The district met with ATampT and ATampT drew up their own plans completely disregarding what we had presented Oh and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings So the first thing their own IT department hears about whats happening with the upgrade is when his bosses come to him with This is what ATampT is doingAnd what ATampT came up with and started working on wasis to put it lightly atrociousTo start off with  ATampT ran  months behind They were supposed to have links ready at the schools midsummer for the change over to avoid disrupting the schools Instead they got the link at the DO and  other links up  days before the start of school So the first thing is that we need to minimize downtimeSo heres what ATampT did httpiimgurcomLNAWPbUpngNote I removed the T links in the chart above to unclutter it  they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the changeoverThey ran Mb fiber to each school site and the CO and  Gb to the DO Yes thats right to start off with the DO gets a Gb to take in all the connections but the link out to the CO is only  MbSo anyway they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber and handed off the connection as copper at each site except the DO  where they handed it off as Fiber A single fiber link Are you seeing another problem here That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites including to the CO  so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASAATampTs instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO Just plug each site into a switch at each site and itll all just work I kid you not What about all the subnetting Oh you dont need to do any of that oO Before we heard this ourselves they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent who is a complete jerk and more of a hinderence than anything that it would all be plug and play and just work We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN informationOther issues No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port The routers are full  no more connections available The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has inside and outside It will not handle VLAN tagging at all None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN taggingEven though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports they refused to give us more of them all the others are disabled even though it would be a  minute configuration That will take a change order How long would that take About  weeksIn fact ATampT refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work When calling their ENOC center which is the number provided for support to setup your connection did nothing more but repeat just plug it into a switch at each siteThe project manager went on a  week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in After talking with our contact at ATampT for days who had been talking as though he were an Engineer suddenly reveals Im just a salesman God this is explains so muchAlso yes they installed a link at the site next door that already has a direct fiber link to the DOSo to recap ATampT provided a completely flat solution and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network Wouldnt work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO        Seriously they wanted us to just flatten the entire network Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in and send it out ATampT has and still continues to stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their craptacular plan workIts clear from the design they came up  They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO  A salesman probably designed this garbage  it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs as well as putting in crap they dont need at all the link at the site next door  HERP DERP LETS CHARGE YOU MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINKFrom here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn not just from ATampT FMLWe got a layer  VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DOSo I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration Holy crap is the command line clunky and the command paths make little sense For one backspacing doesnt work  so any mistakes start over Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command Start overGet through that and get the web interface up WTF is this The GUI is convoluted and clunky  it takes  steps to configure a port andor VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did The fiber wouldnt come up either normally on HP switches it just works Screw this  we call up HP to help us with the configurationTurns out the switch is actually a COM switch rebranded as an HP switch  gt We have to setup the fiber port as this weird hybrid port to work Okay  we also get  ports setup for out VLAN to the CO and  setup for in VLANs of the schoolsCome back the next day  plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch Nothing  we look  fiber link shows down Look at ATampTs equipment link is down Its only been  days and the link at the DO is down So come back a few days later succesfully test sitetosite and now we also have a new Cisco  to be the router for this new madness  As well as  more s one site has an older router with only  ethernet interface and another is so old is only MbThe third  is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch that ATampTs fiber is plugged into and route them to the DOs network for various services Exchange school applications etc  Then it goes out the ASA into the  which sends it to the COs VLAN on the HP switchThis had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic which actually became usefulSo we got this all setup run some connectivity tests beforehand and got the goahead to swap DOs link to the CO over so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IPIts one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff   We had been talking with him and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end which included moving to a different subnet  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for  weeks  And he wont be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while hes goneSo were all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going  He doesnt respond  To anything  We head off for the day never getting a response from him expecting well be stuck for  weeks nowhe sends the schools IT guy the info late that night and indicates hell answer the next day  Finally we get ahold of him the next day and swap over that part goes smooth  we can now pull Mb at the DOOnce this was done I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers and preconfigured the two new s for the new stubnetworks and routing  We went to the first site swapped the gateway over  successSort ofOnly getting  Mb  Test from DO again still getting  Mb  Another stumbling block  At this point its x better than what the school was used to well troubleshoot that part later maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth  no errors or problems on the equipment onsite for now we should get more schools up and runningNext school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets okay thats working good  Get the next site go to plug in and swap over oh ATampT brought their link in at a building on the opposite end of the campus from the T and core stack claiming there wasnt enough room  there was plenty of room they were lazy about running the fiber it was just easier to run it where they did  gt  Ended the work day on that noteThe next day we had a plan  grabbed one of those s meant for another site put it in to handle ATampTs link swapped the gateways confirmed up and working  This school already had a  that was used for the T  we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new  for  This site got full bandwidthNext stop is two sites that are next door to each other  The last sites were doing  Both of them get the  Mb problem  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion I route the upsteam back through the T  Now we can get Mb down  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is  I suspect I know what the problem is will start looking into it the next dayAs it turns out ATampT between the switches they installed onsite and their own internal stuff had the Duplex randomly set to half full or auto  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto or for that matter why they werent even consistant about it  The  Mb issue was caused by ATampTs links having duplex mismatches all over the place After getting the run around for an hour with ATampT we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them set them all to auto  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect  whewAt this point today we still have one site with just a T link  ATampT has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it  Again they dropped the ball on this and didnt put in the request until late August  We dont expect the permit will be granted for  months  Additionally weve had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a Gb link  We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the Gb  Still waiting on that  So its not quite done but the worst is over at least,1385425123.0,Tales from a NetAdmin Ep   The NetAdmin vs

Gambatte,30,30,1rjrxi,116,A quick one for today TFTS the bloodwolves are out in force today and I have a VM that keeps crashing for no apparent reason  must be those damned checks list transient voltagesA few weeks after the events of M is for Musophobiahttpredditrj the very same pimply faced youth PFY as starred in that story had done very little but bombard me with how amazingly fantastic he was at everything to do with IT and technical support Arrogant egotistic totally up himself  these words barely do him justice He would constantly tell everyone around him about his monster computer which would simultaneously run  WoW accounts and Glider  grinding his latest set of accounts up to level cap which hed then promptly sell on eBay But he considered himself too cool to actually play WoWSo basically the worst kind of scum you can find in ITOn this particular Friday morning I was at my desk on the third floor and he was midspiel about he awesome he was in his previous role at the IT department when I received an email from the IC of the building the IC had recently been upgraded to a full office and it was time to move his PC The IC was all sorts of stupid stories for another time but at least he knew that he didnt know about computers so had put the request through to my teamWe did this stuff all the time but I was down a few team members due to some recent departmental reshuffling and everyone else was busy I tuned back into the PFYs selfaggrandizing rantgt PFY basically I was running the entire IT team which made the actual supervisor look bad so he got me transferred over heregt ME PFY the building IC needs his computer moved Seeing as youre so good at IT it shouldnt take you long to move his computer from his old desk to the new one rightgt PFY Thats easy Half hour topsgt ME Well we dont have much on this morning and its the IC so take your time do it right Hell be a massive PITA if its not done right the first time Hes getting a second screen added as well which is already in the officegt PFY SureSo about two hours pass and I come back from my morning vitamin D session to find PFY sitting in the office checking his emailsgt ME Have you finished moving the ICs computergt PFY Yeah it was easy like I saidgt ME Okay another jobs come in soand I left it at that PFY was trying to get promoted to my IC position or at least a position at the same level on one of the other teams so in the back of my head I thought I could take him at his word that the job was doneI should have known better Actually I did know better but I disregarded my instinct its okay I would pay for my hubris laterSo PFY is set to work on some other task and we go about our dayAbout  pm PFY gets a call and has to go to another department for the rest of the day I make a note to follow up with that department so as to make sure he hasnt just taken off early for the weekendAbout half an hour to closing and I finally get hold of someone at that department Theyre basically closed and noone has any idea that the PFY is meant to be there I make myself a note to reprimand the PFY first thing on Monday its not a good idea to be lying to take off early on a Friday when youve got your hopes up for a promotionClosing time finally arrives and I start to head out of the building My exit route just happened to take me past the building ICs new office where I see him looking behind his screen with a very confused expression on his facegt ME Hey IC whats upgt IC Oh my computers not going for some reasongt ME When did this startgt IC Oh I havent used it since its been in this office  Ive been in meetings with the boss all day Thats why it was the perfect time to get my office movedgt ME Give me a second Ill see what I can doI look behind the screen and notice that there is no power or VGA cable plugged in Hmm weird Maybe they forgot to supply one with the second screenCheck other screen same thingAt about this point I let out an expletive that could be heard clearly throughout the building as we were on the third floor having it heard on the ground floor was quite an achievementI checked the back of the computer No cords there either No power no ethernet certainly no VGA cablesSearching through the ICs old desk I found all of the cables in a tangled mess After spending the next half hour untangling them and connecting them into the appropriate sockets I had the ICs computer powered up and working on both screens Of course I then had to sit through the boot up and log in sequence to make sure that everything was working correctlyBoth the building IC and I did not leave until an hour after closing that nightCome Monday morning PFY was late getting in some excuse about a medical appointment just like first thing every other Monday I quickly consulted with the building IC who promptly approved my plan a quick call to the front desk let the security guards in on it tooYou see access to each floor was controlled by an RFID tag When the PFY arrived that day he gained access to the elevator and stairwell but found his card would not get him through the third floor door Eventually he tailgated someone else through the door and made it to the officeHe dropped into his seat by the large whiteboard that we kept current outofoffice task assignments on so as to know where a particular PFY should be if they were not immediately on hand and started cursing about the broken access control system and how he could build a better one himselfI picked up the phone and made a call Within minutes the building IC arrived with his boss in tow followed by a security guard I met them at the office door and brought them to the PFYs deskgt PFY Whats going ongt ME I tasked you with moving the ICs computer on Friday did I notgt PFY Yeahgt ME And you told me you had finished it did you notgt PFY I did finish itgt ME THEN WHY DID THE IC AND I SPEND AN HOUR ON FRIDAY NIGHT MAKING IT WORKgt PFY It must have broken after I leftgt ME Oh I see  so every single cable just disconnected themselves moved back to the original office and put themselves in a drawer did theygt PFY Whagt ME Turn your head to the right and tell me what is written across the top of the whiteboardgt PFY Task Locationgt ME Across the topgt PFY A job is notgt ME Continuegt PFY A job is not completed until it is testedgt ME Correct So given the way that the job was completed on Friday I must conclude that you either chose to ignore this offices standard procedure for completing work or that you are so incompetent as to not be able to determine the difference between a working computer and one with no cables connected to it AT ALL or that you did almost nothing for over two hours lied about completing the job and hoped you wouldnt get caughtgt PFY Bugt ME interrupting him midword near trembling with ragegt ME SHUTgt ME UPgt ME None of these options are suitable for a person to continue working here either in this office or for megt ME Compounding the matter is the fact that you lied about an out of office job on Friday leaving the rest of the team to pick up the slack while you took off for an early weekend Ive been in touch with the department head to confirm both on Friday afternoon and again this morning and no one asked for you to go over there nor saw you in the buildinggt ME Your card access to this building has been limited to unclassified areas only and will be revoked completely as soon as you leave the building You are to report to the general resource pool immediately  Ill be calling your new supervisor to let them know that youre on your waygt ME to Security Guard Please escort this man out of the buildinggt ME to PFY Get the hell out of my buildingPFY was escorted away by Security and IC came up to megt IC You looked like you wanted to swear at himgt ME Because I didgt IC I still think we should have kept him around to scrub the toiletsgt ME So he could do a terrible job of that too Better to just be rid of himPOSTSCRIPT Two weeks later HR sent me the performance review form for that particular PFY I sent it back with a note saying that he no longer worked for my department with a full transcript of the reasons whyThey sent it back apparently hed lasted longer working for me than any of his previous departmentsI filled it out  brutally honestly My final line While PFY does show some technical aptitude his unwarranted arrogance leads him to have a lackadaisical and borderline insubordinate attitude which prevents him from gaining any significant experience in this roleMy counterpart at the general resource pool where people who are still under contract but unable to perform their duties end up later told me that he had put him in a team that was clearing bushes from outside a company building The following day he had to move him to a team that was painting a wall as he was unable to follow the safety instructions for using the chainsawLast I heard the PFY had moved on to a sales role with another companyBrowse other volumes of the

Cloudedguardian,40,23,1rcp13,99,Hi TFTS Ive been a lurker for over a year now and Im certainly no IT girl but I think this still counts and that youll all get a kick out of this I am known by my local friends as The Smart One and as such when one of my local friends had a tech issue Im often asked if I could sort it out for them Its often as simple as reading the manual they tossed in the recycling and pressing the right button if not just turning it on and off againWell one day the only girl of this circle that I actually consider a friend rather than an acquaintance asked me if I could give her a hand Lets call her Red Red wanted me to help her sort out her Notebook as I had a rather nice laptop that Id gotten for graduation that I had to quote Done some cool crap with Well shes my friend and I like learning about computers so I figured I could give it a shotRed pulls out her Notebook turns it on and logs on before clicking Firefox to load up her internet My eyebrow immediately went up when it took no less than five minutes for her Google homepage to come up Im doing a checklist in my head of what could be slowing it down like this and start asking the obvious questions To me anywayMe Well have you cleared out your cache recently It could just be as simple as old files gumming up your systemRed My whatNow I knew that there was a possibility I wasnt using the correct terms as my Dad had for the longest time been the techy of our family and everything I knew was from what he and my American gamer friend had taught me Dad always called what I was thinking of The Cache and so I didnt know what else to call itMe Errr its like a bunch of cookies and information pieces that your computer accumulates as you surf the web Some sites are especially bad for it and you can get up to a couple thousand in an hour with them Cheezburger for instance Theres a program you run to clean it out let me see if you have onHere Reds Grandmother who had been listening in the background cut me off Oh no theres a button on that fox browser thing that does thatI blinked trying to figure out what she was talking about Then I realized that she was talking about the Data management window that you can bring up I resisted facepalming by keeping in mind that I was probably using the wrong terms and therefore it could be my fault that they were confused Me Errr no I think thats the browser cache Im talking about a different one on the computer itself sorry I might not be using the proper termsGranny Well I dont think clearing the computer is necessary the browser fixes that stuff Reds probably just downloaded some weird thing and has messed it all upAt this point Red and my eyebrows were both starting to twitch and so she made the wise decision of pulling me up to her room so I could fuss with her computer in peace As I struggle to get anything to load Red asks me if I really thought it was a computer cache thing slowing it down As I searched for an anticirus a cleaner anything I said it was a possibility before giving up and asking her what antivirus she had She said she didnt know what I meantMe Like uh Norton or McAfee Red Oh No I aint got that WhyMe Well I think you might have a virus Theyre really easy for your computer to pick up if you dont have a proper antivirus Its probably whats gumming up your systemRed Ohhh What are you doingI was at that very second looking up a free antivirus and cleaner that a Tech blogger of mine had mentioned with the intention of downloading and using them in the place of Norton I explained as such and Red told me bluntly not to I looked at her with a look of uttermostMe WutRed I downloaded somethin like that a little while ago and it just made things worse So dontI figured she had downloaded one of the scam ones and tried to explain that I think I lost her in the second sentence so I gave up and just said that it wasnt a Proper antivirus but this one was a good one that I had heard recommended by many people She still wouldnt let me download it As she took her Notebook back with me conceding defeat I suggested that if she didnt want to download the free one she could always go to Staples and buy Norton I added that it was what I had and would clean repair and kill all the virus and it was very simple to use It was megaonsale at the moment and wouldnt be a bad idea She told me shed think about it but it was a lot of moneyAbout a week later my sister Black and I seen Red with a brand new laptop I asked her what happened with her Notebook and she said that since it was so slow shed just gone and bought a new one I blinked Me So it wasnt a virus Cleaning it didnt help Well that suRed Oh no I didnt clean it or nuthin I just chucked it and bought a new one insteadMe Wut Black Please tell me you didnt throw that Notebook in the trashRed Nah its too much hassle to try and throw computer junk in the trash My friend actually wanted it if you can believe it So I let her have itMe Ddid you at least get Norton for your new computer Like does your new laptop have some sort of an antivirusRed Nah it doesnt need that junk Its all fast and new Im not gonna have any problems with this baby at allBlack You are going to become this stores best buckin friend aintcha AhouTLDR  Friend buys new laptop for over  rather than spending  on an antivirus,1385308054.0,More

Gambatte,42,24,1rg6w8,93,In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium and thus a star was born This was of course very embarrassing for the cloud who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of fusionNot so long after that I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platterA brand new system was being introduced and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running On the plus side it had already completed acceptance testing so it should be a matter of plug and play Oh naiveté is a wondrous thing Should was most definitely the operative word thereThere existed a system for passing classified data between two systems This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for its own purposes using a unidirectional link to the data bus  in fact passive was the first word in the link equipments name The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not at that time at least have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuitOnce the equipment was finally all installed on my end I was able  with some coaxing and the elimination of some huge security breaches for example the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network  to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully Huzzah Great success And many drinks were hadBut twas not to be so simple Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations things became more complicated The remote locations RF equipment would lock up after every transmission We would not receive data from them when the link was up And so on Over time we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link which handled the data packets in a different way causing the equipment to lock up We got that fixed but we were still not receiving data from the remote locationEventually after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests I flicked to the last page There I found a summary of the testing results which came down to a single linegt Some tests successful with remote location  all other locations failed all testingWhich was exactly the problem wed been having  and when  had replaced some equipment it had begun to fail as well So these were all known issues from the original testing regime but the project manager had signed off on it accepting the new system into service rather than sending it back to get the issues fixedheaddesk  tableflip  locateandreattachheadWe eventually determined that the reason that remote location  had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for   so when the equipment was replaced the new equipment did not contain that library The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that featureAs the system experts SE started to pack up their gear on their final day before the  hour flight back to the States one of them turned to me and saidgt SE Im glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out once that firmware is in everything should run smoothly for yougt ME Yeah Well see what happens with that I dont know if management will be happy to pay manufacturer for the license And they really need that memory for more important featuresgt SE Any other problems before we head back to the hotel Is the data injection working wellgt ME Wait What data injectionQueue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available Apparently the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system replacing a rather error prone manual process The way the system was actually working insofar as it had on occasion actually worked the manual process was still required but was read from the new systems screen rather than via a voice channelThis design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device which was shown in the documentation as a bidirectional link not unidirectional  despite having the word PASSIVE or UNIDIRECTIONAL written next to it on every externally referenced diagram these were missing from the diagrams included in the design documentAfter the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed I received an official commendation  although Id rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the systems hard drives a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive I could have bought a nice boat at the suppliers listed price The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number although others have estimated it as a low eight Had the system expert not made that one offhand comment to me someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into itTwo technical project managers were reprimanded one for designing a system that could never possibly work and the other for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five although he was already leaving anyway so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own incompetenceAfter that the project was never mentioned againBrowse other volumes of the

troubleshooting  IE I have had a lot experience and everybody knows me and talks to me if they need help including the principals Every year we have about  new students starting that gets a brand new laptop This is usually not a problem and the first interaction I have with said laptop is when I borrow one to see the specs of them but this year that was not the case This year some smart fella decided to without notice give us active directory connected computers I heard this day two of the term when the principal old tech and teacher spoke about students not having logins and since we study windows server I instantly told them that this would be a problem The answer I got was that the central IT department was promising that it would be safe and that they would have local admin so they can install software and they would not be able to sign in on one another computersA few days go by and we finally get the accounts for our  affected users to the email of the local so called PC tech He printed the lists and put them in his room while we gathered our forces two d grade students to start giving them out to the students that for a week had not been able to use their brand new computers But do you think we got the lists when we got there No we did not But this story is not about how the the so called PC tech prioritized a single d grade student that broke his computer the day before over  students that has not been able to use their computers for a week Or how he yelled at me when I told him to re prioritize This story is about something worse After we distributed the logins to the students doing our best to make sure the right student got the right account I said I did not thrust the system and asked for a testing system and was promptly given one As it turns out everything that central IT had said was wrong and I had to go in to the principals office close the doors pull the curtain and explain that the students could use their own logins to gain full admin on all of the computers Including all of the teachers computers And all of the principals computers And then showed him on his own computer when I accessed his files The alarm bells rung and a few scary days later central IT had fixed the AD so students could not log in with admin right on teachers computers any more We could finally breath again But fear not the story is not over yet Remember I told you the school specializes in IT Its only a matter of time before the students try hacking each other something that is not a problem in it self as long as they play nice and so far they have always done that Ye old hosts file patch and desktop background prank the stuff you did when you were young But remember that they can use their own credentials to log in to other laptops with full admin privileges and not only prank when the computer is left unlocked Not that very good Once again central IT promised a solution and last week I heard the solution was done Note that the first issues were in august but all has been fine and only the nice students have figured out what they can do with their friends laptops but I did not trust the solution again so I grabbed my testing laptop once again and checked if their solution worked It did not and resulted in a new email to central IT telling them to get their shit together since it was broken This may seem crazy but this is just bad IT and bad IT is not what this subreddit is about This subreddit is about the absolutely horrible act from the local so called PC tech to central IT after he was CCd in a mail earlier today where they asked for help with testing if they had fixed it This was his response it central IT gt Hello NAMEgt gt Sorry I could not answer your mail earlier I have been on vacation th november And after that I have had still have lots of stuff to do regarding student laptop issues cases and lots of stuff on the janitorial front gt gt New things come from the central IT department all the time that we on the school have to adapt to and that really takes from the active worktime in all sorts of ways gt gt I will try to dedicate time to this in the beginning of next week and see what is new then gt gt Have a nice weekend No that is how he writes I just translated it from swedish The best part The so called PC tech has no idea what AD is and how it works so he does not understand the problem As a effect of that the issue was not on his table This issue has taken a total of  minutes of his time that he has spent reading the emails that he was CCd in and that is the only thing he had to do But he just lashed out against the guys that tried to fix our problem HOW THE FUCK WHAT I DONT EVEN HE WORKS IN IT WHATI would not expect better from a regular user but this guy does it support himself What Oh and this is also the guy that told me you have to be hard and mean against the support agents to get what you want I was nice and calm and got exactly what I wanted but that was above his understanding TLDR Of course he did it was a rhetorical question ,1385732227.0,Did he just send angry emails to central IT because they are trying to fix our

lawtechie,19,13,1rgd61,84,So Im doing tech support at an advertising agency There were five of us on the IT staff and for some cursed reason everybody but I took the same week off Since we were an outside contractor we had some other staff that could be assigned for coverage Unfortunately all the competent people were gone They sent me the Walrus The Walrus was some guy who didnt have the people skills to handle a remanufacturing bench tech gig at a large network device manufacturer Literally He had been laid off so we hired him because he was cheapHe wore tootight shiny polyester shirts over his ample gut and had a bushy fumanchu mustache which is how he earned the Walrus nickname He mumbled and didnt make that much sense So Im running around like a ferret on meth and Ill take anybody who knows basic troubleshooting or can lift heavy objectsI soon discover that hes less than useful in a nowhumorous wayThe ad agency uses the top two floors of a  story office building The help desk is on the first floor so it takes a few minutes to run from the help desk to any of our users Most spares are kept in the help desk officesI figure Ill crew the phones and dispatch the Walrus to tickets he can solve An artist needs fonts loaded and a VP needs help with a presentation Give the Walrus directions to the artists cube the file path to the font directory and send him on his way while I handhold a VPTen minutes later one of the other artists calls meArtist Uhh LawTechie Whats with this guy you sent up hereMe Whats wrongArtist I think you want to come get himI walk up and see a few of the artists ridiculing the Walrus It feels like the shower sanitary napkin scene from Carrie Turns out he didnt know how the font management extension worked and kept rebooting the artists Mac hoping itd work this time The artists sensing weakness started throwing balled up paper over the cube walls at the WalrusI send the Walrus back to the office and make disapproving eye contact with the rowdy artists On my way back one of the administrative assistants complains of a beeping UPSbattery backup I figure the Walrus can handle this I call down to the help desk and tell him to bring up a good UPS and swap out the beeping one So some explanation here Since we have frequent power outages at this suburban office all users have battery backups We have maybe ten spares Every few months we order a bunch of batteries and spend a day swapping batteries I even have worn out clothing in my desk just for that day since battery acid eats through clothing UPS with bad batteries get marked with a strip of masking tape with BAD BATTERY in red lettering Theyre put on the shelf with DO NOT USE BAD BATTERIES also in red lettering When we replace the batteries they go on the shelf immediately above  labeled GOOD BATTERIES in red lettering We also remove the tape on the UPS So bad ones are marked good ones are ready to go This protocol just cant get screwed up can itI get involved in replacing backup tapes and boxing the old ones off for the Iron Mountain guy waiting patiently in reception Perhaps  minutes have passedI walk back to my office not looking forward to a bunch of outstanding tickets The Walrus comes running in redfaced and sweaty WalrusNone of those UPS were any goodMeReally There were three that have new tested batteries I tested them myself Maybe its bad wiringSo we walk up to the cubicle In the trash are two strips of masking tape with half inch block letters in red marker BAD BATTERY So I walk back down take one of the good UPS off of the Good Batteries shelf and install it Beeping stopsI think about my other tasks and figure he should be able to do simple construction tasks The agency wants to build a little classroom We need to put a  port dumb  ethernet switch under a table run cable to it and make sure it lights up Walrus was saying that hes more familiar with hardware than software or user support so I hand him the drill switch mounting kit and some cables I decide its time to get some food so I leave for  minutes For some reason or no reason at all he ignores the tray like mount kit flips the ears on the switch so the flat part is facing up and directly screws the ears into the bottom of the tableUsing   sheet rock screws So now theres four sharp screws sticking out of the top of the table Luckily theyre covered by the PowerMac immediately on top of the table They havent penetrated the steel bottom of the case I call up the home office and ask them never ever to send the Walrus again,1385422197.0,Fun with the Walrus,97,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week

some workers are transferred over to a off campus facility where we help cycle computers New purchases are imaged added to a domain and have special software deployed based on where its going Old relics leaving service  are KillDisced scavenged for parts and then shrinkwraped and prepared for recycling Its not a bad gigIn order to maintain some degree of CYA when computers arrive to be outprocessed and recycled we keep them for  days before wiping them This is so that if a professor forgot the picture of his kid or the staff member needs that one spreadsheet they left on the machine it can still be recovered Most of the time the previous owner realizes their mistake early on and we get their files for them and put them on a physical media for the user to pick up at their convenience Too bad that Most of the time is not  All of the timeThis particular incident began with me arriving caffeine in thermos book in hand for another day of processing I walk to the stack of old towers and grab a choice specimen noting the paperwork According to the paperwork I can wipe it  I trundle this bulky box to my workstation and begin setting it up for its last rights  I used to sing Daisy Daisy while i worked but then someone told me it made me seem like a sociopath I laughed and said  no im just grunt support I am about to pull the trigger when my boss pokes his head back and asks if i have processed Professor Derpingtons computer yet I look hopelessly at the pile of processed machines behind me Then as if it were fate I double check the paperwork from the computer I am currently working on lo and behold its Derpingtons Not boss I have the tower on the table and I was just about to press goWell the Prof forgot some tests and Important research data on there and he needs them so dont kill it yetOk should I get his files off for himNo he says he needs them ASAP Hes coming here to get themI double take Professors and administrators almost never descend to this particular facility Theres even a pool going as to whether or not the CIO of the uni could find this building on a google map  The idea of a Bambieyed professor navigating our wire strewn technological reliquary of a faculty is novel if not terrifying Soon the professor arrives luckily he is not a professor from my department and I have never met him before I walk him through several rooms each stacked with components from various eras of computer development before ultimately arriving at my workstation I sit him down in my chair and boot the PC for him He gets logged in and begins going about retrieving his files I step away for while I figure I can be more productive than just standing about while Professor Derpington moves files So I go take care of a few menial tasks and come back to find the good Professor standing and perusing the shelves The monitor has been switched off but the computer seems to be working overtime based on the volume of the fans Sir are you done I move to turn the monitor back on I can shut it down and walk you to the exitNO WAIT he reaches out to stop meI reactivate the monitor and immediately I am greeted with a familiar sight The windows file transfer dialog with its loading bar animation and rapidly changing text appears and demonstrates that files are being moved to the professors external hard drive Hold onGB of files are being movedfrom a folder labeled NOT PORNMy discovery happens in an instant and suddenly the screen goes black as the professor presses the button and the window to Windows closes again that is private Students should not be rooting through professors filesyes sir my mistake I begin walking out  Give me a call when your finished I round the corner and keep walking I fight to keep the laughter down until I am sufficiently far enough away I double over and laugh for a while eventually i regain my composure and continue going about my work until I am summoned by Derpington Lord of Not Pornia So what happens now he demands as he disconnects his hard drive and powers down the machine I explain our procedure and about how we wipe data He demands that he wants to witness the wiping for security reasons I was disappointed because I wanted to see what was GB of Not porn wasFor Science But he stood by for  minutes as killdisc did its magic I escorted him out and he thanked me and

Smith,28,6,1rjppo,42,So heres a quickie and its a common tale of what happens when a user receives a virus alert and how it put a smile on my faceThis afternoon with the first major snow storm of the season crashing into the area and with the tickets piling up because everything seems to magically break due to the Thanksgiving holiday approaching in the United States I decided it would be a good time to take lunch before dealing with the storm I was in the mood to spend a worthwhile lunch break in my own style Pizza with some Battlefield  Multiplayer and to top things off a cozy spot in a conference room Why the conference room Well Windows and apparently snows a new thing in this area so I would hate for all of the telephone poles to be taken out So I grab my personal laptop which happened to be with me grab some pizza from the lunch room and situate myself in the conference room I connected my personal laptop up to the network launched Origin and began a download of Battlefield  Not a single moment after I clicked download my mobile phone starts to ring Its one of the small business users I supportThe conversation began with the user sounding extremely worried and very panicked They received a cold call from someone in Dallas likely a spoof saying their new lap computer in the users words had a virus and that they mustnt wait to get the virus removed I paused for a second knowing all too well how these cold calls work I checked the number calling me as a sanity check and confirmed its the userss secondary line Odd for this user to be calling me on thatThe conversation then progressed in a very short amount of time to me explaining that this new laptop one which I had specifically set up and locked down specifically for this user is perfectly fine and that the person calling unexpectedly happened to be a scammer Of course also a major security risk if the user doesnt adhere to my advice The user informed me that they were on the phone with the cold caller at which point I proceed to tell them to hang up Fully expecting the user to doubt my advice based on previous conversations with them about simple email issues I remained on standby watching the download progress of Battlefield  I hear a thud on the phone followed by the user yelling a quick swift storm of words that went along the lines of Go away evil scum followed by the voice of the user back on the line with me in a very calm but still panicked voiceI spoke with the user to explain why those types of calls are bad and put them back at ease to ensure their computer was fine The user doubted me here and I simply had to explain to them that everything was okay and that these types of calls happen regardless of whether or not you have a computer I explained the concept of war dialing just to be sure they understood English is also not the users primary language although I am capable of speaking some others to an extent if they prefered and why and how the cold callers broke some telecommunications laws based on the users situation I lastly finished up the call as Battlefield  began to install explaining how call spoofing can lead to tricksI wrapped up the call by thanking the user for running their concerns through me this user was the first one who Ive dealt with who did not follow through and bid them a Happy Thanksgiving I took a much deserved bite of my pizza joining a  player Battlefield  server to vent some stress out on Paracel Storm and Siege of Shanghai With the tickets continuing to come in along with the snow piling up I can only hope that Thanksgiving will be a relief and not an oncall user apocalypseTLDR Lap Computer virus OH MY,1385523425.0,Good user,48,TalesFromTechsupport,top_week
