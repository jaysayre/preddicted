rtechnix,2,2,1r329d,7,Obviously the way tectonics and the hot spots work the islands get older as you move NW Naturally this means that erosion will generally make those islands further from the current location of the hotspot smaller However is this enough to explain the rate of decrease in island size or even what appears to be the old island size looking at the wide shallow peak of the seamount in the bathymetry or is there something else too Such as the plate slowing down and giving the hotspot more time to form volcanoesOr alternatively I suppose the question could be rephrased as were the average largest sizes of the islands in the chain about as big as the current main islands or noI ask because some of while some of the closest atolls look like they made had a similar land size in the past to current islands looking at the bathymetry with a large flat shallow part and more gently sloping sides past about Maro Reef they suddenly become much smaller and steeper Around Midway and further up theyre just specks Are the erosion of the seamounts enough to explain this or were those islands actually much smaller too,1384979746.0,Is the decreasing in size of the Hawaiian island chain going northwest due to just erosionatollformation or are there reasons why more recent islands have had a larger peak size,9,askscience,new
