ndAssistantGoatherd,2,42,1rp2ge,117,Pisistratus was a Greek tyrant Herodotus describes how he took power in Athens three separate times in the th century BC Each coup was achieved in a more or less ridiculous fashion see below My question is whether there is any evidence that the Greeks were themselves skeptical about any of this and whether theres anything that suggests alternative explanations for Pisistratuss rise to powerThe three coups Just outside Athens Pisistratus cut himself and his mules about the body then drove into town claiming that hed been attacked by his political enemies The people gave him bodyguards who followed him around armed with clubs Pisistratus then took the Acropolis by force with the help of his new bodyguards Pisistratus was later driven out of Athens His plan to get back into power is described by Herodotus as the silliest trick which history has to record He found a tall woman called Phye Φύη and dressed her up as Athena He taught her some goddesslike moves then rode into Athens on a chariot with her standing next to him The Athenians fell for this ludicrous ruse and he returned to power Herodotus himself is incredulous about this story After being chucked out of Athens for a second time Pisistratus gathered an army and made for the city On the way a soothsayer wandered by and told him some nonsense about fish being caught in nets Pisistratus ordered his army to advance at that exact time the Athenians were having lunch or playing some dice or having an afterlunch snooze So Pisistratuss army walked into Athens unopposed   ,1385707415.0,Was the absurd rise to power of Pisistratus ever believed to be true by anyone,159,askhistorians,top_day
