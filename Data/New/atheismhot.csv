aaqucnaona,11,0,1rqgkk,7,This never used to be a problem because the issue could always be delayed to an afterlife concern The issue is this  its equally unsettling to me to die or live forever In the first case especially if I am just passing the time browsing something it suddenly hits me that these moments have little value to me but at some point in time they will end for me Even if we somehow manage to stave off aging death is just an accident away And nothing can get past the heat death anyway This all is very abstract but I get this image in my head of closing my eyes and seeing the world for the last time Of moving my last muscle or taking my last breath And no matter what I do how well I take care of myself that moment is coming Even the time taken to write this has only brought me closer to it And then I will not exist No perception no thoughts and nothing Everything that happened good or bad will simply cease to matter All my successes and failings will be for nothing All so that some fucking genes can pass onto to another generation The panic is strong enough to bring to tears and keep me up for the better part of the night This happens every few dozen days regardless of my mood or other activities in my life I dont know what to do where to find solace or a way out of this mental torment Any help or advice on what to do Any similiar experiences to sharePs I know of Dawkins We are going to die and that makes us the lucky ones but I cant get myself to agree Its like asking if its better to give nothing to a child or give it an icecream and then snatch it back,1385762118.0,Its been two years since I lost my faith I still get panic attacks went contemplating my own mortality Any helpadvice,7,atheism,hot

oawe,9,0,1rqkff,4,A family member passed this week and I learned Wednesday the church expects me as a family member to deliver the sacraments in a catholic funeral I was informed this is simply walking something down an aisle and handing it to a priest They arranged this without my consent and are now expecting me to do this and Im conflictedI was put through Catholic sacraments as a child baptism communion etc but was never taught anything about the religion When this was complete at  I never did anything further My family never did anything else religious aside from putting me through sacraments and not diddo I I dont necessarily consider myself anything officially because I never found it a priority or necessity to find out Still I thought ratheist would be the best place to askWhat do you guys think Theres something ever so slightly at the pit of my stomach that feels off about it but theres also allegedly not much to it I realize this could be a lie though as Im uninformed Theyre pretty adamant about me doing it and the situation is making me uncomfortable Im a fairly blunt person so I have made this explicitly known without much change of heart I also am an adult so theres no obligation but I also dont want to alienate or offend my family Advice,1385765182.0,Participating in funeral,4,atheism,hot
merchantco,79,34,1rprui,15,Youre all going to hate me for this but I dont care Remember the shitstorm we raised on rAtheism when the mods effectively banned all meme posts from this website Yes of course we remember thatIn my opinion it is becoming increasingly apparent that this has made ratheism is a better place In my opinion all but few memes are vapid annoying and puerile Only the most brilliant perfectly constructed memes are worth being posted on this subreddit Unfortunately the constant posting of memes created a sickening amalgamate of  unoriginal memes and  intelligent discussions When the meme aspect was removed ratheism became a much more intelligent and thoughtprovoking environment Some memes are humorous I like that But when you hear the same joke over and over and over again it ceases to be funny Raptor Jesus this Raptor Jesus that Sad face this sad face that Confused face this confused face that You know where the word meme comes from It comes from the French word meme which means same The same thing over and over and over again ad infinitumThe environment also became less hostile and more inviting More debates intelligent discussions and more effort put into each post Im happy that this got changed I have no clue why the environment changed in such a positive way but thats another matter Thoughts,1385742005.0,Mod Decision on rAtheism a change for the better,49,atheism,hot

Michael,9,0,1rprta,9,It is tradition on Thanksgiving every year that one person from the family reads a prayer before dinner and the person who read this year chooses the person the next year My mother read last year and she asked me if I wanted to read it even though she knew I was an atheist Im only  so Im guessing she thinks this is just a phase and that Im being a typical rebellious teenager and the dialogue went something like thisHey do you want to read the prayer this year on Thanksgiving I wanted to ask you even though your denying God at the momentNo thank you mom Im an atheist but if you would like I could write something and read it if you wantThen she sort of stopped and looked at me and saidWait youre not going to write about how there is no God and evolution and stuff are you because your grandmother will have a heart attackI felt sort of insulted that she thought I might try to convert my entire family over Thanksgiving dinner Im aware this is anticlimatic I just wanted to share Her mentioning evolution was especially strange to me because we never grew up in a necessarily religious household we went to church around Christmas and Easter at best I did not expect to hear something like that especially in the progressive state of MassachusettsEdit More insightBefore Thanksgiving I had a conversation about my atheism beforehand with my mom my grandmother and my great aunt so I would not have considered me being an atheist a real bombshell because that was at minimum  months prior but I do believe I am the only family member who defines myself openly as an atheist The funny thing is I had a conversation with my aunt and two uncles about religion during Thanksgiving and I was lent a Bible and a book called Proof of Heaven They did seem more open about it then I would have previously thought though my aunt had past alcohol problems and recently found Jesus To clarify I would not consider my family fundamentalist Christians but religion is definitely a large part of their lives my aunt MAY be an exception she goes to church multiple times a week and is in training to become a minister or whatever the correct title is rest of my family that is not direct goes to church weekly,1385741980.0,Something that puzzled me on Thanksgiving I know Im late,9,atheism,hot

skorost,5,5,1rnen1,2,Nihilism is a rather mysterious philosophical concept and hence a rather difficult one to grasp One must dig deep into the philosophical tradition to fully understand what it means what it entails and how anyone could subscribe to it But here I will hopefully and with some measure of success do so here I will develop and formulate that harrowing realm of thought that we call nihilism that movement towards nothingness and bring to the fore the nature of those in and by whom it is expressednamely those of a religious persuasion who derive the value of their lives and of their deeds therein from a divine realm outside the worldEvidence regarding the ostensible meaning of nihilism can be found in the etymology of the word itself It consists of the root nihil which in Latin means nothing This nevertheless does not inform us as to how the word is being used and thusly what it means Nor would it really tell us definitively what the word means if we were to look it up in a dictionary yet we will nonetheless and indeed in doing so we come across an oddly wide range of senses to which the word nihilism is attached as well as a wide range of fields which submit their own definition of it Let us examine a few of these just for the sake of clarityIn philosophy nihilism traditionally refers to Extreme skepticism maintaining that nothing has a real existence In ethics it is formulated as the rejection of all moral principles And yet one more definition we might find is The belief that all endeavors are ultimately futile and devoid of meaning These are all in one sense or another correct but none of them quite penetrates to the heart of nihilism to the cause of it rather they each seem to be dancing around it as though it were a black hole and they were trying to keep beyond its event horizon for fear of being trapped by it and yet to observe it no less as if it could be known fully from the outside Indeed it seemsto me at leastthat these definitions reflect only a vague awareness of the conditions from which nihilism naturally proceeds so I suppose that it is my task to tie them all together into the larger picture that they formI myself if I had to put forth a definition of the word would pronounce it thusly Belief in or towards nothingness Yet that is also too simple if only because it does not inherently paint the picture of what is happening Regardless let us look at the first sense of the word I introduced namely that one concerning extreme skepticism Skepticism is a very useful tool of thinking in that by virtue of it we question our assumptions which we might also call faith and drive ourselves ever towards truth and honesty As I noted in the introduction I am very much a skepticas any educated or intellectual person necessarily needs to bebut it is also necessary that I subscribe to some measure of faith That is to say I must assume a certain range of truths in particular the healthy functioning of my brain and hence the integrity of my own sense experiences and perceptions But I assume these things insofar as I rely on them to function as a human being I am also aware of the possibility that my brain is perhaps in fact not working properly but the lack of evidence to suggest this gives me grounds to assume that it is after all working properlyIf that doesnt aptly demonstrate what Im getting at then consider the alternatives if I were not skeptical at all then I would believe whatever anyone told me regardless of whether or not any two statements or notions contradicted each other I would be a tool at the disposal of everyone else a puppet to be manipulated a gob of clay to be molded I would not be a functional human being were this the case and my reality would consist of the illusions which I accept without questionAnd on the other hand if I rejected everything every assumption every possible truth on the grounds that I cannot know anything with any certainty I would be unable to see my life and my existence as anything but an endless inalterable dream a stage of illusions and phantoms where all is pretend all is fantasy and where nothing I do has any real effect or real meaning outside of myself and my hallucinationa profound despairing selfannihilating solipsism I am God and this is all just a sad pathetic daydream Nothing is real,1385653098.0,Religion makes life meaningless only those who do not believe truly have purpose in this life,7,atheism,hot

Jancy,2,4,1rlysi,3,This is a very important book that is often overlooked by atheists  However I believe it is a must read for modern Christians and Atheists alike The first entry in the book is called Abbe  A year after Voltaire published one of his early original works a young man tried to put the philosophy into practice  France asshole catholic community  The young Chevalier de la Barre had refused to kneel in the presence of a religious procession  He was found GUILTY of the crime of irreverence  He was then tortured and his tongue was ripped out  After he was beheaded his body was committed to the flames  In the bonfire his executioners threw the book that caused this uproar  Voltaires Philosophical Dictionary  This is an important document to France and a contribution to history      My favorite ending of this first story goes speaking of priests  Gentlemen you are right  You should lay claim to the earth it belongs to men with the strength and the skill to acquire it  You have used ignorance superstition and strife to strip us of our legacies and trample us under your feet while you waxed fat on the resources of the unfortunate  Tremble for the day of reckoning is at hand     Voltaire can be difficult to understand at times due to translation from French to English but his satirical style is unmistakable   The concepts in the book are over two hundred years old but are just as telling about human nature as a modern book     Take the time to read the book if you can find a copy of it as a reasonable price  There are five different versions of this book written by Voltaire in his lifetime the one published before his death was his best    ,1385596477.0,Book Voltaires Philosophical Dictionary,7,atheism,hot

jmt,17,4,1ri57i,3,Today I stopped by a store to pick up a present for my brother As I was leaving I wished the cashier an older woman a Happy Holiday She corrected me with Merry Christmas I usually let it slide off my back I live in the South and this time was no different but it made me start to wonder where I stood on the drive homeI fully realize that if I had been born in the Middle East India or Oriental Asia my beliefs would most likely reflect the popular belief in the area What I refuse to believe is that a man living a good life in rural Asia never hearing of Jesus is going to suffer some consequence in whatever if any afterlife that existsSo I took the time a few years ago to study most popular religions They all teach the same basic thing at their core Dont be a dick or else And as apathetic as this sounds that realization lead me to the point of no longer caringI dont need an or else to know that being a good person is the right thing to do But the thing is Im not trying to prove or disprove the existence of a God the afterlife or anything else because it now feels like a waste of time and energyMy view has since shifted to simply living a good life if for nothing else than dying guilt free If thats the progress and there is an afterlife I feel I would have nothing to worry about itI dont begrudge people for their beliefs and I believe that there is some good to be found in religion However Im not going to turn a blind eye to science and logicTLDR Its not that I believe God or a God exists or doesnt exist its that I just dont care anymoreWhere do I fall Certainly Im not alone in this,1385483997.0,What the hell am I,7,atheism,hot

simplicity,12,14,1rgw3u,21,Kind of a blurry memory sprang to the forefront of my subconscious recently and I had a sudden realisation that the place where I spent some of my Sundays with my best friend was a Christian youth group thing It was all pretty innocent stuff but it was in fact the subtlety of it which bothers me The people who ran the group were just so happy and enthusiastic all the time like they were so high on life nothing could faze them which now in retrospect seems a little creepy I was a pretty down to earth kid even at the age of  and never really read too much into their games and all their bullshit happiness I was just there to have fun with my friend I only went a few times and my family isnt religious in any way so I was never really exposed to religion before that apart from painting eggs at Easter and getting presents at Christmas which is why I only just figured out what that group was until recently Id just never given it much thought I remember one game in particular where theyd hand out candy to us and tell us to send it up to God and warned us that if we ate the candy instead of sending it up to him hed be very upset We would then proceed to throw the candy up in the air as high as we could and of course it would just drop back down and theyd tell us that God wants us to have the candy because he could see we deserved it for thinking of him first before ourselves My thoughts were that it was stupid because it was just gonna fall back down on the floor and even if it had a wrapper it was gonna get dirty  like I said I never really bought into religion even as a gullible kid and I especially didnt like eating things that had been on the floor but I reluctantly went along with it for the free candy The next bit was the cherry on top of this stupid exercise My poor friend who was a little on the larger side and no stranger to candy scoffed one of the sweets before sending it up to God but got caught and had to sit out of the next game In my mind this whole charade follows the model of be good or Santa wont bring you presents and all that does is make me hate the indoctrination of young children all the more Even if they didnt cram it down our throats using sweets and veiled threats to manipulate young kids isnt exactly morally correct in my opinion even if it does teach them that sharing is good in a messed up sort of way I always wonder if any of the kids at the group attended church regularly or if they really believed in the magic man in the sky because I certainly didnt and no amount of candy and jolly songs about Noahs Ark could fool me I honestly hope that the others had the same thoughts I did or at least werent sucked in by the creepy plastic smiles of those Christian group leaders  TLDR Went to Christian youth group as a kid a few times was told God would be mad if I didnt give him my sweets  didnt buy into it          ,1385435633.0,As a kid I went to a church group a few times with a friend didnt realise how subtly we were being brainwashed until many years later,35,atheism,hot

ColdSerenity,5,9,1rfuxg,15,I will try to be brief sharing a brainstorm I had last night at am as you do since I would like to see what rAtheism and reddit as a whole has to say about it I am a tried and tested Atheist but I believe selfreflection and doubt are what led me to and keep me in this line of thought As I lay awake in contemplation I started to imagine what existence really isAll we really have is our own mind painfully aware of our limited existence conditioned to seek answers even to the most frustrating questions In the absence of answers to these questions are we a cosmic accident and nothing more Is there anything at all special about mankind in the universe Is there a point to all this an image of emptiness started to well up in my mind It was dark allconsuming and inescapable like a quicksand that gripped me tighter the more I struggled against it A place that was no place at all that threw up only questions and uncertainty the physical manifestation of helpless despair For the first time in my life for just a few seconds I mentally grasped at straws I wanted out I wanted answers I wanted light  anything to keep that awful darkness away from me It was in that moment that I almost invented God Thats right theres something out there that has all the answers I dont need to worry I dont need to ask these questions any more that cause me such trouble It could really be so simple But then those few seconds were over What good would come of me just strapping on the philosophical equivalent of an Oculus Rift to convince myself it was all over I would be a pathetic sight smiling like an idiot wearing my own illusions on my head as the darkness swallowed me regardless In the words of Dylan Thomas I would rather not go gentle into that good night but Rage rage against the dying of the light And so I formulated the following thought A true Atheist is a person deserving of respect not condemnation for his conviction Not only for resisting societal pressure and walking the path of reason but for having felt in some way this darkness I have attempted to describe and learning to fear it but soldiering through it all the same Those who cling to God or Gods are like those mesmerized by the shadows on the wall of Platos cave httpenwikipediaorgwikiAllegoryoftheCave A few of them have faced the darkness and given up their fight some are just subconsciously aware of it and choose to avoid it altogether They cling often fanatically to their little nightlight lashing out against those who would have them lift their gaze This brings me to the second half of my thought When Atheists such as me deal with religious people we often find it hard to contain our disdain for many reasons that have been beaten to death on this forum the History of repression and bloodshed Science the whole caboodle Those of us that have either consciously or subconsciously chosen the fight look with anger resentment sometimes even hatred on the shadowworshippers partially out of jealousy for their ignorant bliss But I think we have to move beyond that Sure we have to keep fighting against obscurantism and of course indignation is often an accurate and necessary response to many of the worldly trespasses of the religious but our very very first reaction should be pity Pity those who did not have your mental fortitude to face a losing battle Pity those who never had the chance through lack of education andor indoctrination to even enter the fight for themselves Pity those who are subconsciously aware but choose to flee I do not want to let this pity lead to arrogance I am a fallible human just as they are even when they claim otherwise but I see it rather as a cure to my arrogance I feel genuine pity rather than anger and disdain I am still frustrated beyond belief dont get me wrong but I think this might be a step forward at least for me personally in understanding Let me know what you think I am genuinely interestedKind regardsColdSerenity,1385410371.0,Pity  or the night I almost invented God,24,atheism,hot

jlevy,6,6,1rfs1v,2,httpwwwfoxnewscomopinionsevenwaysforchristianstolovetheirneighborsevenwhendisagreeThis was a disgusting piece and I honestly just have to get this off my chest It was a link posted by a family member on Facebook and I couldnt just let such a misleading article title imply that his religion is truly one of loveI am sorry but I cannot read this and accept that the author is someone who truly sees equality as a means to better the world and human relations or coexistence The author speaks as though they want to show that they and their flock are empathetic to a cause of a fellow minority they just happen to have a differing opinion with The reality of the situation is not only far from the perspective of the writer but more to the point is crossing the line of fictionMy first and nearly overlooked quarrel with this piece was the rhetorical What does it look like to remain faithful to God while loving neighbors who passionately disagree with Christian convictions Instantly this presumptive statement should ring in the ear of all the staunch believers who have been condemned by the faith church and by extension the god that they dedicated their lives to serving As I am sure many are aware a Pastor a follower of a faith that sees his son as an abomination is being punished for marrying his son into a loving union It is not something that the faith merely passionately disagrees they actually punish and discriminate against anyone who passionately disagrees with cherry picked doctrine This is neither the first nor the last of similar offenses httpwwwreligionnewscombreakingmethodistpastorguiltyofficiatinggaysonsweddingAnd then there are the myriad of churches that cater to and preach the good news to those of faith and of LGBT lifestyles and their friends These can be found at httpwwwgaychurchorg Simply calling implying a whole group many of the faith Christianity nonbelievers is offensive even to me To say that about a personpeople that have clear allegiance to faith is an insult in with the utmost distaste and degradation I am sure there are many like me an atheist a part of the LGBT community and I am sure they like me take every bit of pride in that label But for the others those of faith within the LGBT community this is a slap in the face to their faith and spiritualitySo in answer to the allegorical question it looks like misunderstanding lack of acceptance discrimination disgust and questionable morality I wish this was the only transgression the person behind this article acquiesced but unfortunately it did not stop there Assuming this Pastor has read through the biblical literature it would seem as though their understanding of reality including the fact that cultural evolution has overwhelmed faiths of all types is lost on the pastor Over time all faiths and practices evolve with the cultures surrounding them I challenge anyone to find a religion belief or faith that has not changed As an example off the top of my head in keeping with the modern day culture of science technology and discovery the Dali Lama said If science proves some belief of Buddhism wrong then Buddhism will have to change Yet the author states For the Christian changing Gods laws in Scripture by popular opinion makes as much sense as changing Gods laws in nature it seems to beg the question to hermeneutics regarding the idea of context and audience is paramountcy This has an implication that as we are not the original readers that much of what is in the religious texts is not to be taken as direction in the modern era as the context has changed and with it the faith and church as well  Take Leviticus  as example Do not cut your bodies for the dead and do not mark your skin with tattoos I am the Lord This is not to mention eating pork or lobster wearing clothing of differing threads and working on Sundays For the audience of the era this was a method of separating their culture with the Pagan cultures surrounding them The faith has changed with popular culture as tattoos are not nearly the taboo they once were Tattoos no longer mean heathen worship and witchcraft they are a mark of individualism and hold deep sometimes even religious meaning even amongst Christians The modern culture sees this command from the lord some would say Gods law has outlived its usefulness Nearly half of all adults today have at least one tatooo and given that nearly  of Americans identify as Christian it would translate that many of those that are tattooed are Christians httpbcctrincolleduweblogsAmericanReligionSurveyARISreportsARISReportpdf This brings be to my next pointThe statement Both homosexuals and Christians are curiously enough organized minority groups attempts to elicit a feeling of solidarity with the LGBT community Unfortunately the statement is a outright lie and a false attempt to empathize As stated above nearly  identify as Christian I am not sure where the idea that the author is a part of a minority with th of the nation behind them At this point I am more than upset at the author I am downright disgustedFinally the tipping point was reached when the author blatantly dismissed LGBT community by implying that homosexuality was some sort of disease akin to alcohol addiction or cancer The method in which the writer expressed their churches generosity and willingness to accept people they clearly feels are lepers and others who are struggling with same sex attraction to varying degrees is repulsive The notion that homosexuality is some form of sickness has led many to and is responsible for creation of the thoroughly debunked disingenuous and dangerous practice of gay conversion therapy The author has left me with a sense that his own message of Christian love is lost on themselves TLDRFamily member posted a disgusting article about a Pastor that tried to convince the readers that his hate is really only christian love

PheaMike,4,13,1rdjl7,15,Red Jacket Defends Native American Religion  by Red JacketThe Senecas members of the Iroquois Confederacy fought on the side of the British in the American Revolution Red Jacket also known as Sagoyewatha was a chief and orator born in eastern New York he derived his English name from his habit of wearing many red coats provided to him by his British allies After the hostilities as the British ceded their territories to the Americans the Senecas and many other Indian peoples faced enormous pressure on their homelands Red Jacket was a critical mediator in relations between the new US government and the Senecas he led a delegation that met with George Washington in  when he received a peace medal that appeared in subsequent portraits of the Indian leader In  a Boston missionary society requested Red Jackets permission to proselytize among the Iroquois settlements in northern New York State Red Jackets forceful defense of native religion below caused the representative to refuse the Indians handshake and announce that no fellowship could exist between the religion of God and the works of the DevilFriend and brother it was the will of the Great Spirit that we should meet together this day He orders all things and he has given us a fine day for our council He has taken his garment from before the sun and caused it to shine with brightness upon us our eyes are opened that we see clearly our ears are unstopped that we have been able to hear distinctly the words that you have spoken for all these favors we thank the Great Spirit and him onlyBrother this council fire was kindled by you it was at your request that we came together at this time we have listened with attention to what you have said You requested us to speak our minds freely this gives us great joy for we now consider that we stand upright before you and can speak what we think all have heard your voice and all speak to you as one man our minds are agreedBrother you say you want an answer to your talk before you leave this place It is right you should have one as you are a great distance from home and we do not wish to detain you but we will first look back a little and tell you what our fathers have told us and what we have heard from the white peopleBrother listen to what we say There was a time when our forefathers owned this great island Their seats extended from the rising to the setting sun The Great Spirit had made it for the use of Indians He had created the buffalo the deer and other animals for food He made the bear and the beaver and their skins served us for clothing He had scattered them over the country and taught us how to take them He had caused the earth to produce corn for bread All this he had done for his red children because he loved them If we had any disputes about hunting grounds they were generally settled without the shedding of much blood But an evil day came upon us your forefathers crossed the great waters and landed on this island Their numbers were small they found friends and not enemies they told us they had fled from their own country for fear of wicked men and come here to enjoy their religion They asked for a small seat we took pity on them granted their request and they sat down amongst us we gave them corn and meat they gave us poison in return The white people had now found our country tidings were carried back and more came amongst us yet we did not fear them we took them to be friends they called us brothers we believed them and gave them a larger seat At length their numbers had greatly increased they wanted more land they wanted our country Our eyes were opened and our minds became uneasy Wars took place Indians were hired to fight against Indians and many of our people were destroyed They also brought strong liquor among us it was strong and powerful and has slain thousandsBrother our seats were once large and yours were very small you have now become a great people and we have scarcely a place left to spread our blankets you have got our country but are not satisfied you want to force your religion upon usBrother continue to listen You say you are sent to instruct us how to worship the Great Spirit agreeably to his mind and if we do not take hold of the religion which you white people teach we shall be unhappy hereafter You say that you are right and we are lost how do we know this to be true We understand that your religion is written in a book if it was intended for us as well as you why has not the Great Spirit given it to us and not only to us but why did he not give to our forefathers the knowledge of that book with the means of understanding it rightly We only know what you tell us about it How shall we know when to believe being so often deceived by the white peopleBrother you say there is but one way to worship and serve the Great Spirit if there is but one religion why do you white people differ so much about it Why not all agree as you can all read the book Brother we do not understand these things We are told that your religion was given to your forefathers and has been handed down from father to son We also have a religion which was given to our forefathers and has been handed down to us their children We worship that way It teaches us to be thankful for all the favors we receive to love each other and to be united We never quarrel about religionBrother the Great Spirit has made us all but he has made a great difference between his white and red children he has given us a different complexion and different customs to you he has given the arts to these he has not opened our eyes we know these things to be true Since he has made so great a difference between us in other things why may we not conclude that he has given us a different religion according to our understanding The Great Spirit does right he knows what is best for his children we are satisfied Brother we do not wish to destroy your religion or take it from you we only want to enjoy our ownBrother you say you have not come to get our land or our money but to enlighten our minds I will now tell you that I have been at your meetings and saw you collecting money from the meeting I cannot tell what this money was intended for but suppose it was for your minister and if we should conform to your way of thinking perhaps you may want some from usBrother we are told that you have been preaching to the white people in this place These people are our neighbors we are acquainted with them we will wait a little while and see what effect your preaching has upon them If we find it does them good makes them honest and less disposed to cheat Indians we will then consider again what you have saidBrother you have now heard our answer to your talk and this is all we have to say at present As we are going to part we will come and take you by the hand and hope the Great Spirit will protect you on your journey and return you safe to your

RamboKirby,24,29,1rcn31,40,As a kid I was FORCED to believe in Santa I didnt want to and I knew he wasnt real Around the age of  I saw my father wrapping gifts I saw him buy about a week prior It was so obvious to my naive eyes that Santa did not exist and that my parents were buying the gifts We didnt even have a chimney and kept the doors locked at night It also didnt help that I always stayed up to see if anyone would enter the houseSo anyway mother had told me to shut my mouth and that I wouldnt get any presents if I did not believe in Santa This lasted until I was a teenager Even as a little kid I said he didnt exist By the time I was  I couldnt help but feel really insulted Why was I expected to believe in him as a teenager As a kid whenever I would rebel against the myth Id get yelled at or even hit A few times I was whacked with the belt for giving good arguments that they were buying the presents and saying I wouldnt buy into their lieThe same thing happened with God I would get forced to go to church as a kid and if I wanted even something as meager as something to eat on the way back mother would go insane One time she threatened to kill us in a car accident because I said I didnt want to go to church anymore scary enough I was in the car on the way back from a Wednesday night at said church I got kicked out on a few Christmass because I said Jesus wasnt born on that day and I didnt like him or his religion I was like  and  when all that happened I remember calling her out when she would flip out and do things like using logic from her own Bible against her She didnt care she would say she was a sinner and take me to Hell if I kept being a Satanist When I was  it changed a bit She would threaten to hurt herself and call the police saying I did it if I did not believe in Gods word Whenever she would go out in public in every conversation shed bring up Jesus and be extremely rude to people who did not share her beliefs Sometimes I wonder if there were any other parents as psychotic as mine especially with the Santa bullshit And they werent the only ones like that my sister and aunt were just as bad I remember my sister said I was a demon when I was a little boy and choked me with a blanket she was  something and I was ,1385305928.0,What is wrong with parents Santa and God sure do warp minds,69,atheism,hot

Geronimou,11,9,1re379,3,Ive been here for a short while now and this subreddit has proven to be quite great filled with rationally thinking people Im here to ask advice for my current situation which is following I am currently an exchange student in United States Michigan and Im from Finland I have been here for three months now and Ive had many experiences both good and bad mostly good However I still have  months left and Im feeling quite homesick The worst thing being here is that my hostfamily is very religious They are YECs devoted Christians and very active members of their church community While they are very heart warming and good people their conservative values are greatly conflicting with my own quite liberal values that I have so far kept for myself Every Sunday feels worse than the one before and I dont really know how much longer I can take this So far the family has not been pushing their religion down my throat but I suspect it is because they think Im theistic like them When I think will I be able to live here for  months longer Im very unsure I have a good time here I like my school and the people there and I enjoy the people here in  general However I miss my family friends pets and the ultimate freedom to do what I want a thing I have actually never experienced before even close to this magnitude By losing ultimate freedom I mean that I cant get to places without one of them giving me a ride and they have tight curfewsSo far my host mother has told me that attending church is not optional for me and Ive thought that what the heck it makes them happy and its only one day per week However they asked me to play guitar in the worship band and having no excuse to decline the request I accepted Now I feel really bad since Im participating in the brainwashing of many young childrenIve been thinking about telling the family that I am not religious but I am not sure what would happen The possibilities are roughly They would be totally fine with it I highly suspect this one We would keep living like this except they would shove their religion down my throat They would no longer want to host me in which case my program coordinator would shelter me until I get a new host family if one is not found I my family get a refund and I get sent homeI do indeed realize that being able to participate in an exchange program is a onceinalifetime chance only few people get to experience and that I should not take it lightly that my decision might lead to my program ending prematurely My parents paid a load of money for this and I already feel bad for that aborting the program would make me very ashamed and I know a lot of people would think bad of me not my parents though theyd just be happy to have me back The reason why I was pointed to such religious family is that in Finland I am officially a member of the church and as reading my application my host family thought I was religious To give you examples of how religious my family is I really dont know are they extremely religious in American standard We bless the food every time we eat together YECs they think evolution is absolutely ridiculous My Hostbrother almost decided to not go out with this girl he had a crush on because she is halfJewish Church every Sunday my hostbrother father and mother are in the churchs worship band we play mostly Hillsongs songs and dragged me into it Sunday school before church youth group in the evening prayer group after school on Wednesdays I dont have to attend the prayer group They are fundamentalists about the bible my other hostbrother constantly keeps searching stuff from the bible that can support his conservative views They dont like it when I say mild swear words such as if I say the movie title Inglorious Bastards or kick your ass instead of kick your butt I hear them just randomly praying at different times of the day My brothers room is full of religious stuff on the wallI hope you get the picture of what kind of people they are If not think about the family in Tenacious D where Jack Black escapes fromSo far Ive been thinking about telling about my beliefs to my hostsister who is pretty much the one I would consider least religious of these people and ask her how she thinks her family would react to the matterIt is also possible that I am simply so homesick that I try to find excuses to sabotage my own exchange year just to get home earlier I dont really know What I do know is that I dont think I can attend the church for six more months They also have many youth events for the church that they are expecting I would attend happening in February and I really dont want to take part in themtldr I am an exchange student Should I do something cause I cant stand the religiousness of my host family,1385346954.0,Asking ratheism for advice in my situation,12,atheism,hot

grifthesniper,14,7,1rdxhf,1,Gents and ladies I decided to be Atheist on my own knowledge and choosing and declared my belief  or lack of  to my Catholic mother and later that day my Atheist father who divorced my mother five years ago To cover some background and just to vent my compiled lifetime of confusion Im going to start from as far back as I can remember When I was a small boy probably around the age of six I began taking interest in the news I glued my eyes on the headlines as often as possible and quickly was exposed to the media and shenanigans that are frequently pasted in bold lettering on the screen Among things like sex movie stars divorcing their spouses violent crimes I found interest in politics At this time around in  George W Bush was on the television having some sort of debate with John Kerry Me blissfully ignorant to politics and what a Democrat was or what a Republican was I curiously asked my mother  Since my fathers work takes him away from home for lengthy periods of time Mum who is John Kerry I asked this because she had been talking smack against Kerrys platform and campaign with her friend and praised Bush So naturally I was curious She told me John Kerry is an evil man who wants to take us away from God and let us burn in hell You must never trust a Democrat he will always try and cheat and swindle you So being a dumb little kid absorbed this statement like a sponge As time proceeded I began asking things like What does the bible say will happen to the people on TV who are divorcing their wives And my mother would reply with something along the lines they would be judged by God and sent to hell So I grew a little went a few grades with the statements my mom had said to me In order to go to heaven I must follow the ten commandments to the letter I must never believe or say anything that contradicts the bibles teachings If I did something bad I must tell my mom right away and go to confession the next Sunday However I had as a child always wondered what it would be like to be the dragon with two heads male and female from the childrens show Dragon Tales I fantasized about it obsessively for a a few months wondering how it had gone about its daily life if it had both a male and female part And from there my curiosity about the opposite gender went skyrocketing It wasnt perversion it was genuine curiosity I wanted to know how girls worked and why However I had the sayings of my mother looming over my head at the same time If I looked at porn or interacted with anything that had sexual nature in it I would be sentenced to hell for eternity and a half This among other things like little white lies that all kids tell began to psychologically compile Eventually I felt so bad that I had gone against my mothers words that I stopped confessing anything to the priest at confession Every hour of every day I worried about going to hell for my actions This I also obsessed over but not in a similar way as earlier I began having vivid dreams about different ways that God would smite me and send me to hell Then during the day I would worry that something would cause my death and I would go the opposite direction than the pearlywhite gates when my soul passed on As years went by I became trapped in a cycle of worry which led to depression at a very young age Fastforward a few years to about  I witnessed my Mom and Dad have a vicious fight over something my memory fails me at this particular moment so I do not recall what exactly it was over Though the bottom of the line I saw my father pack a suitcase and march out the door and I didnt see him for a few weeks He came back eventually and declared that he wanted a divorce from my mother Over a painfully long two years the process went on at a snail pace I asked my mom why are you and dad getting divorced She told me that my father was an evil person and had sinned to greatly for her to acknowledge him According to her he had strayed from the ten commandments and was going to hell After they divorced my dad nearly disappeared from my life and I only saw him one weekend a month He sank into a depression which impacted me Around this time I had started to stray away from religion myself I loathed church and sundayschool with a fiery passion I ignored everything that went on when I had to sit through mass I didnt want anything to do with Catholicism Fastforward some more I had just turned sixteen I was a depressed and lonely individual an outcast in my local school I didnt have too many friends only a small group on online gamers and a couple of band kids in my class I started to date a girl in the freshman class who was very nice and accepted me for who I was We spend two of seven days a week together and talked as much as possible Things went wonderfully till summer came along I had taken her out to the movies in my car and decided to stop at the lake on the way home to take a walk under the stars I brought along a blanket and when we had found a nice spot with a clear view of the sky we set it down and layed back and talked about life However we didnt keep track of time and I was thirty minutes late back home My mom scolded me severely and sent me off to bed which I gladly did The next morning my brother and brotherinlaw went with along with me to go to the theater and my BIL asked me if I had done anything with my girlfriend last night Sarcastically I replied in a fitting tone yeah suuure Later that day my mom asked me to join her in the living room and she began to interrogate me She had snooped through my car and found my blanket and accused me of having sex with my girlfriend I denied it and stuck to my story However she said that a parent had certain instincts and that God was telling her that I was lying She refused to accept my answer though I gave it over and over again Eventually she took my car keys from my hand disconnected my internet connection and confiscated my cell phone She refused to let me go out of the house unless for grocery shopping or church I had to wake up at six every morning to read scripture for every hour and was told that I was a disgrace to her and the lord I left on court order to live with my Dad for a month and a half He understood my story and accepted me with open arms into his new home When I returned to my moms after summer was mostly over I said that I didnt believe in god and if she couldnt respect that then I would legally remove myself from her house when I turn  She went nuts telling me that I was going to go to hell for disobeying her that I was a worthless and ungrateful child and that she regretted bringing me into this worldSo here I am ratheism I am grateful that you have taken the time to hear me rant and I would appreciate any advice on how to deal with my situation She refuses to acknowledge that I have the power to make decisions on my own and until I turn  I have to hunker down and keep lowTLDR My

NotFreeAdvice,18,5,1rd1yo,1,First off why do we care to address this issue  Everyone in this subreddit probably understands that religion is not scientific  However there are many religious people that do not understand this  They will attempt to argue that religion can be scientific  In the worst case scenario they then attempt to influence public policy with this misconception  Working under the assumption that it is respectful personal interactions with the religious that are most likely to change minds what is needed is a very concise way of showing them that they are incorrect  I feel that the best way to do this is to show that religion cannot even formulate the most basic tools of science  the hypothesis  The general idea is to show that the traditional assertion of religion the existence of a god or gods is not a wellformed scientific hypothesis  This is for two reasons such assertions are neither falsifiable nor are they testable  We can examine these both in turnThe religious position is not falsifiableThe traditional religious assertion is that fill in the blank gods exists  For instance in Christianity the idea is that the Jewish god exits  However this is not a falsifiable statement  The reason is that one can never prove that this god does not exist  Consider a different example  The statement lime green monkeys with  hands exist  You can never prove that this statement is false  Even if you searched the entire world and did not find such a monkey you could not be certain that you didnt just miss the one such monkey that exists  Thus there is always the possibility that the monkey exists but you didnt find it  This is just a restatement of the black swan effect but it is an important point to return to in debates with the religious  In order to be a wellformed hypothesis you need to either provide more details ie a  handed green monkey exists in my backyard and can be seen today at pm  Or you need to reformulate the statement as a negative ie  handed green monkeys do not exist  Both of these statements are clearly falsifiable  For the reasons the atheistic position is a scientific one There is no god is a falsifiable statement  The religious position is not testableAgain the traditional description of gods  especially in Christianity  is not testable  The god itself is stipulated to be unobservable directly and thus cannot be verified  Thus no test can be constructed  Unless a religious person can formulate a plausible test that would lead to possible falsification of their statement it cannot be counted as scientific  When debating a religious person this should be stressed  Asked them for a specific test of their statement that would lead to falsification of their position  In the absence of such a test their position cannot be scientific  Again the atheistic statement can be made testable fairly readily  If one takes the statement there is no god and substitutes any particular god within that statement then all that must be demonstrated is that specific god does exist  which in turn negates the original atheistic position  In summary the atheistic position is both falsifiable and testable which renders it scientific  The religious position is neither falsifiable nor testable which renders it ascientific  When debating religious folk  especially regarding what should be taught in science classes  this is a good tactic to use  These two simple points stress the fact that they are forwarding a position that is simply not scientific  Anyway I welcome any thoughts on this line of reasoning  ,1385319178.0,A simple strategy for demonstrating why the traditional religious position is not scientific but the atheistic position is scientific,6,atheism,hot

NoirOrioN,10,5,1rbzgi,10,I know that for many of you this is not a new story and is perhaps slightly hackneyed but I feel the need to put my thoughts into writing Today I told my parents that I am an atheist After years of living and growing up in a strong Roman Catholic family I felt it was necessary to gain some closure on this chapter in my life So minus lingering feelings of guilt I decided it was time to share with my parentsThe conversation started with me saying Alright so I need to have a serious conversation with you guys and Im not entirely sure how this is going to go then me taking a moment to buck up and finally say the words out loud I am an atheist Now Ive got to hand it to them they werent entirely dismissive but disappointed is a word that comes to mind For the first time in my life I made my mother cry which was hard but I had prepared myself for that and then started the long conversationI know that compared to some of you Ive gotten off easy It didnt end in a shouting match and my parents still love me as much as they did moments before me saying that I was an atheist My mother insists that I am wrong that she will pray for me and that shes upset that Im missing out And my father cant wait for the day when like Paul I am struck from my horse but they both accept who I am and are prepared to live and let live So from one godless heathen to another thank you all for sharing your stories your questions and your insights on this subreddit They have given me the laughter and support I have needed to continue moving forward For the first time in my life I feel like I have made a decision based solely on my own needs And as difficult as it was to bring this up with my parents I am grateful that I can now live honestly and sincerely I look forward to cherishing the rest of this life my only lifeTLDR As an atheist who just recently told his roman catholic parents the truth I thank you fellow atheist for reading my mildly interesting story,1385269103.0,From one godless heathen to another,15,atheism,hot

dothebootydo,23,4,1rb7cm,8,I have this friend named C She was a pretty good friend of mine during childhood although we drifted a part in high school and we havent seen each other since then She was always a very nice girl and even though she was very religious she was never pushy or too public about it Our parents are still friends so I get updates about her life from time to time through the grapevine About  years ago she moved to a poor South American country to volunteer as a counselor for a Christian organization that helps women who are sexually exploited I think its a pretty noble cause and I think its awesome that shes actually out there doing something to genuinely help those women We havent been in contact for over  years but a couple of days ago she messaged me on Facebook and asked if I wanted to meet up for coffee to catch up because she is going to be back in the states for the first time over the holidays I said yes Just now I received a mass email from her announcing that shes been offered a job at the Christian nonprofit organization for a marketing position that shes very excited about At the bottom of the email it says she needs to raise  of her salary and living expenses and that she looks forward to sharing with each recipient about how they can become a partner in the ministry through monthly giving When I went to the organizations website the About Us section repeatedly mentions how their ministries are dedicated to making sure the poor know about King Jesus and his Kingdom and some of their core values include submission to Jesus celebrating suffering as a sacrifice to Jesus etc Now I feel totally conflicted and Im pretty sure shes invited me to coffee to ask for a financial contribution On one hand I feel like providing a safe house financial support and counseling to female victims is amazing and Id like to support her efforts to do that On the other hand the website sounds much less servicebased and much more spreading the word based which I frown upon And lastly  What kind of nonprofit organization hires someone and then asks them to come up with their own salary and living expenses Especially asking for donations from their own personal contacts and social network I have several friends who work for nonreligiously affiliated nonprofits domestically and all of them are provided a salary In my gut something seems really wrong about the salary situation but I just cant pinpoint exactly why that makes me so uncomfortableHas anyone experienced a similar situation Or have any advice on how I can approach this tactfully ,1385244190.0,I feel conflicted about a missionary friend I havent seen in years We are supposed to meet up for coffee but Im pretty sure she is going to ask me for a donation Thoughts,12,atheism,hot

yanks,15,6,1raoar,2,I want to start out by saying that I consider myself an agnostic However I go to a Jesuit Catholic High School which consists of many different faiths but the vast majority are Catholic That doesnt necessarily matter much but it may help in illustrating my perspective to you allOver the summer I was invited to my friends well call him Dan surprise party and everything was awesome Everyone was nice and all but his parents particularly stood out My first impression of them was that they were EXTREMELY good people They seemed to genuinely care for and expressed interest in getting to know me Now fast forward to a few days ago Homecoming is around the corner and people are asking others to it I didnt mention earlier that Dan has a sister who is a year younger than he is She was asked by another of our friends who happens to be an atheist well call him Randy So she accepted his invitation  they both arent too fond of each other but both want to go to Homecoming so yeahI hear about this and dont think much of it until I hear Dan talking about what his parents said about Randy Keep in mind I had the highest respect for Dans parents as I thought they were good people but this wasnt so Dan told me his parents did not approve of Randy going with Dans sister to Homecoming only because he is an atheist Dans parents also said I dont care if he Randy is a Jew Christian Hindu or even Muslim If you dont believe in GOD then dont interact with usI was absolutely livid while hearing this because I couldnt believe that people like Dans parents could be so myopic about religious preference and go far as to say what they did which included he will enter our house through the front door and leave out the back window For people who follow a religion of tolerance turning the other cheek and The Golden Rule I am appalled that they are so oppressive to someone who simply doesnt believe the same thing as theyI would like to know what Reddit thinks about this and thats why Im getting this off my chest today,1385228901.0,Friends parents arent the people I thought they were,8,atheism,hot

DepressedAndDecieved,24,9,1r92wd,10,Before I delve into the bulk of this post I feel that you fellow Redditors may need some background I am younger than twenty and attend a local college I am not above the average weight for my age I have recently tested my IQ to be well above normal for individuals my age with a recently designed test I have not confined to the internet and solitude with a bag of chips my entire life I am using a throwaway account and Reddits karma does not matter to me  this is a very serious post I seek you because I need help Forgive me if I write more than you may deem necessary This is my story I was born to a conservative Christian family in the mids My early years were spent living in a smalltown neighborhood regularly attending church on Sundays and Saturdays As my parents were relatively poor I didnt have all that much to play with Lego sets were a novelty I remember those years as my best  I had friends in school my parents were loving and their arguments few and fun was always somehow wherever it was needed I remember countless times when I would go to the park with my sister and mother We would walk through the woods mom telling us fantastic tales ranging from the simple childish Mickey and Minnie Mouse stories to even more wonderfully fantastic ones I was fascinated by nature  the trees the wildlife She would chase us around the playgrounds join in on our silly games of medieval roleplay and spin us around on the cold metal carousels These are the memories that bring tears to my eyesAs the years went on we moved to a larger nearby city My parents were earning more money My father had been promoted at work Our new home was in an area of the city generally populated by older individuals There was no one my age to play with My kindergarten teacher hated me as a new student interrupting her school year My parents slowly seemed to loose interest in parenting Nightmares plagued my dreams always some situation where my parents werent there They couldnt help me and I was being dragged away by some unseen force to some evil monsters grasp or we were chased by some evil being  often wolves  and my mother was just a step away a few yards ahead Other dreams involved other obstacles such as steep hills or steep staircases always a step behind or unable to go any further My father was never present his presence only hinted at by a few of the dreams I could never quite find a group of friends to fit in with I picked up a friend here and there but I could never come to associate myself with a larger group This has not changed There was always something else in the way  at the time these kids had seen the big films of the day they had cable televisions at home and understood sports They didnt really care for nature After a while visits to the park with mom became less and less frequent and the stories more shallow Playgrounds became a thing where I could escape from the dreary classroom environment Recess was my fun Now that my parents had more money they bought me more toys Lego sets became my life I came to find a substitute for moms stories in the Lego sets Entire worlds were dreamed up conceived over the span of weeks and months I dont remember how I obtained a subscription but the occasional Lego Club magazines were like monthly Christmas presents I never had the opportunity to play any of the popular video games of the day I only knew Mario from a PC adaptation my uncle gave me My dad eventually gave in and either purchased or borrowed a few of the Lego titles that existed at the time  Lego LOCO Lego Chess and Lego Island I did not see Star Wars until I was sixteen I still held my passion for the medieval era during this time borrowing books from the library about knights and chivalry staring completely floored at the elaborate pieces of armor that they wore At home I would dream up elaborate castles fantasizing about the wonderful adventures these knights must have had I could recite the entire legend of King Arthur by heart  and not just the modern adaptations of the story I still am fascinated by itWhen I was attending first grade a teacher saw potential in me I attended a third grade reading class for the remainder of that year reading stories such as Charlottes Web and I enjoying it Over time the close attachment that I had to my parents began to fade By the time I had moved on to third grade I was reading chapter books such as The Hardy Boys series and The Boxcar Children books Gary Paulsens White Fox was one of my favorites Things changed drastically again around sixth grade My mother and father began to argue more My mother began to take the abuse out on us primarily me The change seemed so drastic I will not go into any details here I will not define the physical or emotional nature When I was in the seventh grade my English teacher spoke to my mother at a parent orientation event about a particular assignment that I had slacked off on I submitted the work but my writing was awfully sloppy My mom came home furious and convinced that I was a drug addict I have never to this day taken any drugs for recreational purposes I have not tasted tried or consumed any alcohol or smoked tobacco to this day It took me weeks to convince her that I was not a drug addict On another occasion with me on the brink of consciousness she called me what translates to a useless work donkey This may sound humorous in English but it was far from that I was afraid to come home from school The once loving mother that I had as a child was someplace else This was not her If I were to say that I hated my mother or my father that would be a lie I still love both of them dearly I would give up any of the baubles that come with money just to bring back those old times so that they could be different They still remain the same old ultraconservative Christians They attend church regularly dragging me along though I have lost all interest in religion I began to look to other people and found very little that was spiritual Preachers come out to speak and draw upon examples of miracles yet they fail to present any proof or evidence when asked Pastors turn around and abuse the very deeds for which they claim to stand I have red the Christian Bible and I have found nothing more than good words and wise sayings The Koran was no different Please understand that I do not offer any judgment on those who continue to believe and follow those religions earnestly  I do not share the same sentiments The one they call God never rescued me no matter how many times I believing the words asked and it will be given unto you prayed for it My parents remain disinterestedToday I considered suicide What used to guide me was the belief that somewhere a God exists Someday that God would help me He would save me My parents taught me that atheists were deceived by the devil My church agreed I was taught that gays and lesbians were also deceived and perverted by the devil My church agreed I was taught that God punished liars yet I saw that seemingly without toll all around me My church insisted Eventually I came to the realization that not everything may be quite as we are taught it seems Going on a quest to fill in my lifelong blanks I spoke with homosexual individuals and came to realize that they are not psychologically different from those who are not I have observed poverty and class structure along with politics After having a thorough discussion with several classmate atheists I came to the startling realization that secular thought had far more substance than the Godless perversion and devilguided thought that my church spoke of I needed to understand both sides to fairly form an opinion and so I decided to research the topic I uncovered stories and history on the likes of the Bibles first human  Adam and his first wife Lilith and how strangely the story is avoided in the King James translations That was in the least my first eyeopener As a formerly religious individual I was taught that God created only two human beings  one from the dirt and another from the flesh of the first At first I thought that maybe both science AND religion were correct What if certain things were just symbolism for a greater meaning that those individuals simply did not understand Books changed hands and were purchased Pages turned Eventually I was convinced This quest has lasted for the duration of these past two years I thank you ratheism as you have provided a foundation for my research I have found enough to satisfy and confirm my doubts As aforementioned I mean no disrespect to those who choose to believe Today I sat in my car before heading home It was a peaceful moment serene and beautiful with the trees waving overhead and the cosmos further still It was almost surreal Depressing Why do we exist What purpose do we no more than a complex mass of cells with seemingly no purpose other than ecological substantiation and selfpreservation have in the greater sphere of the universe  Why should we continue to live and thrive if there is no greater purpose of salvation The thoughts strayed towards my past I had no motive to return home  there was hardly anything to return to I could have ended my life there and left others to continue their own miserable existence Driving home there were hundreds of opportunities for my life to just end A second here a truck there It seemed like a very viable thought but my curiosity kept me alive After much further focus on the idea of suicide I have as I hope banished the thought If there are other atheists out there then there inherently must be some sort of explanation or reasoning to approach this How did you fellow atheists approach  these questions of existence How did you deal with the realization that quite nearly all youve believed was if you were not born to atheist parents false How did you deal with this sense of insignificance the idea that everything needs a beginning and an end I thank you for sparing your time and if you so choose giving your responses Edit tldr   Had abusive childhood with

fuckitsowhat,237,96,1r5t8r,338,This happened about four months ago but I guess I wasnt ready for the internet to know and to get either criticismsupport obviously the criticism was the main concern I have a boyfriend whom I had been dating for roughly three years at the beginning of last summer My parents have always hated him because hes an atheist they are EXTREMELY religious and not afraid to disagree with people not in a rude way but just to disagree In his family it was okay to agree to disagree in my family it was not I had been away at college for a year and after finally turning  my boyfriend and I decided to become sexually active together This was at the very beginning of the school year Everything was super great we would see each other about every other weekend and not having my parents hovering around our relationship made it a lot of fun Once summer came around I had to move back home because I wasnt financially stable enough to move out The restrictions and nagging about my boyfriend came back the moment I moved back in Hes terrible for you he has no respect for authority hes an atheist etc Because of the rules my parents had put on when and where I could see him he couldnt be over if both my parents werent home I wasnt allowed to go over to his place unless it was over at his parents and we were hardly allowed to touch each other without my mother or father yelling at me I would spend the weekend at a friends house This went on just fine until July th came along I told my parents I was going to spend four days with a friend who lived about three hours away near where I had gone to school my boyfriend lived about an hour away They told me that was fine but were acting sort of fishy about it I got into my car and noticed a slip of paper sitting on the dash board with some numbers written on it My mother is a real estate broker and so I figured it was someones number she had written down I did not realize that the number written was my gas mileage until five days laterThe day after I came back from visiting my friend my mother tells me she needs to talk to me Pulls out the slip of paper and I see that there is now a second line of numbers under the first She reads them off and says So how far away again was it to your friends house She proceeds to tell me that she doesnt understand how I could lie like that that she could not believe I would hurt god by lying to them how I could justify knowing that I was doing so many wrong things she had finally assumed by now that we were banging I couldnt take it anymore I was so sick of hiding that I finally just told her about my being an atheist Later that night after I returned from work my parents had company over for dinner and my father had come home My parents asked their company to go upstairs while they talk to me My father starts on one of his yelling rants Tells me to leave the keys my cell phone go pack only the things that I paid for in my room and that I was never to talk to my younger siblings until they are  one is  and the other  He then tells me that this is what my atheism brings me and I hope that Im happy I go into my room pack up two bins and a backpack of stuff push it to the other side of the town that I live in ask a friend if I can borrow her phone and have been living with my boyfriend since I have not talked to my younger siblings since or my father My mother has emailed me a couple times about god and I believe looking for an apology I miss my siblings tremendously and cannot imagine being a parent that disowns their child for lying about where she is going and being an atheist Turns out Im a rather self sufficient adult and minus not being able to see my siblings being kicked out is one of the best things that has ever happened to meTLDR My parents kicked me out and wont let me talk to my younger siblings since they found I was an atheist and was sleeping over at my boyfriends place,1385063322.0,Well ratheism it finally happened I am ready to tell you all about how my parents disowned me,434,atheism,hot

crbreingan,1,4,1r8tk5,1,There has been a lot of talk about the new movie coming out called Gods Not Dead I cant watch the trailer in full because it is such a horrendous misrepresentation of what really happens in situations like that Ive never met an educated person that hates God in the way that is described in the movie trailer But thats not really the point of this postIm still waiting for the Unbelievers to come out The one with Richard Dawkins and Lawrence Krauss It looks like a good documentary and I am very interested in seeing what points they makeBut I propose a movie to counter the Gods Not Dead nonsense I saw an article a few weeks ago I cant remember where I saw the article or who wrote it but the author analyzed the GND trailer and he made the point that the professor in the trailer is not a typical atheist he actually more resembles the God of the good bookJealous angry and spiteful That got me thinking Since most Christians dont actually know anything about what is contained in their bible we should inform them The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction jealous and proud of it a petty unjust unforgiving controlfreak a vindictive bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser a misogynistic homophobic racist infanticidal genocidal filicidal pestilential megalomaniacal sadomasochistic capriciously malevolent bully Richard DawkinsIf you were to put the bible into a modern movie like a Disney film God would undoubtedly be the evil dictator ruling over his kingdom with an iron fist Ordering his people to rape and kill anyone who does not believe in the king almighty There are so many examples of what we would consider to be awful moral standards in the bible yet Christians still believe its a common argument that you cant have morality without God I think we can show them that you cant be moral with God I kindof picture Lord Farquaad from Shrek sitting on his throne and telling Job Sorry that I killed your whole family I had a bet with the King from down the road Anyway heres a new family And the look of confusion on the persons face as a new wife and kids come out from behind a curtain smiling and waving while the servents applaud There are so many scenes from the bible that just work in my head to show that God is not good but the opposite of good The only bad part of the story is that the villain wins The evil dictator is still in charge of countless lives Millions of people living in his kingdom as in still believe in him are willing to worship him and many will still die for him So the movie doesnt get a happy ending Not yet anyway not until god is truly dead in our society ,1385155706.0,Antitheist movie idea,5,atheism,hot

anotherbaldguy,21,17,1r57yq,56,I saw this article referenced in a much more recent news tidbit and it made me outragedhttpenwikipediaorgwikiMeccagirlsschoolfireI just imagine the fear that must have been in these girls being in a burning building and then being forced to stay inside because they werent wearing a specific piece of clothing and dying because of it I mean bad people will always find a reason to be bad people but its things like organized religion that gives them a vessel and excuses them from being punished or brought to justice for horrible actions like thisAnd its for this reason that religions HAVE to be demystified and brought down from their pedestal as being things that cant be made fun of or ridiculed Being offended should never be enough justification for killing or hurting people Im thinking of the whole muhammad cartoons thing that caused so much turmoil I dont care how holy anyone thinks some guy in history is they are not and should not be immune to critique The other thing I cant stand is the slave mentality of it all Just this constantly wanting to follow and worship and be led by somethingI see it as  waysa A personal creator doesnt exist Maybe an impersonal one exists or none exists at all well truly never knowb A personal creator personal meaning they specifically made us humans with purpose etc does exist And created humans and everything else with the infinite intricacies and complexities of the mind and body I mean the brain for example is absolutely ridiculous If miracles really exist the brain would be one This quote really blows my mind and puts it into perspectiveThe brain named itselfSo youre telling me that some entity gave us free will a voice box to communicate an ever expanding brain and ability to consume knowledge and make decisions and most important question the reasons for our existence but wants us to forgo ALL of this and blindly worship and pray and constantly remind it how great it is How patheticly selfish and arrogant a god would that be  How could anyone WANT to worship such a godPlease Im just tired of giving due diligence to people and cultures and religions that just dont deserve it and should be distant memory rather than on everyday news,1385049035.0,I need to get this off my chest And if anyone has a coherent response I sincerely want it because I dont see the  sides of this,73,atheism,hot

merchantco,28,8,1r6om7,8,The ridiculous statements and claims made by the Bible and other religious texts are still regarded as fact by many As part of a country with a  literacy rate and an  secondary school rate I am both baffled and appalled Almost onethird of Americans claim that the Bible is literally true How could so many people in an educated nation such as America believe that the fables and myths in an ancient text are true It all begins with critical thinking Without basic critical thinking you cant think for yourself and thus you are more likely to believe the ridiculous things others tell you I think that we would be surprised to see how few Americans have proper critical thinking skills A st century American with proper critical thinking skills a high school education and decent intelligence probably wouldnt believe in the Bible Next there is religious indoctrination in youth Young children do not have critical thinking skills They treat the words of their parents as gospel and do not evaluate their parents words for themselves Young children also do not understand basic logic For this reason most young children believe in Santa Claus and many of them believe in magic This makes children the target of religious indoctrination When parents teach their child about God and the Bible that child is likely to believe the religious beliefs taught to them for the rest of their life Brainwashing is another reason for religions survival When a person goes to church on Sunday over and over and over and over again that person is being subjected to an onslaught of religious verses beliefs psalms sayings and so on Eventually the mind yields completely and that aforementioned person becomes more or less brainwashed As you read this keep in mind that brainwashing is far too harsh a term for the context Im referring to this form of mind control as brainwashing because the effects of brainwashing and the effects of going to church every Sunday seem very similar Im not that this was the evil intent of the churchEffort is another important factor Changing your religious beliefs requires an enormous amount of effort Many theists and atheists for the sake of objectivity arent willing to take the effort to look over the facts again and come to a different conclusion Take a look at the following scenario youre a Christian adult and youve gone to Church every sunday for the last twenty years You were indoctrinated by your parents as a child and have held their religious beliefs ever since One day you meet a man who holds substantial evidence that God does not exist Will you accept these factsThe answer is no Believing something for your entire life and then suddenly believing the complete opposite is very difficult Few Americans can make such a drastic change in their beliefsAnother important factor is wishful thinking Yes I wish that there was a God in the sky and an afterlife for those who deserve it but that doesnt make it true Many people believe in a deity simply because they wish and hope that all of the nonsense in religious texts such as the Bible is true THE SOLUTIONEvery single American should be given a MANDATORY course dedicated to critical thinking This would include logical fallacies an explanation of how bias works and where to find it and how to make decisions without being influenced by others Thanks for reading Feel welcome to add more reasons in the comment section Ill gladly incorporate them ,1385084372.0,Why God is Still Alive in the Modern and Educated World,16,atheism,hot

rainsonata,6,4,1r72td,4,I know its common to find posts about Christian raised people coming out as agnostic but Im a strange case  My family raised me as a Buddhist and I came out as agnostic a year ago  I find it fascinating how a lot of agnostics and atheists choose to turn to Buddhism because it shares a lot of beliefs but for me its different  When I came out as agnostic to my family my parents didnt acknowledge it at all  They denied that I said it and then they spammed my email with links about Buddhism  When it was clear that I wasnt going to convert back they tried to talk to me at every chance about how everyone should have a religion and that no one can live without one  I calmly told them that not everyone needed a religion  What was true for them may not be true for others  They were furious when I said that  My parents then interrogated me about what did I think happen in the afterlife and I equally calmly told them that I was not sure and that no one was certain about the aspects of the afterlife and if the afterlife existed  After I had a talk with my mom about how I promised that I would bury her the Buddhist way because it was her wish I thought the agnostic problem was over  I was never so wrong  My dad continued to deny my agnosticism and my mom went back to forcing Buddhism down my throat  My parents kept dragging me to the Buddhist temples and forced me to pray at home and at family parties  I had to fake the prayers and I always reminded them that I didnt want to go to the temples    I am sick and tired of my family not taking any of my opinions seriously  I have been agnostic my whole life and only decided recently to come out  I forced myself into Buddhism at the first semester of college because I was depressed and I needed something to cling onto but then I realized that I didnt really believe in it and that I was simply using it as a fake sense of hope My parents never take anything I say with weight and view me as below them  Nothing I every say matters because they insist that they are always right  Their logic is that older means smarter and wiser therefore they are always right  My opinions arent worth taking note of and they dont respect my lack of belief  Im still living with them because my college is nearby and for financial reasons  My mom thinks its just a phase and that I will come back one day while my dad thinks Im stupid for not believing like him   Whenever I try to explain to my parents that I am agnostic because I am indifferent about religion my mom keep popping in the story of how my uncle called himself atheist and then converted back to Buddhism after his wife had a miscarriage  She then continues on about how my uncles children would pray and bow around the house and then complains about why my cousins were better than me  My parents take Buddhism to extremes where they view it more of a religion than a philosophy  They make me go to the temple and pray when I clearly tell them that I do not want to  My family is Vietnamese so my parents make me pray to Buddha and other gods at home when I have made it clear that I dont pray and that it doesnt follow my beliefs  They believe that if they pray to the fortune god good things will happen to them financially  My mom likes to read the Buddhist equivalent to the Bible and likes to quote it to me which annoys me a lot  Buddhism is supposed to be about finding enlightenment and accepting that suffering is a part of life and that reincarnation is part of that cycle of suffering  This concept is ok with me but then my mom nitpicks at the smaller details and those details dont agree with me such as how apparently if you did a bad deed in your past life but you were still somewhat good you were incarnated as a woman because a woman is worse than a man  I cannot make myself follow a religion that downgrades women like that  I do not believe in the fortune god or any other god and I do not view Buddha as a god  I dont think a lot of people will respond to this post because its long and because it involves Buddhism not a very common religion people escape from  I would like some advice on how I can get my parents to accept me being agnostic  My parents act like I am soulless because I have no religion and they dont understand that this is my belief  They claim that I am agnostic because of peer pressure an excuse my mom likes to apply for everything in front of her  Peer pressure was never an issue for me and peer pressure would never easily change my beliefs  I hate it that my parents view me as insignificant in terms of beliefs and that they think that I am easily manipulated by the opinions of others      ,1385095085.0,A strange case of a Buddhist coming out as agnosticwhich didnt work Still forced to go to the temple and unacknowledged,8,atheism,hot

Evenger,64,56,1r2iim,200,I just thought Id make a little post about how I came out with my atheism to my Christian family and how they reacted Im hoping that doing this will encourage others in a similar position to do the same Ive been homeschooled since I was  or  my parents pulled us out of the public system not because of religion but because we were getting bullied and the system neglected it entirely Because my entire family was Christian we had a lot of Christian curriculum This included reading the bible reading Christian history and reading science books that came from a Christian standpoint ie biology amp physics with a Creator Now just because we were homeschooled doesnt mean we were sheltered quite the opposite actually My parents gave us every opportunity to join any activities or programs we could Because we werent sheltered like most homeschooled kids and because I showed a large interest in computers astronomy amp science in general at the age of  I got a computer connected to the internet in my room This was my entire world This was the turning point in my life I started browsing the web going to different sites taking in everything I found that there was so much information available at my finger tips and since I was interested in astronomy I started doing more research on it This of course led me to The Big Bang Theory and Evolution of course I knew of these subjects but Theyre just lies put there by the devil trying to make you stray from the Lord Well I eventually stumbled upon Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking I was blown away I had to know more I had to watch more read more I felt a need for this information on the subject of how everything came to be I watched dozens of documentaries read countless books and then I realized science had more evidence than Christianity and I found myself second guessing everything I was ever taught up until that point Im not sure when it even happened really Just one day I woke up and decided I no longer believed what had been drilled into my head for so longI told my family I was an atheist  or  months ago after being a closest atheist for nearly a year My dad wouldnt even really talk to me for a day or two only to say he was disappointed My mother was a little better which honestly surprised me though she always wanted to argue with me over beliefs which I hated because I honestly just dont care what others believe Youre free to believe in a giant spaghetti monster as your God as long as you mind your own business about it Anyway she eventually stopped that after a week or two My older brother sort of mocked me any time he could up until I threatened him unless he stopped it My younger brother just doesnt give a shit hes kind of like me in his opinion of peoples beliefs After a day or two my dad started talking to me though basically ignoring the fact that I came out which is fine by me My extended family hasnt said anything to me directly about it but Im not sure what they say when Im not aroundNow Im  starting college in January for Computer Science and for the most part my life is back together My mother makes the occasional joke especially with Christmas right around the corner like Atheists dont celebrate Christmas I know that sounds cold but she says it like shes joking I brush it off as simply her way of dealing with it Id rather not fight her about it Anyway that was my little post and my first worthwhile post on Reddit If you have any questions or youre considering telling your family Id be glad to offer any advice I can TLDR I told my Christian family Im Atheist it all worked out in the end,1384967094.0, years old homeschooled and finally told my Christian family Im atheist,256,atheism,hot

thetarofgui,38,7,1r3erq,2, As a sort of philosophical theist Id note just a couple of things Evolution it seems to me is as verified a scientific theory as is possible to posit The evidence for it is overwhelming That being said the truth or falsity of biological evolution has no logical bearing at all on the question of Gods existence Its essentially a nonissue Creationists and atheists both too often mistake it for a challenge to the existence of God The reason I take it to be a nonissue is because while it explains a great deal about the origin of life on earth it does little to explain the more elementary questions of universal origins For that youd need to discuss questions and theories of cosmological physics If the universe can be shown to be infinite and eternal in the past there would be no need to posit the existence of God the universe would be selfsufficient However if you take the Big Bang theory as being scientifically true as most cosmologists do then you have a valid sufficient and nearly necessary reason to posit the existence of something at the very least like God If something like the universe and thereby space and time have a beginning then it is finite What is finite is contingent and what is contingent requires something beyond itself upon which it might exist The only thing beyond the finite is the infinite so if the universe is finite it requires something infinite as its cause By inductive reasoning you can assess what sorts of characteristics this cause would have by logical necessity And some folks like myself find that the logical description of that cause is very similar to the traditional characteristics attributed to God ie changelessness timelessness immateriality infinity etc The questions of cosmology precede the questions of biology and are the only real questions so far as I can surmise that really come to bear on the question of Gods existence Anyway just wanted to say that some theists give a great deal of thought to the reason for their belief Hope you dont mind my butting in but these are hugely interesting issues to me,1384987654.0,How do you combat this,9,atheism,hot

LAM,3,6,1r1l05,1,A person Im friends with on Facebook posted a really really extremist article that likened abortion to hiring a hit man to kill ones spouseHe defended his post using quotes Im pretty sure have been taken out of contexthttpimgurcomSblTpj Is there any way you guys could help me say something concise and reasonable to this guyIn order to not give the blog any undeserved hits Ive pasted the article belowWhy We Should Legalize Murder for HireIll be the first to admit it hit men are shady But they are shady because they are doing work that no one else wants to do work that is in fact illegal By labeling contract killing a crime we have obscured the fact that hit men provide a valuable service to societyBourne SightMany women find themselves trapped in unwanted marriages Matrimony severely curtails a womans freedom and husbands can be unreasonably demanding A woman in such a situation is vulnerable She sees only one way out and so she makes the difficult decision to kill her husbandBut the inconvenient truth is that a woman hiring a hit on her husband will likely have to pay tens of thousands of dollars with no guarantee that the kill will actually take place Legalizing the transaction would remove uncertainty Hired guns could be vetted trained and held to professional standards of safety No one wants a hit to go bad Removing the threat of prosecution would drastically lower the cost of contract killings Legalizing murder for hire would bring a sordid industry into the lightWhile divorce may be an attractive alternative to murder for hire in most cases some women do not have the emotional and financial resources to go through a divorce A contested divorce can take more than a year to resolve After attorneys drain the couples finances the woman will be left with little money to get on with her life Additionally a discrete and welltimed hit protects a husband from the pain of discovering that he is no longer wanted A truly skilled assassin can take his target painlessly in an instant without any suffering The end of a marriage can potentially ruin a womans life but if her husband can be taken out quickly and cleanly it can be a new beginning for herMurder for hire is an uncomfortable subject and I personally could never order a hit The better course is to avoid unwanted marriage in the first place Yet this is not a decision that anyone else can make for a woman It is her marriage only she can decide when it must endI realize readers may be hesitant to endorse this proposal but stop to consider the profound way that the legalization of abortion has taken away the stigma against a woman who wants to kill her child Abortion was once considered murder and thus could only be obtained secretly and at great risk to women Now our country celebrates women who exercise their choice to kill their family members Why shouldnt we extend this right and give women the choice to kill their partnersThe author is the web and publications editor of A Divinity School in Birmingham Alabama where she is active in the prolife movement,1384929277.0,What can I say Is there anything I can say Help for really extremist post on murder for hire,7,atheism,hot
