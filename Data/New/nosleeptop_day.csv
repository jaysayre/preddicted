gavinfaris,44,26,1rplro,87,Ok this is the ideal place to post this Ive asked my friends and some family if theyve experienced this but they have no idea what Im talking about When I was a child maybe around  I used to have theseincidents Id be about to fall asleep and all of a sudden Id feel disoriented Its probably a sleep paralysis thing or something but I remember looking around and I could move and everything even sat up a few times but everything around me seemed to lookweird Id feel as If I was in a big room that was expanding and the tv would start to shrink along with other things Id feel justreally really small I could FEEL the space around me increasingThen there was what happened afterI could almost always predict it would happen becuase the hairs on the back of my neck would stand up There would be these whispers Just these soft whispers I couldnt hear any words It sounded like maybe  people whispering at once Always at once The whispers would get louder and louder until they were voices Always talking at the same time No gaps Id get really scared and cry out Most of the time my mother would come upstairs she usually was downstairs relaxing after I went to bed and once she entered the room the voices would fade away likeREALLY fast Almost stopped instantly you know This happened for a while I remember Maybe a good couple of years Almost every night Sometimes Id be too scared to call out for my mother and sunk myself deeper in my covers pushing my little hands as hard as i could over my ears but of course this didnt do anything After a long while it would just fade away veeeeery slowly I hated it By the time it faded I was always sweaty and terrified and slept completely under the covers head and allAt some point I realised that if the light turned on  the voices would stop I cant remember how I came to this conclusion as it was many years ago like  years I remember a time when I screamed for my mother to turn on the light and she turned it on Instant reliefBut there was just one time that really sticks with me I remember the voices starting up and pressing my hands against my ears I called out for my mother but she didnt come I waited The voices grew louder I remember thinking it sounded like the amount of people in a football stadium Like a HUGE crowd The voices picked up and soon they were shouting Shouting so loud I was crying Like wailing cheeks soaked with tears snot and all I knew there was only one thing to do I had to switch on the light myselfThis meant however that I had to take off the covers and walk exposed to the light switch at the end of the room Im sure you can imagine how terrifying taking off the covers is as a child when youre scared I sort of shimmied to the end of the bed with the covers then slid out of them slowly still sobbing before crawling on the floor my best attempt to be as least exposed as possible I reached the light switch and I had to stand up I hated it I hated it so much The voices were screaming in my ears now I couldnt hear anything else My body was literally shaking from the fear as I stood up feeling my body weigh a ton and switched on the light The voices almost instantly turned into a distant echo Still shouting and screaming but like an echo now I collapsed on the floor crying softly and heard my mother come up She found me there a total wreck I think that was the worst time Slowly the voices grew less intense and there were whole weeks without incident until eventually they just stopped I cant remember when but I cant seem to find anyone who has experienced this beforeIf this sounds familiar let me know,1385735948.0,Has anyone experienced this as a child,113,nosleep,top_day

grandmaslipboogers,19,14,1roaik,44,Hi rnosleep my name is Dave I am  Im gonna tell you about myself quickly okay I need you to know these things so you can understand my storyMy mom has more heart than brains and she loves me more than I deserve to be loved by anybody I gave her hell when I was younger and she has yet to yell at me My father used to beat the fuck out of her and while she defended herself she would clean and bandage his wounds when the fight was over And my father hes a different story I dont understand how a man this rough ever landed a woman as loving and delicate as my mother He was  erm is a big guy about  Slim as they come but with some muscle on him He was so strict For as long as I can remember he made me call him Dom which is his first name If I ever slipped up and called him Dad I would owe him anywhere between  and  pushups He said it was embarrassing I was not allowed out of the house if the sun was setting and certainly not when it was dark If he did not have the license plate number address and positive impression of the parents at whoms house I would be over I was to stay home If he did not have the drivers license number of my teacher I was not allowed on field trips He was just a very terribly paranoid person In fits of rage triggered by paranoia he would beat my mother and I while accusing us of betraying him He was also if you did not already assume a moderately heavy drinker Between  and  pints of brandy a day and always a tall can of beer or two between dinner and bedI rebelled Like all teenagers my age I rebelled fueled by pintup fury over the abuse that I took so quietly It was rough I did many weekends in detention centers for fighting and unnecessary petty crimes And eventually in the heat of all this I fell in love A beautiful girl Olive with an awesome singing voice and the same passion that I hadThree years ago I got Olive pregnant I was  Olive was  Her parents were mortified my mother was heartbroken but very serious about teaching me to be a father She was waking me up at all hours of the night with a sack of flour and a tape recorder playing a baby screaming telling me what the baby needed diaper change feeding cuddling whatever and then she would watch me do it only stopping the tape when I did it the right way She really whipped me into shapeMeanwhile I was not allowed by my father to see Olive The beatings were worse I was flunking school and skipping a lot to pick up extra shifts at work My father was furiousThen one day Olive went into labor When her and my daughter was almost ready to come out our parents came to wait in the living room I came out to update them only to be greeted immediately and startlingly by my drunken father He grabbed me by my shirt collar and motioned to Olives crying mother slurring Look what you did to this girls family This obviously caused a scene Everyone was getting upset Then for once my mother spoke upDom I do wish you were a sweeter man He let go and turned to her His arms went limp as he walked towards her She rose from her vinyl seat and he got reeeeal close to her face He said very slowly and very defeatedly A Sweeter Man He looked around at the people gathered in the room and nodded slowlyThen he walked out of the hospital There wasnt enough time for anyone to worry because just as he made his grand exit a nurse came out and told me that my daughter was readyIn less than an hour my mother was a grandmother and Olive was a mommy Our daughter Ava was born healthy and kickingMy woman and my girl changed my life I calmed and settled for them And now we actually have a house I keep Ava and Olive both happy and healthy And Im happy tooAnd as for my dad I never saw him again Nobody did except for my mother She was summoned to pick his body from the morgue a month after he disappeared They said he died of cardiac arrest that may or may not have been alcohol related and they found him on the side of an underpass two towns over But life went onThis year Olive and I hosted Thanksgiving We expected many guests but nobody expected Dom to show upCuriously enough Dom did show up He showed up completely sober and in great spirits My mother was upset and my aunt went home because she was petrified Everybody else was just thankful to see him Olive and I were both stunned and cautious When he showed up I took him outside to see if it was really him In his wallet he had my dads expired drivers license and all of his credit cards It was himDom ate dinner with us played with Ava mingled with the family and then left to go see his mother Olive and I watched him walk down the road hands in his pocketsI apologize for my typos and if this was scrambled Im on my second bottle of Sutter Home and Im honestly a little afraid I dont know what my next step should be or if hes going to come back or if that was even him at all My brain is racing Im just going to kill this bottle watch Ava sleep for a while and then watch a movie with OliveEDIT Good morning Reddit Its AM and today I am going to work until  While Im at work Im going to get Doms Moms ha number from my mom After work Im going to stop by the underpass that they found him under and then Im going to stop by my moms house to get the pamphlet that they found on his body Maybe Ill find something I was also thinking about trying to find him Ill update you

ultrafilthy,14,24,1rpa86,36,No sleep No mother FUkInG sleep Im not trying to address the readers here Im describing the past few days Wait Weeks Wait Months Im describing the past few months of my life BackgroundIm living in Asia right now doing a three month internship I attend a particular university in the US im american that requires  internships upon getting a degree Students can go anywhere they want as long as they get an internship in their field of study Why did I choose Asia To get as far away as possible from what happened to me in the US From what I saw From what I may have caused That being said Ill begin my story Two years ago I was hanging out with some friends What I call my crew I wont name anyone because its not important Instead ill describe our communal interests There are five of us that make up the core crew My brother a information systems student a fashion student an electronic media student a philosophy student who is into djing and producing music and a city planning student me We are all generally creative people and we like to collaborate on ideas events art projects or what have you We build off each others inspiration For example one time we threw a fashion show at a bar in the downtown area of where we live I brought art to the picture the fashion kid brought the clothes the other three brought a unique style of music atmosphere We like to do things in the public eye Often this leads us to do online promotion of our events Nothing too crazy you know Facebook invites and that type of stuff This leads me to another common interest of ours The internet The internet is amazing Everyone here knows it Upon the thousands of uses it has our crew tends to use it for inspiration There is a grab bag of sites we all pull inspiration from One being chan Okay I know this is reddit and its a constant war between the two communities but seriously there is a lot of good content on chan After you filter through the dicks Car Parts and gore that is chan was not in my personal queue of sites to check everyday untill the fashion design kid sent me a link to a thread with really wild art work With my interest immediately sparked I go to the link and of course the thread ed I feel like I dont have to explain this but threads  on chan after they go idle for a short period of time and everything in the thread is lost I said fuck it cut my loss and closed the link After a few days my friend told me I really missed out and if I go back and request the thread someone might post the pics I do as told Got called a nigger faggot Lame Regardless I decide to browse b and see whats good I ended up seeing why people go to b and frequently returned over the next few months until I finally understood all the humor and inside jokes Hooked at that point I would log onto b before I would even check my email Because its an awesome site After class on day I get home go to b and see a TOR thread Most of you know by know what TOR is but I doubt you have explored it Even if you have gone in have you really gone deep No probably not PM me if interested though I got the good links Seeing this I decided to explore it because why not Keep in mind this was about  years ago Thus the silk road Snowden bitcoins and all that were not popping up on the front page of reddit everyday I have a naturally curious mind so I got really into this whole deep web thing and pretty much dedicated all my free time to it This really wasnt easy It takes a lot of time to filter through all the bull shit dead links avoid Cheese Pizza and not get hacked Fast forward one year If your keeping track I said this started two years ago spent  months on b and one year on TOR So thats  months before I fled to Asia At this point I got passed layer one of the deep web This took the ability to learn and find the software on hidden in TOR that allows you do to do Layer one was pretty much mild Yes there were hit men drugs and mild porn Layer two is where things begin to get weird Going to layer two I started to find the dark side of the dark net In short snuff Im not talking creepy pasta snuff im talking pictures and videos I may sound sick but I was interested in this It wasnt for fap material if youre wondering I am interested in this because if I hear something exists I need to see to believe The snuff videos I saw were generally low quality and had their fair share of errors By this I mean I could not reaaaallly tell if the vids were real I thought it might just be people with somewhat good special effects and props reducing the quality of their videos and making things seem real Dont get me wrong though Some of it was real for sure But some seemed to unbelievable to think humans would do such things Three guys one hammer doesnt even hold a light to this shit After seeing what my stomach could handle I was ready to leave Till I saw a strange link All weird tech TOR shit aside This was my path to layer three The bad stuff The new born hurt core stuff Twisted I know but I had to go to see if humans could be that sick in the head What I saw I can not forget and I do not recommend This stuff was bad Simply bad After seeing a certain video containingwelllets just say I closed my computer took a long cold shower staring at the wall and could do nothing after but take a xanax and go to bed Waking up the next day I immediately thought about what I saw I go back to my compute and remembered I forgot to close TOR I open it try to close it and I cant Every time I move my mouse to the close button it goes the opposite direction wutjpg After five minutes of trying this I say fuck it and power down that SOB and assume restarting it everything will be closed Wrong So wrong I opended my computer and a txt program was opened with a bunch of text I read it and took a huge dry gulp Everything personal on my computer was in this box My adress bank stuff personal notes everything My first thought was NO ive been hacked Wrong again I tried to use the mouse and it worked fine except with the problem of not being able to close TOR I was able to use everything else I open google chrome and do some searching for a key stroke logger I figured if I can download and install it maybe I could find what program or phising code whoever did this was using and I could undo the mess I got the logger and installed it Now the waiting game I didnt do anything once it was installed and just sat and watched If any thing was done I would know it was not me I put the logger window next to the window that had all my personal information so I could see both windowsAfter a period of wait something happened Someone hit the enter key   The thing is the key logger didnt tell me this I could only tell because  of a shift in the txt window a bit later a new paragraph begins on the txt box Could not copy it but it looked like thisrgsdvsssssssssssllwatchingandwaitingda fuq i thought I look over to the key logger and only one letter appeared The letter J No idea whats going on I keep watching  more lines go by similar to the one above Each one caused only one letter to appear on the key logger after about  more lines nothing happens The key logger looks something like jfjfjtrxxxxdffgdth Fuck this I thought and leave my computer For the record I froze all my bank information and important accounts because of potential theft I had been away from my computer for three days when all the sudden I had a thought TOR links at level one start out onion from there they get stranger and stranger I go back to my computer and move the mouse to the jfjfjtrxxxxdffgdth and it changes color from black to grey indicating a link I clicked that shit Yeah it was stupid But I really had no option whipe my drive clean and start all new accounts or see if I can get to the bottom of this Clicking the link brought my to a new window In tiny deep red letters it said my real name I clicked it All the sudden my computer goes black hhhhhhhhhhhhh this is where it happens I just got wicked chills The computer goes from black to matrix style green zeros and ones flying doen the screen Slow at first then fast Then faster Then faster Then A photo of me One that I have never taken One that was in a place where I have never been It was a photo of me standing there with my hands behind my back in a abandoned where house Looking at it freaked me the fuck out till Only three or four seconds passed till my head moved in the photo It looked left two seconds later my head turned back and slowly turned to the right Wait This wasnt a picture this is a video Right then and there I decided I had enough Whoever was trying to play a sick game with me was going to loose because I was not having it I stood up I picked up that computer and I smashed it I smashed it good It was a cheap computer I got off ebay that I used to play around with Not my main CPU At that point I felt better because I had released aggression But the thought of what I saw could not leave my mind I tried to tell my friends but they simply would not take me seriously Cops Yeah right no point Parents Nope not going to bother them They wouldnt give me two words before they would stop believing me After the smashing I didnt use any computer for a few days I tried to shake it off and eventually did A few weeks passed and I forgot Until a dream hit me I was sleeping as usual and I had a dream of the video Except I wasnt watching the video I was in the video It started just like I described earlier I was standing there hands behind the back looking left then right To the left dusty old factory walls to the right same After looking right I looked down and brought one of my hands in front of me and stared at it Red Blood red This freaked me so bad I woke up screaming and did not sleep the rest of the night The next day I was shaken but continued life That night I Tried my hardest to not sleep but I couldnt help it and passed out No dreamsRelief The next two weeks had no dreams I began to forget everything Shortly after in class one day I was making a model of and had to cut some foam core with an exacto knife I was cutting along till a kid accidentally bumped me and a got a small cut on my hand I looked at it and there was only a little bit of blood Hardly did any damage The kid who bumped me said oh shit sorry man are you okay I looked up to my right to tell him its nothing but I could only see a dusty factory wall I looked to my left and saw the same I looked down and saw my hand covered in bloodThe kid put his hand on my shoulder and I snapped out of it you alright dude yeah im fine im going to go wash it I went to the bathroom washed it And just left and went home I got to my room and sitting on my bed was that mother fucking computer still smashed into pieces Okay reddit here is what makes my story different I didnt see this and ignore it I saw that shit and I turned right around and left the house I wasnt about to be all investigative and demon hunting on this I noped right the hell out of there and got in my car and started driving I didnt know what has happening but I did not care I just drove It took me about two hours and a refilled gas tank to get my shit together Pretty much I just drove on the highway randomly When I got back to my neighborhood I didnt go home I went to my brothers house I called him up and just asked if he wanted to kick it Of course he did so I went it He tossed me a beer and looked at me you alright yeah just tired from studying mass ya hear me fool chea drink that beer though and you be alright word lets watch eastbound and down There was no way I was going to tell him I could hardly understand what happened let along vocalize it Fast forward a few hours and I passed out on his couch The dream started again Same story but the new event was after I looked down at my hand I looked up I saw myself Not in a mirror I saw myself standing there in the exact same position except my arm on the me I was looking at started to come out from behind my back Thats when I woke up I woke up to being thrown into the wall by my brothers roommate I had been told my brother was sleeping and I sprinted up stairs to his room and started pulling him by the arm With more strength than normal Retard strength He freaked out yelling and I guess his roommate came in saw us and threw me off into the wall My brother said my eyes were closed the whole time and in the end he chalked it up to some sleep walking shit He was pretty pissed and we didnt really kick it for a week Regardless After that happened that day I went home and I was going to grab that broken computer mess and burn that shit Oh yeah I was going to burn it to pure ash Nothing bizarre ever happened in my life till all this started I wasnt able to put any sense together so I was just going primal mode I got home Stormed to my room and there it was But Back in its pre smashed condition The screen was black but powered on right after I saw it Sorry Will write part two later Have to do some stuff right now,1385717996.0,TOR,60,nosleep,top_day

Moncheriebourbon,2,6,1rowsn,26,Her name was Mary She was in charge of looking after the girls in the dorm It was a great thing the president of the university had done creating an all female dormitory so the girls didnt have to walk to the normal school in the harsh Midwestern weather Mary loved her job The girls were so young and full of ambition Theirs was the generation of Elizabeth Kady Stanton Jane Addams and Alice Paul The world was slowly changing for the better her girls would be teachers on the great prairie and this hall would be where it all began This particular night only a couple of girls remained in the building due to the Easter holiday Ingrid who hailed all the way from Kankakee Emma from Shawneetown and Bridget from Chicago Bridget was a restless soul she found the prairie too dull and devoid of the exciting life she had grown accustomed to in Chicago She had seen the Worlds Fair for herself ridden in Pullman Cars and volunteered at Jane Addams Hull house She was only here to appease her mother who insisted an education would endear her more to Jonathan Moore the wealthy factory owners son Unable to sleep Bridget made her way up to the fourth floor music room Her long white nightgown and matching housecoat lightly drifted across the floor as she made her way to the piano Something soft and sophisticated would remind her of her mother and soothe her to sleep she chose Beethovens Fur Elise The song was so ingrained in her mind she was able to close her eyes and let her fingers naturally flow across the keys So lost in the music she didnt see the gruff groundskeeper drunkenly enter the room At first it was the enchanting music that drew him in but then seeing lovely fairhaired Bridget in her dressing gown his thoughts turned to something more sinister Poor Bridget who missed the city she never imagined something like this would happen to her The groundskeeper believed she was dead after he had finished ripping her gown and her body he fled before anyone could catch him Bridget the resilient Chicagoan dragged herself down the stairs If only she could get to Mary Mary would help her After an eternity she was at Marys door Bridget tried to knock but didnt have the strength so she scratched and scratched and tried to call out with a hoarse whisper but Mary wasnt roused In the morning Mary woke up pulled on her housecoat and opened her door intending to go to the community shower room Instead she found Bridget lying lifeless at her doorstep Mary couldnt tell you what happened after that Only one thing was clear to her she needed to protect her girls She began wandering the halls all night locking doors that were left carelessly unlocked occasionally entering a room and sitting by the bed of a girl having a nightmare she made sure not a single candle was burning after lights out windows were to be kept locked and absolutely no one went anywhere in the building after dark without Mary escorting her Mary only grew worse as the years wore on She was convinced there were men waiting for her to sleep to stop walking the halls even for a second in order to pounce on her girls The doctors said she had hysteria and she was sent to the asylum in Kankakee She panicked in the asylum and knew she had to get back to her dorm or else her girls would all meet the same fate as Bridget She gained the trust of her nurses and one night asked for some knitting yarn and needles The nurses obliged because Mary was such a good patient Mary took her needles and fled back to the hall She was buried in Kankakee in a paupers grave The dorm remained all female through The Great War prohibition the Great Depression The Second World War after coed dormitories became common when AfricanAmericans were finally allowed to attend college through records tracks CDs Mps and iphones And Mary always watched over her girls She no longer needed to sleep so she was able to freely roam the halls every night checking for unlocked doors Walls no longer kept her out so she could sit up all night with a homesick girl who was too embarrassed to talk to anyone else Mary loved her girls but her very being in the dorm attracted less friendly spirits and as the years went on and debauchery became commonplace amongst the girls these bad spirits grew stronger I come in to this story in the fall semester just a few years ago I was living on the second floor of the Marys dormitory with one roommate Rachel my roommate left for home nearly every weekend so I was frequently left alone in the old building Rachel and I were always hearing strange things at night footsteps piano music scratching at the door On more than one occasion one or both of us would fall asleep with the television radio or computer on and wake up to find it had been turned off Other girls said they had similar experiences and we all laughed it off as Mary our friendly ghost looking out for us I became obsessed with the story of Mary and Bridget The fourth floor had been locked up years before I came to the University but you could still walk up the stairs to it and peek in through a crack in the door Most of the girls were afraid of it but the landing just outside the fourth floor entrance became my personal study nook As the year wore on I became increasingly aware of an eerie feeling at the back of my mind I started seeing shadows hearing scratching and waking up terrified for no reason One blistery weekend in December Rachel went home like she usually did The cold weather had kept me indoors for the majority of the week and I was feeling a little stir crazy I went outside to have a cigarette and out of habit looked up to the fourth floor Surprisingly a light was on I stared up wondering how and why someone was up there It was only a second but something was in the window It was big and had red glowing eyes I screamed and dropped my cigarette A couple of girls going into the building looked at me strangely when I looked back up the light was off That night I could hardly sleep I kept seeing those red eyes and my body felt like it was in a constant fight or flight mode Something was just wrong the air felt too heavy there was someone in the room with me even though Rachel was gone I drifted off to a light sleep but was awakened by the sound of growling There was something in the room I tried turning on my lamp but it wouldnt work I spun around in bed and saw in Rachels corner of the room what was making the noise It was a big dark creature that looked like a cross between a giant wolf and a horse Its eyes were glowing red and I could just make out shiny white canines barred at me Panicking I pulled my covers over my head and started saying a prayer begging that the thing be cast out in Jesus name I dont know how but I fell asleep again I woke up sometime later it could have minutes or hours and knew the thing was gone There was a peace that radiated throughout my body before I even opened my eyes When I did open them I saw a woman sitting on the side of my bed She was dressed in very old clothes and was humming something familiar I drifted off to sleep feeling protected It wasnt until I woke up to the sunlight that I realized the song she was humming Fur Elise I had other equally and more frightening things happen to me while living in that dorm I think that Mary was looking out for

Hangingtree,4,5,1rosmv,17,I love my jobIm a butcher you see You may think I sound cruel or maybe even crazyBut I really doWhen I was a kid my father would always take me to work with me It was a family owned butcher shop His father before him and his father before him Weve owned it for the longest time My father taught me all the cuts of meat The thigh the neck the ribs I always liked ribs but I feel bad eating them The best ribs I ever tasted was after my grandmother died She never approved of the store and had arguments with my grandfather and my father about it She wanted to keep me as far away from it as possible Didnt want me See those things when I was a kidI didnt mind though Blood was never a problem everything has blood in it technically tree sap is blood It wasnt a problem to see though I always liked to tease my friends who feel sick when they see it Id cut off a foot of one of the animals and chase them around the field with it My father didnt mind he was actually really lax about letting me do what I want He liked me at the shop I kept things nice and clean Like I said I dont mind seeing the blood or even messing around but I just liked to keep the place clean For sanitation reasonsMy mother on the other hand was the one that always yelled at me for doing anything she didnt like Shed yell at my father for letting me go to the shop saying it was wrong She was a vegetarian after all She would say things like They feel pain Theyre living things You shouldnt be killing them and eating them They were just animals It wasnt like I was hurting peopleMy father had a lot of headaches from her always yelling Though I still remember when we were eating the day after she passed away Hed stare into his plate of potatoes and steak and just cry He really did love herHe started bringing me to the shop more after my mother died A sort of father son bonding experience He got a little sloppy with his work though To stop the animals from crying out you had to slit their throats first and let them bleed out He forgot to do this The noise hurts your ears like when youre sitting in a restaurant and some kid wouldnt stop crying High pitch and it drills into your ears I always hated it My father gathered up the cuts of meat he needed and took them to the other side of the shop I had gotten into the habit of cleaning his knives when he left I picked the knives off the table and was about to wash them when the creature spasmed on the table I didnt think it could move anymore most of its limbs were gone and it was cut open Its skin was all dirty almost black but you could still see pink underneath it The thing looked me in the eyes I saw fear in them like a deer in headlightsH Help meI stared at the animal It shouldnt be able to talk None of the others had talked before My father returned wiping his hands on his apron He saw me standing with the knives Whats wrongI must have looked worried I didnt mean to scare him I pointed at the animal on the table It talked My father just gave me a quick frown Thats not right He walked past me taking one of the small curved knives out of my hands He stuck his fingers into the things mouth opening them wide It gave no fight Ah here He reached the knife in and wiggled it around I saw blood dripping out of the animals mouth He pulled out a small pink thing You have to cut out the tongues Otherwise they talk just like usI looked at the animal on the table Its four limbs missing its shaved head and bleeding mouth But they arent like us right No matter how much they look like usNow you got it slugger My father gave his warm laugh I always liked that nickname,1385697831.0,My fathers shop,22,nosleep,top_day

chrispybigwood,6,11,1rpjmm,9,Im sure many of you are well aware of the famous idea that when a person is at the cusp of death they see memories of their life flash before their eyes According to those who have survived this phenomenon the flashes are slow enough for them to recognize each individual memory and evaluate it It can often lead to epiphanies where one realizes the morality of their life as good or evil and decides to change itIn my youth I was known to dream infrequently and had trouble keeping tabs on my dream journal in my psychology class The few dreams I did have were so mild of temperament and experience that I often forgot they occurred at all I realized at some point this coincided with the fact that I suffered ongoing insomnia and I often stayed up for multiple days at a time My attitude was that life was too short for sleep there were too many things to explore and appreciate to watch them pass idly by in ignorant blissThe only dream I do remember having was one that still terrifies me with every waking moment the one that sends shivers down my spine with every eyelid I see closed I remember waking up in an amorphous environment nothing was memorable except that there was just nothing there Oily shadows which ebbed and flowed in the vast infinity of this abyss before me The experience was in this first person as I looked down and saw my hands feet and body just as how it was in the real world The sheer quality of my vision and perception in this place was like that of a lucid dream mixed with all the governing laws of reality I began to walk aimlessly about hoping to find something or anything in the inky blackness that so completely enveloped me I wandered for what seemed like eternities until finally I came across a single door It was very odd because I had sat down to rest my tired legs and when I looked about again I saw it plain as day like it had always been thereSuddenly a startling clarification encroached my mind Youre not supposed to feel fatigue in a dream not supposed to feel the burden of time I felt the creeping sensation of dread crawl through every fiber of my being as I thought to myself I may never make it out of here or at least not the same What was this place I thought Was it purgatory hell heaven something in between Was I even still dreaming Was this a just punishment for my actions or was this where I must prove myself in some unknown test of character Time would have driven me insane had I not again had the fortune to bring the door into my gaze again Where had it come from What was its purpose Should I enter So many variables to a single constant element in this placeThankfully I had the luxury of time to ponder my decision I decided if I waited long enough I would wake up back in my old familiar house in my old familiar bed and I would wake up safe I felt instead of the previous awe and mystique I saw in the flowing shadows a sense of imminent danger about them I felt there to be an element of malice of hate in there as though it consumed them They were everywhere and there was only one of me Panicked I ran towards the door and thrust it open with all my might leading with my shoulderI was very confused when I arrived on the other side I saw the same overwhelming darkness and looked behind me to find the door so I might escape again It was gone however and I was right back where I started again Alone hungry tired thirsty and altogether desperate I felt myself getting weaker as my will slowly ebbed away as if it was absorbed by this damned oblivion Right then is when I saw itLike a mirage I didnt know if my eyes truly saw it but far in the distance beyond the haze of shadows was a vaguely manshaped figure I called out to it I waved at it each eccentric motion more exacerbated than the last Eventually I ran to it until it got close and then I saw just exactly what this figure was It was meMy view was from behind but I still knew the exact same head of hair the exact same body type the exact same length of the arms and legs the exact same musculature as my own I stopped dead in my tracks and froze every nerve in my body He looked around and stared me dead in the eye and a look of the most honest and real shock I have ever seen swept over his face His jaw gaped wide open his eyes larger than a sinkhole and his eyes locked mine for the briefest of moments And then he ranHe ran away from me with all the speed of a bat out of hell I pursued him but with great difficulty as I felt a pulsating pain in my chest that intensified the closer I got to him When I was just out of arms reach I felt a crushing exhaustion throughout all of my body By some miraculous feat of strength I was able to actually outrun him I wasted no time in leaping on him and tackling him to the ground I felt a shock in me that resounded with more force than if I had been hit with a thunderclap Time seemed to slow as we both fell to the ground and collapsed into it The last thing I saw was his faceI only glimpsed it before I woke up but what I saw haunts my every waking moment His flesh was already cold colder than even dry ice to the touch His skin was pale beyond pale and closer to being an unnatural shade of white unbeknownst to human vision His eyes stared lifelessly dead blank expressionless in no particular direction yet I felt as though they peered into my very soul His lips were crimson red the exact color of the very blood that runs in my veins I saw this and I FELT like a part of me had died when he didI woke up in my bed and threw myself into an upright position upon doing so I looked around the room and made absolutely sure everything was as it should be before letting my resolute guard down It was then that I felt the same overwhelming sense of fatigue and exhaustion I had felt in my dream I was starving and insatiably thirsty Moving any part of my body was met instantly with excruciating pain I looked at my clock to see if it was morning and it read  Satisfied I moved downstairs and cooked a savory meal of bacon and eggs and carried on my day as if nothing had happened until I looked at the messages on my answering machineThere were hundreds of them so many that the answering machine had deleted some of the old ones One was from work informing me that they had fired me from the company after three consecutive no callno shows on the job Another was from my parents wondering if I had got their package requesting that I call them back upon receiving it One was a startled message from my girlfriend wondering if anything was wrong as I missed our date and hadnt communicated with her in three days I listened to all of them and became more and more confused about the situationI looked at the calender to confirm my suspicions and they were proven to be true The current date was indeed three days from when I had fallen asleep before that terrible dream My mind was fucked This meant that not only was it the most realistic and coincidentally the only dream I remembered having but it took place in real time simultaneous to REAL life The fact raised the question though was I suffering from the exhaustion because the dream was real Was the man I killed a version of me in another dimension or universe Was the life I was living now even real Or was I just another version of him in that universe a mystery to be uncovered or a shocking discoveryThoughts raced through my mind as I simply stood there contemplating everything I had ever come to know and understand Should I be alive whats waiting there on the otherside is death really the endThis last question burned and lingered in my mind and I couldnt erase it no matter how hard and fruitlessly I tried It consumed me to the point where I had to kill myself to find out for sure I walked slowly deliberately and with a definite purpose over to the knife rack in the kitchen and picked out the large serrated butcher knife from it I placed it in my hand and envied the feel of the cold steel against my rough calloused palms The feel of the handle and the power to decide life and death at my fingertips I raised it ever so smoothly in the air and placed the blade right against my throat A smile creased my face as I took a deep breath and prepared for the unknownSuddenly in a flash he appeared before me and alarmed me to such a degree where I dropped the knife where it clattered earpiercingly on the floor The silence in that room was absolute and his presence so dominating that the only thing my eyes could focus on were him This was an impossibility though wasnt he dead Hadnt I felt his life force cease to be just as I felt the connection between us cease How is any of this making sense how could any of this happen in real lifeHe stood there solemn and unwavering in his posture His face showed not the slightest trace of emotion as he raised an outstretched arm and pointed a long finger in my direction His voice was calm yet boomed in the deafening silence He said four simple words which chilled my bones more than the dream ever could Four simple words that confirmed my worst fears and suspicions which lurked at the bottom of my subconscious mind He said simply Was I not enoughHe vanished after that He didnt fade from existence or blink into nothingness he simply vanished One moment I was looking right at him and the next he was gone I couldnt believe anything that had happened this had to be a nightmare I pinched myself I cut myself to see if I still bled I screamed I clawed at the walls I begged a merciful God in pity to not let this be real Eventually I conceded defeat and laid on the floor with eyes transfixed on the ceiling and closed my eyes But this time I never woke up,1385733288.0,Evasion of a

iamphiip,6,3,1rq1mr,16,I met Chris the summer before high school when his parents moved to town and our mothers became good friends Over time we became friends good friends and then best friends We remained close throughout high school but then he moved to Florida to work with his father and I joined the Army We still stayed in touch but a couple years went by before we saw each other again    I was taking leave for a few weeks and decided to swing by Florida for a few days before heading back to Korea for another year Chris picked me up at the airport and we spent the drive back to his apartment catching up The most interesting conversation was when he mentioned his apartment was haunted Shortly after Chris and his dad moved into the apartment Chris felt a strange presence in his bedroom The temperature in his room would drop several degrees even when the air conditioner was off and his computer chair would swivel for no apparent reason when he was on the opposite side of the room He told me he never felt threatened but he was sure his apartment was haunted    He told me he started his own investigation He read about a technique that was supposed to facilitate communication with the ghost He took a writing pad and pencil asked a question several times out loud then cleared his mind and started writing It would be jibberish at first something along the lines of safvhagjnLGFDKsfbvaDGSLKNdjghACKK After some time words would start to form as the ghost used Chris energy to direct the motion of his hand From this technique Chris learned the ghosts name was Jeremy and that he had committed suicide in that same room about a year before Chris moved in Jeremy said he was  when he died and he was lonely    Chris was skeptical at first but when he asked around the apartment complex he discovered that a  year old named Jeremy had in fact hung himself in the same apartment about a year before Chris and his father moved in The fact that this information matched exactly to the answers on the writing pad convinced Chris that Jeremy was a real ghost and really haunted the apartment    When we arrived at Chris apartment he showed me the writing pad and then told me he was going to take me into his bedroom and introduce me to Jeremy He said he needed to introduce me because Jeremy didnt like visitors and would sometimes make them feel uncomfortable until Chris told Jeremy to dial it down because the visitor was a friend Chris and I walked into his bedroom and he said out loud Jeremy this is Dylan He is my best friend and I want you to treat him with respect and be nice to him    The rest of the day passed without incident That night Chris offered to sleep on the couch and let me sleep in his bed if I was alright with that I said it was fine I was still skeptical about the ghost and I thought it might be an interesting adventure to sleep in a haunted room I was pretty reckless back then when I was in the Army I thought I was invincible so I didnt even consider that this might be a bad idea Besides Chris introduced me and Jeremy had never acted out against Chris friends once they had been properly introduced    I decided to do a little of my own investigating after Chris went to sleep I took out the writing pad asked Jeremy if he liked me cleared my mind and started writing After a while I must have fallen asleep because I had a nightmare that I couldnt breathe In the dream it felt like my throat was full of foam and there was a huge weight pushing down on my chest My throat burned and tightened but when I brought my hands up nothing was there I struggled and kicked and clawed at my chest and neck but the burning and the inability to breathe only got worse All my strength and Army training was useless Finally I had that falling sensation and woke up  Chris woke me up He said he had been asleep until he heard me thrashing around in the bedroom He came to check on me and found me sitting up against the wall asleep with my hands around my throat When he woke me up he said I slid down the wall a couple inches as if something had been holding me up off the matress My neck was sore so I went to the bathroom to look in the mirror I had bruises around my neck in a distinct pattern It wasnt bruises from my hands it was obviously a bruise from a rope    I went back into the bedroom and Chris was staring at the writing pad He asked me what I had been doing so I told him He showed me the writing pad and he was pale Among the scribbles and random letters was something I do not remember writing It said Jeremy is ONLY best friend,1385750356.0,A ghost tried to steal my best friend,19,nosleep,top_day

whiskeythefoxtrot,1,1,1rqd1h,0,Ok so this starts out when i was living with my folks  They had built a house in an old field that was being turned into a neighborhood at the time  The house was completed in  i think so I was  at the time  First few months of living there life went on as advertised then about  months in my stepmom came home and found the backdoor was wide open  My parents checked to make sure nothing was stolen and installed a deadbolt on the door we thought that gusts of wind forced the door open  Another month went by without incident until my dad came home tobfind the back door wide open again with deadbolt unlocked  I should note that dad is a paranoid bastard and double checks all the doors before he goes to work in the morning and makes surevthe deadbolt and regular locks are locked in place  After that we got a security system installed and changed the locks to the front and back door and changed the code to the garage door again paranoid  For the next few months or so the door would be deadbolted shut somehow open when noones home trip the alarm system and send cops rushing to our house  Eventually it stopped on its own but we never did find out the cause  Skip forward to when i was either  or  and home for the summer  I was sitting in the living room by the offending door watching tv all of the sudden the damn door flies open and slams into the wall  I hauled ass out of the house to my buddys house and didnt come back until my folks came home from workNot long after the door made me run like a two year old girl from the house i started hearing humming randomly when i was alone in the house  I heard it mostly in my room but also in the living room where the back door is the kitchen and the laundry room  By this point I think my parents were starting to question my sanity because I asked them a few times if they were humming or heard humming and all I got in return were some wierd looks and jokes about my hearing  By the time I was  or so I started having dreams about a figure standing somewhere in my room and humming the same little tune I heard before  I decided not to tell my parents  Close to my th birthday the dream and the figure became more vivid the figure looked like a fairly short teenage girl with dark hair and wearing a baby blue short dress  I heard humming all the time at myhouse by this point  Then one night I was home alone and listening to my radio and cleaning my shotgun when all of the smoke alarms started going off at the same time  After running around my house with a fire extinguisher all the smoke alarms went off and there was no sign of smoke in the houseBy  the dreams and humming were a regular occurence with added bonus of seeing movement out of the corner of my eye  By this point my girlfriend and I would come to my house when my folks werent home tostudy  One time while we wereprestudyingwe both heard a woman scream and the door going to tje garage slam  Thinking my stepmom had come home early and figured out my girlfriend was at our house to study i tore into the kitchen after telling my gf to climb out the window  But when i got to the door noone was home  We were still alone  After stopping my gf from climbing out my window we both decided to leave and unfortunately she never came back to my house while it was just the two of us  Which sucked  After that the dreams got worse and the woman in the dreams seemed a lot more hostile  In my dreams she would stand directly overvmy bed and stare at me  She wouldnt hum or move Id get this intense feeling of dread everytime  The dreams got so bad that I wouldnt sleep  I was scared shitless to be honest  I would come home and stuff on shelves would be knocked over tv would be on nothing but static  I hated that house by this point  Not long after things got this bad I graduated and joined the Air Force  Ever since then I havent seen her or heard any humming  I think it helped that Im  hrs away  My Dad and stepmom split and they sold the house  But everytime I go home on leave I drive through my old neighborhood and that house is always for sale ,1385759360.0,Want someone to shed some light on a few older experiences,1,nosleep,top_day
ThatOneDoper,7,2,1roy4x,1,Hey rnosleep I have a question for you When I was  living in New York near springville or Olean I lived in a singlewide trailer that my Grandfather gave my Dad for us to live in The house I know nothing of its past I only lived there to the age of  I dont remember everything from living there but what would happen in my room and with neither of my parents home Ill start from the smallest things and work my way up Me and my brother would always but only at night feel our bunkbed shaking somewhat softly being so young I paid it almost no mind Without my parents home you would hear skittering in the back of the house Thats the stuff that didnt scare me When I started having trouble sleeping I started to lay on my side looking away from the wall Thats when I  saw them About three to four small black creatures Dont ask me how I made out their shapes I just could They had circular heads with triangular ears and these glowing red eyes When I would look at them they would slowly shake almost like vibrating slowly reaching towards me When i would being a fearless four year old reach out to grab them to see if I could find out what they were they would duck down until I layed still for about an hour At first I was curious but after the third night I would be terrified to see them With that going on we also had two dogs An American Rottweiler and a Geman Rottweiler Tue American one was fully grown but the German was a pup When my parents werent home one night me and my brother were watching TV when all of the sudden our American Cheyenne stood up She was looking at Tue single hallway of the trailer that lead to the two rooms and bathroom At first we paid it no mind but Tue she started growling then barking Now if youve ever hear a Rottweiler growling snarling and barking you know its intimidating as fuck She slowly walked towards the hallway but stopped at our kitchens threshold Thats when she went berserk Howling and barking while running through the house berserk Me and my brother were pretty young so we got scared and went to our neighbors house The front of our house was some French window BS thing where it stuck out and had three sides From our neighbors house we could see Cheyenne running through the house then upon reaching the window she would jump up and rebound off the window and wall She did that till my dad came home Naturally me and my brother forgot about it because of snow the next morning If anybody has had a similar life experience or knows what this all meant comment I have since moved to another house in West New York that was haunted and then to South Texas Im a senior as of now but after graduation Im going to drive up to Nee York and visit the old houses I lived in PS my family has a history of hauntings,1385702999.0,Have you seen them too,3,nosleep,top_day
aVolforLife,4,2,1rp4hb,1,Most of you reading this probably have had a dream at some time that was so vivid so real that it becomes indistinguishable from reality I have And though these dreams ocurred when I was very young they still haunt me Sometimes at night under the correct conditions I find myself unable to move breathless  paralyzed  Im  now but this is the first dream that I can remember I can remember it vividly because for a period of about a year it is the only dream I had Before I get too far ahead of myself I should tell you about me I always feel bad talking about my childhood as comparatively mine was perfect I grew up in a very happy home My parents are well educated professional types and I was their first child We lived in rural Tennessee in a two  story house overlooking a lake My bedroom was upstairs and had a sliding door that opened onto a balcony overlooking the lake and miles of hills and open sky Beautiful We werent a religious family odd for rural Tennessee but my family was very conservative I wasnt even allowed to watch Nickelodean due to content that my parents deemed questionable Hell they didnt let me see my first R rated movie until I was about  Needless to say I was a bit sheltered I was very creative and my parents still tell stories about how self sufficient I was I would read and draw and build models I spent a great deal of time alone in my head by choice Like most kids apparently I hated bed time Dreaded is probably the more proper turn of phrase  My parents being intellectuals not given to emotional overreaction would tuck me in and insist that I stay in my bed this time It seems for some time that my parents would wake and I would be asleep under or in a chair next to their bed I have no memory of getting up walking downstairs and crawling in the chair Im getting ahead of myself Back to bedtime and dread that sticks with meEvery night was the same routine Bath Pajamas Bed Usually one if not both parents would sit and read to me from Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland until I dozed off Before they would leave they would turn off my bedroom light turn on an old transistor radio with a little lighted clock on the front my own version of a night light and retire Usually they would leave the stairway light on like it was the dark that scared me The dark was harmless it was the dreams that were the problemThe dreams were always the same I would awaken at  according to the old flip style clock on the transistor radio front The only sound was the hiss the white noise of the channel that my parents had left softly playing early s pop the station must have gone off the air I guess my parents thought Don Henley Hall amp Oates and the stair light would keep my monsters at bay The dream always proceeded the same from there After I would reach over to turn off the radio I would roll back over away from the light in the hallway facing the sliding glass door to the balcony and try to go back to sleep Even writing this my heart is racing It always seemed brighter outside than it should be at night and the groans and creeks of the wooden balcony seemed unusual The white curtain that covered the door to the balcony always shifted the same way when that slow grinding sound began You know the sound Im describing The sound of the heavy glass door shifting along the rollers in the tracks And thenIt was like I awakened from a dream but still dreaming Groggy in a blinding white room uncapable of the slightest movement Why cant I move I cant move my head to find out I know Im laying in what would best be described as a crib and there are no distinguishing marks anywhere Everything is just white bright smooth A low bass hum permeates through me Almost inaudible but it is a sound that is more felt than heard I begin to cry There is a feeling that someone is telling me its okay dont cry this will be over soon and everything will be okay Another personality I cant say a voice because there was no sound but another personality says to distract me A ball appears to my right hovering feet from my face It slowly moves from right to left floating until it disappears Then it floats from left back to right No ball travels this slow without falling Its as if Im weightlessThe dream always ends the same A pair of huge black eyes inches from mine Cold Inhuman Souless Clinical Without empathyI wake in my parents room Those dreams never returned but a few years later we moved to Louisiana This time we bought a house that overlooked hundreds of acres of swampy marshland My bedroom had a huge window I always felt as if I was being watched I never had the dreams but there were times when I would wake up in other rooms of the house Sometimes in my closet curled up sometimes in my sisters room under her bedYears later my parents asked if I remember that year that I had trouble sleeping They laughed at the story commenting on how thoughtful I was as a kid I mean I even apparently turned off the radio every night before I would find my way downstairs in the dark Several years after that a senior in high school I was at a friends house We decided to rent a movie to scare us He chose a movie I had never heard of We watched it and it shook me so much that I threw up Ive never reacted like that to any movie especially not one so poorly acted To this day I cant walk past a copy of Fire in the Sky without getting a little sick,1385709840.0,Was it really a dream,3,nosleep,top_day

grandmaslipboogers,19,17,1roaik,40,Hi rnosleep my name is Dave I am  Im gonna tell you about myself quickly okay I need you to know these things so you can understand my storyMy mom has more heart than brains and she loves me more than I deserve to be loved by anybody I gave her hell when I was younger and she has yet to yell at me My father used to beat the fuck out of her and while she defended herself she would clean and bandage his wounds when the fight was over And my father hes a different story I dont understand how a man this rough ever landed a woman as loving and delicate as my mother He was  erm is a big guy about  Slim as they come but with some muscle on him He was so strict For as long as I can remember he made me call him Dom which is his first name If I ever slipped up and called him Dad I would owe him anywhere between  and  pushups He said it was embarrassing I was not allowed out of the house if the sun was setting and certainly not when it was dark If he did not have the license plate number address and positive impression of the parents at whoms house I would be over I was to stay home If he did not have the drivers license number of my teacher I was not allowed on field trips He was just a very terribly paranoid person In fits of rage triggered by paranoia he would beat my mother and I while accusing us of betraying him He was also if you did not already assume a moderately heavy drinker Between  and  pints of brandy a day and always a tall can of beer or two between dinner and bedI rebelled Like all teenagers my age I rebelled fueled by pintup fury over the abuse that I took so quietly It was rough I did many weekends in detention centers for fighting and unnecessary petty crimes And eventually in the heat of all this I fell in love A beautiful girl Olive with an awesome singing voice and the same passion that I hadThree years ago I got Olive pregnant I was  Olive was  Her parents were mortified my mother was heartbroken but very serious about teaching me to be a father She was waking me up at all hours of the night with a sack of flour and a tape recorder playing a baby screaming telling me what the baby needed diaper change feeding cuddling whatever and then she would watch me do it only stopping the tape when I did it the right way She really whipped me into shapeMeanwhile I was not allowed by my father to see Olive The beatings were worse I was flunking school and skipping a lot to pick up extra shifts at work My father was furiousThen one day Olive went into labor When her and my daughter was almost ready to come out our parents came to wait in the living room I came out to update them only to be greeted immediately and startlingly by my drunken father He grabbed me by my shirt collar and motioned to Olives crying mother slurring Look what you did to this girls family This obviously caused a scene Everyone was getting upset Then for once my mother spoke upDom I do wish you were a sweeter man He let go and turned to her His arms went limp as he walked towards her She rose from her vinyl seat and he got reeeeal close to her face He said very slowly and very defeatedly A Sweeter Man He looked around at the people gathered in the room and nodded slowlyThen he walked out of the hospital There wasnt enough time for anyone to worry because just as he made his grand exit a nurse came out and told me that my daughter was readyIn less than an hour my mother was a grandmother and Olive was a mommy Our daughter Ava was born healthy and kickingMy woman and my girl changed my life I calmed and settled for them And now we actually have a house I keep Ava and Olive both happy and healthy And Im happy tooAnd as for my dad I never saw him again Nobody did except for my mother She was summoned to pick his body from the morgue a month after he disappeared They said he died of cardiac arrest that may or may not have been alcohol related and they found him on the side of an underpass two towns over But life went onThis year Olive and I hosted Thanksgiving We expected many guests but nobody expected Dom to show upCuriously enough Dom did show up He showed up completely sober and in great spirits My mother was upset and my aunt went home because she was petrified Everybody else was just thankful to see him Olive and I were both stunned and cautious When he showed up I took him outside to see if it was really him In his wallet he had my dads expired drivers license and all of his credit cards It was himDom ate dinner with us played with Ava mingled with the family and then left to go see his mother Olive and I watched him walk down the road hands in his pocketsI apologize for my typos and if this was scrambled Im on my second bottle of Sutter Home and Im honestly a little afraid I dont know what my next step should be or if hes going to come back or if that was even him at all My brain is racing Im just going to kill this bottle watch Ava sleep for a while and then watch a movie with OliveEDIT Good morning Reddit Its AM and today I am going to work until  While Im at work Im going to get Doms Moms ha number from my mom After work Im going to stop by the underpass that

We like to do things in the public eye Often this leads us to do online promotion of our events Nothing too crazy you know Facebook invites and that type of stuff This leads me to another common interest of ours The internet The internet is amazing Everyone here knows it Upon the thousands of uses it has our crew tends to use it for inspiration There is a grab bag of sites we all pull inspiration from One being chan Okay I know this is reddit and its a constant war between the two communities but seriously there is a lot of good content on chan After you filter through the dicks Car Parts and gore that is chan was not in my personal queue of sites to check everyday untill the fashion design kid sent me a link to a thread with really wild art work With my interest immediately sparked I go to the link and of course the thread ed I feel like I dont have to explain this but threads  on chan after they go idle for a short period of time and everything in the thread is lost I said fuck it cut my loss and closed the link After a few days my friend told me I really missed out and if I go back and request the thread someone might post the pics I do as told Got called a nigger faggot Lame Regardless I decide to browse b and see whats good I ended up seeing why people go to b and frequently returned over the next few months until I finally understood all the humor and inside jokes Hooked at that point I would log onto b before I would even check my email Because its an awesome site After class on day I get home go to b and see a TOR thread Most of you know by know what TOR is but I doubt you have explored it Even if you have gone in have you really gone deep No probably not PM me if interested though I got the good links Seeing this I decided to explore it because why not Keep in mind this was about  years ago Thus the silk road Snowden bitcoins and all that were not popping up on the front page of reddit everyday I have a naturally curious mind so I got really into this whole deep web thing and pretty much dedicated all my free time to it This really wasnt easy It takes a lot of time to filter through all the bull shit dead links avoid Cheese Pizza and not get hacked Fast forward one year If your keeping track I said this started two years ago spent  months on b and one year on TOR So thats  months before I fled to Asia At this point I got passed layer one of the deep web This took the ability to learn and find the software on hidden in TOR that allows you do to do Layer one was pretty much mild Yes there were hit men drugs and mild porn Layer two is where things begin to get weird Going to layer two I started to find the dark side of the dark net In short snuff Im not talking creepy pasta snuff im talking pictures and videos I may sound sick but I was interested in this It wasnt for fap material if youre wondering I am interested in this because if I hear something exists I need to see to believe The snuff videos I saw were generally low quality and had their fair share of errors By this I mean I could not reaaaallly tell if the vids were real I thought it might just be people with somewhat good special effects and props reducing the quality of their videos and making things seem real Dont get me wrong though Some of it was real for sure But some seemed to unbelievable to think humans would do such things Three guys one hammer doesnt even hold a light to this shit After seeing what my stomach could handle I was ready to leave Till I saw a strange link All weird tech TOR shit aside This was my path to layer three The bad stuff The new born hurt core stuff Twisted I know but I had to go to see if humans could be that sick in the head What I saw I can not forget and I do not recommend This stuff was bad Simply bad After seeing a certain video containingwelllets just say I closed my computer took a long cold shower staring at the wall and could do nothing after but take a xanax and go to bed Waking up the next day I immediately thought about what I saw I go back to my compute and remembered I forgot to close TOR I open it try to close it and I cant Every time I move my mouse to the close button it goes the opposite direction wutjpg After five minutes of trying this I say fuck it and power down that SOB and assume restarting it everything will be closed Wrong So wrong I opended my computer and a txt program was opened with a bunch of text I read it and took a huge dry gulp Everything personal on my computer was in this box My adress bank stuff personal notes everything My first thought was NO ive been hacked Wrong again I tried to use the mouse and it worked fine except with the problem of not being able to close TOR I was able to use everything else I open google chrome and do some searching for a key stroke logger I figured if I can download and install it maybe I could find what program or phising code whoever did this was using and I could undo the mess I got the logger and installed it Now the waiting game I didnt do anything once it was installed and just sat and watched If any thing was done I would know it was not me I put the logger window next to the window that had all my personal information so I could see both windowsAfter a period of wait something happened Someone hit the enter key   The thing is the key logger didnt tell me this I could only tell because  of a shift in the txt window a bit later a new paragraph begins on the txt box Could not copy it but it looked like thisrgsdvsssssssssssllwatchingandwaitingda fuq i thought I look over to the key logger and only one letter appeared The letter J No idea whats going on I keep watching  more lines go by similar to the one above Each one caused only one letter to appear on the key logger after about  more lines nothing happens The key logger looks something like jfjfjtrxxxxdffgdth Fuck this I thought and leave my computer For the record I froze all my bank information and important accounts because of potential theft I had been away from my computer for three days when all the sudden I had a thought TOR links at level one start out onion from there they get stranger and stranger I go back to my computer and move the mouse to the jfjfjtrxxxxdffgdth and it changes color from black to grey indicating a link I clicked that shit Yeah it was stupid But I really had no option whipe my drive clean and start all new accounts or see if I can get to the bottom of this Clicking the link brought my to a new window In tiny deep red letters it said my real name I clicked it All the sudden my computer goes black hhhhhhhhhhhhh this is where it happens I just got wicked chills The computer goes from black to matrix style green zeros and ones flying doen the screen Slow at first then fast Then faster Then faster Then A photo of me One that I have never taken One that was in a place where I have never been It was a photo of me standing there with my hands behind my back in a abandoned where house Looking at it freaked me the fuck out till Only three or four seconds passed till my head moved in the photo It looked left two seconds later my head turned back and slowly turned to the right Wait This wasnt a picture this is a video Right then and there I decided I had enough Whoever was trying to play a sick game with me was going to loose because I was not having it I stood up I picked up that computer and I smashed it I smashed it good It was a cheap computer I got off ebay that I used to play around with Not my main CPU At that point I felt better because I had released aggression But the thought of what I saw could not leave my mind I tried to tell my friends but they simply would not take me seriously Cops Yeah right no point Parents Nope not going to bother them They wouldnt give me two words before they would stop believing me After the smashing I didnt use any computer for a few days I tried to shake it off and eventually did A few weeks passed and I forgot Until a dream hit me I was sleeping as usual and I had a dream of the video Except I wasnt watching the video I was in the video It started just like I described earlier I was standing there hands behind the back looking left then right To the left dusty old factory walls to the right same After looking right I looked down and brought one of my hands in front of me and stared at it Red Blood red This freaked me so bad I woke up screaming and did not sleep the rest of the night The next day I was shaken but continued life That night I Tried my hardest to not sleep but I couldnt help it and passed out No dreamsRelief The next two weeks had no dreams I began to forget everything Shortly after in class one day I was making a model of and had to cut some foam core with an exacto knife I was cutting along till a kid accidentally bumped me and a got a small cut on my hand I looked at it and there was only a little bit of blood Hardly did any damage The kid who bumped me said oh shit sorry man are you okay I looked up to my right to tell him its nothing but I could only see a dusty factory wall I looked to my left and saw the same I looked down and saw my hand covered in bloodThe kid put his hand on my shoulder and I snapped out of it you alright dude yeah im fine im going to go wash it I went to the bathroom washed it And just left and went home I got to my room and sitting on my bed was that mother fucking computer still smashed into pieces Okay reddit here is what makes my story different I didnt see this and ignore it I saw that shit and I turned right around and left the house I wasnt about to be all investigative and demon hunting on this I noped right the hell out of there and got in my car and started driving I didnt know what has happening but I did not care I just drove It took me about two hours and a refilled gas tank to get my shit together Pretty much I just drove on the highway randomly When I got back to my neighborhood I didnt go home I went to my brothers house I called him up and just asked if he wanted to kick it Of course he did so I went it He tossed me a beer and looked at me you alright yeah just tired from studying mass ya hear me fool chea drink that beer though and you be alright word lets watch eastbound and down There was no way I was going to tell him I could hardly understand what happened let along vocalize it Fast forward a few hours and I passed out on his couch The dream started again Same story but the new event was after I looked down at my hand I looked up I saw myself Not in a mirror I saw myself standing there in the exact same position except my arm on the me I was looking at started to come out from behind my back Thats when I woke up I woke up to being thrown into the wall by my brothers roommate I had been told my brother was sleeping and I sprinted up stairs to his room and started pulling him by the arm With more strength than normal Retard strength He freaked out yelling and I guess his roommate came in saw us and threw me off into the wall My brother said my eyes were closed the whole time and in the end he chalked it up to some sleep walking shit He was pretty pissed and we didnt really kick it for a week Regardless After that happened that day I went home and I was going to grab that broken computer mess and burn that shit Oh yeah I was going to burn it to pure ash Nothing bizarre ever happened in my life till all this started I wasnt able to put any sense together so I was just going primal mode I got home Stormed to my room and there it was But Back in its pre smashed condition The screen was black but powered on right after I saw it Sorry Will write part two later Have to do some stuff right now,1385717996.0,TOR,59,nosleep,top_day

Moncheriebourbon,2,6,1rowsn,25,Her name was Mary She was in charge of looking after the girls in the dorm It was a great thing the president of the university had done creating an all female dormitory so the girls didnt have to walk to the normal school in the harsh Midwestern weather Mary loved her job The girls were so young and full of ambition Theirs was the generation of Elizabeth Kady Stanton Jane Addams and Alice Paul The world was slowly changing for the better her girls would be teachers on the great prairie and this hall would be where it all began This particular night only a couple of girls remained in the building due to the Easter holiday Ingrid who hailed all the way from Kankakee Emma from Shawneetown and Bridget from Chicago Bridget was a restless soul she found the prairie too dull and devoid of the exciting life she had grown accustomed to in Chicago She had seen the Worlds Fair for herself ridden in Pullman Cars and volunteered at Jane Addams Hull house She was only here to appease her mother who insisted an education would endear her more to Jonathan Moore the wealthy factory owners son Unable to sleep Bridget made her way up to the fourth floor music room Her long white nightgown and matching housecoat lightly drifted across the floor as she made her way to the piano Something soft and sophisticated would remind her of her mother and soothe her to sleep she chose Beethovens Fur Elise The song was so ingrained in her mind she was able to close her eyes and let her fingers naturally flow across the keys So lost in the music she didnt see the gruff groundskeeper drunkenly enter the room At first it was the enchanting music that drew him in but then seeing lovely fairhaired Bridget in her dressing gown his thoughts turned to something more sinister Poor Bridget who missed the city she never imagined something like this would happen to her The groundskeeper believed she was dead after he had finished ripping her gown and her body he fled before anyone could catch him Bridget the resilient Chicagoan dragged herself down the stairs If only she could get to Mary Mary would help her After an eternity she was at Marys door Bridget tried to knock but didnt have the strength so she scratched and scratched and tried to call out with a hoarse whisper but Mary wasnt roused In the morning Mary woke up pulled on her housecoat and opened her door intending to go to the community shower room Instead she found Bridget lying lifeless at her doorstep Mary couldnt tell you what happened after that Only one thing was clear to her she needed to protect her girls She began wandering the halls all night locking doors that were left carelessly unlocked occasionally entering a room and sitting by the bed of a girl having a nightmare she made sure not a single candle was burning after lights out windows were to be kept locked and absolutely no one went anywhere in the building after dark without Mary escorting her Mary only grew worse as the years wore on She was convinced there were men waiting for her to sleep to stop walking the halls even for a second in order to pounce on her girls The doctors said she had hysteria and she was sent to the asylum in Kankakee She panicked in the asylum and knew she had to get back to her dorm or else her girls would all meet the same fate as Bridget She gained the trust of her nurses and one night asked for some knitting yarn and needles The nurses obliged because Mary was such a good patient Mary took her needles and fled back to the hall She was buried in Kankakee in a paupers grave The dorm remained all female through The Great War prohibition the Great Depression The Second World War after coed dormitories became common when AfricanAmericans were finally allowed to attend college through records tracks CDs Mps and iphones And Mary always watched over her girls She no longer needed to sleep so she was able to freely roam the halls every night checking for unlocked doors Walls no longer kept her out so she could sit up all night with a homesick girl who was too embarrassed to talk to anyone else Mary loved her girls but her very being in the dorm attracted less friendly spirits and as the years went on and debauchery became commonplace amongst the girls these bad spirits grew stronger I come in to this story in the fall semester just a few years ago I was living on the second floor of the Marys dormitory with one roommate Rachel my roommate left for home nearly every weekend so I was frequently left alone in the old building Rachel and I were always hearing strange things at night footsteps piano music scratching at the door On more than one occasion one or both of us would fall asleep with the television radio or computer on and wake up to find it had been turned off Other girls said they had similar experiences and we all laughed it off as Mary our friendly ghost looking out for us I became obsessed with the story of Mary and Bridget The fourth floor had been locked up years before I came to the University but you could still walk up the stairs to it and peek in through a crack in the door Most of the girls were afraid of it but the landing just outside the fourth floor entrance became my personal study nook As the year wore on I became increasingly aware of an eerie feeling at the back of my mind I started seeing shadows hearing scratching and waking up terrified for no reason One blistery weekend in December Rachel went home like she usually did The cold weather had kept me indoors for the majority of the week and I was feeling a little stir crazy I went outside to have a cigarette and out of habit looked up to the fourth floor Surprisingly a light was on I stared up wondering how and why someone was up there It was only a second but something was in the window It was big and had red glowing eyes I screamed and dropped my cigarette A couple of girls going into the building looked at me strangely when I looked back up the light was off That night I could hardly sleep I kept seeing those red eyes and my body felt like it was in a constant fight or flight mode Something was just wrong the air felt too heavy there was someone in the room with me even though Rachel was gone I drifted off to a light sleep but was awakened by the sound of growling There was something in the room I tried turning on my lamp but it wouldnt work I spun around in bed and saw in Rachels corner of the room what was making the noise It was a big dark creature that looked like a cross between a giant wolf and a horse Its eyes were glowing red and I could just make out shiny white canines barred at me Panicking I pulled my covers over my head and started saying a prayer begging that the thing be cast out in Jesus name I dont know how but I fell asleep again I woke up sometime later it could have minutes or hours and knew the thing was gone There was a peace that radiated throughout my body before I even opened my eyes When I did open them I saw a woman sitting on the side of my bed She was dressed in very old clothes and was humming something familiar I drifted off to sleep feeling protected It wasnt until I woke up to the sunlight that I realized the song she was humming Fur Elise I had other equally and more frightening things happen to me while living in that dorm I think that Mary was looking out for me that night and all the other nights similar things happened Mary really is still looking out for her girls over  years after her death but there are other things out for the girls too I just hope Mary continues to be there to protect others the way she protected me ,1385701703.0,Marys Hall,31,nosleep,top_day

chrispybigwood,6,10,1rpjmm,10,Im sure many of you are well aware of the famous idea that when a person is at the cusp of death they see memories of their life flash before their eyes According to those who have survived this phenomenon the flashes are slow enough for them to recognize each individual memory and evaluate it It can often lead to epiphanies where one realizes the morality of their life as good or evil and decides to change itIn my youth I was known to dream infrequently and had trouble keeping tabs on my dream journal in my psychology class The few dreams I did have were so mild of temperament and experience that I often forgot they occurred at all I realized at some point this coincided with the fact that I suffered ongoing insomnia and I often stayed up for multiple days at a time My attitude was that life was too short for sleep there were too many things to explore and appreciate to watch them pass idly by in ignorant blissThe only dream I do remember having was one that still terrifies me with every waking moment the one that sends shivers down my spine with every eyelid I see closed I remember waking up in an amorphous environment nothing was memorable except that there was just nothing there Oily shadows which ebbed and flowed in the vast infinity of this abyss before me The experience was in this first person as I looked down and saw my hands feet and body just as how it was in the real world The sheer quality of my vision and perception in this place was like that of a lucid dream mixed with all the governing laws of reality I began to walk aimlessly about hoping to find something or anything in the inky blackness that so completely enveloped me I wandered for what seemed like eternities until finally I came across a single door It was very odd because I had sat down to rest my tired legs and when I looked about again I saw it plain as day like it had always been thereSuddenly a startling clarification encroached my mind Youre not supposed to feel fatigue in a dream not supposed to feel the burden of time I felt the creeping sensation of dread crawl through every fiber of my being as I thought to myself I may never make it out of here or at least not the same What was this place I thought Was it purgatory hell heaven something in between Was I even still dreaming Was this a just punishment for my actions or was this where I must prove myself in some unknown test of character Time would have driven me insane had I not again had the fortune to bring the door into my gaze again Where had it come from What was its purpose Should I enter So many variables to a single constant element in this placeThankfully I had the luxury of time to ponder my decision I decided if I waited long enough I would wake up back in my old familiar house in my old familiar bed and I would wake up safe I felt instead of the previous awe and mystique I saw in the flowing shadows a sense of imminent danger about them I felt there to be an element of malice of hate in there as though it consumed them They were everywhere and there was only one of me Panicked I ran towards the door and thrust it open with all my might leading with my shoulderI was very confused when I arrived on the other side I saw the same overwhelming darkness and looked behind me to find the door so I might escape again It was gone however and I was right back where I started again Alone hungry tired thirsty and altogether desperate I felt myself getting weaker as my will slowly ebbed away as if it was absorbed by this damned oblivion Right then is when I saw itLike a mirage I didnt know if my eyes truly saw it but far in the distance beyond the haze of shadows was a vaguely manshaped figure I called out to it I waved at it each eccentric motion more exacerbated than the last Eventually I ran to it until it got close and then I saw just exactly what this figure was It was meMy view was from behind but I still knew the exact same head of hair the exact same body type the exact same length of the arms and legs the exact same musculature as my own I stopped dead in my tracks and froze every nerve in my body He looked around and stared me dead in the eye and a look of the most honest and real shock I have ever seen swept over his face His jaw gaped wide open his eyes larger than a sinkhole and his eyes locked mine for the briefest of moments And then he ranHe ran away from me with all the speed of a bat out of hell I pursued him but with great difficulty as I felt a pulsating pain in my chest that intensified the closer I got to him When I was just out of arms reach I felt a crushing exhaustion throughout all of my body By some miraculous feat of strength I was able to actually outrun him I wasted no time in leaping on him and tackling him to the ground I felt a shock in me that resounded with more force than if I had been hit with a thunderclap Time seemed to slow as we both fell to the ground and collapsed into it The last thing I saw was his faceI only glimpsed it before I woke up but what I saw haunts my every waking moment His flesh was already cold colder than even dry ice to the touch His skin was pale beyond pale and closer to being an unnatural shade of white unbeknownst to human vision His eyes stared lifelessly dead blank expressionless in no particular direction yet I felt as though they peered into my very soul His lips were crimson red the exact color of the very blood that runs in my veins I saw this and I FELT like a part of me had died when he didI woke up in my bed and threw myself into an upright position upon doing so I looked around the room and made absolutely sure everything was as it should be before letting my resolute guard down It was then that I felt the same overwhelming sense of fatigue and exhaustion I had felt in my dream I was starving and insatiably thirsty Moving any part of my body was met instantly with excruciating pain I looked at my clock to see if it was morning and it read  Satisfied I moved downstairs and cooked a savory meal of bacon and eggs and carried on my day as if nothing had happened until I looked at the messages on my answering machineThere were hundreds of them so many that the answering machine had deleted some of the old ones One was from work informing me that they had fired me from the company after three consecutive no callno shows on the job Another was from my parents wondering if I had got their package requesting that I call them back upon receiving it One was a startled message from my girlfriend wondering if anything was wrong as I missed our date and hadnt communicated with her in three days I listened to all of them and became more and more confused about the situationI looked at the calender to confirm my suspicions and they were proven to be true The current date was indeed three days from when I had fallen asleep before that terrible dream My mind was fucked This meant that not only was it the most realistic and coincidentally the only dream I remembered having but it took place in real time simultaneous to REAL life The fact raised the question though was I suffering from the exhaustion because the dream was real Was the man I killed a version of me in another dimension or universe Was the life I was living now even real Or was I just another version of him in that universe a mystery to be uncovered or a shocking discoveryThoughts raced through my mind as I simply stood there contemplating everything I had ever come to know and understand Should I be alive whats waiting there on the otherside is death really the endThis last question burned and lingered in my mind and I couldnt erase it no matter how hard and fruitlessly I tried It consumed me to the point where I had to kill myself to find out for sure I walked slowly deliberately and with a definite purpose over to the knife rack in the kitchen and picked out the large serrated butcher knife from it I placed it in my hand and envied the feel of the cold steel against my rough calloused palms The feel of the handle and the power to decide life and death at my fingertips I raised it ever so smoothly in the air and placed the blade right against my throat A smile creased my face as I took a deep breath and prepared for the unknownSuddenly in a flash he appeared before me and alarmed me to such a degree where I dropped the knife where it clattered earpiercingly on the floor The silence in that room was absolute and his presence so dominating that the only thing my eyes could focus on were him This was an impossibility though wasnt he dead Hadnt I felt his life force cease to be just as I felt the connection between us cease How is any of this making sense how could any of this happen in real lifeHe stood there solemn and unwavering in his posture His face showed not the slightest trace of emotion as he raised an outstretched arm and pointed a long finger in my direction His voice was calm yet boomed in the deafening silence He said four simple words which chilled my bones more than the dream ever could Four simple words that confirmed my worst fears and suspicions which lurked at the bottom of my subconscious mind He said simply Was I not enoughHe vanished after that He didnt fade from existence or blink into nothingness he simply vanished One moment I was looking right at him and the next he was gone I couldnt believe anything that had happened this had to be a nightmare I pinched myself I cut myself to see if I still bled I screamed I clawed at the walls I begged a merciful God in pity to not let this be real Eventually I conceded defeat and laid on the floor with eyes transfixed on the ceiling and closed my eyes But this time I never woke up,1385733288.0,Evasion of a

iamphiip,6,4,1rq1mr,15,I met Chris the summer before high school when his parents moved to town and our mothers became good friends Over time we became friends good friends and then best friends We remained close throughout high school but then he moved to Florida to work with his father and I joined the Army We still stayed in touch but a couple years went by before we saw each other again    I was taking leave for a few weeks and decided to swing by Florida for a few days before heading back to Korea for another year Chris picked me up at the airport and we spent the drive back to his apartment catching up The most interesting conversation was when he mentioned his apartment was haunted Shortly after Chris and his dad moved into the apartment Chris felt a strange presence in his bedroom The temperature in his room would drop several degrees even when the air conditioner was off and his computer chair would swivel for no apparent reason when he was on the opposite side of the room He told me he never felt threatened but he was sure his apartment was haunted    He told me he started his own investigation He read about a technique that was supposed to facilitate communication with the ghost He took a writing pad and pencil asked a question several times out loud then cleared his mind and started writing It would be jibberish at first something along the lines of safvhagjnLGFDKsfbvaDGSLKNdjghACKK After some time words would start to form as the ghost used Chris energy to direct the motion of his hand From this technique Chris learned the ghosts name was Jeremy and that he had committed suicide in that same room about a year before Chris moved in Jeremy said he was  when he died and he was lonely    Chris was skeptical at first but when he asked around the apartment complex he discovered that a  year old named Jeremy had in fact hung himself in the same apartment about a year before Chris and his father moved in The fact that this information matched exactly to the answers on the writing pad convinced Chris that Jeremy was a real ghost and really haunted the apartment    When we arrived at Chris apartment he showed me the writing pad and then told me he was going to take me into his bedroom and introduce me to Jeremy He said he needed to introduce me because Jeremy didnt like visitors and would sometimes make them feel uncomfortable until Chris told Jeremy to dial it down because the visitor was a friend Chris and I walked into his bedroom and he said out loud Jeremy this is Dylan He is my best friend and I want you to treat him with respect and be nice to him    The rest of the day passed without incident That night Chris offered to sleep on the couch and let me sleep in his bed if I was alright with that I said it was fine I was still skeptical about the ghost and I thought it might be an interesting adventure to sleep in a haunted room I was pretty reckless back then when I was in the Army I thought I was invincible so I didnt even consider that this might be a bad idea Besides Chris introduced me and Jeremy had never acted out against Chris friends once they had been properly introduced    I decided to do a little of my own investigating after Chris went to sleep I took out the writing pad asked Jeremy if he liked me cleared my mind and started writing After a while I must have fallen asleep because I had a nightmare that I couldnt breathe In the dream it felt like my throat was full of foam and there was a huge weight pushing down on my chest My throat burned and tightened but when I brought my hands up nothing was there I struggled and kicked and clawed at my chest and neck but the burning and the inability to breathe only got worse All my strength and Army training was useless Finally I had that falling sensation and woke up  Chris woke me up He said he had been asleep until he heard me thrashing around in the bedroom He came to check on me and found me sitting up against the wall asleep with my hands around my throat When he woke me up he said I slid down the wall a couple inches as if something had been holding me up off the matress My neck was sore so I went to the bathroom to look in the mirror I had bruises around my neck in a distinct pattern It wasnt bruises from my hands it was obviously a bruise from a rope    I went back into the bedroom and Chris was staring at the writing pad He asked me what I had been doing so I told him He showed me the writing pad and he was pale Among the scribbles and random letters was something I do not remember writing It said Jeremy is ONLY best friend,1385750356.0,A ghost tried to steal my best friend,19,nosleep,top_day

reko,5,3,1rp4cz,5,I advise that you read my first post if you havent already to get a better understanding of the situation httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsqgmregardingtheknockinginmywoodsHello everyone I apologize more than you know for the very slow update but I have a lot to shareA few days had passed from my first post and things were continuing as they had been for weeks The knocking growling Or whatever you want to call it continued every night It seemed to stay just outside of my treeline and I did my best to ignore it Last Saturday I heard a loud sound in the middle of the night I waited until the morning to investigate When I walked outside with my cigarette the next day a large section of my fence was broken down bent in a very unusual fashion I took pictures of it and I can upload them to Imgur or something if anyone is interested Anyway at this point I broke down and confronted my neighbor to see if he had anything to tell me about this He seemed distant about the subject but he told me that he used to camp out in the woods when hunting and that he began to experience the same type of thing  Not wanting to tell him that it terrified me I told him about the fence and how it was becoming hard to sleep because of the noise He suggested an idea that I was scared to follow through with at first but we wound up doing After sharing a bottle of Jack Daniels and discussing our ideas about what we were dealing with the plan went into motionOur blood fused with whiskey and pumping through our veins some warm clothes and two shotguns we sat outside the following Tuesday night We sat in the shadow of the barn that sits by my fence in silence solemnly passing the bottle back and forth The sounds kicked up around  AM so we sat perfectly still and waited for something anything to happen The rustling in the woods got louder the growls got more intense and my grip on that shotgun was like a castaway clinging to driftwood I began to wonder what the fuck we were thinking we didnt even know what was running through our woods CRACKMy neighbors shotgun shot off as a stick cracked directly behind us We both spun around half falling over and obviously terrified Nothing was there but as the resonance from the gunshot died down so did the rustling and growling We both stood there for a good ten minutes just staring into the darkness Silently agreeing that we had done enough we parted ways and went back to our houses The new silence that engulfed my house was even more unpleasant than the constant and overwhelming knocking I could hardly concentrate I had become so used to the sounds that the absence of them drove me wild I eventually got myself to get some sleep but it wasnt deep sleep by any meansThe rest of that week even leading up to tonight escalated from returning to normal to Hell on Earth My girlfriend came home two nights ago and I have yet to tell her about the occurrences Im running out of things to do and it seems that every night the darkness is inching closer and the knocking is worse than ever When the knocking did start up again it was worse It was less of a hushed thing and now it was loud angry sounding The knocking was also at closer intervals but the episodes of knocking and growling last shorter amounts of timeAgain Im sorry for the slow update and I know this post is probably all messed up but Ive barely gotten any sleep lately Ill do my best to clean this up if it needs it and Ill keep you all updated as events occur Stay safe No Sleep,1385709674.0,Regarding the Knocking in my Woods Update,8,nosleep,top_day
