MrTig,49,90,1rpisc,358,Being one out of the twelve teenagers of my extended family cousins etc and one being technically minded it fell to me to help diagnosefix issues my family had with their hardwareThis included tuning my parents TV repairing failed computerslaptops installing new OSs and general tech supportOne delightful summer my now former uncle asked me to help recovery images hed deleted in error while attempting to reinstall his OS I had a few tools I knew would work for this took the hard drive away and said it could take a few days I had other things queued up and that I might not get everything backMy then uncle then gave me a firm tone  MrTig dont look at any of the files you recover they have sensitive data in them I honestly didnt care I intended to recover as much as I could reinstall his OS and hand the files backMy major mistake was his understanding of looking and by that he meant even looking at the file namesRestoring the content back to the disk with about  of his images lost which later turned up on a pen drive he just happened to find I returned the drive refitted it and told him they should be thereHalf an hour later I get a rage filled call stating You looked at my files theyve all been modified while you claimed you only recovered them It would appear that a small amount of knowledge here has been dangerous Because the new created date was a few days ago my uncle assumed that Id instead rifled through over  files because I was a nosey buggerTried to explain that because it had been created on a new drive for recovery it would say created on recent date but refused to have itIt would later transpire the reason for his protectiveness was the nature of some of the files relating to his business not being above board,1385732097.0,Dont look at my files,448,TalesFromTechsupport,hot
jooiiee,28,41,1rpivn,96,I am on paper a student in a school that specializes in IT and that lets students that have the knowledge help with IT related things During my ½ years at this school I have helped with rouge DHCP servers several times WiFi overhauls server builds installs and fixes Nobody in house knows nix network redesigns and a fair share of both student and teacher laptop issues and troubleshooting  IE I have had a lot experience and everybody knows me and talks to me if they need help including the principals Every year we have about  new students starting that gets a brand new laptop This is usually not a problem and the first interaction I have with said laptop is when I borrow one to see the specs of them but this year that was not the case This year some smart fella decided to without notice give us active directory connected computers I heard this day two of the term when the principal old tech and teacher spoke about students not having logins and since we study windows server I instantly told them that this would be a problem The answer I got was that the central IT department was promising that it would be safe and that they would have local admin so they can install software and they would not be able to sign in on one another computersA few days go by and we finally get the accounts for our  affected users to the email of the local so called PC tech He printed the lists and put them in his room while we gathered our forces two d grade students to start giving them out to the students that for a week had not been able to use their brand new computers But do you think we got the lists when we got there No we did not But this story is not about how the the so called PC tech prioritized a single d grade student that broke his computer the day before over  students that has not been able to use their computers for a week Or how he yelled at me when I told him to re prioritize This story is about something worse After we distributed the logins to the students doing our best to make sure the right student got the right account I said I did not thrust the system and asked for a testing system and was promptly given one As it turns out everything that central IT had said was wrong and I had to go in to the principals office close the doors pull the curtain and explain that the students could use their own logins to gain full admin on all of the computers Including all of the teachers computers And all of the principals computers And then showed him on his own computer when I accessed his files The alarm bells rung and a few scary days later central IT had fixed the AD so students could not log in with admin right on teachers computers any more We could finally breath again But fear not the story is not over yet Remember I told you the school specializes in IT Its only a matter of time before the students try hacking each other something that is not a problem in it self as long as they play nice and so far they have always done that Ye old hosts file patch and desktop background prank the stuff you did when you were young But remember that they can use their own credentials to log in to other laptops with full admin privileges and not only prank when the computer is left unlocked Not that very good Once again central IT promised a solution and last week I heard the solution was done Note that the first issues were in august but all has been fine and only the nice students have figured out what they can do with their friends laptops but I did not trust the solution again so I grabbed my testing laptop once again and checked if their solution worked It did not and resulted in a new email to central IT telling them to get their shit together since it was broken This may seem crazy but this is just bad IT and bad IT is not what this subreddit is about This subreddit is about the absolutely horrible act from the local so called PC tech to central IT after he was CCd in a mail earlier today where they asked for help with testing if they had fixed it This was his response it central IT gt Hello NAMEgt gt Sorry I could not answer your mail earlier I have been on vacation th november And after that I have had still have lots of stuff to do regarding student laptop issues cases and lots of stuff on the janitorial front gt gt New things come from the central IT department all the time that we on the school have to adapt to and that really takes from the active worktime in all sorts of ways gt gt I will try to dedicate time to this in the beginning of next week and see what is new then gt gt Have a nice weekend No that is how he writes I just translated it from swedish The best part The so called PC tech has no idea what AD is and how it works so he does not understand the problem As a effect of that the issue was not on his table This issue has taken a total of  minutes of his time that he has spent reading the emails that he was CCd in and that is the only thing he had to do But he just lashed out against the guys that tried to fix our problem HOW THE FUCK WHAT I DONT EVEN HE WORKS IN IT WHATI would not expect better from a regular user but this guy does it support himself What Oh and this is also the guy that told me you have to be hard and mean against the support agents to get what you want I was nice and calm and got exactly what I wanted but that was above his understanding TLDR Of course he did it was a rhetorical question ,1385732227.0,Did he just send angry emails to central IT because they are trying to fix our

Gambatte,37,87,1rodh8,235,I was sick and tired of the company so I was breaking out my notice was in Off to better and brighter places or at least so I thoughtAs a result of handing in my notice I was transferred to the training school to help administer the training courses until my final day My job now basically consisted of sitting on a computer reading a thousand or more pages of Megatokyohttpwwwmegatokyocom a day I was intrigued by the early insane antics of Largo but I lost interest in the story later on about the time I discovered the Order of the StickhttpwwwgiantitpcomcomicsootslatesthtmlSo Im chilling out on a Friday morning doing nothing in particular when one of the instructors comes down Turns out the PFY from S is for Standardshttpredditrlvnp was on a course there Or at least he was meant to beThe conversation between instructors was essentially as followsgt  Is PFY in the officegt  No  is he meant to be heregt  Well hes not in the classroom no ones seen him at all todaygt  The trainees got paid yesterday didnt they Last time they got paid which was fortnightly PFY went out drinking all night and showed up nearly two hours lategt  What punctuality requirements were specified in the contracts you could be hit with major penalties for being late or not showing up even to internal coursesgt  He said he had a flat on the way to class so I asked him to show me the flat tire When his spare didnt have a puncture he said hed stopped to get it fixed  despite the fact he was already running late When I asked why he didnt call from the garage to explain his lateness he said his cellphone was flat and the garage wouldnt let him use their phone When I asked him to produce a receipt for the repair he finally broke down and confessed hed been lying the whole time and that he actually got drunk and slept through his alarmgt  Whaagt  I know right I let him off with a warning  I didnt care much that he was late but dammit you do not lie about it and especially not right to my faceSo the instructors all disappeared down to the classroom to further question PFYs classmates in case one of them had received a phone call or text message from him Instructor  stuck around for a while calling the local medical center police station and anywhere else he could think of that PFY might be that would be a legitimate excuse for his absence Having had no luck he joined the others in the classroomFunnily enough one of the guys at the company BF had been dating a girl GF that worked as a nurse at the local medical center He had come over that morning to pick up some training materials for his PFYsSo it had come down to me and BF in the office when the main office line rang As the only official member of the training school in the office I picked it up Who should it be but the PFYFrom my previous experience with PFY I could tell by the thin reedy voice he was using that he was not well  the kind of selfinflicted not wellgt PFY Is  theregt ME Hes just down in the classroom Ill see if hes availableI put the phone on mute and walked the portable down to  who was just heading back to the officegt ME  its PFY and by the sound of it he is capital H capital O Hung Overgt  Oh this should be good took the call right next to my desk in the office so I was privy to his end of the conversation PFY claimed that he was at the local medical office  knew this was false as hed already checked there PFY claimed he was having liquid nitrogen treatment for warts The medical facility only received one delivery of liquid nitrogen per week on a Tuesday morning which was completely used up by Tuesday afternoon This was common knowledge to anyone that had been through the procedure before It was also required that you clear it with your workplace before going to the medical facility for anything minor minor being anything that didnt immediately prevent you from working PFY claimed he was in a treatment room with GF BF said that GF had just finished a double shift about an hour previously and had been sound asleep in their bed when he left for work that morning about half an hour ago so that was definitely not true then asked the PFY to put GF who was supposedly in the room with him on the phonegt  Im sorry if this is embarrassing for you GF but youve got one of the worst voices Ive ever heard on a femalegt  gt  Get your ass in here as soon as you can PFYgt  gt  Yes you are very much in the sYes the PFY had decided that the best course of action rather than confessing to going out and getting drunk and sleeping through his alarm again was to lie about it and when caught in that lie to impersonate a femaleFALLOUTAlthough I left the company before seeing the whole spectrum of the fallout I know the entire incident was promptly written up by  and passed on to HR for disciplinary actionThe immediate response from HR was Its not April  is this some kind of joke that I dont

Sounderhawks,140,192,1rn4x4,590,I was told to post this here after putting it in a thread in rtechnology Hopefully its something that will make you laugh Im finally at a point where I laugh about it Please forgive me if it isnt too clear Its been  years since then and Ive been out for  years in college so some of the real technical details have fadedAboard Al Asad in Iraq there was a huge morale drive I was in the Networking Division of unit on base We had a few extra IPs We attached a large NAS to one of our Staff NCOs machines so that if we ever got in trouble theyd just tell them to take it down If it was a Sergeant or below theyd probably end up getting ninjapunched and losing rankAnyway when night shift came on I monitored was able to que up and download most of the Al Asad Morale Drive which at the time was supported by G aka the IT department at the General Officer level When the time to return home came we had close to TB of movies music and TV shows We were somehow acquiring great quality copies of the newest episodes of TV shows I remember getting the newest episode of Generation Kill within  days of it airing back in the USFlash forward about  months and my unit is deploying out to what at the time was a small presence MEB for those who know what that is Camp Bastion When we arrived there wasnt much and we did a lot of work to repair the damage the unit we were replacing had done Since this was our units first full deployment into Afghanistan we took pretty much the best people we could forward in every department This means we had lots of experience in our unitWhen we arrived we were told we dont have a morale drive because we dont have the resources to manage it Well we had more IPs than we needed at the time so we threw that old NAS up on the network We password protected it to our unit to preserve bandwidth This worked fantastic for about two weeks until our S happenedFor those of you who dont know S is the logistics part of a unit They decided to give our password out to various units on the base in exchange for favors Withing  days our unit could barely do any work because our bandwidth was being hammered We decided to change the password againUnfortunately this pissed off the whole base The next day we had calls and emails from angry Es and above asking why the base morale drive had been taken downThis all happened fast so we still werent aware that it was the S who got us in the mess We start replying to the emails like this This is our units asset This isnt the bases server Therefore we are the ones who decide if we will allow access to everyone outside our unit Currently the bandwidth it was using was cutting into performance on our mission critical systems When infrastructure improves we will consider restoring access to the morale driveThis did not go over well There is no fury quite like that of an entitled Master Gunnery Sergeant Soon enough G comes calling asking about access to the morale drive We tell them no for the aforementioned reasons They respond that they have the power to take anything off the network and order us to hand it over to them so they can administer itWe say no because we have a portion of it only accessible to us which had a bunch of things like cracked software cracked versions of LAN games etc We had built an internal network to our department so that after shift change people could hang our and blow off steamWe saw the writing on the wall so we had friends back in the states ship another of the same model NAS out with extra hard drives We backed everything up to that NAS then hid it in some space in one of our legacy servers racks Finally we wiped the harddrives and repeatedly dropped the original NAS until it wouldnt turn on anymoreWe took the broken NAS with the blank harddrives to G The final straw for turnover was their Information Assurance Manager deciding that he was confiscating it because it was a security vulnerability to the internal network Thats the one thing we really couldnt fight since he just has a senior officer sign off on itFor the next couple of months all of us had strange issues with our admin permissions being adjusted and other random annoying netadmin trolling commenced What they didnt know is that we had the domain admin password because they left it in plaintext in a startup scriptAt this point it probably seems really petty and it was However when youre deployed for several months these petty things build up We were pissed because we felt like we were A being punished for trying to provide a service that didnt work out B our stuff was taken with no compensation and C G were fucking with us just because they had nothing better to doAfter we started having random things disappear from our share drive we started counterattacking them Things escalated a bit but they didnt really know how we were getting in Certain people started taking liberties with our billet of being information security personnel They reasoned they could tap into other peoples harddrives if they were connected and delete anything that didnt belong on an official government networkThat all changed when someone deleted the wrong persons pornographic material Technically no porn is allowed on the network This means no naked pictures emailed from the states etc Well apparently these were naked pictures of this guys wife that went missing He took his harddrive to the Colonel of G and had it given to the IAMThat launched a pretty long investigation into my department that ended up with several senior NCOs being relieved of duty and even sent home earlyIronically that wasnt the worst investigation I had done to memy department while deployed By that point I actually knew my rights and was able to skate freeTlDR Attempted to have a morale drive for our unit since one wasnt up Entitled senior enlisted decide their happiness is more important than the bandwidth we needed to run our servers Leads to netadmin troll war between us and a superior unit This leads to a serious investigation and relief of senior leaders This also made our CO mad because it made the unit look bad and we were basically annexed into HQ instead of being our own department and thus got thrown into the mix of a bunch of shitty billetsIf you guys like this one I have one more long one like this about the same department getting investigated on a different deployment That one is my personal favorite because it was the perfect storm of incompetence witch hunting and a command trying to deflect attention from gross misconduct

Gambatte,15,37,1rlvnp,155,About a year after the events of T is for Testedhttpredditrjrxi I was leading a small group of technicians in a field office Our support area was the network connecting multiple other devices which had their own specialized support teams the interface devices and the systems that collated and correlated the dataOne of the listed tasks assigned to all new as in fresh out of the training courses technicians was to produce an overview of all of the systems in the office This was quite involved and usually ended up requiring the production of at least three documents each of which would be approved by the supervisor of the team for the relevant areaSo on a semiregular basis a new batch of fresh technicians would arrive in the office theyd complete their listed tasks and receive a pay rise on completion of their on job training book and become available for further training and promotion Generally the OJT book could be completed in a couple of months with a little bit of effortExcept for one particular pimply faced youth PFY He slacked off and never bothered to progress his OJT book at all Much like the PFY of T is for Tested his attitude saw him bounced from department to department Suddenly eight months have passed and the training department is trying to schedule him on a course for further training with a view to promotion when it becomes apparent that he doesnt meet the requirements having still not completed his OJT bookQueue mad rush to get it completed in under two weeksHis system overview hit my desk I picked it up and read through it and immediately wondered why someone who was in such a desperate rush to get it completed had taken the time to Photoshop a photo on page one so that the pictured screen read PFY IS THE MASTERNaturally the write up was a mess Sections that should have had pages of information were covered in four sentences Sections that should have been covered in four sentences went on for pages and pagesSo heavily annotated with the required corrections the draft was returned to the PFY It was not uncommon for three drafts to be required five was not unheard ofWithin two hours he submitted the second draft having changed only one paragraph And again the same comments were madeThe third draft was the same  one paragraph changed despite pages of required corrections I pulled him into the office closed the door and went over every required correction I did everything short of dictate the required text to himFourth draft  one paragraph And the fifth And so onBy the time I was about to reject his eighth draft I was pulled into the office by my supervisor SUgt SU Whats going on with PFY Im catching some flak from the training department over his OJT book and they tell me one of the last things hes got to do is your system overview Has he done itgt ME Well hes triedgt SU What do you meangt ME reaching into hammerspace Heres his latest draft  number eight as I recall Ive already annotated it with where corrections or more information is required Every one of his drafts that I have rejected has had this information and most of the time the information hasnt changedgt ME also from hammerspace For comparison heres an overview that meets the required standardMy supervisor quickly flicked through the two documents and rapidly agreed that the produced overview did not meet the required standardWhich is when the fun startedIn order to assist with the rapid completion of the overview PFY was assigned to my department I was given strict instructions he was to be given all the support he asked for and no other tasks until his overview was up to standard He had  access to the system every reference document except for the previously accepted standard meeting overviews and access to the personnel who knew the system inside and out namely me and my team of PFYsA further three weeks pass Once PFY learned he was to receive no tasks until the overview was completed he spent the time watching DVDs and playing PS  for comparison I received eight drafts in seven days then he was explicitly given nothing else to work on I received two drafts in three weeksEventually with a great deal of encouragement read punishment that increased with each passing day between submissions an acceptable overview was completed and PFY was out of my hair and off on a training courseAnd then his performance review form arrived Again by virtue of him bouncing around so much the time he spent with his thumb firmly implanted in his rear pretending to work was more than with anyone else I tried to pass it off to his previous supervisor PS seeing as hed actually done some work for him but he bluntly refusedSo I filled it out honestlyThe form then went to management for approval and thats when the REAL fun startedApparently PSs manager did not agree with my review PS also disagreed with it when they confronted me about it I mentioned that I had specifically offered PS the chance to fill it out but he had refused to do sogt PS Youre only giving him a bad review because you dont like himgt ME I offered you the chance to fill it out Wait are you saying that I review on factors other than performanceThen PS dropped the bomb he had previously had the PFY of T is for Tested working for him who had filled his head with how much I sucked to work for how I hated my PFYs and how I loved to throw my weight around bully them and so on Despite having known me for years PS had decided to believe this rubbishI was beyond livid at this point I had reached a point where anger gives way to calm resolve in a way I suspect is similar to a fullblown psychotic break I took a deep breath picked up the nearest phone and made a couple of callsMy entire team of PFYs assembled Individually and as a group they all swore that I was one of the better supervisors theyd worked for and had no knowledge of any kind of bullying or harassing actions on my partThe IC from T is for Tested arrived hed transferred to that office not long after I had and laid out the truth of T is for Tested independently verifying that the lies that had been spread about me were completely baselessMy supervisor arrived and verified that the drafts the PFY had handed in had not met the required standard and yes we had an independent source to verify againstPFYs poor review stood  not that it even mattered he was promoted immediately after completing his training course which obviated all performance reviews poor or otherwise from his prior levelPS received an unofficial verbal reprimand for his gossipmongering which he promptly blamed me for He went out drinking to forget his selfinflicted troubles eyed up the wrong girl at the bar made the wrong smartass comment to her enormous boyfriend and ended up with a fractured eye socket and three titanium plates holding his face togetherKarma never worked so well in my favor beforeIt occurred to me later that the old maxim people are often guilty of the very sins they loudly decry may apply and talking in confidence to PSs PFYs revealed that the more he liked them aka the more they would go boozing with him in the weekends the better their performance reviews would readUnfortunately because of the fallout of this event I was never in a position where I could pass that information on to management without it looking like a move from malice or spite rather than a genuine desire that the procedure for conducting performance reviews be followedBrowse other volumes of the

abigviking,6,12,1rlcy9,64,This isnt a facepalming story but a funny oneI work for the support sector of the Services department at my company As the most senior engineer in my skill set in North America it has become my responsibility to train newlyhired support engineers on a few of the many products we support  specifically the products in my skill setOur company is global and I work at HQ so new hires are flown in to our site for training from around the world With this brings many accents and dialects which is important to this storyMy favorite product to train on is software that does keyword spotting in calls Its a fairly new product and we havent had many cases for it yet but we still train on the basics of how it works how to configure it etc You can assign scores to the word if it is spoken by the agent or customer alert Supervisors if a customer is ticked off and do a lot of other neat things During training each new engineer gets a test machine to set up and configure the software and run tests on it This is why its my favorite one  I usually end up telling them to use inappropriate phrases for testing Just for turds amp chucklesUsually I start by telling the newbies to pick their own phrases Some of them come back and tell me I cant think of anything and this is when I jump I tell them to use bag of dicks or crouching woman hidden cucumber to start There is a lot of filthy language thrown around at the office so this isnt out of the ordinary They usually have a good laugh and go with itThis one particular newbie was a very special case for me and the root of this story He was a small Malaysian guy It was very easy to make him laugh and he was fun to hang out with I told him to use bag of dicks and run a test to see if the system would catch that he just said it This software is actually very good at understanding accents but in the training lab most people use American English The British and Australian engineers will often switch to their respective dialects to make it easier on them but we dont have any Asian language recognition of any sort in the software quite yet to be released in later updates down the roadSo I end up having this engineer in the training lab trying to test this phrase and check to see that the system catches itTrainee Bag of dicks  System Nothing  Trainee Bag of dicks  System Nothing  Trainee Bag Of Dicks  System Nothing  This went on for some time He was laughing the whole time along with everyone else and occasionally saying Its not working Why isnt it working Bag of dicks He was never yelling it but he was projecting it pretty loudly I kept trying to help him adjust his accent and say the phrase differently After  tries it finally was caught by the system Much laughter was had by all in the room and a few engineers that popped their heads in to see what was happeningtldr Foreign support engineer trainee makes testing of keyword spotting software hilarious for training group,1385581383.0,Training the newbie support engineers,76,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

Meltingteeth,184,225,1rjd61,943,Quick background This is back from my tier support days at a university This generally involved me sitting at a desk waiting for students to bring me their computers when they had some sort of issue however occasionally I worked with staff members and various departments across campus This happened during my final weeks at this job I received a call from the head of the relatively small Reference department The department head was a crotchety old man COM who submitted trouble tickets like he was trying to win the lottery He had been working at this job for a solid decade and was stubborn as a mule COM had said that his computer was running ridiculously slow Checking old tickets I saw that he had complained of this three times before The first time they had wiped a solid amount of trash programs files and registry redundancies This legitimately helped him The next two times he had demanded that they take it to the workbench for servicing because it was still slow and there was obviously something wrong Both times they found nothing I massage my temples as he talks and tell him Ill be right over to look at itTen minutes later Im in COMs office looking at his computer Its nothing fancy just a Dell Optiplex i and  gigs of RAM He didnt need it for anything other than database study and library cataloging Predictably COM tells me quote The damn thing is far too slow and never speeds up when you people bring it back from repair I wish you would just fucking replace it already IBM computers are absolute shit This little bit was important because it showed me that he had absolutely no clue what kind of computer he was usingNow I have a pretty high patience level but I get particularly annoyed when users say you people and swear at me I inspect his computer and theres nothing urgently wrong with it He has an Ask toolbar installed but nothing thats eating resources or bogging it down After a few more minutes of COMs bickering I have a fun idea and tell him that Im going to take it over to the workbench transfer all of his files safely and give him a new processor and more memory I usually try to keep terminology as simple as possible with users but the larger words are always there to boost user confidence and add flair So I take COMs computer over to the workbench and grab a pail of cleaning supplies As you can probably guess from this I spend the next ten minutes dusting out his computer and wiping every safe surface down with Clorox wipes By the time Im done the computer looks brand new I even snagged an i badge from a shelved unit in the back and put it on the front I bring the shiny new model to COMs office I tell him that Ive upgraded his memory as well as installed an i processor and ask him to try it out Right away I get Jesus Christ thats much better out of him I stick around for another minute to change some accessibility settings for him and leave his office as he provides me with a low Thanks kid The influx of tickets from COM fortunately stopped for the rest of the time I was there however I wonder to this day if he took my replacement as an example of how to acquire new equipment At the very least it shouldnt have been too hard for helpdesk to outfit him with a new mouse and keyboardTLDR Angry older user demands a newer faster computer Clorox wipes and a sticker are the best upgrade,1385513663.0,My computer is running too slow replace it with a new one A case study on the placebo effect,1168,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

Gambatte,30,32,1rjrxi,116,A quick one for today TFTS the bloodwolves are out in force today and I have a VM that keeps crashing for no apparent reason  must be those damned checks list transient voltagesA few weeks after the events of M is for Musophobiahttpredditrj the very same pimply faced youth PFY as starred in that story had done very little but bombard me with how amazingly fantastic he was at everything to do with IT and technical support Arrogant egotistic totally up himself  these words barely do him justice He would constantly tell everyone around him about his monster computer which would simultaneously run  WoW accounts and Glider  grinding his latest set of accounts up to level cap which hed then promptly sell on eBay But he considered himself too cool to actually play WoWSo basically the worst kind of scum you can find in ITOn this particular Friday morning I was at my desk on the third floor and he was midspiel about he awesome he was in his previous role at the IT department when I received an email from the IC of the building the IC had recently been upgraded to a full office and it was time to move his PC The IC was all sorts of stupid stories for another time but at least he knew that he didnt know about computers so had put the request through to my teamWe did this stuff all the time but I was down a few team members due to some recent departmental reshuffling and everyone else was busy I tuned back into the PFYs selfaggrandizing rantgt PFY basically I was running the entire IT team which made the actual supervisor look bad so he got me transferred over heregt ME PFY the building IC needs his computer moved Seeing as youre so good at IT it shouldnt take you long to move his computer from his old desk to the new one rightgt PFY Thats easy Half hour topsgt ME Well we dont have much on this morning and its the IC so take your time do it right Hell be a massive PITA if its not done right the first time Hes getting a second screen added as well which is already in the officegt PFY SureSo about two hours pass and I come back from my morning vitamin D session to find PFY sitting in the office checking his emailsgt ME Have you finished moving the ICs computergt PFY Yeah it was easy like I saidgt ME Okay another jobs come in soand I left it at that PFY was trying to get promoted to my IC position or at least a position at the same level on one of the other teams so in the back of my head I thought I could take him at his word that the job was doneI should have known better Actually I did know better but I disregarded my instinct its okay I would pay for my hubris laterSo PFY is set to work on some other task and we go about our dayAbout  pm PFY gets a call and has to go to another department for the rest of the day I make a note to follow up with that department so as to make sure he hasnt just taken off early for the weekendAbout half an hour to closing and I finally get hold of someone at that department Theyre basically closed and noone has any idea that the PFY is meant to be there I make myself a note to reprimand the PFY first thing on Monday its not a good idea to be lying to take off early on a Friday when youve got your hopes up for a promotionClosing time finally arrives and I start to head out of the building My exit route just happened to take me past the building ICs new office where I see him looking behind his screen with a very confused expression on his facegt ME Hey IC whats upgt IC Oh my computers not going for some reasongt ME When did this startgt IC Oh I havent used it since its been in this office  Ive been in meetings with the boss all day Thats why it was the perfect time to get my office movedgt ME Give me a second Ill see what I can doI look behind the screen and notice that there is no power or VGA cable plugged in Hmm weird Maybe they forgot to supply one with the second screenCheck other screen same thingAt about this point I let out an expletive that could be heard clearly throughout the building as we were on the third floor having it heard on the ground floor was quite an achievementI checked the back of the computer No cords there either No power no ethernet certainly no VGA cablesSearching through the ICs old desk I found all of the cables in a tangled mess After spending the next half hour untangling them and connecting them into the appropriate sockets I had the ICs computer powered up and working on both screens Of course I then had to sit through the boot up and log in sequence to make sure that everything was working correctlyBoth the building IC and I did not leave until an hour after closing that nightCome Monday morning PFY was late getting in some excuse about a medical appointment just like first thing every other Monday I quickly consulted with the building IC who promptly approved my plan a quick call to the front desk let the security guards in on it tooYou see access to each floor was controlled by an RFID tag When the PFY arrived that day he gained access to the elevator and stairwell but found his card would not get him through the third floor door Eventually he tailgated someone else through the door and made it to the officeHe dropped into his seat by the large whiteboard that we kept current outofoffice task assignments on so as to know where a particular PFY should be if they were not immediately on hand and started cursing about the broken access control system and how he could build a better one himselfI picked up the phone and made a call Within minutes the building IC arrived with his boss in tow followed by a security guard I met them at the office door and brought them to the PFYs deskgt PFY Whats going ongt ME I tasked you with moving the ICs computer on Friday did I notgt PFY Yeahgt ME And you told me you had finished it did you notgt PFY I did finish itgt ME THEN WHY DID THE IC AND I SPEND AN HOUR ON FRIDAY NIGHT MAKING IT WORKgt PFY It must have broken after I leftgt ME Oh I see  so every single cable just disconnected themselves moved back to the original office and put themselves in a drawer did theygt PFY Whagt ME Turn your head to the right and tell me what is written across the top of the whiteboardgt PFY Task Locationgt ME Across the topgt PFY A job is notgt ME Continuegt PFY A job is not completed until it is testedgt ME Correct So given the way that the job was completed on Friday I must conclude that you either chose to ignore this offices standard procedure for completing work or that you are so incompetent as to not be able to determine the difference between a working computer and one with no cables connected to it AT ALL or that you did almost nothing for over two hours lied about completing the job and hoped you wouldnt get caughtgt PFY Bugt ME interrupting him midword near trembling with ragegt ME SHUTgt ME UPgt ME None of these options are suitable for a person to continue working here either in this office or for megt ME Compounding the matter is the fact that you lied about an out of office job on Friday leaving the rest of the team to pick up the slack while you took off for an early weekend Ive been in touch with the department head to confirm both on Friday afternoon and again this morning and no one asked for you to go over there nor saw you in the buildinggt ME Your card access to this building has been limited to unclassified areas only and will be revoked completely as soon as you leave the building You are to report to the general resource pool immediately  Ill be calling your new supervisor to let them know that youre on your waygt ME to Security Guard Please escort this man out of the buildinggt ME to PFY Get the hell out of my buildingPFY was escorted away by Security and IC came up to megt IC You looked like you wanted to swear at himgt ME Because I didgt IC I still think we should have kept him around to scrub the toiletsgt ME So he could do a terrible job of that too Better to just be rid of himPOSTSCRIPT Two weeks later HR sent me the performance review form for that particular PFY I sent it back with a note saying that he no longer worked for my department with a full transcript of the reasons whyThey sent it back apparently hed lasted longer working for me than any of his previous departmentsI filled it out  brutally honestly My final line While PFY does show some technical aptitude his unwarranted arrogance leads him to have a lackadaisical and borderline insubordinate attitude which prevents him from gaining any significant experience in this roleMy counterpart at the general resource pool where people who are still under contract but unable to perform their duties end up later told me that he had put him in a team that was clearing bushes from outside a company building The following day he had to move him to a team that was painting a wall as he was unable to follow the safety instructions for using the chainsawLast I heard the PFY had moved on to a sales role with another companyBrowse other volumes of the

deshe,83,157,1ri4te,563,  All names of individuals and businesses have been replaced Gather around yall and hear the story of Elijah the most eccentric ISP user of them allIt happened in the year  I was just a  years old youngling then working at the tech support call center of my countrys largest ISP telling people to turn it off and then turn it back on and try again for a living I was half decent at my job so after a while the lords of the internet decided to bestow me with the responsibility of taking customer complaints at nightThere were three of us during night shifts Me a business sector support representative and a shift manager The explained how things work in the land of the night  I would get calls from ordinary customers and in the rare occasions where two would call at the same time the business support representative would bite the bullet and take it Having these technicalities laid down in front of me they proceeded to a string of tales which all shared the same motif  the nighttime customers are batshit insane but most of them are tame compared to the one they call Elijah the most batshit insane technically inept socially handicapped short tempered internet user of them allOh I remember the first time I encountered Elijahs presence It was a second order encounter but the waves of fuckingcrazy hit me like a truck The business sector tech support got a call while I was busy with another user By the time I was done with him I heard her scream at the top of her lungs into her headset No I said no I am not going to help you with that Because that is criminal and not my job way to go Maria Show him whats for After some time she eventually wore him down we have a nohangup policy and he left the conversation steaming Was was that Elijah I asked a question whose answer I already knew Yes she said he wanted to hack ltgeneric dating sitegt and asked me to tell him their IP addressFast forward several months At this point I am a top notch night rep the word of my insane turn it off and then turn it back on skillz hit the streets Oh yeah I was getting a lot of attitude I have had the pleasure to support Elijah several times and he always was a hoot for example he once mailed me a screenshot of a chat software and when I asked what he wants me to do with it he told me that he doesnt know English so I should translate it for him All in all he seemed like a lonely man looking for some human interaction I felt for him which is exactly why I was not ready for things to comeI remember that night all to well The sea was angry that night my friends Mars was in the second house poising Ares to wage wars amongst men The oceans were boiling and four horsemen haunted the skies I had a night shiftAt first things were working out as well as they ought to The amount of calls steeply subsided as the hours passed and before I knew it we were in the wacko timezone  a narrow portion of the day just shy of three hours long between when the last young productive member of society went to sleep and the first senior citizen geezer of the day who wasnt able to read his mail because his cat disconnected his monitor These hours are usually almost completely call free up to the occasional daranged lunatic who lost connectivity at AM in the middle of the week and decided hed rather bother tech support than going the fuck to sleepThe phone rangI picked it upThis and that ISP this is deshe how may I be of my attempt to initiate the conversation with the formal greeting was severed by a throng of icoherent semisentences in a voice I recognized as Elijahs Listen I have a picture You get me A picture And I want to put this picture where all the other pictures are and where there is the my computer and the my documents and the internet symbol Do you understand meHello Are you there I have a picture and IYeah yeah I heared you the first time Elijah Do you want to use that picture as your desktop background I guessedNo you dont understand Listen I have a picture I want to put this picture where there is my computer and where there is my documents and where there is all the other pictures Do you understand me do you want to create a shortcut to that picture an arrow in the darkNo Are you even listening Listen I

half an hour there was actually a call in the queue and here I was knee deep in giving support to the most incoherent man on earth regarding stuff which are not even within my authority to support I

that guy Listen all I want to do is to have to have the picture in the where the my computer is where the cats and the dogs and flowers are blooming oh my god I could actually feel his mental state deteriorating througout uttering that sentence I fell in to my compassion and beyond my best judgement decided to give it one last shot before referring him to Microsoft againSo I explained to him how to put a shortcut of the image on the desktop which only took  minutes  and all was goodGee thanks  Elijah said you are much better at this than the other guy what did you say his name was deshe yes deshe He sucks John you could teach him a thing or twoWell thanks I said doing my best to conceal my laughter I decided not to come forward Elijahs intentions were never bad and there was no reason to make him feel like the idiot he actually wasAnd that was that the story about the time that a customer tried to tell me how bad a representative I am behind my back an all time Elijah classicEPILOGUEI kept my position at the night watch for sveral months to come during which I have spoke with Elijah many a time He was never violent or rude just an utter loon He was not a good person he was of the harassing mysogenistic types which I have come to learn from hearing the female tech support rep versions of the tales of Elijah but I attributed it to his loneliness and apparent lack of nuts and boltsSeveral months later I was promoted the hell out of there and left as soon as I could I was still getting emails from the call center and learned that my successors at the graveyard shift were not as patient They decided they should not deal with him anymore They complained and the security chief complied issuing a formal restraining order from the police Elijah was now formally a persona nongrataFast forward three years I am not working there anymore I moved to another city to get a degree and did not keep in touch One friday evening out of the blue I get a phone call from an unrecognized number I took itHelloListen I have a picture OK OK that didnt actually happenWhat actually happenned that the guy on the phone was a colleague from my tech support days and well aware of Elijahs shannanigansDude he told me get to a TV and change the channel to the enterntainment channel NOWSo I did There was an episode of A Star Is Born which is the local equivalent of American Idol They were at the initial auditioning part which meant sifting through a bunch of basket cases and occasionally airing the more ludacris ones The guy on the screen was horrid He was fat and obnoxious wearing a white sleeveless shirt with very obvious sweat stains close ups of his face revealed the poorest variety of dental hygiene I developed deep mercy towards the judges hypothesizing about all the sorts of halitosis this bastard must have had And his voice oh my god this voice He sounded like someone drove a chainsaw through a block of marble in Bayreuth Festspielhaus That voice was horrid but it was also oddly familiar It took me about  seconds before I came to terms with what my poor eyes and ears were witnessingThe song stopped and the judges stared awkwardly Well Elijah they said you should never sing in public Ever Now people who audition for A Star Is Born should know by now that the possibility this kind of harsh criticism should be considered but not our unaware Elijah No nobody talks to Elijah like that He proceeded to go into a glorious televisionized fit spitting at the judges shouting and yelling trying to break the cameras and finally being forcefully removed from the premises by securityApparently this was the third year in a row he tried his luck at this show And each time was a sight to see though after that last one he became again a persona non grataPoor

Smith,28,6,1rjppo,42,So heres a quickie and its a common tale of what happens when a user receives a virus alert and how it put a smile on my faceThis afternoon with the first major snow storm of the season crashing into the area and with the tickets piling up because everything seems to magically break due to the Thanksgiving holiday approaching in the United States I decided it would be a good time to take lunch before dealing with the storm I was in the mood to spend a worthwhile lunch break in my own style Pizza with some Battlefield  Multiplayer and to top things off a cozy spot in a conference room Why the conference room Well Windows and apparently snows a new thing in this area so I would hate for all of the telephone poles to be taken out So I grab my personal laptop which happened to be with me grab some pizza from the lunch room and situate myself in the conference room I connected my personal laptop up to the network launched Origin and began a download of Battlefield  Not a single moment after I clicked download my mobile phone starts to ring Its one of the small business users I supportThe conversation began with the user sounding extremely worried and very panicked They received a cold call from someone in Dallas likely a spoof saying their new lap computer in the users words had a virus and that they mustnt wait to get the virus removed I paused for a second knowing all too well how these cold calls work I checked the number calling me as a sanity check and confirmed its the userss secondary line Odd for this user to be calling me on thatThe conversation then progressed in a very short amount of time to me explaining that this new laptop one which I had specifically set up and locked down specifically for this user is perfectly fine and that the person calling unexpectedly happened to be a scammer Of course also a major security risk if the user doesnt adhere to my advice The user informed me that they were on the phone with the cold caller at which point I proceed to tell them to hang up Fully expecting the user to doubt my advice based on previous conversations with them about simple email issues I remained on standby watching the download progress of Battlefield  I hear a thud on the phone followed by the user yelling a quick swift storm of words that went along the lines of Go away evil scum followed by the voice of the user back on the line with me in a very calm but still panicked voiceI spoke with the user to explain why those types of calls are bad and put them back at ease to ensure their computer was fine The user doubted me here and I simply had to explain to them that everything was okay and that these types of calls happen regardless of whether or not you have a computer I explained the concept of war dialing just to be sure they understood English is also not the users primary language although I am capable of speaking some others to an extent if they prefered and why and how the cold callers broke some telecommunications laws based on the users situation I lastly finished up the call as Battlefield  began to install explaining how call spoofing can lead to tricksI wrapped up the call by thanking the user for running their concerns through me this user was the first one who Ive dealt with who did not follow through and bid them a Happy Thanksgiving I took a much deserved bite of my pizza joining a  player Battlefield  server to vent some stress out on Paracel Storm and Siege of Shanghai With the tickets continuing to come in along with the snow piling up I can only hope that Thanksgiving will be a relief and not an oncall user apocalypseTLDR Lap Computer virus OH MY,1385523425.0,Good user,48,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

IsilZha,36,29,1rghh8,115,Alright thought Id share a headache I had to endure this AugustSeptember its a bit of a long story as we hit a stumbling block of some sort and almost every single pointSo heres the deal We got a school district thats desperately needed an upgrade for their WAN They had  schools running single T pointtopoints to the District office DO which then ran it over a multilink Tx to the County office for web filtering and internet One school is right next door to the DO with a direct fiber link They have an ASA firewall just a  at the DO that has their public IP  the county office has it setup to expose that public IP to the internet Obviously this presents a problem Each school except the one next door is limited to  Mb internet bottlenecked further by having to share  Mb on the main line out In practice they got between  Mb and  Mb woohooAll the schools have their own subnets and DCs Traffic flows from the schools to the DO through the DOs ASA and out the CountyBehold a diagram  httpiimgurcomVxMvPpngJust to curb the concern Ive changed all the IPsThe routers are mostly Cisco s  the switches are HP procurve managed layer  switchesNow they brought us in cause at the time their IT department consisted of two people It now consists of one for the entire district That madness is beside the point of this post though This started a year ago  my boss drew up a design using MPLS to get them  Mbit links to the DO and a  Gbit link from the DO to the County Office COWe only heard a few scant details for a few weeks after he submitted the design then nothing until early this year The district met with ATampT and ATampT drew up their own plans completely disregarding what we had presented Oh and the district excluded their own IT department from these meetings So the first thing their own IT department hears about whats happening with the upgrade is when his bosses come to him with This is what ATampT is doingAnd what ATampT came up with and started working on wasis to put it lightly atrociousTo start off with  ATampT ran  months behind They were supposed to have links ready at the schools midsummer for the change over to avoid disrupting the schools Instead they got the link at the DO and  other links up  days before the start of school So the first thing is that we need to minimize downtimeSo heres what ATampT did httpiimgurcomLNAWPbUpngNote I removed the T links in the chart above to unclutter it  they still exist and are up at this point to facilitate the changeoverThey ran Mb fiber to each school site and the CO and  Gb to the DO Yes thats right to start off with the DO gets a Gb to take in all the connections but the link out to the CO is only  MbSo anyway they put in a small Cisco switch at each site to take in the fiber and handed off the connection as copper at each site except the DO  where they handed it off as Fiber A single fiber link Are you seeing another problem here That single fiber is a VLAN trunk for all the sites including to the CO  so all the traffic comes in through the single fiber link and needs to go back out the same fiber link after being filtered through the ASAATampTs instructions when they finished putting in the link at the DO Just plug each site into a switch at each site and itll all just work I kid you not What about all the subnetting Oh you dont need to do any of that oO Before we heard this ourselves they had been repeatedly telling the Superintendent who is a complete jerk and more of a hinderence than anything that it would all be plug and play and just work We had to pry at them for the first day before we could even get the VLAN informationOther issues No equipment at the DO has a Gb fiber port The routers are full  no more connections available The ASA is license locked and cannot have anymore VLANs aside from the two it has inside and outside It will not handle VLAN tagging at all None of the switches in the core stack support VLAN taggingEven though the switch they put in at the DO has multiple ethernet and fiber ports they refused to give us more of them all the others are disabled even though it would be a  minute configuration That will take a change order How long would that take About  weeksIn fact ATampT refused to change anything anywhere to help make this work When calling their ENOC center which is the number provided for support to setup your connection did nothing more but repeat just plug it into a switch at each siteThe project manager went on a  week vacation the day after the link at the DO went in After talking with our contact at ATampT for days who had been talking as though he were an Engineer suddenly reveals Im just a salesman God this is explains so muchAlso yes they installed a link at the site next door that already has a direct fiber link to the DOSo to recap ATampT provided a completely flat solution and wanted the district to just flatten the whole network Wouldnt work anyway due to VLANs and only providing a single link at the DO        Seriously they wanted us to just flatten the entire network Only a single link is provided to take all the school traffic in and send it out ATampT has and still continues to stubbornly refuse to do anything to help make their craptacular plan workIts clear from the design they came up  They presumed the internet access presided at the DO instead of the CO  A salesman probably designed this garbage  it shows a blatant lack of understanding of the type of network needs as well as putting in crap they dont need at all the link at the site next door  HERP DERP LETS CHARGE YOU MO FOR AN INDIRECT FIBER LINK AT A SITE THAT ALREADY HAS A DIRECT FIBER LINKFrom here on we seemed to run into some odd stumbling block at every turn not just from ATampT FMLWe got a layer  VLAN tagging capable HP switch so that we could split up the VLANs for inbound and outbound which we got in a few days after the link was put in at the DOSo I console into the command line to do basic setup and enable web administration Holy crap is the command line clunky and the command paths make little sense For one backspacing doesnt work  so any mistakes start over Try to go back and just modify the last part of your previous command Start overGet through that and get the web interface up WTF is this The GUI is convoluted and clunky  it takes  steps to configure a port andor VLAN and much of it makes as much sense as the CLI did The fiber wouldnt come up either normally on HP switches it just works Screw this  we call up HP to help us with the configurationTurns out the switch is actually a COM switch rebranded as an HP switch  gt We have to setup the fiber port as this weird hybrid port to work Okay  we also get  ports setup for out VLAN to the CO and  setup for in VLANs of the schoolsCome back the next day  plug in a laptop at one of the sites to see if we can ping through to another laptop on the HP switch Nothing  we look  fiber link shows down Look at ATampTs equipment link is down Its only been  days and the link at the DO is down So come back a few days later succesfully test sitetosite and now we also have a new Cisco  to be the router for this new madness  As well as  more s one site has an older router with only  ethernet interface and another is so old is only MbThe third  is to take the school VLANs from the HP switch that ATampTs fiber is plugged into and route them to the DOs network for various services Exchange school applications etc  Then it goes out the ASA into the  which sends it to the COs VLAN on the HP switchThis had the fun side affect of being able to independantly route incoming and outgoing traffic which actually became usefulSo we got this all setup run some connectivity tests beforehand and got the goahead to swap DOs link to the CO over so now we just need to coordinate with the CO to swap routes and give us the right IPIts one guy at the CO that handles all the network stuff   We had been talking with him and he told us to just let him know when we were going to swap over and he would make the apporpriate changes on his end which included moving to a different subnet  He also just now mentions that the next day he will be going on vacation for  weeks  And he wont be giving anyone else at the CO access to anything to take over while hes goneSo were all ready to go and try to get ahold of him to get us going  He doesnt respond  To anything  We head off for the day never getting a response from him expecting well be stuck for  weeks nowhe sends the schools IT guy the info late that night and indicates hell answer the next day  Finally we get ahold of him the next day and swap over that part goes smooth  we can now pull Mb at the DOOnce this was done I went through and preconfigured the unused fastEthernet ports on the school site routers and preconfigured the two new s for the new stubnetworks and routing  We went to the first site swapped the gateway over  successSort ofOnly getting  Mb  Test from DO again still getting  Mb  Another stumbling block  At this point its x better than what the school was used to well troubleshoot that part later maybe everyone just blasted the bandwidth  no errors or problems on the equipment onsite for now we should get more schools up and runningNext school goes up and gets almost the full speed the DO gets okay thats working good  Get the next site go to plug in and swap over oh ATampT brought their link in at a building on the opposite end of the campus from the T and core stack claiming there wasnt enough room  there was plenty of room they were lazy about running the fiber it was just easier to run it where they did  gt  Ended the work day on that noteThe next day we had a plan  grabbed one of those s meant for another site put it in to handle ATampTs link swapped the gateways confirmed up and working  This school already had a  that was used for the T  we pulled it to use at the site we were originally going to use the new  for  This site got full bandwidthNext stop is two sites that are next door to each other  The last sites were doing  Both of them get the  Mb problem  On the last site I give something a try to confirm my suspicion I route the upsteam back through the T  Now we can get Mb down  Which at the time was the same we were getting at the DO no way for us to tell how loaded down the COs link is  I suspect I know what the problem is will start looking into it the next dayAs it turns out ATampT between the switches they installed onsite and their own internal stuff had the Duplex randomly set to half full or auto  For the life of me I cannot fathom what idiot was changing around the duplex to anything but auto or for that matter why they werent even consistant about it  The  Mb issue was caused by ATampTs links having duplex mismatches all over the place After getting the run around for an hour with ATampT we finally got a tech who knew what he was doing and he helpfully checked every link and found all these duplex mismatches and fixed them set them all to auto  All sites now running at the bandwidth we expect  whewAt this point today we still have one site with just a T link  ATampT has to get a permit to shut down a railroad line to run their fiber under it  Again they dropped the ball on this and didnt put in the request until late August  We dont expect the permit will be granted for  months  Additionally weve had to wait several months to get a change order going to make the link to the CO a Gb link  We have a new ASA waiting to be put in that can handle the Gb  Still waiting on that  So its not quite done but the worst is over at least,1385425123.0,Tales from a NetAdmin Ep   The NetAdmin vs

Gambatte,42,24,1rg6w8,94,In the center of an interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas a final particle was irretrievably caught in the rapidly condensing heart of the cloud With a silent roar of electromagnetic radiation the hydrogen molecules began to fuse directly into helium and thus a star was born This was of course very embarrassing for the cloud who had to excuse itself from the table with a bad case of fusionNot so long after that I was working as a supervisor of a team of pimply faced youths when word of my excellence somehow made it to management Vowing to wreak bloody vengeance on whoever had volunteered me I went to find out what new responsibilities had been added to my platterA brand new system was being introduced and I was to work with the project team to get it up and running On the plus side it had already completed acceptance testing so it should be a matter of plug and play Oh naiveté is a wondrous thing Should was most definitely the operative word thereThere existed a system for passing classified data between two systems This was used by multiple customers in multiple locations and worked at least as well as could be expected and often better There existed a second system that passively listened to this classified data for its own purposes using a unidirectional link to the data bus  in fact passive was the first word in the link equipments name The new system was to use the same passive connection to the bus to allow the data to be sent via a second encrypted link to remote locations that did not at that time at least have the equipment to support a connection to the original encrypted circuitOnce the equipment was finally all installed on my end I was able  with some coaxing and the elimination of some huge security breaches for example the ability to silently remotely view the screen of any user currently logged on to the classified network  to establish an encrypted link between the test facilities and pass data successfully Huzzah Great success And many drinks were hadBut twas not to be so simple Once we attempted to establish a link with one of the remote locations things became more complicated The remote locations RF equipment would lock up after every transmission We would not receive data from them when the link was up And so on Over time we came to learn that the remote location was using a completely different set of RF equipment for the encrypted link which handled the data packets in a different way causing the equipment to lock up We got that fixed but we were still not receiving data from the remote locationEventually after I had personally put hundreds of hours of overtime into the system a team of five experts were dispatched from the US at great expense They happened to bring with them a copy of the original testing documentation On reading through the testing document to see how we could replicate these tests I flicked to the last page There I found a summary of the testing results which came down to a single linegt Some tests successful with remote location  all other locations failed all testingWhich was exactly the problem wed been having  and when  had replaced some equipment it had begun to fail as well So these were all known issues from the original testing regime but the project manager had signed off on it accepting the new system into service rather than sending it back to get the issues fixedheaddesk  tableflip  locateandreattachheadWe eventually determined that the reason that remote location  had been working was that it contained a specific firmware library that the company had not actually obtained a license for   so when the equipment was replaced the new equipment did not contain that library The project management team promptly started looking into the cost of licensing that featureAs the system experts SE started to pack up their gear on their final day before the  hour flight back to the States one of them turned to me and saidgt SE Im glad we could get that transmission problem sorted out once that firmware is in everything should run smoothly for yougt ME Yeah Well see what happens with that I dont know if management will be happy to pay manufacturer for the license And they really need that memory for more important featuresgt SE Any other problems before we head back to the hotel Is the data injection working wellgt ME Wait What data injectionQueue emergency meeting with everyone immediately available Apparently the original design document stated that the purpose of the new system was to automatically insert data received from the remote locations directly into the existing system replacing a rather error prone manual process The way the system was actually working insofar as it had on occasion actually worked the manual process was still required but was read from the new systems screen rather than via a voice channelThis design flaw was traced to the passive data listening device which was shown in the documentation as a bidirectional link not unidirectional  despite having the word PASSIVE or UNIDIRECTIONAL written next to it on every externally referenced diagram these were missing from the diagrams included in the design documentAfter the shouting and the screaming and the crying and the recriminations had died down the project was quietly cancelled and all of the equipment removed I received an official commendation  although Id rather have been quietly slipped cash equal to the cost to replace one of the systems hard drives a large capacity ruggedized SCSI hard drive I could have bought a nice boat at the suppliers listed price The estimated money spent for zero return was easily a seven figure number although others have estimated it as a low eight Had the system expert not made that one offhand comment to me someone experienced enough to know that it was especially impossible then I shudder to think how much more money would have been poured into itTwo technical project managers were reprimanded one for designing a system that could never possibly work and the other for accepting as serviceable a system that only passed most of one set of tests out of five although he was already leaving anyway so he shouldered as much of the blame as he possibly could effectively protecting the other manager from the repercussions of her own

Gambatte,74,102,1rduku,388,Before the beginning there was nothingness  a void so complete that the passage of time  even the very concept of time itself  was meaningless Then the nice universe from the interstitial dimension next door popped in for a cup of tea and some biscuits having brought them with it because  as one would expect by its very definition  the larder of the eternal void was quite empty and generally just messed up the whole boundless void With a sigh entropy set to work slowly cleaning up the whole mess so that it could back to the lovely timeless nothingness that it had had going on before this most annoying interruptionShortly after that I was supervising my team of pimply faced youths PFY when a job came in to check the coolant levels in a lovely piece of high voltage equipment Being a simple job I collared the nearest PFY and tasked him to go carry out said checkHe promptly returned bearing the bad news the coolant levels were low and would require replenishmentSeeing as I had a fairly new team of PFYs of which only one had replenished said coolant levels previously I assembled the group and informed them of said taskgt ME Any questionsgt PFY This coolant Is it hazardous What PPE personal protective equipment should we be usingOh ho I thought A learning opportunitygt ME Excellent question PFY I shall direct your attention to the Material Safety Data Sheet application that each of you has on your desktop From there you can access the safety details on everything and anything you might be exposed to So your job is nowgt PFY to look up the coolant MSDS sheet and see what PPE we needgt ME Well done Once youve done that gather the requisite items and let me know once everything is ready to begin  Ill come up to make sure that you do it properlySo the herd of PFYs gathered up the job sheet and ran off to perform the task as described I later learned that the PFYs became concerned with such details asgt Specific personal protective equipmentgt Respiratorygt None requiredgt Eyesgt Goggles or full face splash shield when dealing with hot liquidgt Handsgt Use insulating gloves when extensive exposure to solid state or high temperature liquid state is contemplatedgt Other clothing and equipmentgt Use heat protective garment when exposed to large quantities of heated vaporandgt Compound is known as the universal solvent and does dissolve at least to some extent most common materials So after a considerable period of time far longer than it should have taken really but not longer than I had expected I was asked to come up to the equipment to supervise the coolant replenishment procedureI arrive to find two PFYs in full face shields rubber aprons rubber boots and rubber gloves A third was standing by with a full set of breathing apparatus on ready to engage should the first two be overcomeThis seems a little excessive I thought Aloud I instructed them to beginAs it turns out the PFYs had broken the task up into groups The one PFY who had done this before had promptly volunteered to move the hazardous chemical in its sealed container up to the coolant replenishment point while the newer PFYs looked up the data sheet and collected the requisite PPE for handling Of course he had also been kind enough to volunteer the name of the chemical compound for them to enter into MSDS before he left to do soAs the coolant began to pour into the system a priceless look of realization slowly crept across the faces of the PFYs as it dawned on them what the dangerous sounding dihydrogen monoxide actually wasFALLOUTThe PFYs were credited for their strict adherence to safety then given further instruction on how to interpret information from the MSDS databaseThe devious PFY was promoted to IC a few months later and is still one of the very best Ive ever hadBrowse other volumes of the EncyclopædiaAhttpredditqywlBhttpredditrtjrCDhttpredditpwforEFhttpredditqkzrGhttpredditquffhHIJKLMhttpredditrjNOPhttpredditrgwQRSTUVhttpredditrdukuWhttpredditqiiXYZwith credit to MagicBigfoot,1385340315.0,Encyclopædia Moronica V is for Volatile Chemicals,490,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

Cloudedguardian,40,21,1rcp13,102,Hi TFTS Ive been a lurker for over a year now and Im certainly no IT girl but I think this still counts and that youll all get a kick out of this I am known by my local friends as The Smart One and as such when one of my local friends had a tech issue Im often asked if I could sort it out for them Its often as simple as reading the manual they tossed in the recycling and pressing the right button if not just turning it on and off againWell one day the only girl of this circle that I actually consider a friend rather than an acquaintance asked me if I could give her a hand Lets call her Red Red wanted me to help her sort out her Notebook as I had a rather nice laptop that Id gotten for graduation that I had to quote Done some cool crap with Well shes my friend and I like learning about computers so I figured I could give it a shotRed pulls out her Notebook turns it on and logs on before clicking Firefox to load up her internet My eyebrow immediately went up when it took no less than five minutes for her Google homepage to come up Im doing a checklist in my head of what could be slowing it down like this and start asking the obvious questions To me anywayMe Well have you cleared out your cache recently It could just be as simple as old files gumming up your systemRed My whatNow I knew that there was a possibility I wasnt using the correct terms as my Dad had for the longest time been the techy of our family and everything I knew was from what he and my American gamer friend had taught me Dad always called what I was thinking of The Cache and so I didnt know what else to call itMe Errr its like a bunch of cookies and information pieces that your computer accumulates as you surf the web Some sites are especially bad for it and you can get up to a couple thousand in an hour with them Cheezburger for instance Theres a program you run to clean it out let me see if you have onHere Reds Grandmother who had been listening in the background cut me off Oh no theres a button on that fox browser thing that does thatI blinked trying to figure out what she was talking about Then I realized that she was talking about the Data management window that you can bring up I resisted facepalming by keeping in mind that I was probably using the wrong terms and therefore it could be my fault that they were confused Me Errr no I think thats the browser cache Im talking about a different one on the computer itself sorry I might not be using the proper termsGranny Well I dont think clearing the computer is necessary the browser fixes that stuff Reds probably just downloaded some weird thing and has messed it all upAt this point Red and my eyebrows were both starting to twitch and so she made the wise decision of pulling me up to her room so I could fuss with her computer in peace As I struggle to get anything to load Red asks me if I really thought it was a computer cache thing slowing it down As I searched for an anticirus a cleaner anything I said it was a possibility before giving up and asking her what antivirus she had She said she didnt know what I meantMe Like uh Norton or McAfee Red Oh No I aint got that WhyMe Well I think you might have a virus Theyre really easy for your computer to pick up if you dont have a proper antivirus Its probably whats gumming up your systemRed Ohhh What are you doingI was at that very second looking up a free antivirus and cleaner that a Tech blogger of mine had mentioned with the intention of downloading and using them in the place of Norton I explained as such and Red told me bluntly not to I looked at her with a look of uttermostMe WutRed I downloaded somethin like that a little while ago and it just made things worse So dontI figured she had downloaded one of the scam ones and tried to explain that I think I lost her in the second sentence so I gave up and just said that it wasnt a Proper antivirus but this one was a good one that I had heard recommended by many people She still wouldnt let me download it As she took her Notebook back with me conceding defeat I suggested that if she didnt want to download the free one she could always go to Staples and buy Norton I added that it was what I had and would clean repair and kill all the virus and it was very simple to use It was megaonsale at the moment and wouldnt be a bad idea She told me shed think about it but it was a lot of moneyAbout a week later my sister Black and I seen Red with a brand new laptop I asked her what happened with her Notebook and she said that since it was so slow shed just gone and bought a new one I blinked Me So it wasnt a virus Cleaning it didnt help Well that suRed Oh no I didnt clean it or nuthin I just chucked it and bought a new one insteadMe Wut Black Please tell me you didnt throw that Notebook in the trashRed Nah its too much hassle to try and throw computer junk in the trash My friend actually wanted it if you can believe it So I let her have itMe Ddid you at least get Norton for your new computer Like does your new laptop have some sort of an antivirusRed Nah it doesnt need that junk Its all fast and new Im not gonna have any problems with this baby at allBlack You are going to become this stores best buckin friend aintcha AhouTLDR  Friend buys new laptop for over  rather than spending  on an

curriedavenger,14,54,1rbmxm,309,Sometimes you gotta feel bad for a guyThis was a slow day in the computer shop so its just me and the manager Mick in our small branch on university campus  I take a phone call from an obviously worried guy asking whether we can get deleted files off of a USB drive  I say its possible but we would need to sent it to a specialty centre that deals with data recovery and its likely to be expensiveAn hour later a guy that is the picture of middlemanagement rocks into our store out of breath and sweaty presenting a password protectedencrypted USB keyThis is itMick and share a glance at each otherIm the guy that called you earlier shouts the customer  You know about the data on the drive he pleadsMick takes a look at the drive and notes its a secure drive that encrypts the data on itWhat happened I askTurns out that the customers boss had given him this drive and protected it with a password as it contained confidential information The information on the drive was the only full set of data and collating that information again would be arduous and expensive not to mention embarrassing for the relevant parties  Because the customer was a contractor he was liable to lose his job over thisMick and I explained that the drive was set to its highest security setting which deleted the data after three or so incorrect password attempts  Even if the data could be recovered by some miracle of engineering it would appear as gibberish since it was encryptedThe customers nostrils start twitching and he chokes out a thank you takes the drive and leavesA couple of weeks later we get a visit from a regular customer  a system administrator from the university that typically grabs a coffee from the shop next door and comes in to shoot the breeze with Mick and me  He mentions the drive and explains that he gave it to a incompetent contractor that some manager had hired because the manager was nailing the contractors sister  This contractors laziness and outright lack of work ethic had made some of the sysadmins friends very unhappy and had cost friend a weekend with his children in one case  The sysadmin was known to get shit done when it needed doing and was ruthlessly efficient in that respect  which is why he held onto his job for so long despite being a general asshole to most peopleSysadmin had worked with one of his friends to engineer a situation where the contractor would be handed an empty drive having been told it contained information pertaining to the universitys staff and payroll ie highly sensitive data for a protosystem to undergo testing with  While the actual project was real the contractor was kept walled off from touching it with his ineptitude by his immediate boss Sysadmins friend Greg  Of course this meant that Greg would need to do all of the contractors work or otherwise get a shitty performance review when certain milestones were not met  Greg couldnt actually let the contractor do the work since unfucking the contractors inevitable fuckups was more difficult than doing the work himselfGreg handed the contractor the drive and told him the password and informed him that the data needed to be transferred to the new system by the following day for testing  A simple task but importantIn spite of his stupidity I could not bring myself to laugh at the poor twat since it seemed like losing a password could happen to anyone and data redundancy was an obvious step  At least until the rest of the storyThe contractor having forgotten the password destroying the supposedly only complete copy of the data and therefore unable to test the system subsequently claimed that the drive was misplaced  When Greg found the drive a few days later plugged into the contractors computer FFS the contractor told him that the drive must have been faulty  After Greg tested the drive in front of the contractor the guy came clean about forgetting the password and wiping the data  Understandably his contract was terminated for gross incompetence and dishonestyAt this point Sysadmin was tearing up with laughterI mean for fucks sake the password was the guys full name and extension number,1385257410.0,Some things are worth remembering,363,TalesFromTechsupport,hot
curriedavenger,34,57,1rbh79,329,I previously worked in a computer shop that had a repair section behind the store  We specialised in Apple products and as I worked in the retail section my colleagues and I were the interface between our technicians and our customersOne day a businesswoman walked in with her laptop and demanded that we get her computer working as she cant check her email  A quick check at the service desk in the store revealed that the computer would not boot at all and that it was likely an issue with the motherboard requiring the computer to be formally booked into our onsite service system to arrange for parts and service  I informed her of our labour prices explained how upon a complete diagnostic service we would be in touch with a quote for repair and approximate time frames she can expect to have certain milestones in the process to be completed withinHaving agreed to that I begin getting her details to be entered into our system  She gives me her phone number but when I ask for an addressYou dont need that actuallyNow how she expects to know what I need I didnt understand and I explain that given the extent of work that will be done we have to actually have a billing address since she was not paying upfront  particularly important when the actual problem has yet to be formally diagnosed so we cant really take prior payment since we dont know what the extent of the repairs will beI dont want my mailbox filled with your fucking flyersI explain that our service centres database of customer details is actually separate from our marketing department and that our company does not mail out flyers so there is no risk there  I also explain that without a billing address our checkin software will not process the repairShe reluctantly agrees and I print out the form for her to sign  I watch as she grabs my pen off out of my hand despite having a pen in front of her anyway and begins to cross out two of the three paragraphs in the terms and conditions of the service request  the ones pertaining to contact details  These paragraphs state that we will only ever use the details to contact the customer in regard to this particular service job and that we will never use the details for marketing purposes or otherwise forward the information to any other entityI ask her what she is doing  I dont want to be harassed by telemarketersI ask her to read the parts of the contract that she disagrees with not that I can negotiate different terms but so I can address her concerns like any decent salesperson  I explain again that the only reason we can contact her under this very contract is to speak with her in respect to this repair job and show her the wording that says just that  I also inform her that our terms are not subject to negotiation and I cannot accept her computer unless she signs the full set of termsJust get it doneShe slides the service agreement towards me grabs her handbag and walks out  I now have a broken computer and no valid contract to show for it given that I have not yet signed off on it  The computer is in limbo and I cant do anything with it until a fresh agreement has been signed  However I do have her phone number  I call her to let her know that he computer having been left here without a valid agreement means we cannot service it and we may be forced to treat the laptop as being abandoned  As it was not currently working it had little value and at the close of business it would be left outside of our store for her to pick up unless she requests that we hold onto it  Naturally she yells at me to hold on to it until she can get back to us  I inform her that there is a storage fee of  per day until the service request is completedShe starts going off her goddamn rocker and there is so much sound pouring out of the phone that its grabbing the attention of our other customers even over the obnoxious pop music that we plebs in retail must endure all dayA few hours later she storms into the store with a toddler in tow screaming at our youngest salesperson  a  year old girl  about how we are extorting her  I step in and apologise for making her come back and get the new agreement printed out  She tries crossing out the contact terms in the contract AGAIN and I stop her staying I cannot accept alterations or deletions and she will either need to take the agreement asis or leave with her computerShe then goes quiet and her anger rolls back like the water on a beach just before a tsunami is about to hitand starts sobbing  Sobbing and reading the terms she had earlier deleted  People are now staring at us and I become aware that it appears that I had handed her a letter telling her I never really loved her or something especially as she cried over the contract and continued to sob as she signed it  She grabbed her kid and left without saying a wordHer husband was an asshole too but thats a story for later,1385252369.0,Not so fine print,386,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

Rhywden,119,122,1r99ob,636,This is another story from back when I was one of the admins for a mediumsized students dormitory  connected clientsPhysical layout consisted of  houses connected by fiber with every house sporting several Netgear managed switches thus providing  Mbit connections So one evening I was sitting in my room and reading when someone knocked on my door Internet is downFirst thing to check Local issue Tried connecting to the router remotely  no dice Not only is the Internet down but the whole network Went over to the server room and logged in locally and discovered that the router was alive and kicking also the uplink was fine but the connection to our network was borked Around that time a fellow admin showed up who forgot more about networking than Ill ever learnHowever he too failed to spot an immediate source of this error Uplink  fine No errors in the logs Blinkenlights on the switches in the server room are indeed blinking and showing not only connected ports but also active onesWe tried several things over the course of the next hour but did not find anything TCPdump didnt show any incoming traffic on our network facing cardUntil by pure chance or maybe desperation we rebooted the switches Because the network suddenly came to life again and ground to a halt mere seconds laterOkay time for another reset this time with TCPdump to watch whats happening And thats when we saw it A TCP packet which consisted entirely of zeros yes even the leading bytes which should include stuff like source and target port and just one single xF somewhere And it flooded the network for the short time it workedWe then worked out what had obviously happened Some computer in our network broadcasted those malformed packets which in turn caused our switches to freeze in such a state that they appeared to still be working I kid you not if you didnt watch them closely youd notice nothing  it was just that the pattern of blinking and steady lights didnt change over time as it usually would in a live networkThe solution was to pull out all the cables and connect them one by one until the switch failed again That way we discovered the culprit  who wasnt home at the time of course He later told us that he came home to discover that his PC which he had left on to complete a slow and huge download had bluescreened which obviously didnt agree with his NIC which then decided to retaliate against the cruel world in the only way it could,1385167866.0,The TCP packet of death,758,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

theunusualsuspect,15,24,1r9cpz,176,So this was maybe a year ago but I just havent sat down to right about itI used to work for a small ISP that provided DSL via resold ATT circuits They also resold T circuits and things of that nature On top of that they also provided pointtopoint wireless access VOIP webhosting and emailProviding support for resold internet really isnt as bad as you think  especially considering I was T and only caught escalated cases that got past our call center Simple stuff And VOIP never really caused any issuesWhat did cause issues was email We actually hosted our own email server I couldnt tell you what we used off the top of my head right now but it was linux based all of our software was And thats fine  it was free and simple Only it wasnt updated regularly or everSo eventually we arrive to the day in question As you may have guessed we have a form on our website anyone can use to send our sales department a question Now we can all see the emails that come in from that form so everyone in the office knows when something is submitted Well we started receiving a series of interesting emails After a quick google search it turns out its a very basic SQL injection used to essentially retrieve the password for an email account Thing is if you grab the right one say our network administrators email password well thats when the trouble can start especially considering email account usernames are the same usernames used for webhosting logins Or so I thought  its actually much simpler to abuse the system we were using Ill get into that in a minuteSo me and my coworker inform our network admin He takes a look and bans the IP abusing the form That was it Fantastic We have no idea whats been accessed I inform everyone I can and they assure me our network admin will take care of it And that is that as they sayWell not a few weeks later we are getting absolutely flooded with spam Our internal email accounts and our customer email accounts It gets so bad that we actually start getting black listed by Domain Name Servers and other ISPs Im talking verizon yahoo charter  it was just unbelievable So as our network admin is looking for a solution me and my coworker investigate on our ownNow i mentioned earlier that we do webhosting right Well guess what Email is hosted via that server as well Which isnt that big of a deal What is a big deal is that if you have a webhosting account it turns out you have unfettered access to EVERYTHINGSo how it works if youre unfamiliar is as followSSH into our server we allowed the access And from there all you had to do was keep ing and you would eventually land in the highest parent directory where you could freely view all of our fucking user accounts Oh and you didnt need a password to get into them YOU COULD DO THIS ON ANY ACCOUNT One other thing  sudo commands freely fucking available And theres our god damned problemSo now were a god damned ISP that when I check was responsible for  of the entire spam coming across the internet Thats a shit loadOf course this was immediately brought up to our network admin and the owner I dont know how to emphasize absolute and total despair but they DIDNT FUCKING BELIEVE US You know what they blamed it on Spoofing FUCKING SPOOFING Sorry it still infuriates meThey tried implementing solutions but nothing really panned out  which you know is because someone had unfettered access to our shit It was a constant fight until the day I quit My coworker quit the same day It was interestingI have a whole mess of other stories that Ill eventually get around to but this was just the one that stands out to me,1385170486.0,SQL injection Ill just block the IP,200,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

some workers are transferred over to a off campus facility where we help cycle computers New purchases are imaged added to a domain and have special software deployed based on where its going Old relics leaving service  are KillDisced scavenged for parts and then shrinkwraped and prepared for recycling Its not a bad gigIn order to maintain some degree of CYA when computers arrive to be outprocessed and recycled we keep them for  days before wiping them This is so that if a professor forgot the picture of his kid or the staff member needs that one spreadsheet they left on the machine it can still be recovered Most of the time the previous owner realizes their mistake early on and we get their files for them and put them on a physical media for the user to pick up at their convenience Too bad that Most of the time is not  All of the timeThis particular incident began with me arriving caffeine in thermos book in hand for another day of processing I walk to the stack of old towers and grab a choice specimen noting the paperwork According to the paperwork I can wipe it  I trundle this bulky box to my workstation and begin setting it up for its last rights  I used to sing Daisy Daisy while i worked but then someone told me it made me seem like a sociopath I laughed and said  no im just grunt support I am about to pull the trigger when my boss pokes his head back and asks if i have processed Professor Derpingtons computer yet I look hopelessly at the pile of processed machines behind me Then as if it were fate I double check the paperwork from the computer I am currently working on lo and behold its Derpingtons Not boss I have the tower on the table and I was just about to press goWell the Prof forgot some tests and Important research data on there and he needs them so dont kill it yetOk should I get his files off for himNo he says he needs them ASAP Hes coming here to get themI double take Professors and administrators almost never descend to this particular facility Theres even a pool going as to whether or not the CIO of the uni could find this building on a google map  The idea of a Bambieyed professor navigating our wire strewn technological reliquary of a faculty is novel if not terrifying Soon the professor arrives luckily he is not a professor from my department and I have never met him before I walk him through several rooms each stacked with components from various eras of computer development before ultimately arriving at my workstation I sit him down in my chair and boot the PC for him He gets logged in and begins going about retrieving his files I step away for while I figure I can be more productive than just standing about while Professor Derpington moves files So I go take care of a few menial tasks and come back to find the good Professor standing and perusing the shelves The monitor has been switched off but the computer seems to be working overtime based on the volume of the fans Sir are you done I move to turn the monitor back on I can shut it down and walk you to the exitNO WAIT he reaches out to stop meI reactivate the monitor and immediately I am greeted with a familiar sight The windows file transfer dialog with its loading bar animation and rapidly changing text appears and demonstrates that files are being moved to the professors external hard drive Hold onGB of files are being movedfrom a folder labeled NOT PORNMy discovery happens in an instant and suddenly the screen goes black as the professor presses the button and the window to Windows closes again that is private Students should not be rooting through professors filesyes sir my mistake I begin walking out  Give me a call when your finished I round the corner and keep walking I fight to keep the laughter down until I am sufficiently far enough away I double over and laugh for a while eventually i regain my composure and continue going about my work until I am summoned by Derpington Lord of Not Pornia So what happens now he demands as he disconnects his hard drive and powers down the machine I explain our procedure and about how we wipe data He demands that he wants to witness the wiping for security reasons I was disappointed because I wanted to see what was GB of Not porn wasFor Science But he stood by for  minutes as killdisc did its magic I escorted him out and he thanked me and

PotatoRoll,61,19,1r88u6,141,Brief backgroundI work in a school with an ageing teacher population who once they decide something that is how it needs to be done like most end users We recent got a few Nexus s in from some promo that one of them signed up for and had a tech meeting that they were brought up in in which it was explained we are aware that we have them but we havent even looked at them yet as there are more pressing matters They have been in MY possession since Monday and I was out Tuesday and Wednesday Thursday was spent catching up on email and taking care of problems that prevent them from teachingAnyway Earlier today I had a teacher lets call her Jen come down and grab one of the Nexus s from me I explained that I needed more time to get them to function with the network and I havent even looked at them yet AS I WAS OPENING THE BOXI got a call from someone just down the hall saying he is having an issue printing so I grab my laptop and stroll down to him in the meeting room with Jen and a bunch of other teachersI lean over realize hes printing to the wrong printer change his default and we turn around to check to make sure the paper printed Printer is back down by office when Jen says WE NEED TO ORDER IPADS Now I work in a decent school but not one that is extremely well off So saying we need to order iPads isnt something I am going to take well Jen We have to order iPads this person is using a program that is only on the iPad and I have to use it now tooMe What is the name of the programJen I dont know but she said it is only on the iPad and I cant do what she is doing without oneMe Ah interesting the speaker is on her way over to me now what is the program that you are using that isnt available on AndroidSpeaker Its one that I downloaded from XYZ website I didnt see an option for the Android download but I have only ever used an iPadMe You didnt see an option for the download of Andriod on that website but there was one for an iPad that doesnt make any sense can you show me what the program isSpeaker turns her iPad towards me and swipes over to Foxit PDF readerMe I have seen this program before it is a PDF reader have you tried using AdobeJen Well this one has the functions I need you can see all of the files I need right here and pick the one you need then you can open it up and highlight and mark notes plus when you close it and open it it will open right up to where you left off on that PDF So thats why we need this oneMe to speaker now Have you tried Adobe reader I cant imagine Foxit reader having this function and Adobe reader notSpeaker I paid  for this app so I think that is why I get all of these featuresJen I dont think we will be able to do that on these tablets why did we order them anywayMe They were free with a promJen Ah that makes sense were just being to cheapMe angrily You have literally held onto this tablet longer than I have you cant expect it to work properly if it hasnt even been set up yet The teachers werent even supposed to know about these until we got them workingJen Well I think we should just order iPads to save the trouble of trying to make these work rightMeboiling You can give me the tablet and I can take a look at it before we decide to spend  on something I am not allowed to fix or repair and we have to send it back every time it breaksSpeaker You can buy an older iPad and it will cost less Mine didnt cost  and Ive had it for  years and it hasnt broken once yetMetipping point Thats nice but she is around kids from  every day and kids get into things they shouldnt and play with things they shouldnt and break things they shouldnt If it is going to cost me RETAIL PRICE of  DOLLARS I am not willing to fork over the cash when I have tablets here that havent even been tested for the same function and considering it is an APP and a WELL KNOWN app even though it is a pile of garbage as far as I am concerned Ive had nothing but trouble with it I am convinced GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST IT that adobe reader will perform the same functions necessary and we will have not spent a dime to achieve that goalDeer in headlights lookhands me the NexusI storm back to my office sit down open up the adobe reader app on the tablet WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT All of the same functions of the Foxit reader for free on a free tabletI walked back down to the meeting room happily strolled in sat down next to the speaker and started going through all of the functions that she said Foxit had without saying a word to herGot back up and leftBriefly spoke to my boss about kind of exploding like that but he said since they trapped me like that he would let it slideI was still mad when I typed this but I feel a lot better noweditFormattingTLDR Teacher needs iPad because Foxit Reader isnt available on android and Adobe doesnt have the same functions,1385141092.0,Foxit PDF reader and Adobe,160,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

FenrisFrost,52,19,1r7yh4,158,So where I work a major state organization we have a fleet of lawyers who work for the political figure we support and their computer needs are quite marginal Word Outlook occasionally Excel and printers There are about ish people in this department  They print a lot so to accommodate this they have several serious network printers strategically placed throughout their office space They have  total and no person is more than  feet away from any of them  So these people seem like good candidates to all get their own individual printers right  Our manager approved and had us order  individual tray printers and set up EACH ONE as a local printer for each lawyers PC  This model is nice for a desktop printer but it lacks a display so its light just blinks red whenever ANYTHING is wrong  It was only a week later when the lawyers started putting in tickets saying that their printers had all failed The Helpdesk being terribad reported each call in a new and unique way making it so that it just seemed like a catastrophic coincidental mass failure   tickets Red light flashing Printer will not respond Printer no longer accessible Print job lost Even stuff like Computer cannot access network   Our entire Helpdesk all yearslong experienced and not one of them asked any basic question like Is the printer on Does it have paper They just funneled the tickets right through to us because their boss likes us to look bad  Well it turned out almost literally all of the tickets was for them being out of paper A few were for them being not even turned on Not a single actual problem in other words and these are all people whove passed the bar exam some with major political affiliations Many were actually pretty embarrassed  We get this storm of tickets now once a month roughly The Helpdesk completely ignored us when we explained the issue and continues to not even ask these basic questions So essentially whenever a laywer needs to reload their paper or even turn their printer on we have to go do it for them  sigh  ,1385133594.0,Its a Printorama,177,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

Techsupportvictim,240,680,1r5j3f,1720,Okay this is by far one of my fav stories and I tell it at work often as a tale of woe and caution The scene My retail that also does tech support for our stuff store Sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close The players And yes the details are important TSV me a  size  chick Darren customer easily  muscled guy Looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit shaved head etc Guys biceps are as big as my headJeff Coworker playing captain of the ship in the tech area The game Dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correctSo Im doing my thing fixing user error issues the occasional software restore and so on Oddly quite for a Sunday But whateverJeff hey TSV do you think you can take one more before you go I was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah I couldTSV whats upJeff got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it No appointment TSV sure Bring him onJeff brings over big guy Huge guy from my POV I firmly invite him to grab a seat as its the only way I can look him in the eye for those that dont read my retail stories Im partially deaf so half my hearing is lip readingTSV hi Im TSV Dude Darren Not real friendly but not pissy toneTSV Nice to meet you Darren Jeff tells me your phone was broken sorry to hear that Lets get you set up with a new one Okay yeah this is how the company makes us talkDarren kind of nods pulls out the phone Now this model has a glass front and back Both are shattered Total spider web He hands it to me and a quick look shows that it wont turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red Yeah its dead time to bury this dogTSV I need to take this in the back for just a moment okayDarren nods again and I notice that his lip is shaking Dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like hes about to bawl Over a phone WTF  So I make quick work of going to the back popping the back off the phone get the serial and look up the warranty and part I put the phone back together as best I can pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off Back to the floor I goTSV Okay Darren I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have warranty thing so a replacement is just  Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since its on the SIM card I have you out of here in just a few minutes Darren okay pulls out his wallet and hands me cash What about my numbers and photos and stuff Can you get those TSV I hate this part it never goes well unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and wont power on so theres no way for us to retrieve any informationI brace myself for the yellingDarren my wife is going to kill me Shes an ex Seal Shes good at killing people when she needs to Shes going to cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush Mostly directed at himself Some at the universe in generalDarren Im an idiot She told me to back up the photos She said folks phones get stolen in Vegas all the time She kept nagging me so I said I did it Shes going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his sin and Im the priest Hes not yelling or anything so okay Ill listen Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend Its not uncommon as we are in LA You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain Now why was Darren so flipping out It wasnt over the phone but the data See Darren was the generally happy father of a baby boy A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party How nice etc But before he left Mom had reminded him to back up the photos the only photos of Darren Jr to the computer in case something happened to his phone She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered And yes Darren told his wife he did it And now she was going to kill him Having seen Darren Im a tad worried about a woman hes scared ofNow our company has a backupsync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly I figure whats the harm in checking if he had it on Theres a part of it that does save photos although its not on by default I dont tell poor Darren about it because I dont want to get his hopes up Darren finally out of steam oh well its my fault Time to face it like a manTSV thats the spirit Your wife will be mad but Im sure she loves you and will forgive you after a lot of grief of course this actually gets a chuckle And hes only a few weeks old you have plenty of time for taking more photosDarren yeah not quite convinced hes not a dead manI ring him up for the phone power it on Get to the screen for him to log in At this point he just thinks hes setting up the new phone like normal And what to my wondering eyes do appear But a backup made the night before his trip TSV well thats interesting Theres a backup listed in our system for your phone Last updated Thursday nightDarren I dont remember doing thatTSV you probably set it up when you first got it That was months ago so its easy to forgot Plus it runs on its own so you dont have to do anything other than plug your phone into power It might just be contacts and notes But why dont we try it Cant hurtDarren okay if you think we shouldTSV knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are I do Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloadedDarren hey all the apps I had are thereTSV waiting to download but it knows what to getDarren if it knows that could it have my photosTSV lets lookHe taps the gallery app Darren those are my photos Old photos Wait those arent as old Those are THE photos You saved my photos You saved my life Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me Remember hes got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process I thought my LP guy was going to explode Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldnt have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back He thrusts his hand out to shake mine Darren you just saved my life Literally My wife is an ex Seal TSV so you said Im glad it worked out Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home Darren yeah I learned my lesson Im never lying to my wife again TLDR guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water Had lied to wife about them being backed up I look like a goddess cause I get them back via online backup service he didnt know

effingWitchDoctor,47,37,1r6dl6,236,Hello again TFTS Todays story takes place about  years ago at a small software company  people you probably havent heard of I was the network admin and did some inhouse scripting when I had time we had actual techies and I was rarely bothered for network problems This particular day we had one of those problemsWe had recently sent the latest version of our project to the client for testing We were about  done and just wanted to see if they were happy with the features as they had been written They responded that they liked the features but that it ran slowly on their system and they needed it to be quickerJava is not a fast language Its great at a lot of things but optimization is not one of them The powers that be bosses decided the best way to tackle the problem was to hire on a new developer who could rewrite portions of the code in C They interviewed and hired Veteran Programmer VP who happened to start work on this very dayVP claimed to have  years of experience developing C He had just left a company you have definitely heard of for undisclosed reasons and been hired almost immediately by us The bosses seemed to think we had really caught a prizeSo on this fine monday morning I have only just sipped my first sup of coffee and logged into my workstation when a techie leans in the door EWD we just got a ticket from VP Apparently he cant access the development serverHuh I set him up and tested his account on Friday Forward it and Ill take a lookA few minutes later I receive the forwarded email and Im a little surprised It reads something to the amount ofi dont know what kind of place u keep round here but i cant even get to the server let me in NOW real coders got stuff to do hereIm kind of taken aback by this but log in to the development server to see whats amiss After poking around and not seeing any immediate problems I email him explain that Im the admin and ask if he can give me more information about the problem I considered asking him to keep email conversations professional but decided to let it go A few minutes later I get the next emailhaha real fuckin funny now get over here before i call Big Boss BB and have HIM fix this shitNow Im starting to get a little annoyed I email him back that Ill be over soon and deliberately waste  minutes looking at pictures of cats Feeling calmer I set off to figure out whats wrong only to find him about  feet away standing at the door to the server room Our server room like any server room should be is locked and airconditioned It is a fortress of solitude keeping the treasures within away from the greasy fingers of common users Only the Head Techie HT the bosses and I have keys to this room anyone else must access it remotely Some use terminal editors directly into the server some pushpull with git all are welcome to use ftp but none are allowed in the roomI walk over to VP to explain this but as soon as he realizes who I am he starts to tell me his thoughts on the situation using his outdoor voiceIve been standing outside this door for  fucking minutes I have shit I need to do so let me the fuck inThe guy is practically shouting in my face Im shocked but quickly recover VP we dont go in there except for maintenance You can access it remotely using vim or git but no oneI DONT GIVE A SHIT IVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS AND I NEVER HAD TO USE THAT SHIT NOW OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR OR BB WILL HAVE YOUR ASSBy this point people have come out of their offices to see whats going on BB appears on scene and tells me to take  and let him sort it out I hear him calming VP as I walk offAt this point Im pissed It takes a lot to piss me off but there I was pacing around my office and gritting my teeth After about a minute My Boss MB walks in and closes the door He wears a close cousin of the thousand yard stare on his face and appears to be speechless so I just throw it out there years my ass How could someone develop for  years and not know how to edit code remotely What are they even doing over at otherCompanyI dont know I also dont know what BB is going to do about it That fella sure has a temperWe talk for a few minutes and theres a knock at the door BB VP and HT walk in VP has the most loathesome smirk Ive ever seen and HT is making the same face MB had on earlier BB looks as happy and clueless as everBB Ooooookay then Now that were all fine and dandy lets talk There were a couple of misunderstandings here today but theyre really easy fixes and heres what were going to do Were going to get VP here a key so he can use the server how he wants That means that HT is going to have to put peripherals on the server VP also wants more monitors so were also gonna put a video card in it too EWD is going to set up the VP as administrator on the server because its his workstation And now I want you two to shake hands and we can all put this behind usBB is beaming MB and HT both look numb and I probably do too VP squeezes a bit more smugness out of his smirk before leaning over to shake my hand Nothing personal buddyBB Great If anyone needs me Ill be in my officeBB and VP head out leaving HT MB and I doing our best someoneshotmydog faces We discuss it agree its ridiculous and they eventually leave to go carry it out I make VP the admin of the server and start looking for a new jobtldr we

TechGuy,35,6,1r518r,87,I have a small IT business in Austin One of my clients needed me to run an HDMI cable through her walls so that she could hang a tv on another wall and setting up an Asus N wireless router I had been to her house once before and met Bella her Great Dane she was friendly and pretty relaxedClient tells me the door is unlocked and the dog in in the back yard I get there and the dog is inside so I called the home owner to make sure its safe to go in She assures me that the dog is fine and to go inI open the door and call Bella to me to meet me outside at the steps I didnt want to invade her territory without announcing myself first She comes out and greets me for the pets then I tell her to go inside witch she does I follow her in and on the way they have a puppy in a corralled little fence circle it is yapping at me At that point Bella starts to get uneasy which occurred to me after the factI set my stuff down and go to the pantry to get Bella a treat as the home owner suggested As soon as I go for the pantry Bella starts growling and showing teeth This dog is huge and would fuck me up easilyI do my best to stay calm so that the dog doesnt pick up on my fear but my hair is on end and my heart is racing She get closer and I try to go around her She moves to block me so I back up and she gets closer We are just standing there her growling as I think Im about to find out what its like to become a great dane turd I reach out and start petting her head and scratching her ears which puts her at ease a bit but when I stop petting she starts growling Im sitting there petting her and calling the home owner telling her what going on She doesnt really take me seriously because it is so out of character for her dog I explain calmly that I think that I am about to die and that she needs to call a neighbor over to distract the dog so that I can leave The client just moved into the house so she doesnt know anyone but says she is min away and headed my way She tells me to just grab her collar and just take control of her Yeah right This dog is going to eat my face if I step out of line with herIm petting Bella who now has her muzzle in my crotch as I scratch her ears If I screw with the pooch my balls are done Now Im like fuck it and call  and explain the situation so that they can send an officer over to hopefully distract the dog so that I can leave So Im just chilling with Bella in the corner for the next min petting her every time I stop she growls so now my new job is IT mandog petterFinally an officer shows up Im just hoping that he doesnt walk in and have to shoot the dog when it goes for him Luckily this guy is smart and sees me in the widow and walks up to get the dogs attention Bella goes nuts over him looking into the window I make my escape walking slowly toward the door so as not to draw Bellas attention and finally make it outI go and talk to the officer to explain what happened he was really nice about it all and Im glad he saved my ass and Bella didnt meet her demise that day I explained to him how I was afraid that either I was going to die or the dog would end up shot which put him off because of the controversy of the last to officer shootings of dogs He says Everyone thinks we are going to shoot their dog I really wasnt thinking about that at all when I said it I was just happy to see the guy and happy in how professionally he handled the sit I owe him one for sureThe home owner shows up and the officer leaves Im speaking with her about the incident and she tells me how Bella is yo and normally they live to maybe  or  years and that Bella was just diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is about to be put down that this is why she behaved that way She told me that I could stay and work because Bella was in the back yard but she had to leave I really didnt feel comfortable being there alone after the incident and rescheduled for SaturdayI have other clients that have great danes that I can go over to their house anytime and do work when they are gone and they dont bother me at all but Bella was old dying and was uneasy about me because of the yappy puppy My new policy is to never enter anyones home with an animal that can easily kill me without the home owner there Had it been a sheltie or some such breed I could have taken a few bites and been fine but Bella could have crushed my skull with her massive jawsNever againHome owner called me later that day to make sure I was OK after the incident I assured her that I held myself responsible for being stupid enough to go into her house with Bella inside I didnt want her to know that I blamed her for the incident she was already stressed enough about having to put her dog down soon She told me that she is having the

SirEDCaLot,54,45,1r4i39,255,This takes place several years ago  Id just been hired by a small independent IT firm  We provided all kinds of services to small businesses and we helped out a few home users as well it wasnt something we advertised but our business clients would sometimes want to use us to help with their home problems and we were happy to oblige  We werent cheap but we took pride in giving everybody even the dumb ones service with a smile and our customers were generally quite happyIm a brand new hire only been there a day or so  My business cards have just been approved and sent off to the printers and a shiny new neverbeforeused phone extension has been assigned to me  Its also worth mentioning that there was no voice directory you either dialed an extension or pushed single buttons to be put in one queue or anotherSo my phone rings the display shows a local number and indicates the call wasnt from a queue this caller punched my extension directly  The caller is a middleaged sounding womanMe This is EDC first name how can I help youCaller  Yes hello is this SirEDCaLot first and last name at company  she knows my name and extensionMe  Yes it is  What can I do for you todayCaller  Well Im having a problem with my Apple Silver computer its probably something simple but someone at the public library gave me your card impossible my cards didnt exist yet and said you could help me fix it do you do that sort of thingMe  Absolutely Id be happy to help you out  Do you or your company have an account with usCaller  Well no you see my son used to fix my computer hes very smart you see but now hes in the Navy so he isnt around to fix my computer anymore can you help meMe  Id be happy to help but first we have to set up an account for you  Can I get your first and last nameCaller  Thank you  My name is firstname and I really dont know very much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me but then he joined the Navy now he works on an aircraft carrier and fixes the computers on the ship he knows a lot about computers hes very good with themMe  That sounds very exciting  What is your street addressCaller  Oh I live just off mainroad near the WalMart its a nice neighborhood but its just not the same since all the children moved away my son used to play basketball with the boys from across the street we had a net set up in our driveway and they had a lot of fun did you know they have a basketball court on the aircraft carrier where my son works when my son lived here he would play basketball with the boys across the street with a net in our driveway minutes of this go by during which I hear all about this womans son but despite many attempts still havent gotten past the name and address area of the New Account pageCaller  blah blah blahSo I really dont know that much about computers you see my son used to fix my computer for me whenever it would break and that was very nice of him but now he works for the Navy and hes on an aircraft carrier so when I have a problem with my computer I have no idea how to fix it so I decided I should probably learn so I borrowed a copy of Windows XP for Dummies from the local library remember she has a Mac and Im almost done reading that so I was thinking your company should hire meMe face firmly planted on desk    uhhh  thats not really my department  did you want to set up an account with us so we can fix your computerCaller  Well my son used to fix my computer but now hes in the Navy so he cant fix my computer for me facepalm but Ive been reading my Windows XP for Dummies book apparently the right book for working on Macs who knew every night for the last two weeks so I hope I can work part time for your company maybe answering the phone or helping people with their computer problems like you doMe  Um Im not really the one to talk to for that if you want I can transfer you to someone who could take your resumé   meanwhile furiously typing out an allcaps IM to my boss  IF I TRANSFER YOU A CALL FROM xxxxxxxxxx SEND IT TO VOICEMAIL DO NOT ANSWER THIS CALL TRUST ME ON THISCaller  Okay that sounds good I think I should call you back tomorrow then my potroast is almost done and I dont want to burn it my son never liked to eat potroast but he is a good boy so he would always pretend that he liked it and he would fix my computerMe  Well you should make sure your potroast doesnt burn then  Why dont you give us a call back when you have your resumé readyCaller  Okay then I think that is a good idea I will call you again later and I think I should go check on my potrclick  she hung up not meFINALLY  minutes later am holding a nowdisconnected phone staring at a New Account screen with nothing but a first nameEpilogue  Boss wasnt too impressed with my IM ignoring customers  bad but seemed to understand my explanation  We both felt bad for the woman but theres not much we could do to help we couldnt afford to sit on the phone for hoursThe woman called back two weeks later seemed to have no memory of our previous conversation but I got to hear all about her son in the Navy and how she was reading Windows Mobile for Dummies to learn about her shiny new iPhone her first cell phone ever  The third time she called I fortunately recognized her phone number and was rewarded with a severalminutelong voicemail  I forwarded it to the boss who after listening for  seconds called to thank me for the previous IM warning and apologized for doubting my judgment hehWe never did figure out how she got my name or extensionTLDR The

RoninSpartan,17,31,1r251v,115,So have I got a tale for you One that has just happened fairly recently A tale of abuse and unjustly assumption of which I was wrongly accusedA little background first though I have been working at my current position of an Information System Specialist at a college for a little over a year now under a contract based on soft monies Previous to that I did a bit of IT work as a workstudy picking up some information about the network and learn what I could with the limited access that I had The offer to take on this position was made because of the server crashing of course the institution was not keeping proper backup procedures and them having  other IT personnel  of whom were under utilized but one ridiculously overpowered network adminThroughout this year after my hire I was able to implement a backup scheme with twotiers attend to employees issues with their laptops and computers as well as their part of the website learn about Server  to prepare the network to shift from a NovellGroupwise environment to a Windows NetworkingExchange environment and do most if not all of the grunt work of a workstudyThe storyNow because of my situation I had been restricted from most of the access to some servers and services However there was one I had acquired administrative access to in order to pick up some of the duties from one of our IT guys Shortstuff leaving for another department within the college He had been dealing with the network admin for about  years and just got totally sick of it This access was to a scheduling system that the campus used for classrooms events and such This scheduling system would send out notifications when rooms were booked and also HVAC alerts to certain people Previous to learning the system we would have to go in and manually check for any requests for IT set ups this was a rather tedious task and new it could be sent through a notification rule sometimes it would get too busy to check or the request for an IT set up needed some testing before the event and didnt want to see it last minuteSo I read the manual about two months ago shortly after obtaining admin access and found out how to create IT work order notifications tested with one of the other users that book events for the college Success Now we and by we I mean I didnt have to manual check for work orders we were alerted at least  days in advance It was then that other notifications had stopped sending out although no one had mentioned it until last weekI had tried to figure out what could have happened I know I hadnt deleted anything and only added in that notification rule for IT I went about checking everywhere I could in that system and couldnt find where they might have been since I didnt see anything except the IT work orders in the notification rules It puzzled me so I asked Shortstuff what could be going on he mentioned it could be a service on the server that needed to be reset Ha well I didnt have access so I asked the network admin to look into it He restarted the service but said that it had not stopped I started to think what the hell could have happenedThe IT director had asked whether I had deleted anything when I added in that notification rule or if I might have done something to that system I told him No I didnt delete anything I only added in those IT work order notifications for us to receive an alert Come to find out yesterday the network admin was not getting important notifications about some events of the HVACs and such for quite sometime The IT director later that morning had walked into my office because of a FilePrint Server Cluster I was tasked to create I opened up the scheduling program to check something and noticed I only had access to check the work orders and nothing else I was pissed I know what I did and would not do anything to hinder the network further than the state it was already with the network admin having so much control over everything I looked at my IT director and was shocked So even though I didnt do anything I get my admin access taken away He just replied with Oh and stepped outIt was almost noon and headed out to the cafeteria for lunch thinking I could try and have a dandy time with some stir fry Shortstuff had decided to eat at the cafeteria as well he said to check the text he had just sent I pull out my phone and read that his administrative access had also been stripped from him as well In the huff and puff state the network admin was in without any notice or proper authorization took both my access and Shortstuffs administrative access from that systemWe decided to do some investigation and found out that the other users on the scheduling system didnt lose their administrative access This was directed toward us that we were some how at fault for this screw up and did not blame anyone elseMe and Shortstuff got to discussing about this whole issue in the hallway when comes along Ladyblonde just to hear us frustrated about this ordeal She asked about what had happened and we let her know Almost immediately her face had this fright of realization and she uttered I think I might have done that She went on to say after moving departments she no longer needed those emails of the event and thought by removing those notification rules she was only removing herself from them I had an intense moment of joy and confidence for this is the proof of our wrongful accusation and that we were not at fault at all This was the last straw for Shortstuff and he is going to use it on top of everything that has happened to him in the preceding years to take down the network admin Later that evening just before I left to head home I stopped in to talk with the IT director and update him on needing an IP address for the File server role on the cluster He then mentioned about us not being at fault but letting the network admin continue his frustration for the time being to figure out the notification rules without our help Ladyblonde had gone in and informed the IT director of her mistake without us telling her to We were going to have her come in today when we meet with the IT director on this issue I still have not been restored my admin access and we plan on meeting today to get this resolved and hopefully straighten out the network admin for his not just this one but many assumptions and wrongful accusationsWill keep you all informed of the result  Update I happened to discuss this little fiasco with a user I work closely with on booking and reserving rooms for IT work orders and such She has just recently started working here a few months back Yesterday when the network admin and tried to figure out what I did wrong he gave her a call She had let him know what I did to send out notifications and that I was trying to figure out why the other notifications had stopped sending He stated about me He doesnt know what he is doing He went in the system and screwed something upGODOFIT  network adminUpdate  So I had a chance to speak with the IT Director on this matter and how I felt about this situation I told him my whole side of and what I had heard from the user I work closely with He replied with This has happened in the past to Shortstuff before and I had talked with GODOFIT about it previously It seems like I will have to have a bigger discussion and bring in the higher ups about this incident He told me that he will let things settle before he starts the process for me to be able to get my permissions back for that system I understand that he may want it to sit and wait it out but IT WAS WRONG TO TAKE THEM AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACEShortstuff told me he let the IT Director know that all incidents he has encountered with GODOFIT will be on the Presidents desk on Monday morning and that this was the last straw Shortstuff had only gave a heads up to IT Director as a friend  Shortstuff put up with GODOFITs shit for  years I get to enjoy this weekend filled with homework and maybe just maybe start shifting gears with my side business to further promote my computer repair skills as well as some network and server experience We are supposed to have that meeting shortly this will definitely be a point that is brought uptldr strip my admin access and wrongfully accuse me youre going down mofo Edit they hired me cause they needed another IT guy to find out how to back shit up after their server had crashed ,1384956924.0,An abuse of power led by a wrongful accusation,146,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

Kataclysm,28,4,1r2eke,45,I work in IT Ive been involved professionally for going on seven years now and have been involved with computers on a personal level for going on  I cant tell you how many times Ive explained to people the importance of having a secure password changing it regularly updating ALL account passwords when youre compromised in one way or another regardless of date changed and stressing the importance of not using a universal passwordI dun fed upFlash back to about  months ago My personal Walmartcom account was accessed without my knowledge and around  worth of Samsung Galaxy tablets were purchased and sent to someone I had no clue as to who they were At least I knew the individual had some taste in electronics The timing was pretty awful for this because it resulted in my bank account going into overdraft and in several late bills with accompanying late fees as well as overdraft fees which my bank refused to refund After the two weeks of hell ordering new debit cards because at the time I wasnt sure exactly HOW I was compromised I decided it better to be safe than sorry and generally being completely broke with  kids and a pregnant wife to take care of which wasnt a heck of a lot of fun I ended up getting the charges reversed This mistake cost me around  I had made several serious mistakes regarding my online presence at this time I used a unified password system  password to rule them all My old password was a mere six characters long alpha only They were a combination of letters that were higher up on the alphabet and completely random but still not complex enough I trusted Walmartcom to store my personal credit card details for future purchase ease so I didnt have to spend that  seconds remembering my information and typing it inLooking back I suspect that my wife had a piece of spyware or something else on her computer because I never shop on Walmartcom But hey lesson learned passwords changed computers nuked and reloaded from orbit Its the only way to be sure problem resolved During this time of extreme paranoia while I suspected everything and anything I went through and changed all of my passwords for all my accounts to different much more complex passwords  digit alphanumeric with scattered capital letters minimum I was feeling pretty secure I felt nobody was going to get the best of me againExcept I forgot one account A rather important one tooMy PaypalFast Forward to this last Monday morning Barely awake from the weekend hibernation and minimal sleep thanks to a gassy baby I dutifully slog into work and prepare my workstation for another day of customer calls complaints and general incompetence I check my personal email on my personal laptop and see a few emails from PaypalKenneth Harrison accepted your payment Timestamp at  AM Im pretty sure I was asleep during this time Or at least trying to sleep Son of a  Followed by another email from PaypalImportant We noticed unusual activity in your Paypal accountWell good for you nice to see you didnt put a stop to it Thanks loads all you did was limit my account didnt ask me to verify any transfers before pushing them through Thats just brilliantSo I look at the first email and turns out this individual so kindly transferred  to themselves for what I can only guess was for sexual favors because they did a great job of screwing me overI dutifully log into Paypal and immediately update my password from my old insecure one which I should have updated earlier but had completely forgotten I had a Paypal account Shame on me I perform a little housekeeping on my account settings and then go to the resolution center to dispute the transaction Still waiting hopefully the Paypal rep working the case is merciful and kindSo now again all my funds are tied up for at least another  days while Paypal waits to hear back from this guy just in time for the Thanksgiving Holidays This is completely my own fault preventable and I hope this is received as I meant it a cautionary tale for other IT workers The rules are not just for others they are for us as well and when we are caught not following proper procedures not only is it extremely embarrassing it can make us look bad to our clients should they discover our hypocrisy,1384964478.0,When changing account passwords dont forget to change ALL of them,49,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

frozenfoxy,1,8,1r1o5q,50,So I once worked for a company that offered IT support to many other companies around the globe Being the night owl I am I was all too happy to accept a position from AM to AM to support one of the bigger companies with a small team of eight people Of course supporting people on the night shift means we get all sorts of people from all over the world with completely different ideas on what kinds of programs are OK to run in a business environment  One night a man from Russia called in telling our supervisor his computer was possessed It sounded interesting so he put it on speaker for us to listen to between our own calls Whenever the man turned it on it would slow down significantly from when he remembered receiving the laptop followed by opening hundreds of programs that he swore he never installed  Our first thought was some sort of virus and we asked him when the last scheduled scan had run on his system He proceeded to tell us that he had never heard of viruses or antivirus programs before which seemed like it might have been a language barrier with him not understanding what we were talking about When opening the program he reported it told him the antivirus library was over  days old Nope not a language barrier after all  About two hours later the program reported twelve virus infections all of which we were able to get cleaned up properly followed by directing him to run the preinstalled antispyware program as well This came up with a lovely  or so hits Pretty high compared to most of his coworkers but not the highest we had ever encountered  With all these cleaned up we had him restart the computer to check if the problems had been resolved At this point the sun was starting to rise and we were getting a bit restless from the lengthy hand holding call Painfully he reported the phantom programs had not gone away even after the cleanup  Our supervisor was quite tired of the call by this point and asked for remote access permission to his computer The man exclaimed immediately YOU ARE DOING THIS WHY It took a good ten to fifteen minutes to calm him down and explain we had nothing to do with his ghost computer  He finally agreed that it was OK for us to access his computer once calm Dialing in to his computer came up with a sight that was somewhat embarrassing and unnerving in the midst of a technical support office A good  to  popups advertising various porn sites were all over my supervisors screen as soon as he got into the system The first seven windows that had opened were dialup porn services either in Russian or English When asked about them the man stated they were vital to his work which made it difficult for us not to have a laugh before we could ask him to hold for a moment and put the phone on mute  As we were calming down the door to the office opened It happens to sit very near our supervisors desk and has a fairly direct line of sight at his screen The person who had walked through was the senior manager for the technical center After taking a few steps forward she halted and stared rather blankly at my supervisors screen Without missing a beat he cracked a grin and stated with no further explanation Hes Russian The manager shook her head and left without a word a visible blush on her face causing our laughing to pick up again  We were able to uninstall all the porn programs pretty easily but even to the final day we worked there together wed all have a laugh every now and then when that manager passed and reminded us of the phantom porn,1384932811.0,Night of the Phantom Open Programs,58,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

Shadowlady,29,59,1r046v,292,First of Im not sure if this is the right sub as its not your typical Tale from Tech support its more shocking than funny but I need to share it Also I wouldnt mind hearing if you guys experienced anything similarBackstory I do outsourced tier  IT support for a major gas company supporting many of their different locations world wide Today a colleague asked me to take over one of his tickets because the user was a homeworker that went to the office specifically to have an issue resolved with his laptop that was not letting him log in but my colleague did not have time to call him as he had was working on another urgent matter Lets call the user DaveDave had been chasing this already calling repeatedly and stressing our level  out I had somewhat of an idea what was going on and how to resolve it so I figured I would call Dave immediately calm him down by letting him know Im on it That way I could also confirm the details I needed with him directly instead of picking through a week old ticket with  updates to find all the relevant bits of information That didnt work out to well because of course the main phone number given on the ticket was his home number and his office number was somewhere in the middle of one of the updates So instead I caught Daves wife a lovely lady who informed me that Dave was in the office today because he was having issues with his laptop I sheepishly apologized explained that was why I was calling and that this was the number I had She said she would check for his cell phone number but she just got a new cell phone so she was struggling to find it In the mean time I found the update with another number on the ticket so I thanked her for her help told her that I would try the number and if by any chance it didnt work I would call her back The number worked but Dave was not picking up I left a Voice mail and went to work Once an update he was missing was installing I focused on some other tickets and forgot about it A couple hours later I checked and everything was completed successfully I tried to call Dave again but still no answer It was nearing the end of the work day and I didnt want Dave to be stuck in the office waiting for IT to do something thinking his issue was not resolved yet So I called Daves wife to tell her that just in case he calls her let him know he can go home the issue is resolved Then Daves wife drops this on me there has been a major explosion at the gas refinery Dave works at  people were killed and another is missing She hasnt been able to reach Dave either I let out a huge gasp and all my colleagues are staring at me trying to figure out what were speaking about They dont speak Dutch so they cant understandDave is not one of the people named missing or killed but not being able to reach him has clearly upset his wife Im completely stunned I apologized for bothering her with something as trivial as computer difficulties right now and I check and tell her Dave should be fine as his office building is not anywhere close to the refinery Thank god she then tells me Dave just texted that he has been in a meeting all day and thats why he didnt reply The moment I hang up I get a message from first line Dave is on the line and would like to speak to me He just wants to know if his laptop is workingThe only proof I can provide httpukreuterscomarticleuktotalexplosionidUKBREAIPPhttponlinewsjcomnewsarticlesSBEdit added reuters link because wsj has a paywall,1384893028.0,I just had the biggest scare of my career and I need to vent,351,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

Zehnpae,17,14,1r05kc,98,I think one of the most eye opening experiences a young technician can have is working as a field technician  Going into businesses and peoples homes gives you an appreciation for just how varied the technical field really is  You just cant explain the feeling you get when you start out your work day fixing a server located in a pantry next to an old microwave and then end it showing someone how to safely download oddly specific pornography of seminude girls on exercise balls without getting a virus on their PCAs with most careers though you eventually have that moment where you wonder Is this job really worth itIve hinted at the story before and I may have posted it under a different username in the past but I got a few requests to tell it again so here goesI spent a few years as a house call PC repair tech This was back in late s earlynaughties doubles when it was still a bit of an oddity  These days you have a kid on every street offering to fix your computer in exchange for a hamburger  Back then the only competition was Geek Squad and once people started figuring out we could fix their computer faster cheaper and without them having to leave the house  It was no contestMy schedule got busy pretty quick I would get asked for by name more often than not  I had adventures every day was an adventure  I collected stories like pokemon  Stories of delight terror and everything between  But the one thing that unifies all field technicians is that one story  The one that haunts you in your waking dreamsI pulled into the parking lot a little past one in the afternoon  Id worked that trailer park before  It was mostly retirees with the occasional single dad  This particular trailer had the mandatory  plastic lawn chairs area carpet rug on top of the gravel and random assorted squirt guns  Nothing out of the ordinaryI checked my collar knocked on the door and waited  After a few moments your standard old lady lets call her Betsy answered the door  I introduced myself and Betsy exclaimed Oh youre that geek guy Come on inI took a step inside the door felt a crunch took another step felt another crunch  Betsy closed the door and as my eyes adjusted from the brightness outside I looked down and I realized with a mental quiver just what I had walked onKitty litterI glanced around and found that it was everywhere  I couldnt actually see the floor itself  I was stunned into a moment of silence and sedation as I took it in  My natural instinct was to turn and leave with a big nope but I was too much the professional  I asked her where the computer wasBetsy smiled either unnoticing or uncaring of my shattered perception of old people and began to lead me towards what I hoped wasnt some sort of bizarre sex dungeon where shed chop me up and then scoop away my bloody chunks along with more litter  I remember noticing that the furniture was actually buried in the kitty litter not settling on top of itShe led me down a short corridor crunch crunch crunch crunch  She led me into a small room with a desk buried a few inches deep in more litter crunch crunch crunch  Underneath the desk was an aging Gateway computer a relic of a long gone era  She offered no explanation almost no awareness of it being there  I didnt have the wherewithal to ask  Ive seen some shit but I was channeling some epic level of stoicness to not start crying or begging for an explanationShe gestured at the computer explained that as of a few days ago it wont turn on anymore  I knelt downyeahI knelt down in the freaking cat litter to check the cabling and fiddle with the power button  Standard PC repair operations right  I did have to dig the power strip out from about an inch of litter  It was then I noticed the stuff was packed about  or  inches deepThe power checked out I could charge my phone  I quickly swapped the power cable with a known good cable  No dice  No spin nothing  I then made my third big mistake of the dayI opened the case upYou know how when you pour kitty litter theres that dust that flies into the air  You know how computers tend to accumulate dust over time  If it had been cocaine Id be retired in the Bahamas right now with twin sisters making me waffles every morning  What escaped was a powdery fury that pretty much explained why the PC had simply given up on life  At that point there wasnt much keeping me going eitherI explained to my credit calmly and without wavering in my voice that due to dust collection in the computer the machine had probably overheated or otherwise mechanically failed and it would cost more to have me fix it then it would to just upgrade the dinosaur of a PC she had  I suggested she elevate the PC above her desk and clean it regularly should she purchase a new one  I thanked her and then leftIt was until I was outside swearing to myself wondering what the hell just happened that I realized I hadnt seen a single cat,1384893914.0,Maintaining integrity in the face of

Keurigbrewed coffee Id prised open ten Kcups of Dark Magic to fill a doublefilter of coffee which I then brewed up The weather in Austin had started to get cool again after a weekend that was an alltoounpleasant reminder of the ballscorcher that was summer and my helldesk was absolutely swamped with tickets On top of everything my secondnewest PFY had injured himself and was on reduced duty so it fell to me to get things done in his steadNever send a PFY to do a network admins job I continued sliding back into my chair and sitting on my feet as is my wont and my cell phone burst into Rick Astleys dulcet tones signifying an incoming call I arched an eyebrow  I hadnt expected the campus tech to call me not when he had a PFY to unload troubleshooting on A quick flick of the screen later and my Ones speakers blasted his voice out into the officeHey Jack weve got a problem here he said frustration evident in his voiceIs it NEWPFY I took a sip Because I just happen to have the financial aid office at TEXASCOLLEGE in my contact listI could tell his reply would be negative before he even said it No he didnt do anything He knows better Ive got something new for youHe detailed the situation leaving nothing out  apparently a kid had driven his expensive SUV out to offcampus lunch at a very popular nearby restaurant and in his brilliance when he ran into the restaurant he left his tablet and phone on the front seat and the car unlockedThe imbecile also left his keys in the cupholderYou can guess where this is goingTen minutes later when he came out with his order his gadgets were gone and so was his nice new carHe got a lift back from a friend who had stopped there for lunch after he did and the administration was in an uproar I shrugged A car stolen Whoopdyshit thats why we have insurance itd be covered The tablet Not so much A police report had already been filed and we were asked to track the tablet and phone in order to recover them and if it was at all possible to try to save the carIts the principle of the thing I thought to myself as I plugged the kids credentials into iCloud and threw his phone into Lost Mode A few clicks later the police report number was registered with Computrace and the tablet flagged as stolen Such useful tools but only in the right hands I smirked Of course it would be a TRAGEDY if this were to be misusedAbout twenty minutes later the device stopped moving ReloadEvery is SUCH a nice tool and after pouring another cup of Dark Magic I took a look at the final location Something seemed off about it I grabbed the nearest crossstreets and plugged it into Google Maps then switched to Satellite View My eyebrows went up at what I saw and I put down my coffee cup before laughing my ass off and grabbing my keys I drained my coffee then dialed a number on my cell on the way out the door I had a drive to make    A SHORT WHILE LATER     I walked into the school phone and bag of fast food  from a rather popular nearby restaurant in hand and strolled into the campus techs officeWhatre you doing here he asked Didnt you track the phone and tabletI nodded and passed him my One with Google Maps pulled up to the approximate location of the phone followed by the bag of food His eyes widenedYouve got to be jokingI shook my head and flipped the phone to Gallery showing him a picture I took not twenty minutes before not entirely coincidentally taken outside a rather popular nearby restaurant and he started chucklingI pity him I could sense the laughter rising in him and he stood up and locked his machine The kids in the office he said and walked out of his office with me following I threw a nod and a smirk to my newest PFY who was sitting in the corner stripping down machines for parts in his free periodSure enough the kid was in the office and his father was there too as well as one Austin police officer with a notepad in handDid you find my phone the kid said jumping to his feet and looking at the campus tech franticallyForget the phone his father said Wheres the carIm honestly surprised he doesnt know I replied Given what he did he should know IMMEDIATELY where his phone and tablet  and yes his car too  wentWhat are you talking about the dad said his expression blanker than a new chalkboardDoes this look familiar I said turning my phone around to face the teenager and the fatherI went to lunch there today thats where my car got stolen the kid retorted So whatDoes THIS look familiar I repeated flipping to the next picture in the sequence the one Id shown the tech

only parked there for like ten minutesAnd thats all they needed to take the car I replied flipping over to the phones last location in Google Maps which when looked at via satellite view was the towing companys storage lot As of ten minutes ago your phone was there and I daresay youll find the tablet and keys there tooHis father glared at himThe cop glared at himHe glared at meI breathed on

FUT,36,41,1qy0uq,168,Xpost from a comment I made on a gaming subreddit Was told it fits hereSo a few years back at Gamestop I sold a brand new xbox NOT THE USED POS  Like next week he comes in and of course I happen to be working Im thinking red ring at this point as this was just before the redesignNopeThe conversationevent goes as follows to the best from my memory My manager even filled in a few parts that I forgotPut this image into your mind before reading the conversation I am a lb skinny white teen trying to calm down a lb super pissed off black man He was chill last week Me Hey welcome to gamestopAt this point I knew it was gonna be interesting as he didnt respond stared me down and proceeded to slam the  box on the counterMr T Yo yall sold me a roachboxIm calling him Mr T just cause his build haircut and angerMeRoachbox Does it turn on When it turns on is there any kind of red lights displayed on the power button or does the power supply have a light that changes Im about to just take it out of the box and test in myself cause this wasnt going anywhereMr T IDK ABOUT THAT SHIT YALL SOLD ME A MOTHERFCKIN ROACH BOX My manager hears this going down and comes over to help about once a month people go fucking mental in gamestop so its kinda the normSo my manager and I open the box and it smells pretty rank Not to be confused with dank wasnt that kind of roachboxIm thinking to myself wtf happened in  weeks to make this thing smell like someone took a dump in the CD tray The female employee working with us at the time for only  days so far I might add ran to bathroom to vomit and forgot that only the manager has the keysyeah it was frantic rush but I digressSo I reluctantly remove the xbox from the packaging to test and inspect As I am doing that my manager makes some progress with Mr TMr T THERE ARE GOD DAMN COCKROACHES IN THE XBOXNow Ive heard of roaches in electronics but never seen it in person let alone  week old xbox  Ok so now the inquisitive biologist in me is intrigued I check first to make sure its the same system sold on the recipet serial number Check Get gloves from the back room Check I checked the tamper sticker and it looked fineSo I plug this smelly POS into our test unit turn it on and right after the fan kicks in a fuckton of super small cockroaches pour out of the system vents in every direction There other people in the store minus the lady that left with her child after he cursed so it was like Whack a mole on the counter desperately trying to get the roaches back in the box or trash to seal up before customers see it Honestly we didnt get them all Now knowing what a roach box is my manager looks at me and we both start to make each other laugh when we dont want to Mr T See yall sold me a roachbox Manager Do you by chance have a problem with roaMr T MOTHERFCKER ARE YOU SAYING I HAVE ROACHES IN MY HOUSE MY HOUSE IS NEW THERE AINT NO ROACHESI pretty much take the back seat on this one I really dont have the authority to return a console that has been taken out of the packaging let alone with bugs in it  My manager tries to explain to him the box was sealed locked in our back room and our store was the newest in the area There were no roaches in the storewell before the xbox was brought back there wasnt at atleastSo hes getting more and more pissed Its getting to the point where we have told him to watch his language multiple times and its borderline to where we call one of our cop friends that frequents the store or something I ended up calling the district manager while the store manager tried to diffuse the situationlike everyone left the store at this point cause Mr T was gonna explode at any second I explain the situation to the district manager who says we cant take it back I have to repeat myself again describing the loss of salescustomers he is causing He told us directly to NOT call police and to deal with it Before I could tell him that the employee in training vomited from the biohazard he district manager started the customer is always right bullshitMy manager couldnt afford to lose his jobcareer as he put years into getting a store  I was about to quit and go to college fulltime so I decided to just return the console under my name still bad for my manager though but our best option without getting a swat team called in It is basically a process where you sign that it is against company policy etc In the space where you say why I wrote ROACHBOX  Boxed it up immediately and off to the refurb center it went We made it clear to Mr T that it was user error and we fixed his fucking error The customer is not always right Get your house sprayed for bugs or dont live like a hoarder I never got contacted about the  shrink There are various reasons why they let it go but thats a story on its ownWe replayed that on the surveillance video so many damn times it was just clear enough to lip read the customer Was worth the frustration with all the laughs from that TLDR  Roachbox  Enough said,1384826831.0,Roachbox ,209,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

SpaceLobster,21,30,1qxvdp,78,It was an early morning in the winter It was a beautiful sunny day in the neighborhood cool but crisp enough to be enjoyable This one day I received this deskto Ok this person was about  years old and refused to listen to anything I saidwas acting like a two year old on candy and coffee and I overcharged him for parts that were found just laying around As usual I take in the desktop and I asked Whats the problem youre having The customer points to the VGA port and starts to wiggle it The explained to me they left the computer on during a thunderstorm and their internet on the computer stopped working I said ok Then they proceed to tell me when one of their family members went to unplug it they yanked the monitor chord too hard and it became loose Now Im smiling ear to ear I figured it wouldve taken one or two parts and I was done with it I didnt have a basic video card on hand so I calculated about a week with shipping the part I take a look at the machine and noticed right away the VGA port is extremely loose as soon as I open up the case and remove the motherboard the VGA piece falls right off This was an old mobo no DVI About a week later I get the part check out the internet issue came to the conclusion the Ethernet port really was fried as well So of course I add a new card for the computer By the way this was just laying around As I went to turn it on to test it I get zero response Do a power supply test the power supply completely dies I called the customer to let him know they amount of work I have done and let him know about the power supply The power supply also was something just laying around This is how the conversation wentMe Hello this is SpaceLobster calling how are you todayHim Took you long enough Really It was barely a weekMe Well sir I had to wait on parts that were on order unfortunately I didnt have the parts just laying aroundHim What was the solution As I already discussed a day priorMe I had to replace the VGA Ethernet and Power supply Him What happened to the video thingyMe It came clean off the motherboard and there was no way for me to really save it When I tell you clean I mean you cant even tell it was meant to be there it took some force to break as clean as it didHim WhatMe I explained how the VGA is onboard for about  minutesHim So it fell offMe agitated YesHim Cant you justyou know put it backMe Facepalm and blindsided Nono I cannot The new video card is only  This I legitimately ordered Him Well whyMe All the tracers are completely missing I cant do anything other than replace it even if I were to solder it it would cost you a lot in labor Im saving you a ton of money right now Him What was the other things againMe The Ethernet port or as you know it as the Internet port was fried but I was able to replace that without any issuesHim grumbling I said my internet wasnt working why did you REPLACE it You couldnt just fix itMe trying to keep cool There was a short from the storm on the port I tried all I can to fix the onboard there wasnt much I could do for you other than a new part Him Great just trying to rip an old man off What about the other thing you didMe I replaced your supply that died Him The whatMe The part that makes your computer turn onHimscreaming HOW DO YOU DO THIS TO ME IM NOT SOME ALIEN SCUM INSERT RACISM HERE IM A GOOD WHITE CHRISTIAN INAUDIBLE Me hang upHim calls backMe The next time you scream at me Im taking the parts back and giving you the computer just the way you gave it to me I quickly amazon a random power supply print out the page as a receipt The power supply will cost you  It should have only been around  lol Him Fine hangs upAt this point I dont see or hear from this customer for nearly a month Finally comes in to pick up the computer Him How much do I owe youMe  for labor  for part I was only going to charge him  for the fix at first considering it was ridiculously simple as the parts should have only been around  Him Staring at meMe Staring back Him You really know how to rip people off Best Buy would fix it for me for freeMe I really doubt that Him You shouldnt have the nerve to charge me that money considering youve had it for over a monthMe I called you once per week to remind you its here how is this my fault you didnt showHim You had it over a monthMe To get him out of my hair Fine  labor Im not taking any less The guy pays me I give him the computer normally Ill turn it on in front of the customer to show them everything is running like new In this case I simply just showed him the new VGA port and the new Ethernet port that he can now use Im thinking its over at this point His last remark had to be leftA real tech can fix things Im sure a geek kid wouldve put the parts back like I

SkraeNocturne,14,6,1qwt6o,53,Bit of backstoryTheres a server at one of our clients that runs the server software for their handheld scanners  This software has a limit of about  connections at any given time  This software or at least their installation of it has an issue with disconnecting sessions  If a scanner goes to sleep or is otherwise taken offline the connection remains open in the server software even though it has nothing to connect to  When the scanners come back online they open a new connection in the server software even though their old connection is open  The manufacturer of the software is aware of this and refuses to fix it because most of their customers arent running as many scanners as the client does  A quick note this was apparently not by design they discovered this when our client and one of our techs informed themSo we set up a script to monitor when the connections are nearing the limit send an email to our help desk to let us know and restart the machine  We are getting the emails but its apparently not always restartingSaturday I got this emailgtFrom  Shipping person  gtSubject  ltprogramgt high importance  gtBody  Are ltprogramgt is down Can you get it upgt gtThanksgt gt gtShipping personI dont work weekends  Weekends are my day to run errands and relax so I didnt see the email until  hours later  If you have a high priority process go down why would you email somebody on their day off  Our help desk email and phone number are labeled on every computer they have  I know because I put them there  Using those will get the issue taken care of so much faster instead of several hours laterTLDR  This is high priority Ill inform them using low priority channels,1384798786.0,Just a quick one from the weekend,59,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

the door and mind the gap    The year was  Clinton was gearing up for his reelection campaign the Bojinka Plot was exposed due to a chemical fire the Oklahoma City bombing was perpetrated and the Tokyo subway was attacked with sarin gas by Aum ShinrikyoHowever as these are irrelevant to our story well skip that and go straight to Houston Texas where an elevenyearold fifth grader was headed to school with a rather hefty book in his backpack one that most people his age wouldnt even begin to comprehend let alone bother to pick up He looked forward to the day of schoolwork despite being bullied by his peers for being different and nerdy and the many Macintosh computers at his school were an escape for him System  had been released the semester before and it had been installed across nearly every machine at the schoolNumber Munchers Oregon Trail Carmen Sandiego OutNumbered and Treasure MathStorm Games all morning he thought to himself as he walked in the schools front door and headed to his classroom He picked up the copy of the Houston Chronicle that had been delivered to the school that day  to a classroom  some educational program paid for it took out the front local business and lifestyle sections then snuck down the hall to the teachers loungeTechnically he wasnt supposed to be in there However when it was the only room to get even halfway decent coffeeWell a detention would be worth itHe retrieved a styrofoam cup of coffee headed for the doorHe almost made itWhat did I tell you about coffee The computer teacher chuckled as she came through the door and took the boys coffee his disaffected grumbling not stopping her as she ruffled his hair Youll stunt your growthAw come on please the boy replied looking up at the woman with innocent doe eyes It just tastes good and it makes me look more adult when I read the papersI thought I told you last week she replied with a smile Dont be in such a hurry to grow up Youll get there eventually and youll always wish youd spent more time as a kidThe kids are stupid he grumbled They dont know how to not die of dysentery in Oregon Trail They dont know how to catch Carmen They keep asking me how to use the Fodors guide They cant even solve the math problems in OutNumbered before the TV goes away and they get zappedThe teacher knelt Not all kids are like you you know Some are lucky some arent quite as lucky Either way dont complain Just help them if they get stuckFine Ms D he muttered Can I PLEASE have my coffee I have stocks to checkShe shook her head and passed him the bubbling beverage I dont want to know just why youre doing thatHe scampered off coffee and newspaper in hand    LATER THAT DAY    After being slammed around the playground into various pieces of play equipment the boy was tired of it He went into his sanctuary the computer lab and sat down at one of the Macs then started a game of Number MunchersA pair of hands started mashing on his keyboard causing him to look up in annoyance Hey Cut it outThe boys malefactor shook her head and continued slapping his keyboard causing the Troggle to eat his MuncherWhatd you do that forYoure stupid the girl sneered at him Youre a nerd and we all hate you Go back to the school you were at beforeQuiet anger and frustration bubbled up inside of him but before he could say something or do something the computer teacher leaned over and tapped the girl on her shoulderAhem You know youre not supposed to say things like that rightSorry the girl apologzed quite insincerelyGet to your lunch break Youre not allowed in here right now If I catch you acting like that again you dont get to play games in here for a monthAfter the girl walked out the teacher turned back to the boy and sighed Look theyre going to come after you again and again until you stand up for yourselfI know he muttered quietly I just dont know what to doJust dont hit her Its not nice and boys dont hit girls The teacher walked off and the boy pulled the very heavy book out of his bag and started readingMacworld Macintosh Secretshttpimgurcomdie    THAT EVENING    The boy was in heavenHis mother worked for the county teaching ESL English as a Second Language to Hispanic immigrants at that school on Monday and Wednesday nights and sometimes if his father was working late his mother would bring him and his sister along with her but she left them with the childcare crew which a lot of the time took the kids to the computer lab and let them have three whole hours in itAfter a particularly good round of Carmen Sandiego the boy returned to reading his massive tome and an idea struck him one with which he could revenge himself on his tormentorFortunately there were precious few children in the computer lab that evening and the machine he went to was unoccupiedAfter a few quick looks around he slipped a floppy disk into the drive and opened up a single program on it He flipped through pages in the book occasionally muttering to himself as he traced the words with his finger clicking and typing the whole way performing a veritable ritual on the machine one with an unclear finishAn hour later he ejected the disk shut the machine down and went back to his bookWhen his mother took him and his sister home he felt a deep satisfaction knowing that his class had the lab first thing tomorrow for a double period    THE NEXT DAY    Okay kids the teacher called out loudly Go to your assigned computers sit down turn it on and get ready Today I want you to play either OutNumbered or Treasure Mathstorm Miss Weaver said that she wanted you all to brush up on your math skillsThe boy went to his machine complied with the teachers request and began playing A short while later the bully raised her voiceMs D The computer isnt workingThe teacher got up and went over doubleclicked Macintosh HD and the Trash Can opened She closed it reopened it and the same thing occurred She opened the Trash and Mac HD opened with nothing visible inside it except the System Folder and some documentsHuh Well Ill have to fix this Itll take a while She looked around and there were no machines free Well theres no computers available so youre going to have to do a packet of worksheets we have for math SorryThe boy smiled to himself at his workstation and when the class went to its next period lunch he went over to the teacher whod had no time at all to work on the machineUm Ms D Can I help you fix the computerShe shook her head I dont think so This isnt something someone like you would know how to fixI think I kind of do know how to fix it Ms D Can I at least try pleaseShe shrugged and gestured to the machine Be my guestTwenty minutes passed and a sea of typing and clicking came from the machine the whole while The teacher had stopped what she was working on and went over to watch the boy at workSo someone renamed the Applications folder to a single space and deleted the icon She stroked her chin And then they changed the icons for Macintosh HD and the Trash Can then renamed them to each otherI think thats what happened the boy said a huge grin on his faceShe smirked and tousled his hair And I suppose that thats going to happen to it every Tuesday and Thursday morning that you all are in my classroomI dont think so Ms D the boy replied quietly I only think Im going to do it if she picks on me again He looked up in alarm at his faux pas I mean um I just told on myself didnt IThe teacher knelt down and looked in his eyes before hugging him and whispering in his earTold on yourself for whatThe boy looked up and a smile was on his faceCome on I think Ive got a few things to teach you the teacher said beckoning the boy to follow her into the computer rooms storage room I could use someone who can help me out with the computers here and I think youre the right kid to do it Jack    More modern things tickle your fancy Try

Tomagathericon,18,27,1quk95,149,Bear with me please because this needs some backstory  Some time ago i was working for a smaller bank that employed lots of elderly women They had only one tech guy and he couldnt nearly handle everything the people needed so most of the less important stuff just got ignored Even though i wasnt actually hired as tech i heard people complain about minor things and helped them out just cause it didnt take long Word got around i made work easier for people and soon i was doing all the less important things that didnt require their official tech guy    So one day one of the women in charge for bank transfers complained to me that creating a transfer history for customers took very long  Now to explain this all the transfers are saved in a system called LDMS Large Document Managing System with different lists for each dayIn order to create a transfer history for a customer these were usually created and billed per month youd have to search the system for the customers bank account number and get his transfers from each of the lists manually as each day was a seperate list  Now youd think they would just copy what they need paste it in a textfile then print that file when they have everything Nope that would be too easy  Instead what they did was print every single transfer one by one each on a new page then get an empty piece of paper cut out all the transfers they printed this is the part where the shears come into play glue them on the empty page wait for it to dry then make a copy of it which they would then send to the customer Theyd usually require several of those since one piece of paper wouldnt hold more than half a dozen transfers that way    I tried to show them the magics of copy amp paste and while they did notice it going much faster and easier the next day they had forgotten about it and went back to their old methods I believe they are still doing it this way    tldr Welcome to the handicraft class Today were gonna make a nice collage out of your parents bank transfers,1384724820.0,How to merge two documents without the need for shears,176,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

sharpie,60,162,1qqw7h,448,So I was talking about my student loans in rexplainlikeimfive and I briefly brought up my first work experience  A couple of cool cats asked me to go into detail about it because I mentioned the entire IT crew intentionally jumped ship at the same time and a propane tank explosion unrelated but how fukkin cool would that beI started the job as a Security Intern which included your average help desk work like fixing keyboards and monitors and answering questions but also meant I got to do audits of the University  It was unpaid but it was relevant work experience that I knew I would desperately need  This was fine because it was the opening to a lot of really cool shit that I got away with  We had something called a Computing Commons where students had access to specialized PCs  Some of them had Dev SDKs for games  Some of them had Autodesk  Mostly kids used them to play Minecraft or WoW or Heroes of Newerth  During that time there I had Admin on those systems and so I knew most of what was going on with them  If one went dark I knew where it was and could go fix it usually by imaging it or pulling it into the IT Dept if it was hardware relatedThis was well and good until one day I strolled in and discovered that one of my friends who was the Security Technician essentially my boss and getting paid was quitting  He hadnt graduated yet but had a better job lined up  Guess who got the bump up  This guy  hour to do the same shit I was already doing  FuckyeahSeaking  So now I was on payroll and shit was going smooth  I could pretty much make up my own hours  I had the Client Systems triage fukkin down  I wasnt building the images or doing the complex stuff but the IT Archwizards were glad I was there  I allowed them to focus  I was the one who absorbed and deflected the idiocy and I got paidAll great things do eventually go sour though  And you do have to know the sour to really enjoy the sweet  I walked in another day and there was something wrong  It wasnt the typical angry typing in silence when you knew something was wrong with a server  It was different  You could smell it in the air  You could smell what I could only describe as the fresh tears of an Admin  I own that name OldSpice fuck you  Come to find out that the Client Systems Admin who was my boss now was changing his grades  Now you might ask why was a student the Client Systems Admin  Well because thats how you do it when youre a diploma mill  Who can you pay less than one of the students youre supposed to be educating  Well anyways he didnt deny it and he couldve got away with it if he hadnt become too greedy  But alas guess who got bumped up again  Not this guy actually  No one did  Which was okay because he was a cool guy and left us with a very stable image of XP that accommodated everything wed need for at least a little while  So life went on with one less friend because he left mid semester and never actually graduatedNows the best time to tell you about the IT Staff  There was J who handled all of the servers and their services and S who handled all of the network infrastructure and the systems security  J forgot more things about Windows and Linux administration than Ill ever know  S was the kind of person you were thankful wasnt a foreign national  He was the kind of guy who lived for getting shells and man could he get shells  Getting a shell is a loose term for exploiting a system and getting a payload into memory that gives you a shell on that system  Finally there was M  M was the IT financials and the magic he could work over the phone with suppliers will never be rivaled   But thats all you ask  Yes these  guys managed a University of too many  They did it alone  They did it entirely without thanks  There were times when it seemed like the stress would be too much but they believed they were making it a better place  They thought that if they werent there then who would protect the neckbeards  Certainly not their parents  They paid for them to be here  To get them out of their basement  There was also the IT Manager R  He was one of the greatest guys I ever knew  He had a lot of other roles to fill but he trusted J S M and I and so we were largely unmanaged  It was how we survived and it was how the school survivedOne day sitting with us in our circle of chairs R just slammed his fist down stood up and said I dont usually do this but unless any of you object Id like to bring Sharpie on full time  No one objected and I swear to you that was one of the most prideful moments of my life  By the end of the day there was a contract on my seat  I found out later that it was one of the last things he did before he quit  I was sad but I was also happy because I was making more money than I had ever in my entire life  kyear  FYI happiness and sadness are not two great tastes that go great together  They are not peanut butter and jelly  More like jelly and shit because I imagine peanut butter would take away some of the shit taste but not jellyShortly after him S amp J quit as well  Im pretty sure R knew they would quit too but I have nothing but my perspective on the whole thing  I dont remember who had a job lined up first but J and S explicitly timed it so that both of them would leave together  This was mostly because of politics but also because there was never time for a rest or vacation  Their palms would sweat on their keyboards from the stress of managing these systems alone with thousands of students and staff depending on them  With the CEO explicitly not hiring on more staff things were just slowly falling apart and they were sick of it  Sick of not being paid enough I found out later they made kyear each there  Both had put in  years at least never a raise or vacation  Sick of the disrespect  wed have this bitch of an old woman walk into the office and just shit talk about it because there were computers in various degrees of repair  We would have to drop everything no matter how serious and arrange ticketed computers that interns were working on in neat little piles because who knows fucking why fucking up everything the interns just did to troubleshoot  There were also days once a month where wed be locked in one of the theaters for the entire day while the President would masturbate himself and his circle of investor assholes and tell us about how things were going to get better and ask us what we thought  No one ever put forward anything useful or critical because they were afraid of getting shitcanned  As a footnote  If theyd known that one day a few years into the future theyd be lined up literally and fired one by one like they were pigs getting slaughtered Im sure they wouldve done things different  But anyways  I couldnt get fired because it was me solely responsible for the Microsoft and Linux infrastructure the network and the client systems and M who bought everything and could quell the beast that was the staff and faculty  So at least we had that going for us which was niceThings really started going down hill close to Christmas time though thats when we rotated the systems in the Computer Commons  Obviously this is a problem for Windows XP  Windows  was coming out and our image which I didnt know how to Admin beyond pushing to systems was hella outdated and work for me was piling up because of it because of the servers because of the network  I made the decision to drop Ghost mostly because I hated Symantec but also because we had Microsoft tokens out the ass and Windows Deployment System was apart of the technology M tokens supported  Keep in mind I didnt know dick about doing this  So I learned from the ground up and I burned through tokens like a pimp making it rain and in  months we went from shitty XP to a less shitty Windows  environment  But also in that time I went from not being on Adderal to being on a prescription and my hair went from not falling out to falling out and I went from not putting on weight to eating like a fucking hogWhy was the Windows  shitty  Well partly because I was still learning partly because we were using roaming profiles and partly because for the two weeks before the migration I was alone in the IT department frantically trying to build these images discovering if you didnt set the skipRearm flag before you sysprepd an image  times you irreversibly fucked your image  Seriously when Windows  first came out that was pretty much undocumented  I remember when it started getting cold  They shut off the heat in the University because it was usually empty  I remember it reaching  in there and I sent M a text saying Hey man  Im freezing in here  I have a jacket but Im still really cold my feet are numb  Can you call maintenance I cant find their number  He sent me back lol  I never did get the heat on in there and so for the last two weeks before the deadline I fought the freezing cold to make that shit happenSo can you imagine being  being solely responsible for this kind of environment and standing before  computers starting to image them all and knowing just fukkin knowing that if this didnt work that you were going to fuck up not just your own day but everyones day  Youll never guess what didnt work  Spoiler  Pretty much everything  It took  hours to image  systems of the thousand we had because I could never figure out where the multicast was getting lost at in the network each one was being handled unicast creating its own link to the server creating a read to the same exact single Windows Image file  I felt really fuckin clever when I set up a RAMFS and placed the image in there to speed things up a bit  But never the less shit did not work  Shit did not work for a long time  At first it was that no one could log in  I fixed that it had to do with the roaming profiles and how we had a system variable reference a certain value which affected what roaming profile theyd pull based on what the system was supposed to be  Then it was all of the undocumented bandaids that had been wiped away in XP  Things like printers and start menu customizations and shit that people needed like shortcuts to shared folders instead of using the fucking network maps under Start gt Fucking Computer because they were Babyboomers and change scared them  Some of them were even worse Babyboomers and just flat out wouldnt use Windows   I had to go back to XP for them and personally educate them on everything about the transition  Which believe me can be a lot if youre not up for figuring it out yourself  All the while dealing with shithead kids that would torrent the network into the ground an undocumented network and server infrastructure and updates that had to be done manually  There were nights I just slept in the Computer Commons because it wasnt worth the drive homeShit was still fucked up around Valentines day  The students were never so pissed off that they threatened to leave though  They fucking should have though  I would have if I wasnt me  They didnt give a shit though  They could still play video games and thats all they ever needed  Valentines day was important to me because the staff and faculty fuckin rolled into IT that day and brought me a pile of candy the size of my dick  For the record popcorn comes in  sizes Small Medium Large My Dick  You get the idea  One of them even brought me a pig with a heart sewed into its hands  One pissed off day a few months later I actually cut the heart out of its grip so that it was just a pig  She found out and sewed that shit back together  I wish Id taken that pig when I leftThings eventually settled down though  I persisted overcame and continued to do the best I could  They were worried about the security of the systems and they fuckin shouldve been so they hired another student who was and still is one of my best friends  He took over the network and security and helped a ton there and for a short while it was him who Ill call D M and Sharpie  I was able to focus down on the Windows  images and I was making real stridesThen one day they hired a new IT Manager  That was pretty much when things started going down hill  I couldve survived and probably wouldve stayed there a lot longer if they hadnt brought this guy on  The President actually hired him because he wanted to keep him on a sports team the President played on  He hired him because he wanted to own a human being  And so he did  This guy gobbled the Presidents balls and absolutely swallowed the gravy  Anything the President wanted this guy would do and worse yet the guy had no management experience  None at all  Guy didnt know dick about management so most days I would literally pretend there was an emergency and go take a conference room so I could get work done  It was that or having this fucking guy act like Napoleon Dynamite and play Lindsey Sterling videos  He ruined that shit for me  Not that I liked it that much but I went from Meh to unconditionally hating that shit  Hed talk about wanting to bang her in his shitty Napoleon Dynamite voice which was his real voice  Nevermind the fact that he had a wife and kid  A kid that looked like a Naird chimp by the way  Eventually they brought on a guy that swore he knew vCenter  They needed this because they wanted a virtualization professional for a really stupid project that I wont go into detail about  Guy didnt know how to use a serial cable to connect to vCenter  I had to educate a guy who was making more than me on fundamentals of Server Administration with a usb to serial cable which was fine but the guy was making more than twice my wagesNeedless to say shit got pretty tense in there  M D and I were brutal in our reviews of the new IT Manager and the President didnt like it  Of course they let go of the guy they could to make a point  They shit canned M  I was furious but there was nothing I could do except continue doing my job  He left and the best I could offer was a going away present  Universally up until the new IT Manager we were all huge gun enthusiasts M especially  He found zen in the long distance shot  He owned a rifle that Ive long since forgotten but was chambered in  Winchester Magnum  I called him up shortly after the shit canning and we negotiated his goingaway present  The opportunity to shoot a grill size full propane tank out in the middle of fuckin nowhereSo of course we had to do this in the wee hours of the morning  Got there at AM had to take some pretty mean trails that only a lifted vehicle could make and when we got there it was still pitch black  Stars look different when theres no light pollution to fuck with your night view  EDIT   So anyways were out in the middle of this park in the wee hours of the morning and hes stoked and Im stoked and I walk it about  yards out to the side of a giant hill  You dont know terror until youre out in the wilderness  yards away from the only light which is a trucks low beams  Theres just something about it that makes you understand why fire was the first thing we figured out  But anyways I dragged that shit out there with my knife out because I sure as shit didnt want to get eaten by a bobcat or something  Looked back and saw that it lined up pretty well and briskly jogged back  Terrified  I get back there and Ms like  dude whered you put it  I look back and its too fuckin dark to see it  So I break open my emergency kit from the truck and theres a glowstick in there  I walk out tie that shit on and finally get back  Ms already prone and stoked to fire by the time I get back  I instantly regret the decision but because he needed this I looked from in the bed of the truck over the cab  What felt like an hour was probably  seconds as M zeroed in prone and took his shot  The round entered the tank very off center but straight on creating what I can only describe as a spinning machine of death  At first you could see it spin because of the light but it quickly picked up enough speed to throw that off Thats when for the second time that night I discovered what terror really isIt sound like some kind of helicopter getting up to takeoff speed but somehow it hit something in the ground and it jetted probably  or  feet to the right from my perspective and proceeded in typical asshole fashion to start spinning up again  It did this two more times toward us during which I truly thought it was intentional but finally died down  After it stopped spinning for the last time and silence returned I looked down and M was still prone  Hed never moved  He just in the epitome of alpha male badassery said cool  We both walked out to get it partly because you dont leave shit behind when you go out in nature and blow stuff up but also because he wanted to show his  year old daughter  He said she loved this kind of stuff  We shot some targets after that then went home when others started showing up with similar ideas in mind  That was the last time I actually saw the guy,1384582732.0,Tales of an IT Rodeo Clown or How a University Employed a Student Just Before the Rest of IT Quit or Got Fired,610,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

              part the second                                      How to Win PFYs and Terrify EndUsers    Two weeks had passed since the tablets went out to the students and sure enough one student  one clever clever kid  had figured out how to get a local admin account on the devices with a WinPE flash drive with NTPWEdit on itNow normally we wouldnt be able to see that he was using it without a lot of work and since wed since run a script with net user ACCOUNTNAME activeno every two hours on every single tablet via psexec assetlisttxt due to the imaging company screwing up anyways the rest of the company didnt think that the damage was there I was a paranoid bastard though and I set up an alert in Computrace The tablets would call in every two hours and report a bunch of stuff like their IP address software installed et cetera My alert would textmessage me if anyone logged in using a nondomain account when the device called homeFortunately the idiot kid used it to make himself another local admin account this one with his Internet handle as the user name which tripped the alarm and texted me when it called homeApparently subtlety wasnt his strong suitThe next morning  a Friday  I had the tech who goes to the campus confiscate his tablet He called me with the kid in the IT room just for me to explain Being that I was on a bit of a DBZA kick I decided to talk over the phone using Mr Popos voiceWe know what you did I hope you enjoyed itUm can I have my tablet backMonday uh am I in troubleYoull find out on MondayAre you going to contact my parentsYoull know by MondayThe tech booted the kid out of his office at that and after a quick discussion with me about the kid parents were wealthy as can be kid was a gamer with an iPhone and time and money to burn got a full ride to a certain ultraconservative Texas college for engineering et cetera he hung up the phone I pulled out the PDF of the school handbook and after perusing it confirmed what I needed and repeated the process with some paperwork I had archivedMonday afternoon rolled around and sure enough the kids parents were sitting in the principals office with him and the campus tech I knocked discreetly on the door after a few minutes and apologized to the principal for being lateI dont think I know you Youre not the campus tech Who are you the kid asked with far less fear in his voice than one would expect I guess he figured that his dads money and status exec in a certain computer company would protect himIm the senior network administrator I replied sitting down and smoothing my slacksForgive me his father announced I dont see why we need to be here So he got caught misusing a computer Whats the big deal Just take it away from him for a whileI shook my head Unfortunately its not that simple Were it that easy wed just take the tablet away and refund your insurance check However theres several things that we need to factor in to this First off your son was using illicitly obtained administrative access to create backdoor accounts on the tablet in question Secondly we have heard from various students that he decided to spread this method around and show other kids how to do itWait whatQuite And when we called him on it he asked us if he was in trouble and if we were going to contact you I dont think he was sorry about it more like sorry he got caughtAt this point his parents were glaring at him but not seriously and he leaned back in his chair confident that any punishment would be something lightSo at this point I continued theres precious few things we can do We would LIKE it if your son put an apology in writing to us for this but thats really a formality at this point Given the severity of what he did immediate expulsion with failing grades in every subject is the punishment we have in mind for himTheir faces went slack his jaw dropped and even the principal looked over at me with an arched eyebrow However the campus tech nodded and the principal kept quiet The principal had an inkling The campus tech well he KNEW what I had in mind and he was impressedEXPULSION You cant be seriousOh but I am serious And dont call me Shirley The joke was illreceived so I continued on Theres an acceptable user policy Its in the code of behavior in the student handbook that he signed off on when he started the year You signed off on it too since hes a minor You all signed the forms AGAIN when we gave him his tablet It states in there that an offense of this severity is punishable by means up to and including expulsion Quite frankly given how confident your son made these kids with his methods of getting administrative access an example needs to be madeI turned to the kid And dont forget what this means You get expelled your free ride to STATECOLLEGE goes away as well Im sure that you could get in by other means  though why youd go there in the first place I havent the foggiest  but a full year of failing marks is kind of an eyeraiser to even the most permissive college and if they see expelled for attempting to defeat computer security measures on your transcript well I dont think that it would end wellThe hyperventilating started and I leaned back in my chair letting it sink into everyones heads that I well and truly hold a banhammer over some kids future and crossing me while it was over his head well it wouldnt end well at all since I appeared to have the campus tech and principal on my sideYOU CANT  Of course I smoothly said cutting the redfaced father off before he could reply we may have an alternate solution thats far more preferable Back in my day kids that were as creativeminded as he were regarded as possibly having a future in the information technology field In fact the administration would even give such kids extra training and knowledge in hopes that they would use their skills for good As a matter of fact thats what my high school did for me when I did something far worse than what your son did Given the level of skill required to do what he did Im certain that we could find a place for him in our new technology internship program here for the rest of the term if not the yearThe hyperventilating slowed and the father looked pensive while the mother was glaring daggers at the kidOf course your son would have to realize that being granted his privileges again would come with a price He will leave all of his cellphones at the office in the morning and the only computers hes allowed to use on school grounds will be our provided devices Any further attempts to circumvent security or perform malicious acts  or even ones that we perceive as malicious against our systems and networks  will result in immediate uncontestable expulsion I glared at the kid throwing him a lifeline Is that eminently clearHe nodded assent and his father agreedBe in the campus techs office tomorrow morning  AM I rose shook the fathers and mothers hands and walked out with the campus techI cant believe you pulled that off he said walking beside me I expected them to go ballisticQuite frankly so did I I replied checking around the corner to make sure we werent being followed Once we were back in his office with the door shut I sat down in the comfy chair and kicked my feet up So any plans for your new PFY he said raising his Mountain Dew in a saluteOh we cant trust him with anything especially local admin Hes going to be doing a LOT of triaging diagnostics and gruntwork perhaps some reimaging Good honest tier  helldesk work In fact I think Im going to make his cellphone our outofhours contact for any nonserverrelated stuff for the campuses with an expected acknowledgement time of  minutes to respond to the ticketOur maniacal cackles rang out through the office and he clinked his Dew bottle against my Doppleganger    And heres everything else Ive submittedhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportsearchqauthorATuxedoJackamprestrictsronampsortnewamptall    EDIT oh for

lnx,19,20,1qmkyh,180,This is more of a sad story to me than something funny  It was actually the nd month ever being in a call centerOk so I used to work for an ISP some time ago that will remain nameless and I got this call at around pm at night  It was for the ISPs firewall software as the customer a mother set it up and well blocked everything  She didnt understand the reasoning for a white list and that just blocking everything would well block everything  She called in mad at me that we dont make it easier  I tried to calm her down and was seemingly able toAfter probing the customer and empathizing I realized what she had done and proceeded to switch the firewall software onto a different setting that doesnt block all  Then she did the unthinkableMy stupid daughter probably did this she told me after she just told me she was the one who turned on the block all white list function  I promptly ignored her because I cant really obviously involve myself in that  That was about to changeShe puts her daughter on the phone who I should mention is in tears and is verbally getting yelled at by the mother from what I am hearing on the phone  At this point Im freaking out because I was new I wasnt trained well enough for this  My training was  weeks and that was itI just do what I can and yes I got written up for this  I stop following my script that the computer tells me I need to follow and talk to this daughter as a human I tell her its ok Im here to help and we will get the internet rolling again in no time at all  I managed to calm her down the mother finally walked off somewhere and I was able to then get her full attention as I imaged in my head what screens shes seeing I kinda have a photographic memory and remember most operating systems visually including the firewall software our ISP issued  Within  minutes it was going again  Turned out the mother even removed our preset white list which was quite comprehensive actually and we had to turn off the firewall and redownload our softwareThink its over  Mother came back on the phoneAt this point Im still not going by script anymore  I didnt want to put the blame on the already angry mother besides its unprofessional  So I instead just told her that there was a corrupted white list and we got it fixed and its working just fine now  She looks sees internet is happy  Then she messes with the white list again while on the phone with meAre you sure you want to erase the contents of the white list  she mutters  Yes she says  I face palm so hard I swear the entire floor heard it even the customer who was on mute  The internet it broke again  What did YOU do she yells at to meMiss clearing out the white list prevents any site from loading  I tell herWhat  I dont understand you did this somehow  I want your supervisor she yellsCertainly I sayXferred the call to level  support told them over IM the entire case notes I was loggingHer again said level  support  Turns out this happens all the time with this ladySometimes I feel so sorry for the other innocent people involved in these customers rampage  I  have more stories if interested spanning over several years,1384450718.0,Phone etiquette is not in this parents mind,200,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

of that most blessed of lists the Black List For those not in the know one of my previous positions had this idea implemented At this time my boss was an awesome guy and hed listened to my idea of The Black List had me get the numbers together and pitched it successfully to the CO level The Black List was a set of people who would receive absolutely no technical support whatsoever This was communicated to their bosses and was not lifted until the supervisor had assured us with proof that the user in question had been reprimanded and instructed in better communicationThis would end up being my defining incident in the time I spent at FirstAid It came on the heels of a very bad professional incident in our department but in my personal life things were going great I was dating Heavylegs and happy as could be Of course we all know what happens in IT when things are going along smoothly and happilyIt endsIt started with a massive cockup by a Level  engineer that to this day I maintain was not at all an accident L was on his way out and had decided to screw over everyone at the company Of course he did this in ways that most users wouldnt know or care about Group Policy edits were made to completely remove the data limit in Outlook for storage File servers and networked file storage had their access rights either cleared preventing access and requiring repair or cleaned such that anyone could access anythingDid I mention that FirstAid was a medical facility with several dozen clients of medium or larger size This was a major problem Had we not been on the ball and in fact on the lookout for L to pull this wed have been seriously hosed As it stood we barely managed to fix things overnight before the next shift We missed somethingRemember that meatgrinder department I so do love telling stories about We met my erstwhile companionhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentslauotheblacklistbrokenhearts there as well as dealt with a not so small problemhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentslqildtheblacklistalphacounter there This department was of course led by one person and that one person reported to the CO level We shall call her AnnaWhen Anna decided to come in for work early on Day  of what would become War she decided to start her daily routine of getting into everyones business by making her way to the shared network drives and seeing what she could find Depending on the data that she accessed she could have been fired and sued or even arrestedSo of course she decides to look for a certain legendary file What does she find there on that network share A copy of the Black List Our CIO required a digital copy of the black folder that Awesome Boss kept and it was a simple spreadsheet of names departments and dates of submission for the Bamphammer The CIO did not sadly keep this file somewhere relatively obscureYes Anna was able to get into ITBLACKLIST with no problems She made a copy of this file on her desktop and decided that it was time her people got removed from the list As she scanned her department she noticed that Heavylegs was now freshly in the clear she had just been removed from the list the previous week and we had celebrated that fact with well Ill tell you when you get older TFTSThis could not do and Anna was at the front door of the office as Heavylegs and I arrived I was not even in the door before Anna was screaming at me and us telling me that I was setting a horrible precedence for getting off of the Black List I gave Heavylegs a kiss and told her to go on inside and when the door closed behind her I responded to Anna very politely Ive just arrived What the fuck are you talking about AnnaAnna IT IS CLEAR THAT ANY WOMAN ON THE LIST CAN GET OFF THE LIST BY SLEEPING WITH YOUNope Not even going to fight this one My cellphone is in my hands as she screeches and Awesome Boss is called As he had just gone home not more than a few hours before I apologize for waking him retrieve HR Girls number and give her a callAs Anna continues to gripe at me I inform HR Girl of the situation and request that she send someone out Ending the call I see HR Girl exit her office inside and come my way stopping to lean into an office door and linger momentarily before she heads my wayFollowed by the Director of HR DHR was as tall as I was six foot five He was far better built than I was at the time and probably could have doubled as a granite statue if he so chose In hindsight it was probably good that HR Girl brought him because she would not have been good backup as Anna described how it was bullshit that someone had to provide sexual favors for Black List removalAs DHR exited the building Anna turned to continue her tirade She fell silent at DHRs upheld handDHR Anna there is no reason to be screaming at this employee as he is coming in for workAnna This man is perpetuating a list of sexual favors to be allowed to workDHR So you decided to go around the chain of command and confront him directly At this point HR Girl comes over to me and escorts me to my desk Our conversation is about how baseless the accusation is until it hits us both as Girl Power my current L apprentice comes to meet usHow in the hell did Anna access the ListAs GP begins to update me on the status of the file permissions it hits us A check of the logs later and we see the truth Before the rights were fixed she managed to get in She made a copy I rolled my eyes and shook my headHR Girl Ill speak with DHR after this and let him knowI began the holy procedure of Cover Your Ass and gather all of the information necessary to prove that this list is not exclusive HR Girl lets me know that DHR would like to see me so I collect this evidence and gather a few other bits of information just in case before I head for HR with GP in towAs I approach I see Heavylegs in the windowed office and she is in tearsRage I know exactly what is about to happen and it infuriates me I turn to GP and she knows GP  you dont have to do this  Youre right I dont Im going to go in there and fight What I need you to do is call Awesome Boss and let him know whats happening Tell him I owe him a bottle of the good stuff but its time to call in a favor from NickGP Nick What does the CEO owe us Why are you going right there Theyre about to fuck with my relationship GP Im not going to let them Im going to go nuclear in there if I have toWith a fist bump we part I turn back to the room and move to the door opening it Immediately conversation stops and the only thing I have is the scene DHR and the Director of IT sitting across from my nowweeping girlfriend On the side of the Directors is Anna smug and practically dancing in her seatI am told to have a seat in the chair next to the Director of IT I politely decline and move down to where Heavylegs was attempting to control herself I kneel and whisper words to her Those words are not your business but they helped to start the calmingdown process I kissed her on her forehead and sat down next to her placing the ratherlarge folder of evidence in front of me DHR  were here to address some serious accusations towards you and the IT department regarding the Black List Could you tell me what your relationship is with Heavylegs My relationship status is none of your business However the requisite paperwork for dating a coworker is on file with your office I have copies here of it including your signatureThey arent expecting this DHR shifts uncomfortablyDHR That will not be necessary The concerns here are that sexual harassment is occurring with women on the List specifically that if they sleep with you they will be removed from the list Patently false I am not even involved with the process for removal You are In fact I have here a list of Black List removals which are signed off on by HR Girl and yourself I also have the original Black List documentation stating that the approval and removal processes both go through your office Are you telling me DHR that you are also accusing me of violating the rules of this list designed with mutual cooperation between our departments specifically to avoid this type of conductDirector of IT is smiling I am not Rage is coursing through my body like a venomous bite looking to burn me out We go back and forth DHR attempting to get me to admit to sexual harassment and my refusal He gets progressively madder and progressively paler as I present my evidence Transcript of the meeting where Heavylegs was removed from the list This meeting took place between Awesome Boss Heavylegs Heavylegss Boss Oh thats Anna isnt it HR Girl and the Director of HR It included signatures of all attendees Continued in a reply to this post wow this got longEDIT Just got fired whee

next two weeks Can you please change the maintenance to another time pleaseA reasonable question nicely askedgtMe I do not believe that there is a way to change it as it is prescheduled and we perform it across all servers at once Let me check for you thoughgtUser Please try to change it Last week this happened as well and we had to turn away about  kids who didnt get to test Parents were upset that their time was wasted We have been planning this testing event for monthsgtMe Im sorry for the inconvenience but there is no way to change itgtUser Is it possible to push it back a little bit At

ready to learn next based on what they know They are computer adaptive tests which adjust depending on whether you answer correctly or incorrectly There is no percentage and there is no grade Its a number that says how good you are at Math or ReadinggtMe My name is VampireSmut How may I help yougtUser I have a question about your Math and Reading tests Should they be given a grade to be used in a grade book I have several teachers grading the tests and calculating them into their math or reading gradegtMe Our tests are meant as assessments to determine the students ability to independently complete math problems and independently read We do not recommend or have a suggestion for using it as a grade however in the end that is up to you to decidegtUser Is there any information in your manuals that offer this information that ltCompany Namegt does not suggest or recommend Ive tried looking for something that states that but I cant seem to find any reference to itYeah its located just under where we tell you that we dont recommend implanting the CD into your skull and going skateboarding as a way to try to make the program more coolgtMe We do not have anything stating that we recommend not doing it Its simply that we do not recommend it We arent telling you not to do it we just arent telling you to do itgtUser got it thank yougtUser Disconnectedwhy muST THINGS CHANGEBackground Our products are pretty simple Once set up the student simply logs in and takes the test or whatever The teacher doesnt have to go in and fiddle with stuff They just watch their students to make sure they dont cheat and pull up the results afterward Around the time of this chat we had just done a facelift to our site Only the Login Page and the Home Page were changed Even then nothing changed functionally or even organizationally All that happened was we colored it up a bit more and made everything a bit bigger to make it easier for teachers to use it with tablets gtMe My name is VampireSmut How may I help yougtUser I want to administer the Diagnostic Test What are the directions for this I used to do it easily last year but now thaT THINGS HAVE CHANGED IT IS NOT

distgenius,3,7,1ql6t5,38,Weve all heard the stories  Pleasant interactions with users when providing support happen my cousins friends mothers coworkers niece had someone call in and they were civil and helpful and very thankful that tech support resolved their problem as soon as they could even though it wasnt right awayThen one day you catch a glimpse yourself  Maybe the stories are trueBackgroundI work for a company that produces EMR software for the mental health world both the records and for managing their business  We also sell a package that would be used for managing care which is more for the insurance company side of things  The two worlds intersect a lot and when I hired about two years ago my only experience with mental health was providing moral support for my wife while she attended graduate school for counseling psychology  Now I know a lot more than I expected and have a load of stories that I could shareI spend  days a week providing support directly to endusers for both software packages as well as creating reports doing oneoff data pulls and also doing QA on updates and upgrades  The fifth day is my chance to catch up on whatever I havent been able to focus enough time on without having to be there on the phones or manning the ticket systemAbout a month ago we had rolled out a pretty hefty upgrade to one of our customer sites which merged two of our applications into one web app  They are one of the few stragglers that were on the older version and the transition went as smoothly as we could have hoped considering end users didnt want to test didnt pay attention in training and they had a metric arseton of customizations that we had to bring into the new base system Of course the same things they said worked in the test environment immediately broke on day one and when we went back into the test system sure enough they didnt work there either  The last month has been more hectic than normal and filled with cases of end users completely forgetting their own internal policies and processes but sure that the upgrade broke something  Ill fully admit that the upgrade could have used more time for testing and wish that we could have caught more of the problems internally but I cant throw too many stones at my coworkers  It seems like nobody can manage to break an application quite like an enduser  Especially the ones who still miss the days of paper formsTodayIm on site in the tech office  The day was drawing to a close  A half hour before I get to punch out and go home a user calls  Well call her U for unicorn because Im still not sure she really exists The other players are DG me and M the customers tech support manager  M answered the call because the other techs were in the middle of somethingU So I know I talked with with you earlier and you put a ticket in but I wanted to check on it because I hadnt heard anything  Im concerned that my staff might be doing something wrongM Let me check with the engineer and see if theyve had a chance to work on your ticketM mutes the phone and asks about the status  I explain that I havent had a chance to dig into it just yet but something about the ticket information didnt mesh the words all meant something our system but the combination didnt add up so it would be great if we could clarify the problem  Unmute phoneM So our engineer is looking for some clarification and I think I was the one who created your ticket the last time you called  I must have not taken good enough notes do you mind explaining it againAt this point Im nervous M is great as a manager but Id feel more comfortable with one of the Ls or Ls  Theyre more familiar with the different shadowing systems they use depending on the users setup and theyre also at least passingly familiar with our software  In the majority of the calls we handle it is much more effective to shadow them than to have them explain their steps out loudU Sure not a problem  Were finding that some contracts have rules with expiration dates well after the end date of the contractAnd U goes on to explain in great detail that shes pretty sure there was a validation that stopped people from entering in things like this and shes not sure why it exists but there definitely are contracts with these anomalies  DG Just to be clear are you concerned that processes that depend on the contract are attaching to these rules for dates outside the contract itselfU No I know that isnt happening Im just concerned that my staff are entering in invalid informationDG Do you mind if I do some digging and call you back before the end of the dayU agrees M thanks me for taking the time out at the end of the day to dig into something new and off I go   The tech side is pretty basic the validations are working fine for rule entry but were missing one on the actual contract dates  There is nothing to prevent a user from changing the contract end date to one before a contract rule ends which doesnt affect the parts that depend on the rules because the first thing those do is check that an active contract exists for the date in question To top it off it wasnt even one of her staff that had changed the end of the contract it was someone in the billing department they probably saw a contract that didnt end on the fiscal year end and made a bad assumption  Fifteen minutes of digging no big deal found my answer  I signal to M that it is timeM calls U back and we relay our findings  U Thank you so much  Ill let my staff know about that part and Im sorry to have taken up your time with this  I was just concerned that we were doing something wrong on our end  Ill fix the end date on the contract myselfM smiles the happy smile of someone managing a support department that is continually underwater in a sea of tickets  I sit back in my chair in amazement  Iactuallycaught a glimpse of the unicorn  Im still not completely sure of course but the stories dont seem quite so

sacheltry,27,25,1qguq2,171,A department director other than my own hijacked me to help her with an Access database Since the work she was doing was at a highlevel my director agreed to let her borrow me for a whileIt was a very simple database that tracks the different roles that are available for advancement within the company and who currently has them Normally I work with SQL Server and Oracle but it wasnt worth my time and energy doing any additional work on this particular databaseSince this has to be secure I was only allowed to do work at her desk on her laptop After some time and giving enough logical arguments to improve productivity I was allowed to put it up on the network in a secure location that only the two of us had access to  that was a little betterThen I was told that since IT could potentially see the database not that they care I had to further secure the database She told me Ive heard about those Chinese hackers and I dont want them to get into this very critical database I almost said That since we we are a multibillion dollar company that is probably the first thing they are going to be looking for A database that contains what types of jobs each person has and is available is the first thing hackers are looking for Fortunately I decided to hold my tongueI figured the best way at least for her to think so was to just put a password on the database itself She thought that was great and we discussed the best password to use for far too longA week later I get an email What was the password we decided onIm so glad she took our security so seriouslyUPDATE I love all the great storiesTo give you some insight to what I am dealing with last night I was working at her laptop and her crappy mouse was barely working So it is not frustrating enough that I am at her desk dealing with this but to click a button takes three to five circles of the mouse before it responds to move over the button I think my pleasant façade started to fade quickly because she said that shes been having problems with it all day but it sometimes works I said I had an extra at my desk but she refused it Fortunately I realized that if I press very hard on the mouse it does respond So that was a good way to relieve my tensionThen today I was looking at all her data entry I saw that some people were entered twice Those I just fix without telling her However one was entered as John Doe and then again as John Doo  I asked which one is correct She responded with YesThe best part is that she must make x my salary I just it is true about rising to your level of incompetence,1384277456.0,I want this database to be secure,196,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

into my partner had identified it as the Bacteria Dopant and it was attacking the critical medical facilities in the Bio DistrictWere not going in there unarmored I dont care what the Chief saysI slapped on the familiar IT Driver and drew forth the Antivirus Memory My partner opted for the Defrag Memory a good option in case we were dealing with a fragmentation caseAntivirus DefragHenshinGreetings fellow tech support gurus  here with another tale of that most blessed of lists the Black List For those not in the know one of my previous positions had this idea implemented At this time my boss was an awesome guy and hed listened to my idea of The Black List had me get the numbers together and pitched it successfully to the CO level The Black List was a set of people who would receive absolutely no technical support whatsoever This was communicated to their bosses and was not lifted until the supervisor had assured us with proof that the user in question had been reprimanded and instructed in better communicationI have an absolute hatred for people who use whatever buzzword happens to be popular Sure there are times that such words are useful but other times they are more of a hindrance than a benefit Thishttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentskchjwtheblacklistaccountingdouchebaggery was an example of someone who knew what to say to get IT to respond immediately and it got him in deep waterMy least favorite word is urgent In any capacity of IT this word is seldom used properly URGENT can range from a keyboard with a stuck key to a massive citywide power outage At FirstAid we made sure to stress how much we loathed seeing that word and encouraged better classification of issues No one listened Including the microbiology and testing facility Everything was urgent to them and not just urgent I could filter out URGENT from our ticketing system and find no less than  hits All from this department whose RampD nature made them think they were the most important group at FirstAid The day in question was no differentA new tech had recently joined the group and I shall nickname her Girl Power Why GP was outgoing social bubblybutnotbraindead and most of all smart as a whip A box of whips A crate of whips on the USS Whip Gp knew her stuff but hadnt yet had the chance for practical experience beyond a Tier  helpdesk position She was my first hire and I was immensely proud to show her the ropes To this day shes like a kid sister and accompanied me on any rounds I needed to make I arrived one morning with my frequent armload of caffeine and fried sugar for the L techs and noticed that GP had brought them a case of Coke that morning A tear threatened to break past my defenses but I sucked it up and distributed the doughnuts as best as I could remember Several Ls mentioned that GP and The Boss were looking for me so I squared everything away and headed for my desk Nearly immediately after logging in I was pulled into a threeway IM conversation by The Boss It turned out that there had been a bit of a disagreement with the microbiology and testing labs regarding a series of computer issues that they were having They thought we should devote  of our resources in IT to fixing their computers and my Boss disagreedThe first message after The Boss explained things made me giddy with excitement You see GP had not yet been hipped to the Black List and while shed known we were hiding something from her she hadnt yet figured it out So when we were sent The Boss  time to brief your shadow on the listI may have peed a little Boss explained that three of the seven primary lab computers were experiencing slowdown of a degree that could not be remotely determined L techs had failed to placate the labrats complaints and cries of URGENToneone and someone had decided to fill out a ticket for the issueevery ten minutessince AM that dayIt was currently AMThe Boss released us to execute on our own recognizance and I swung by GPs desk to pick her up Armed with our wits and our skill we headed for the facility I briefed her along the way and I swear her eyes took on a glow that could only be described as PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER I then described the itty bitty living space part and also told her what to expect at the facilityAny of you who have done time near any sort of medical testing or waste will know that the smell is abysmal It smells like Godzilla took a runny shit on a bloated corpse added jalapenos and then cooked it all for a few years Between this and the nature of the work anyone entering the facility was required to wear biohazard suits after checking in We did so and entered the facility making our way quickly to the affected testing area What we found was no less horrific than a library with collapsed bookshelves Im no biologist or biochemist but the state of this particular lab went against every fiber of my being GP choked on what I can only suspect was bile as we took in the scene while I deftly stepped in front of her to meet the onslaught of researchersAlpha Douchebag decided to step up first and declare that we were hours late I raised a hand and cut him off Dont care Lead us to the affected machines More sputtering and cursing ensued and I raised my voice Ill call the board and have your team shut down if you utter another syllable Lead OnStunned silence shocked face and then finally blessed movement We were led to three machines in the back of the room near some of the dirtier sections of the room The machines in question were filthy and indeed sluggish I logged each user out and shut the machines down a nagging suspicion in the back of my head Instructing GP to disconnect the other two machines I unplugged mine and put it on its side Opening the case confirmed my suspicionsWhat could best be described as a growth of bacteria had crept into the motherboard It had started at the bottom and found a power line snaking its way towards the processor fan and the primary hard drive The former was I can only hazard a guess protected by the fact that it was moving blades that somehow kept the monster at bay The hard drives board however was covered and to this day I have no idea how this gunk hadnt made it INTO the drive itself and fried it  I immediately dropped the drive into the case and reached for one of the phones to call The Boss A similar clunk behind me told me that GP had found something similar in one of hers Boss you really arent going to believe what weve found hereAD IS THAT YOUR BOSS PUT HIM ON SPEAKERPHONE YOU IDIOTS NEED TO LEARN THE MEANING OF URGENTBoss I heard that Dont bother What did you findGP and I described the scene in excrutiating detail all the while keeping AD at bay I eventually handed GP the phone to tell her share of the story and squared off with AD Explain to me whyAD SHUT YOUR MOUTH I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR SUPERVISOR MY BOSS IS middle management person name AND SHE WILL NOT BE PLEASED AT THE LACK OF PROGRESS Perhaps then you should go ahead and call her downAD I WILLAD trundled off to call his boss and I turned back to wait for GP to finish She did and handed me back the phone The Boss authorized the Black Listing even before I asked about it but I wanted to make sure we had this one nailed down Boss is Matcha watching the camerasBoss He can be Do you need evidential backup I do Plus I need you down here AD is pulling his boss down here and were going to have a serious issue on our hands If you can bring HR Girl You arent going to believe the state of this roomBoss I believe you Were on our wayHanging up I informed GP of what was about to go down and she actually wrung her hands with anticipation We stood back and I moved the machines to give the cameras a somewhat better view but I knew better than to try to get pictures myselfIn came The Boss with HR Girl and both began to inspect the room When The Boss came down to us and looked in the computers he actually gagged Words never do this sort of thing justice GP and I agreed and HR Girl was positively green in her suit AD and ADs Boss arrived next and were stunned to find GP and I with backup AD barely entered into his tirade before his boss started walking toward us The Boss held out a hand to indicate that she should inspect the computers She did so with that trained calm that most researchers in movies are portrayed as having and looked at me then GP and finally my Boss before speakingIm a computer idiot and this looks bad even to me Are these machines broken because of this biohazardThe Boss looked to me and I shrugged I cannot be certain I refuse to work on this machine however due to this biohazard I refuse to let any technician under my umbrella work on this machine for the same reason and we do not have a safe room prepared for this sort of instanceMy Boss nodded his assent and ADs Boss nodded as well She turned to HR Girl and my Boss I formally apologize for this breach of containment for this bacteria I will get to the bottom of this immediately and accept any sanction for our team that is necessary as well as providing information on which bacteria this isAD was furious The Boss grinned and nodded at me and I delivered our favorite line to ADs Boss regarding her workers We have a list of several people who felt it necessary to submit tickets every ten minutes this morning about this issue neglecting to inform us of the state of your lab These users also decided that it was necessary to use words designed to make this problem our top priority In hindsight it should have been everyones priority Due to their conduct with our ticketing system with the authorization of Director of IT and backed by Director of Operations as well as supported by HR Director I am notifying you that your techs names here are now on the IT Black List This means that they will not be permitted to submit helpdesk emails they will not be allowed to delay any updates and they will not be responded to in any form regarding an ITrelated incident HR Girl is here to witness this as well as to take evidence for FirstAid as necessary for conduct in this labADs sputtering obscenities could be heard behind all of us making sure we knew that we were all morons and that their very important research was being ruined by our carelessness ADs Boss was red in the face either from anger or embarassment She nodded with my statement and apologized again and we took our leave For the next week L techs were treated to lunch by the Microbiology and Testing Department as an apology for flooding the queues GP was a bit shaken from how disgusting everything was but caffeine set her straight We decided to completely destroy the hard drives since they were little more than OS drives with shortcuts to various network programsdrives anyhow rather than even attempt to clean them They were disposed of in accordance with state and federal lawsOh and AD was fired and I think sued The litigation would have left his asshole in ruins Turns out he was the main perpetrator of the labs conditionI never stepped foot in the labs againTLDR Shepards Biotic Charge

CanIGetaHellYeah,253,494,1q7ilu,1561,I was a new starter looking after a client we had taken over  months ago who where having lots of issues the CEO was concerned the old IT guy was still accessing the system I thought that was a bit crazy but strange things were happening account lockouts passwords changing services being disabled it really felt like something malicious was happening but I couldnt prove anything Then it happened One afternoon I was light on work so I decided to log into their system and have a poke around I log onto the terminal server look at active usersLogged in user  BackupHoly shit that didnt look right I bring over my coworker who notices that the computer name has the same initials as the company that the old IT guy was currently working for We look at his IP and bingo reverse dns shows he is connecting from his old work placeReset his password and displayed this message on his sessionTHIS IS AN UNAUTHORISED CONNECTION YOUR IP  HAS BEEN LINKED TO YOUR DOMAIN COMAU AND LEGAL ACTION WILL FOLLOWKnowing his session wasnt idle I let that sit for a nice  seconds so he could marinate in panic and fear then disconnected his sessionLogged in and opened Outlook and he had EVERYONES mailbox connected to his with full permissions we checked his sent items nothing  I hit recover deleted items and hey presto  months worth of emails he has been forwarding to himself OR forwarding to a women in the office who we discover he is having an affair with  He is feeding her information from her coworkers and she was using that to her advantageHe had forwarded other emails that I had written to the CEO assuring him the old IT guy was not logging in remotely and he had added Haha these guys are fucking idiots they have no idea Cancelled another backup last night do you think they will figure it out  MoronsI could not believe what I was reading I simply can not include all of the incredible things we discovered and the evidence we collected it was the most exciting IT work I have ever done in my life It was filled with justice and epic winsEpilogueThe CEO decided to get lawyers involved I provided them with every scrap of data I could find and they put together this intimidating  page document that included itemised lists of connection times showing he basically logged in every day while working at his new job and tampered with the system It stated they would sue him and have him charged if he did not capitulate with the terms of the agreementThat document was delivered to him personally at his desk at am of a work day and at exactly the same time the exact same document was delivered to his boss at am He was escorted out of the building at amEdit Epilogue not prologueEdit II Answering some questions hereWhat happened to the girlThe CEO decided to review her work and discovered that she had been doing some sabotage as well not putting in sales orders in from people she didnt like deleting messages and saying they were never recieved and in one more serious incident she edited someones timesheet resulting in lost overtime She had to pay the back money owed and lost her job they could have taken legal action but my understanding was it was not a large amountWhat where the terms and conditionsI wasnt privy to all the details but my client did let me know that he had to attend several depositions in which he had to answer in great detail everything he had done surrender hard drives and other equipment that he had mentioned he had stolen and there was some kind of financial component to it as well where he had to pay costs of causing all of these issues I think it was in the thousands not a huge amount but for a guy without a job it was There was some provision about not working in IT I am not sure how legally that works but I believe he had to stay away from IT for  or  yearsYou arent an IT detective youre a big phonyYes when taking on a new client all password should be rotated and the entire system should be reviewed Unfortunately I had been working for the company for two weeks they took on the client six months ago I later determined that several factors went into why the system review wasnt done time and cost constraints but mainly laziness My coworkers had already looked into it and concluded that he wasnt logging in and told me a full password rotation was done later I discovered it was ONLY for real peoples accounts not service accounts When I was given management of the client account manager not IT helpdesk guy the CEO gave me a the full story and I began looking into it It should also be said that my job role was account manager I met with clients and discussed the performance of our helpdesk their IT agreement and projects  I was not meant to do troubleshooting that was apparently for the helpdesk tier  The jobs that came through to the helpdesk backups cancelled account lockouts were treated by them as isolated issues and did not investigate further than that All of this coalesced into a situation where everyone in my company was telling me its fine and my client is just paranoid I didnt accept that and found what I found Did I use any advanced techniques  No The guy was sloppy as shit and anyone who is worth half their salt could have found it I am sharing this story because its interesting not because I think I am a detectiveWhat other evidence did you findHe was a prolific user of Lync and his chat logs were all stored in his user profile he would chat throughout the day with the woman in the office and have some of the most cringe worthy interactions that were just disturbing to read They had flashes of red hot anger swearing at each other like two drunks at a pub followed by pathetic apologies and disgusting make up flirting Constant bitching about others in the office I found that this woman would contact HIM to fix IT issues it explained why she was so hostile towards me when I met her in person Several incidents where he was attempting to fix something our helpdesk was also looking at the same issue and this inflamed the problems He had accidentally saved some passwords to websites in his browser cache like facebook web management site of his personal domain some other weird forums Couldnt do anything with these of course but it was hilarious clicking on his history and it loading straight into these sites the audacity and gall of this guy thinking he would never get caught yet taking no steps to hide his activity The most disturbing of all though was the M Night Shyamalan twist when I discovered that the old IT guy was very close to one of the owners and they had remained in contact after he was let go He had convinced the owner that letting him go was a mistake and to watch how many problems would occur without him He also claimed to be logging in to check on things and make sure backups run that kind of thing quotes from emails he wrote He was sabotaging the system while pretending to fix things saying that if he wasnt logging in things would be so much worse The owner believed every word and met with him on several occasions to discuss how to deal with the situation  The CEO was furious upon this discovery and went to the other owners who decided to use this opportunity to push him out of the businessThanks for reading ,1383950154.0,Old IT Admin couldnt let his little baby go

OfficerNelson,82,87,1q8aro,345,My last theatre tech storyhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsovfmwhenthelightisgreenthetrapisclean was moderately wellreceived so heres something far more sinister and equally as lengthy Trust me its long but the ending is great And its sort of being written liveI work as a lightboard op in a highlyrated regional black box theatre Its small holds around  people but much more fun and fiscally rewarding than my volunteer work at other theatresBoring technical stuffAt my other jobs we had pretty crappy equipment My first spot around  years ago had an ETC Expression which was good for its time but we werent allowed to program cues  we had to do all blackouts and crossfades manually After that I jumped to a really cheap black box theater which had some tiny offbrand board after that we didnt even have a dedicated board and my last volunteer job had a really shitty Express which IIRC supports only a pitiful  channels even though we had x as many cansAnyways this current place is suitably equipped Ive spent some unpaid overtime just poking around the manual to see what this lightboard can do However the master electrician hereafter ME has a real bulge over the new soundboard which we got over the summer which is very nice and does make me a bit jealous  watching the motorized faders is mesmerizing The thing must have cost a pretty penny because the technical director mentioned that he maxed out our budget for quite some time with itOne of the features of the new soundboard is it can be controlled from a smartphone This is really really helpful when doing preshow checks and in theory you could run the show from anywhere in the theatre we have wireless headsets as well Since the ME couldnt shut the hell up about this I figured it would be used pretty often  well once the board was installed it wasnt used onceAfter a few months I got sick of it and did some research of my own  to my elation my older lightboard also has this feature I didnt want to involve the ME just yet you may remember in the last story that he is generally unhelpful and he doesnt even know what a lighting plot is so I got to workFirst I found an ethernet cable CAT even and figured out where the wireless router was  a WRTG my favorite Patched the lightboard into it and got to workNow I will give the ME credit He did manage to figure out what WPA is and did hide the SSID as useless as that is Since the only thing that connected wirelessly was his smartphone with the soundboard app I couldnt listen for the SSID I tried to connect through LAN on my laptop but for some reason the router was connected to our campus internet so it wasnt able to use the default IP Since I liked my job too much to get into anything more greyhat I shot the ME an email asking for help on this endeavorThe ME replied a week later after the trial of the smartphone app ran out prompting me to front  to unlock itgtI tried to set this up already but the board keeps dropping the connection every  minutes Dont waste your timeWhat he failed to realize was that every  minutes the trial version of the smartphone app purposely disconnected with a message stating to unlock the full version I threw a message back explaining this and giving a rough explanation of what I wanted to do Surprisingly he replied with the information so I got to workFirst things first the router was configured way wrong ME apparently forgot to turn off its DCHP server so it wasnt playing nice with the campus network Additionally he placed the soundboard in the DMZ great idea having a critical show component fully remotely accessible to anyone I actually have it on good authority from a connection in IT that the ME got some serious flak for this thing before so its a shock that he connected it back into the network anyway especially in its state Apparently this is because he wouldnt be able to use the internet on his phone while connected to the WRTG  a fair complaint even though switching networks on my Nexus  takes about a second although I dont know how long it takes on an iPhoneRegardless I fixed his mistakes and looked at the board I noticed something strange The default IP was changed DCHP was manually enabled and the remote access settings were switched on  all of which were changed from before I sent that email Did some omnipotent being set this up for me hint noI fixed the router got everything connected and fired up my phone  after some initial setup I finally got it to work I took a stroll around the theatre flipping through channels the stage manager panicking that the board was running on its own I cracked the code preshow would never be the same againOf course look at the scroll bar  this story is far from overThe next day I got an email from the technical director ME had complained to him that I had broken into the wireless router and intentionally ruined the settings so that the show wouldnt be able to run The technical director fortunately is not an idiot so I offered for him to come to the show that night and Id show what happenedUnsurprisingly he did show up and I walked him through what I did I explained how the router was negligently configured and how the ME took my explanation and tried to do it himself To seal the deal I connected over my phone sat down on the set and recited one of the most memorable scenes in the show and pulled up the lights at just the right time He looked up at the board  nobody there  turned around and excitedly asked me to see my phone I gladly showed him everything that could be done with it He was totally ecstatic and lamented that he couldnt offer me a raise ironically the budget was blown by buying the new soundboardWhat I didnt expect was for him to let the ME know what I actually didToday a week later after a few shows worth of dancing around the stage triplechecking every light just for the fun of it I noticed something strange  the lightboard was throwing a networking error on boot and the soundboard failed to boot at all I figured there was something wrong with the router  well to my surprise it was gone I tracked the wires they snaked into a hole drilled into the wall next to a locked closetYep the ME decided to move the router breaking the boards in the process The lightboard could boot but the soundboard wouldnt and without the soundboard we simply cant run the showI shot an email to the TD straight away Unless we can fix this router problem we have to cancel the show If we cancel the show we lose money Naturally the TD wasnt keen on explaining to the board of directors why a show was cancelled so he drove on down and we got to workFirst he had the keys to the closet so we got that open I checked out the router  nothing Totally dead Power cycling did nothing and there was no switch on it minutes before the show House is open people are filing in and we might have to send them homeNaturally this had to be a power issue or a defective router I contemplated racing home and simply swapping out the router with mine for the night same model how hard could it be but that would have taken another  minutes  time we didnt have So while the TD skimmed the soundboard manual to see why no network  no boot I started tracing the power cableFirst the power brick was plugged into a surge protector which was switched on but wasnt getting power That in turn was plugged into an extension cable  one of those giant orange ones which coincidentally appeared in my last story  which snaked back out of the same hole and was plugged into the ancient UPS which runs the amp racks I checked the UPS  overload light was on I reset it it ran for a split second and shut back down from an overload Unplugged the extension cord tried again and surprise  no overload Somehow the immense draw from this wireless router was blowing this UPS and the ME failed to notice that when he plugged it in all of the amps would shut offI plugged the extension cable into a wall outlet the router flipped on and the boards sprung into life   minutes after the show was supposed to beginI sat down and checked the router again This time the lightboard was in the DMZ and he tried to set up port forwarding from WAN straight into the lightboards remote control Things are going to get uglyI kept watch over the router and soon noticed a connection from way outside the campus network  in fact from a city an hour away where the ME lives and sure enough commands started coming in to the board remotely All channels at full All channels out Patching commands Cue overwrites Somebody with specific knowledge of this boards IP device name password and who lives surprisingly close to the ME and had paid  for a remote app was trying to completely sabotage this show Fortunately I was smart enough to disable remote command executionAs Im writing this were about  through the show The TD just popped his head up from the stairwell and told me to expect a promotion then scurried off while I was left speechlessThis is perhaps the only guy who could turn moving a router  feet into an RGETLDR ME ME hes our man if he cant do it hope he has another job offer lined upUPDATE EDIT The ME was indeed fired and I have the option to be promoted to his position in January but because of student employment constraints I would not be able to get a raise Not sure whether I will take it or not  lightboard op is a much easier job,1383975059.0,Tired of having a steady wellpaying job Why not sabotage your own company and pin it on a

BookInvertebrate,23,8,1q82n6,81,Hey all Having fun reading all the great stories I decided to share todays headache of a callIt comes from guy Ill call him Mr Clueless who I have helped about four times with the same problem He had two laptops that used a inhouse developed software to automatically upload data to an FTP on a very restricted wifi connectionThese laptops are field laptops that go out gather data from devices going to be vague here and then come back to a warehouse and upload that data over night Every time he calls he tells me theyre broken and did not upload over night and when I ask him to do a few things on the laptop he says they were already sent out to the field and wont be back until evening times this went down we had to get him to bring the laptops to us which took him sometimes days to do so that we could test a few things two times it was on our end because the FTP server was changed by the server admins and the other two were something wrong on the laptop The application had wrong import information there was a config file  that somehow got its passwords changedHere is the th call again the laptops had not uploaded overnightMr Clueless Hi Bookinvertebrate both laptops did not load the data againI open up my FTP and load the credentials that the laptop would be using the FTP is up and running I move a file over to test that it would accept it that is working fineBookInvertebrate Ok did you make sure that you had a connection to the wirelessMr Clueless You need to check your server something is wrongThank you for interupting me knowing him in the past he is usually emphatic and kind of neurotic so I take a deep breathBookInvertebrate Yes I see that the FTP server is up Have you tried loading filezilla we put filezilla on the laptops for troubleshooting on the laptop to check to make sure it was connecting and that the credentials were workingMr Clueless Its obviously not the password because both laptops went down at the same timeBookInvertebrate Ok yes I understand this but these steps help me figure out the larger issue because I see no issues on my end Can you maybe get in front of one of the laptops and I can guide you on what to doMr Clueless I already deployed them in the field NOOoooooooooo Its not the laptops they both did not upload you need to check your stuffAlready frustrated that he again deployed them before calling the help desk to help troubleshoot I carried onBookInvertebrate We really need to test on those laptops they are configured uniquely so its hard for me to narrow it down without having one of those laptop on the warehouse connection to test Mr Clueless Ive been doing this for thirty years young lady its not the laptops Even though I have never said it was the laptops Think about it this way if you had two broken toasters and they broke at the same time would you start tinkering on one to see why it broke He says this in the most self satisfied Igotyou voiceI am literally trying to figure out how the hell we got to talking about toasters while simultaneously pulling my hands through my hairBookInvertebrate Well I would take one of those toasters figure out how it broke maybe follow the power cordMr Clueless I am not checking the laptops this is a waste of my time there is no way there is a problem with themI pull out my trump card someone who oversees a lot of these special lap deploys and works in that guys department He asked that he be clued in the next time this issue happens because of all the resources we waste trying to fix this without preliminary troubleshooting Ill call him Mr SmartBookInvertebrate Fine Ill just talk to Mr Smart  he mentioned that he would like to assist with these in the futureMr Clueless Fine close my ticket since you dont want to do the work  Ill just go to Mr Smart from now onBookInvertebrate Thats not what Im saying I just need a few stepsMr Clueless Cancel my ticket Ill go to him clickFrustrated I write a document with  different ways to troubleshoot With steps to check the wireless connection check the FTP with filezilla to ping the FTP server etc All with pretty screenshots All stuff I showed mr clueless in person  I email this to Mr Clueless and CC Mr Smart stating that it would be helpful if these steps could be completed on one of those laptops so we could narrow down this issueI get an IM from Mr Smart apologizing for Mr Clueless not following previous instruction He states that earlier the warehouse had some wireless issues because one of the guys there unplugged a cable Its a cabinet open to them unfortunately He said that the tech should have checked the connection and that all will be working with the upload tonight And this guy wanted me to check my damn server gtTLDR

piercedRichard,13,13,1q7ciz,66,This happened a little over a year ago so some details may be offfuzzy SorryI was working at a person marketing company in Minnesota as the second IT person myself and my boss were it not including the developers We changed the name of the company around  years back but the AD domain was set up under the old name We wanted to change this My boss wanted to start fresh  New domain new Exchange servers Not a problem  A lot of work but not a problem Or so I thought He hired a  year old guy as a contractor who was very nice at first He and I talked quite a bit and we both worked on issues together for a few months When the fan had began to drown in excrement he started complaining to my boss that I was screwing things up because I didnt like him I liked him until around two months after that when my boss told me about his comments for the previous few months  The guy seemed to know his stuff pretty well in the first several meetings I had with him Then again I hadnt touched a fair amount of what wed be changing He started to recommend that we add additional things like imaging every machine in one weekend mind you rewriting group policy from scratch in Word not writing a policy we could look at using RSOP or GPMC My boss wanted it and I went along It sounds like a good plan except that its a lot of changes very quickly The ProjectThis was supposed to be a day project  He was supposed to be done with the migration at  days but that didnt happen He spent  days writing pretty simple group policies In word not using GPMC or any other tool except to get the descriptions and titles which he then typed out He spent another  days or so working on an image for our imaging  I had already created an image which took me  days while I was still doing support It was really basic stuff  Windows  Pro x Office  x and Firefox Thats it MAK keys for Office and Windows Really basic stuff but he wanted to add local group policy elements and tweak the settings Company logo basic stuff again It became pretty obvious to me that he was just milking us for time He was fired from his previous job for undisclosed reasons His work ethic gave me a clue  We all surf the web or write on Reddit when working but he seemed to do every single task as slow as possible  More on that at the end He had a desk right next to me and most commonly was writing newsletters for his family or whathaveyou You dont have to worry about your jobHe and I went out to lunch a few times and we were very friendly I asked him if hes going to continue his business after his contract expires He was looking for a fulltime position as well He looked at me dumbfounded Completely dumbfounded His response You dont have to worry about your job  I think well make a great team I didnt worry about my job but I knew we were looking for a Systems Engineer but the requirements were well above what this man had Masters BS in CS CCNACCNP MCE And it startsMy boss gave him a final hard deadline to be ready to image and migrate which he kind of made We imaged every machine in the company in around  hours actually I did most of it  My boss was working on migrating mailboxes and the contractor was updating the group policy for almost all of the two days I put in around  hours from Friday until Sunday Not a good weekend Issues became apparent almost right away  We werent getting all group policies cleanly applied and some major issues occurred We tried to fix it for around three days then the contractor said that I was screwing with the policy which I made no changes to the policy so my boss yelled at me I did nothing with the issues for the new systems for the next three weeks as instructed very clearly to do so My bosss temper was getting shorter and shorter and I was the brunt of the outbursts due to the stress of the project going very badly This was  weeks after we were supposed to be finished around  months after this guys contract was supposed to be over Quit touching me  Im not in the office right nowThe contractor complained consistently that I was messing with things that I didnt touch and that the fixes I was doing on a systembysystem basis were screwing with his tests and that I was a child Yes I was  years old then but I had run a pretty successful MSP business for the last  years with some very stuffy clients He and I didnt talk during this period at all Only the sparse email to let him know what I was doing on every system Then came his snarky replies that I just ignored Rules are meant to be brokenI finally decided to break the rules in a very careful way to do a well researched test I had been telling my boss and the contractor a few times that changes to the Default Domain Policy werent working Microsoft recommends that you dont change it because there is a SID issue with all of them and the combined computeruser policy wasnt working correctly Basically computer policy was being applied to the user not the computer and loopback doesnt work that way I got yelled at a lot for just mentioning it because the contractor said it wasnt possible to do it without Loopback processing So I tested it  I took a spare computer made one superficial change to a group policy wrote a registry key using Prefereneces that was applied to an existing test user that I had created before we migrated It didnt work Then I moved that computer to the same Users OU and tried again It worked immediately I tested with a live system and a live user and it worked immediately Sweet  I fixed it The meeting that became a confrontationSo the next morning I called a meeting with my boss and the contractor and explained the test the results and counter tests I performed as well to make sure it wasnt just a fluke I even tested it in a bare freshlyimaged machine and it worked on the second login since computer GP doesnt process on the first login for a new machine I wasnt worried The contractor tried to poke holes interrupting me every few words with why my test was invalid My boss blew up at me  Are you prepared for the consequences if this breaks something Yes yes I am I just want it to be fixedAll huffy the contractor demanded to see this in action so we took over a live users computer verified the superficial registry entry wasnt on the system then logged in with my test user It worked See youre stoopid And fat And a doodie headNot good enough  The contractor put another computer in the same OU as my test then ran the test without my boss and I present He came over and ushered me in and asked my boss to join him He explained what he had done and that it didnt work I asked if he forced replication he had not We forced replication twice and restarted the computer and it worked SobbingHe worked on a new solution to our problems and I went back to my work I was talking with my boss near the end of the day when he came in and told me Dont mess with the policies What you did today was really messy and can cause huge issues to which I replied Uh huh ok He started crying ran out of the building I need to do more  Um  What do they try to exchange for money Time Yes TimeWe make the changes in the following days and come Monday everything is working much much better After another month of fixing the group policies and writing at least  more newsletters he decides that we need to reformat all of the machines at our remote office Sure they could use a reformat He volunteers to do it and spent  days reformatting  machines around a halfmile from our office in the same complex I went up there to fix a few issues and each time he had his feet up and was reading from his Kindle while the screen in front of him was waiting for him to click Next I asked the manager from that group if hes working and she very candidly said No he just reads his kindle and does something online As soon as I show he suddenly moves quite quickly and is now working on multiple machines at a time The endWhatever  I shoot an email to my boss to let him know he was out sick for that week but take no other action I dont talk to him I dont care anymore We dont renew his contract for another month Our  month project turns into a  month one pretty quickly with this guy I clean up the remaining issues and just do my job in general We hire an excellent Systems Engineer but just before my boss said Now you have to get along with him Not a good sign I had worked at the company for a few years and never had a problem with anyone including other contractors and potential superiors He and I get along really well  I like just about everything about him nothing worth complaining about at all and we both help each other a lot Parting is such sweet sorrowA month later I get fired for screwing up the migration project No bull  I truly didnt do anything to screw it up I only took action after we were starting to get the bad attention of our CEO and that action worked thankfully Eh not so much sorrow at allI already had an interview scheduled with Robert Half for the week after I was fired so I just moved it up to the next dayFriday I interviewed with a few other recruiters Monday through Wednesday I had my first interview on Thursday one week after my termination The first interview didnt go incredibly well  Called Gary the interviewer Greg when I met him and couldnt explain how to troubleshoot an IP printer not printing I sent an email to my recruiter to forward to Gary thanking him for taking the time to interview me I got a call no less than an hour later offering me the job for  more than my previous job at a good company where Ive now been for two years I started at the company  days after being fired TLDRgt Contractor milked us for time delayed our project screwed it up I fixed it got fired for fixing it then got a massive raise at the new position ,1383945761.0,Contractor thinks hes getting a fulltime job while milking us dry,79,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

,19,32,1q673t,186,Were setting up an office in country  and I figure first things first we need a gateway to gateway tunnel We hire a contractor from a MSP in country  to set the infrastructure in place physically as well as ssh and telnet for remote support and configuration Im tasked with having to work with this godforsaken clown of a contractor to set up the tunnel and get things in motion I spend hours meticulously planning a solution for the second country including two domain controllers Cisco  series router a port PoE Cisco switch TB NAS with DFS rsync scripts to NAS in country  as well as a PABX and miscellaneous equipment all within budget I even get into the gritty details of VLANs on interfaces for the switch I send him an email with my carefully crafted network map routerfirewall VPN tunnel encryption configurations including cost breakdowns etc etc It was a gorgeous plan and I was proud of my work Im waiting Im waiting One week later this snot stirrer has the audacity to dismiss my entire beautiful scheme and implement a solution without my discretion He puts in a homefuckingrouter with two x port switches for   host interface connections So with some of the budget blown I find somewhere to compromise on the budget in order to upgrade the router and switch Its a small operation to start they can work with TB for now Ill cut back on the NAS He installs and configures the router amp switch Then he installs the new NAS and security camera but doesnt bother to connect either of them to the local network Ugh fine Ill ask a colleague in country  if they could just plug it inSo Mr Contractor leaves country  and starts doing further configurations remotely In his first email back to me after nearly  weeks of noshow does he send me a walloftext essay Can you guess what it was about It wasnt about my network schema not about my proposed solution not a reply to the godknowshowmanyotheremailsIsentaskingwherethehellhehadbeen Instead he sends me an essay on why the VPN tunnel encryption configuration I suggested cannot be implemented and CCs the MD in charge of our company at country  He goes deep into how it has been broken by the NSA according to Snowden and that if we implemented it then the NSA would be spying on us He goes on further explaining in absurd detail how block and stream ciphers work ECPECC cryptography and cipher strengths with mathematical formulas in the email My response in two linesgt The least of the US NSAs concerns are spying on us Were a company trading IT infrastructure here not drugs Reconfigure according to and I spilled out a config using DH  so he wouldnt be so paranoid After  days I finally get another response from him telling me that the VPN tunnel didnt work when he tried to initiate with the MD CCd in I run through a typical checklist are the endpoint subnets right PFS enabled UDP  amp TCP  Etc etcNo response Hello Ive tried initiating myself from country  and Im getting rejected at PIPsec level Are you there Twodays later he tells me hes reconfigured and tried again but with no luck establishing again with the friggin MD CCd Pretty much all email exchanges from here on have the MD CCd in were not that big of a company but it was oddI go over with a colleague the configuration religiously on my router to be  sure its not a problem on our end We spot nothing I go back to him requesting the SSHtelnet credentials so I can just do it myself Like the plague he avoids handing me over details not just the routers sshtelnet but also access to the PABX printer domain controllers and other equipment After persisting and persisting for access details he writes back to me saying he still had no luck getting the VPN going Screw it Ill call him and well troubleshoot over the phoneSo I call him and sounding frustrated he tells me how my lack of communication gives him the impression that I dont want to work with him He then proceeds to tell me that if I want physical support in country  then Im going to have to look it up in a phone directory beep What the The bastard hangs up on meThe MD then forwards me an email from him subject titled Have a laugh In the forwarded email was the contractor outlining my incompetence and inexperience He also noted that I may feel threatened by him due to him being older and much more experienced which would explain my communication issues What surprised me was when he said gt I was under the impression that I would be providing remote support for country  and country  on an ongoing basis and as a security measure I cannot hand out the access details to the administrator who we are replacingNow I was pissed So straight away on the phone with the MD and he tells me to disengage and that hell take care of it Next day first email at am is from the contractor with access details to everything Immediately after is an email from our MD asking me to check access to everything SSH in Yep PABX Yep DCs YepI ssh into the router and spot the VPN problem almost instantly The moron didnt even enable IPsec policy I reenabled it unblocked udp  on firewall reset IPsec timers Done Within  minutes of the contractor emailing me the details had I fixed it and replied with the MD CCd gt VPN tunnel is now up and running The issue was with country s router and I am more than happy to share the CLI history including changes I made to get it up and running Weeks of troubleshooting this VPN and arguing with this guy listening to his poor attitude towards me and here it was working because of my fixes Goes to show how much my inexperience compares to his experience While I was writing that email back to him all I could think was how much a jackass he must look like now in front of our MD The same MD he tried to suck up to undermine me in front of and attempt to make me redundant so his company could step in as a MSP Dont you dare try to throw me under a bus by calling me incompetent because Im younger and less experienced You cant replace me BitchFollowing that email I havent had any replies from him I imagine him sitting at his desk behind his laptop smearing shit on the walls in anger knowing that someone far far younger than him and apparently less experienced had beaten him at his own game I wasnt going to give him the pleasure of knowing what hed done wrong in the router config If he wanted to know he would have to write back and bear more embarrassmentTLDR Contractor with an ego attempts to make me look incompetent Tries to undermine me and make me redundant then step in as an MSP

OldPolishProverb,9,25,1q7hye,23,Pull up your chairs children and gather round the desktoponfire screensaver while Mr Proverb tells you a story from the days of the distant past back in the early s Days when Dinosaurs were not yet extinct merely confined to nature preserves and Kingdoms still ran their day to day operations on the big iron of mainframe computers or in this case on a couple of midrange VAXs Once upon a time there was a kingdom where all users shared equally in the magic big iron boxes Peons and nobles of the kingdom took turns seeking the knowledge held within the magical big iron boxes sharing of their time with others as they went along their daily strife  All one had to do was dip a magic mirror dumb terminal actually think really primitive thin client into the enchanted stream of the flowing network and you were granted an audience with the mighty iron that held the holy business databases These sacred tombs were guarded by the keepers of the IT in their own special climate controlled chambers All were equal in their quest for answers from the magic iron boxes as the great ones tirelessly responded to all requests one by one Not all knowledge was given to anyone who asked for the keepers of IT knew that this would lead to madness but all were equal in their quest to seek the truth or gain access to the third quarter gross sales totals whatever was more important to them But low and behold there came one day a challenger to the set order a young man trained in the ways of the spreadsheet and the business plan He came forth from the wilds of the lands of Academia all bright and shiny  He was indentured as squire to the Chief of Officers CEO  Honored at being chosen he rose up to the tasks of this noble calling and toiled mightily in the quests assigned to him Rewarded for his efforts he soon accompanied his chief before the royal court that did own the kingdom Soon he was being assigned tasks by ownerruler of the kingdom himself    Now the IT guardians were vigilant in their protection of the magic iron boxes  They knew that they were old and powerful and could be temperamental  But if treated with respect deference and patience they were happy in to perform their duties They would faithfully produce ever bountiful reams of knowledge printed upon massive amounts of continuous paper The pages were needed to serve the entire kingdom to the benefit and profit of all come day in and day out Ah but the new squire cared not for the needs of the others in the kingdom for he felt himself aloof  He had been tasked by the powerful Chief of Officers and the great owners themselves He stormed the gates of the IT and demanded private audience with the great magic iron boxes  The IT guardians explained that if he were to wait his turn like all others his query would be answered in due time No he proclaimed He had been tasked by the Chief of Officers and the great and powerful OwnerKing himself All others must wait behind himThe chief guard of the IT realized he had no choice but to consent when faced with an order of the great ones The IT guards cleared the chambers of all others in many cases stopping or cancelling other quests that had already been given permission to proceed Amid the grumblings and complaints of the many the squire now had a private audience with the magic iron boxes Soon he emerged triumphant in his quest for knowledge Heavily laden with printouts he went upon his merry way  Gleefully he returned to his the royal court with the fruits of his quest The guardians of IT sighed heavily with relief at the departure of the squire  They then turned back to their relentless task of appeasing the temperaments of the magic iron boxes and now to the lower members of the court whose days had been turned into disarray At least we dont have to go through that again they all thought How wrong they were Embolden by his triumphs he took on more quests Some were tasked of him but many other were of his own devising By showing his cleverness he hoped to be looked upon with favor by the royal house and awarded with riches and position Time and again he disrupted the daily proceedings if the IT guardians and threw into frenzy the affairs of others The guardians asked argued and pleaded with the squire to let them schedule a time with the magic iron boxes so that they would be ready to receive him as well as not inconvenience others  He would hear none of this since he had now been dubbed Golden by the royal court He invoked the names of the CEO and the OwnerKing whenever questioned about his quests He questioned their loyalty to the crown and threatened the crowns wrath upon them if he did not get his way  With heaviness of heart they relented Time passed and as the scene played out over and over again While the golden one was able to produce results many others soon fell farther and farther behind There was turmoil in the kingdom as department goals and project deadlines fell by the wayside like leaves in the autumnEventually the CEO finally started to notice troubles in the kingdom Not being a perfect fool for who among us is perfect He soon realized that the problem was coming from the land of IT  In a rare moment of insight he felt the need to confer with the keepers of IT about these problems  So he left his home in the high country of the corner office of the castle and sallied forth seeking the chief of IT  As he approached from afar the quarters of the IT chief he heard words of rage spilling out from the chiefs lair To his amazement it was his golden one He was unleashing epithets most foul and vulgar upon the chief of IT He stopped and stood in the shadows to listen To his shock he heard his own name used to call forth fire and brimstone upon the cowering chief  He heard his chief beg for a delay from the golden so that their regular duties could proceed He said that he could arrange a private audience with the magic iron late in the evening when he could ask his questions to his hearts content  No He replied He wanted things his way and he wanted them NOW He then called upon the name of the OwnerKing and said to make it so  The Chief of Officers quietly entered the chambers behind the golden one and quietly said No to his astonished squire  Come with me He said to the white faced squire Dejected and forlorn he silently followed his master to the high lands of corner offices No one knows exactly what happened behind those closed doors that day What we do know is that a new squire emerged chastened and humble  He also seemed to flinch whenever he had to sit down as if in pain He still had his quests but they were smaller and farther between   More importantly they were done under the watchful eye of the chief of IT who reported on the squire and the results of his quest to the CEO Deference was given to the keepers of the magical big iron And a cautious piece once again settled upon the kingdom  Next

Warlizard,467,442,1q3wpz,1201,Ive been waiting to get some more info before I updated so here it is with clarification on exactly what happenedHeres the original post  httpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentspsaetldraccountingfirmgetscryptolockervirustechIt turns out that what they wiped was ALL of the local backups  they still have the files that were encrypted by the virusI have spoken with the owner god knows how many times and it has been frustratingFrom the getgo the owners actions have baffled me I told her that if she just sent me the encrypted key Id see if I could crack it but shes apparently so techunsavvy that she simply doesnt know how to do anything at all with it Her tech has been with her for more than a decade and is a family friend however he bolted and she cant reach himNaturally shes pissed off as hell at him because well he deleted all the Carbonite backups deleted Carbonite forgot the password and cant install it backFrom one of the comments in the last post I learned that the hackers who created the virus are now allowing people to log into an onion site through Tor send an encrypted file pay about k in bitcoins then they promise theyll send the unencryption key plus a utility to unlock everythingThe owner is naturally skeptical that shell get the key after paying k plus the world of the deep web may as well be wizardry plus since her tech guy is AWOL she really has no one to help her outI told her that Id log into her server grab the carboniteencryptionpem key and see if I could get the password from it but I guess she got too busy last night to do itThis morning she sent me a text asking if we could do it today however its my birthdayI dont work on my birthday At all Period Today is the day I fuck off and do precisely what I want without thinking about anything other than doing fun thingsTo that end Im going to eat food thats bad for me drink concoctions that will inebriate me spend time with people of illrepute and do nothing at all of any valueTomorrow when I get the file Im going to throw the bit cuda version of hashcat at it and see what happensIve already pulled  down a GB collection of dictionaries but lets be real  the odds are lowThis whole thing has been really bizarre The owner should have thrown the  at the original people and gotten her shit back the tech should have WRITTEN DOWN THE FUCKING PASSWORD they never should have wiped the backups deleted Carbonite only had one backup etc but hey this is the perfect storm of shitty and it is what it isIve learned a ton of interesting stuff so for that reason alone it has been worth itAnyway Im off to get the mirror on my car fixed fuck Mercedes and their  bill that I foolishly cracked when I tapped the gates leaving my community get a hair cut and Ill continue to snapchat the fuck out of the dayOh and Ive gotten the best snaps from you guys and its really fun so if youre bored add me Warlizard and you TOO can see absolutely nothing of interest from the great state of Arizona LaterzEDIT First of all wasnt trying to be a pretentious fucktard about the mirror was just angry with myself for being a dumbass and hitting the gate because I was trying to beat it closingNext just had my car washed and the guys there are replacing the mirror fixing the cracked turn signal on the front of it fixing the crack in the bumper repainting the bumper detailing the car and wetsanding  waxing the whole car for a bit more than the dealership wanted to just replace the mirror glass So fuck the dealershipThe owner told the tech that he should cover half of the cost to get this shit fixed and thats when he bolted If I were in her shoes Id pay the k and hope I didnt get fucked It seems to me that the only way this scam works is if the hackers actually do what they say theyre going to do Sure some people would pay the  out of desperation and maybe some would lose but when people start paying k if someone anyone doesnt get their information back then far fewer people would be inclined to pay at allAnyway time to grab something to eat Ive been enjoying the snaps from you guys and the cool birthday wishes I know that Im not  years old and I shouldnt give a shit about something as trivial as a birthday but fuck it I do Its fun and its what you make itEDIT  I know this really isnt the place but I need to source a good tech for a friend of mine whos looking for a fulltime IT guy to manage his offices PC stuff Server  networking etc Its a salaried position not paying crazy but about k plus health care If anyone is interested and in the Phoenix area please let me know Its a hodgepodge of crap and you will be unappreciated plus the hours are long but its an interesting challenge mostly because managing a heterogeneous environment held together with ducttape and the tears of the frustrated can be pretty fun,1383841094.0,UPDATE  TLDR  Accounting firm gets Cryptolocker Virus Tech wipes

Gambatte,12,25,1q5i1i,74,I was working away this morning when I received a phone call from a subcontractor He required a specific form in order to keep the paperwork rolling but was unable to locate one on the company websiteOkay I think he either doesnt have a log in to the secure area or hes forgotten his password In either situation its always faster for me to pull the document from the network drive and email it to him its a faxed form so generally the subcontractor will print it once copy it a bazillion times and fax each one backFile not found I knew this was too easyI dig a bit deeper and find the original noncustomized form a scan of the sample from the relevant documentation so basically identical to the custom form except for the lack of a company logo I fire that off to the subcontractor and start digging deeperAfter some discussion I discover that the last person to have worked on the file accidentally deleted it but didnt say anything at the time Yes this was months ago so were way past what backups could possibly recover headdeskSomehow it falls to me to generate this file anew seeing as I already have the sample to work from A couple of hours of transposing some very fine print later which Im sure comes through the fax brilliantly every time its ready to go I create a PDF and go to put it up on the company websiteHmmm The password to upload the file is not workingAnd I dig deeperThe whole website is different from the last time I was in thereThe CEO happens to walk past and I snag himgt ME Whats up with the company websitegt CEO Looks good right I got a call from this guy who redid the whole website a month or so back for only k And hes hosting it for us too saved the company a bundleI got the accounting info later its saving the company less than  a month from the previous hosting company The CEO wastes more money than that every single day when he spends  minutes talking to whoever is in earshot about how hes going to buy himself a boathttpikymcdncomphotosimagesoriginalejpg soonSo I get hold of the new hosting company get the passwords and get into the company website First thing I notice theres some weirdness going on theres a link to a CSS file but most of the styles are being declared in the page source Well thats unusual but not my concernI upload the file and am adding a link to it inside the secure area when I receive an emailgt CEO Gambatte while youre in the company website can you move the commonly used forms out of the log in area to the public zone Too many people are complaining that they cant remember their log in when they just need to grab the formsOoookay I add a link on the page in the public area with some brief explanatory text save it fire a quick email off to the CEO to tell him its doneIve barely got back to browsing Reddit when a response comes backgt CEO Thats good but now the page name doesnt make sense its no longer just Application Forms Change it to just Formsgt Also can you see if you can change the default font for heading and subheadings from Times New Roman to Arial and white instead of that horrible brown I asked the developer about this but he said it was really hard and would cost extraSo I dive back into the website A quick change in the CSS will be good enough for now Ill go back and remove the manual heading style changes from the source later Took about thirty seconds I suppose if the website developer thinks they can squeeze more money out of the client they willThe difficult part is that for some reason rather than building a headermenu template and using that and thus allowing a change to every page with a single change to the template code every single page has its own header defined in its source codeohhellnoavihttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvoCaOSuDSo Im faced with going through every single page that has this page in its menu searching the source to remove the word Application from the menu item or rebuilding every page on the website to apply a header that Id have to create essentially from scratch anyway and its  on a FridayIm going to have to go with my good friend MurtaughhttpikymcdncomentriesiconsoriginaltumblrlzlaNSqqaygyojpg on this one Im afraidUPDATE EDIT Most of this is summarizing information I later added in the comments The developer was using a customized version of GetSimple CMS  the customization being to remove the useful tabs for things like themestemplates backups or other pluginsI was able to use a jQueryload to grab a header template into the nav div There was some monkeying around with the MobileMenu plugin to make it work mainly because I couldnt find where it was being called I eventually got it to work in the callback functionThe customization of GetSimple consisted of commenting out a big chunk of one of the files in the admin folder that declared the access tabs to the additional features So the features werent removed just the access to them Uncommented the section log out log back in hey presto Ive now got full GetSimple access so I can probably take out the jQueryload and put the header into the template

occurs if  the HDD experienced a complete mechanical failure or  the flex cables bad Its almost always  especially without any loud clicking occuring Well luckily its probably a pretty simple fix  this issue is normally the flex cable going bad This fix is pretty cheap if that is the case but theres the chance its the hard drive thats bad Wed need to check it in for testing if thats okay Well contact you as soon as we know what the repair options aregtTF YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I NEED IT BACK TODAY we close in an hour and a half UGH Okay When can I find out whats wrong with it gtMe Ill start testing on it immediately We should be able to contact you in two days by the latest but could have an answer by tomorrow late afternoon If you want to and you havent been called come in tomorrow at around  PM or call and we can give you an updatePaperwork gets signed she leaves She was actually not awful by the end of it having calmed down a bit M is confused as to why she seemed so agitated but was helping his own people and we kind of just laughed it off NEXT DAYTF suddenly barges in at  PM demanding for her computer back This part is hearsay but three sources gave me really similar information  I had left just a half hour earliergtTF IS MY COMPUTER DONE YETgtM Sorry but what is your namegtTF TWOFACE McLASTNAMEHERE YOU SHOULD KNOW THISgtM Im sorry Ms McLastnamehere let me check the paperwork right nowwell it looks like your system finished testing for tier one I finished it that morning and its currently finishing testing in the back Begins to radio the back for information on the testing  we dont always have life updates on the system until testing is finishedgtTF WHY DONT YOU ALREADY KNOW WHATS HAPPENING THIS IS YOUR JOBgtM after getting a response from the back Well it looks like your flex cable is in need of replacement  your hard drive came up fine and testing with other hard drives showed the cable was faulty Well need to order one Thatll be here tomorrow if we get your okay and its  for the part and  for installagtTF YOU MEAN I HAVE TO PAYgtM Well yes maam given that youre out of warranty gtTF WHAT THE F THE A YESTERDAY DIDNT SAY I HAD TO PAYgtM Actually right here on the paperwork you signed off on it being an out of warranty repair and agreeing to it being a charge It also says so in our Work Agreement which is right above your signature in boldgtTF WHAT THE HELL THIS IS BULL THAT GUY YESTERDAY WAS LITERALLY THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER HAD HE NEVER EVEN TOLD ME I GET CHARGED FOR THIS I WOULDNT HAVE DONE IT IF HE TOLD ME I GOT CHARGED FOR THIS well actually its on the paperwork TWICE that she was going to be charged for this repair a minimum of  for the diagnostic which is waved if we do any repairs I read it out to her out loud before having her sign I WANT HIM FIRED HE WAS LITERALLY THE WORST HELPER IVE EVER METgtM Are weare we talking about the same person I was here when you were checked in and he went through all of the procedure with you He even pushed you up the queue given you had stated it was an emergency and seemed distressedgtTF THATS IT I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOUR SUPERVISORAt this point my super comes out  a bigger guy who hasnt really worked a supervisors position before this and is EXTREMELY new Also kind of a huge accidentalsarcastically accidental prick a lot of the time Poor guy wasnt readygtTF YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE TERRIBLE THEYRE TRYING TO CHARGE ME FOR A REPAIR THAT SHOULD BE FREEgtB Maam theyre just doing your job And I have it right here on my paperwork that you agreed to paying for the system repairs or diagnosticgtTF WELL F YOU FT this didnt blow over well given my supervisor is actually gay I DIDNT AGREE TO S I WANT MY COMPUTER BACKSadly having missed this this apparently became a giant screaming match  one sided really B kept trying to explain to her that literally no one would do this cheaper and taking it to the Apple store will net the same result and require driving He gave up after a few minutes thoughgtB Well if you want your system back right now I can pack it up immediately but itll still be the  for diagnostics before we can release to you This caused more of the exact same argument and then she began yelling about me needing to be fired again and that he should be fired as well and that M should be fired Basically this girl wanted our whole department gonegtTF finally giving up FINE Ill just take it to Apple then Theyll do a better job After a bit more cussing at us she finally pays the  and goes to Apple B having worked at the Apple store notes that the girl just wasted well over  extra  the fix from us would have taken just one day longer would have been done day after all this and she would have only needed to pay  more for all her issues to be

Cyfun,177,329,1q3a4b,1160,Used to work at a cable ISP callcenter  Many of you probably know that cable modems have or used to have a Standby button on the top and if you hit it it would essentially turn off your internet  God forbid they call the button something logical like Off or Internet Disabled  Us TSAs loved these calls though cause it was the easiest fix in the worldI should also mention that we had an automated voice recording where if a person lived in or near a city with a known outage itd just tell them while theyre on hold so they didnt have to wait to talk to a real person  Unfortunately it was activated per city so it was often overkill if the outage was smallOne day a dude gets through to me cause his internet has been down for days and he asks when the outage will be fixed  I tell him theres some work being done across town but no outages affecting him directly  Have him look at his modem and sure enough its in Standby  He presses the button and his internet returnsI ask him the required Is there anything else I can help you with today He says he wants his account credited for his lack of internet the past few days  Hes not yelling at me or being pissy or anything just says it matter of factly  I explain to him that there was no outage his internet wasnt down hed somehow bumped that button and shut off the internet from his end The problem was entirely on his endHe argued that he had no way of knowing what that button meant that nobody explained it when it was installed and he never received a modem manual  I pointed out that had he called sooner we could have fixed it immediately He said that he actually called several times over the past few days and the automated recording said there was an outage affecting his area so he hung upI tried a bit more to argue against it but in all fairness he was right we did make things pretty confusing Plus he wasnt bitching me out which I did appreciate  And we had the authority to credit people up to  without requiring approval  So I crunched the numbers real quick and told him at  a month and being down for  days was only   Its enough for a sixpack he says and I agreed and credited it to himI salute you sir for being calm collected and not being a dick  You earned that ,1383814981.0,Persistent customer gets refund for putting his own modem in Standby,1489,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

RamsesThePigeon,21,17,1q4w7k,86,Everyone here has at least one aggravating astounding or amusing Tale from Tech Support Ive told a few of my own on occasion but theres one that Ive left in reserve It happened several years ago back when I was a selfstyled editor of photographs for aspiring models For some reason the ability to airbrush a blemish resulted in some folks thinking of me as an allknowing and exceptionally adept technical guru but as I would learn theres always someone whos a little more skilledNow I should mention that Im not a typical IT guy in fact Im an authorhttpwwwnearlydepartednet who works at a video game company to pay the bills At the time of this story I was casually acquainted with a young woman who had by a process of notsosubtle suggestion and outright pleading convinced her aunt  Ellen well call her  to finally get her children ages ten and twelve their own personal computers Why this was such a powerful obsession for my friend is still unknown to me but I agreed with the sentiment After all these kids had been limited to using the family computer for the majority of their lives a fact which made school projects and socialization alike into somewhat difficult tasksAfter having been finally convinced Aunt Ellen bought each of her children a desktop computer Then to further cement her households position in the Information Age she switched from the bottomrung DSL connection theyd been using and upgraded to a respectably fast cable service The inclusion of television channels and a home phone line may have helped her with that decision However she discovered with some dismay that setting up her network was a bit of a daunting challenge Thats where I came inAt first this seemed like it would be a simple task just set up a router install a few wireless NICs and be done with it However Aunt Ellen had a few special requests The most important thing she told me is an Internet passwordI nodded my understanding though I wasnt completely sure what she wanted Do you mean a WiFi password I asked Something to protect your wireless networkOh yes certainly that replied Aunt Ellen but I also want to keep my kids off the Internet if its past dinnertime Thats when all the creeps come out Well that was fine and although I had some private thoughts on the matter I wasnt there to offer parenting advice or play Internet Educator I set up the network put the necessary conditions in place on the router and moved onOkay great Aunt Ellen said visibly pleased Next put passwords on each of the new computers She didnt immediately offer an explanation for this but my assumption was that it was to keep her son the tenyearold from snooping on his sisters machine and vice versa Do you want to have your kids set up their own passwords I askedAunt Ellens answer was given with a look of shock Oh no no No only my husband and I will know them I dont want my kids on the computer without permission Again that seemed counterproductive to me but I held my tongue and did her bidding With that complete my final task was to reconnect the family computer to the network and go on my merry wayThe following day I received a phone call from my friend Her Aunt Ellen it seemed was having some unspecified difficulties with the new network setup and she wanted to know if I could stop by and help I was wary of becoming this familys personal IT technician but the fear that Id done something wrong brought me back to their house Upon arrival Aunt Ellen explained to me that her husband had been unable to check his email the night beforeI know you did your best she said but do you think maybe something went wrongWell I can certainly find out I replied Do you know if he used the right password Remember if its after seven you need to enter it firstAunt Ellen smiled and nodded Oh yes definitely I even tried it myselfI was skeptical but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and pulled up the routers configuration page Everything seemed to be in order except for an extra entry which Id never seen before It specifically locked a handful of URLs each of them clearly pornographic in nature and had the curious label of NoFacebookNoPornI need to check something I told Aunt Ellen Do you mind if I look at I thought for a brief moment before continuing  at your daughters computerWe went up to the girls room and  after Aunt Ellen made me avert my gaze while she entered the necessary password  had a look at the computer in question Lo and behold somebody had created a second administrator account and their browser history showed that it had been used the night before to access the router Suddenly it dawned on me Id never changed the routers default password and Aunt Ellens sweet innocent twelveyearold daughter had taken it upon herself to passiveaggressively block her fathers access to his pornographyIt was to say the least an awkward predicamentFortunately I managed to resolve the situation while leaving everyones pride intact although it took a lot more finesse than I had expected the task to require In the end the fathers browsing capabilities were restored the routers password was changed and nobody save perhaps the twelveyearold was any wiser and even though I undid her work I left the bent paperclip that I saw seated beside the girls keyboardTLDR A

pacocase,0,21,1q7jkn,0,Three warriors bravely boarded a flight out of their homeland departing earlier than even the sun itself had even thought to come up The security lines were naught for our heroes knew few other travelers dare to journey at such an hour as six fortyfive in the morning One hero courageously slept most of the way after a brief respite in the land of Philadelphia However the other two remained alert worried about the treachery that lie before themHaving accomplished their firstday goals intact shelter was the next priority after arriving in the far away land known as Los Angeles Tired from the long day of travel our droopyeyed heroes made their way an inn which had outdoor hallways that reminded them of much cheaper facilities ones they had seen before but had been too afraid to enter This was however the only inn in town with vacancy and rest was required before the next days battle Our heroes strengthened their resolve bypassed the glacially slow vertical transport device and took the stairs to their cabins for the night It was soon apparent to our esteemed heroes that the days in this land are longer as the initial day of the journey seemed never to end and this morning had come much earlier than normal The second day began with a long trek on unfamiliar and nonsensical trails Our crew did manage to make sense of the trails and eventually arrive at their destination only to be greeted by a cantankerous gatekeeper The small warrior having already encountered and tried the patience of this particular gatekeeper before gave way and allowed the tallest to use his powers of persuasion to turn the wouldbe foe into a reluctant ally All the while the others made camp amongst the myriad displays of technology in this new lair where they would largely remain for duration of the journeyThe epic battle began The BSODs fought fiercely in the beginning a seemingly undefeatable foe The three warriors fought with vigor each performing their own specialized attacks but to no avail There appeared to be no discernible pattern in the actions of their enemy  something our heroes had been trained to spot in their youth undergoing years of training during the NES period After several battles lost to the BSODs downtrodden and with little hope remaining one warrior decided on an unorthodox maneuver He would call for help lest the gatekeeper turn on them again Holding his communication device up to a gleaming beacon of sunlight he summoned an entity known as Dell Tech SupportDell was uncooperative at first Was the whole world against our heroes Nonstandard operating systems and video cards were flung at them as reasons for ignoring their pleas for help Our heroes convened placing Dell on a suspended animation spell known as hold After much internal discussion the hold was lifted as sacred dump files were gathered and sent to Dell as an offering As the sun set on the third day our heroes were on the edge of exasperation They returned to their inn with dashed spirits nonetheless determined to try again the next dayMuch to the warriors delight by the next morning word had been sent Dell had accepted their offering and from it they extracted this bit of wisdom should our heroes choose to undertake the task They must disable the CStates in the land of BIOS on each of the seven individual realms of the BSODs The short warrior having visited the land of BIOS more than the others was chosen for the task He suited up for battle and disappeared for a long while Just as the others were growing concerned enough to embark on a rescue mission the he returned with a triumphant grin joyfully inviting the others to provoke the BSODs which now lied dormant seemingly defeated Thank you Dell Tech Support The trio cried in unisonNaturally skeptical our heroes poked and prodded at the BSODs for a few concurrent days to be sure the beast was truly slain A few side quests remained to be sure  on the last day a Winnov device was swapped for an ineffective one after a baby BSOD reared its ugly blueandwhite head The new device successfully repelled further attacks and there was much rejoicing by the evening of the final day of the journey Rumors of strange incidents of frozen reality remained unproven Our heroes regarded them largely as superstition and legend surrounding the BSODs as they had searched for them all week to no avail The three warriors having successfully slain the beast and turning the gatekeeper into a permanent ally now shared a battlehardened camaraderie that had not existed the week prior They congratulated each other on their successes and took separate paths home eager for further journeys of their own,1383950846.0,A literal tale from tech support I had a little time on my hands before leaving the client site,14,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

sadak,12,24,1q3xq6,62,Inspired by uxoticrox tale Well your just not helping me at all I like to share to all of you In Mexico capital citystate there is a misconception that free internet is stealing Even that using any intelectual property without permision is stealingHere is semilegal to sell any DB with personal data depending of the data it can be legal to anounce even the ones to connect to WIFI those ones that you can find for free in the interwebs that have every default SSID and default password of every modem sold by the big local and monopolic company This agravated by the fact that every modem comes with the WIFI enabled no firewall enabled and every admin password is the same Even they alter corrupt the modem firmware to brand it and to make it user friendlyYou can go to downtown and in almost every corner in the street you can buy your free package containing a wireless USB receiver a program that cracks the password just an IDE of an app that reads the SSID and query a database So basically just plug the USB and with one click you steal the internetWell to the talesTwo years ago I bought my apartment there for other reasons I rent it now and Im living in Guadalajara now Before moving I contracted everything I will need in my new independent life you know internet with phone service because said company doesnt sell internet service only and cable tvWell when I finished moving I procced to connect the modem provided by company and then I arranged my couchs tv and somethings to make my first own meal This took around  hoursThen I procced to conect my laptop using an ethernet cable I didnt want to lose control while configuring it I configured the modem in my parents house since they contracted service when we first received our  kbps modem then when we received our first wireless modem Everytime I changed both the admin password and the wireless password or disbled the admin one and created one for me Well that was my principal objective with this brand new modem But when I tried to connect and test my internet speed never got the one I contracted I payed for  Mbps but I was getting less than  Mbps This company is know for their bad support service mainly because they are tech ignorant and only follow anything that is in their manuals and when there is something that is not there they frezee I will tell a history of this in another timeI procced to check the modem properties to see if this one is faulted happened once when living with my parents But while I was checking the options a Wire modem I clicked in the LAN configuration and saw the connected adresses list WTF There was at least  devices already connected I owned at that moment a Wii Ipad Ipod and my laptop and those werent configured yetAdd the mac address to the black list Power recicle the modem WTF They still connectTested adding the mac address of my ipad to the black list and connect it It can connect First diagnosis the black list is fucked up by company customization I say corruption of the firmwareTest white list enabled and add laptop and ipad addresses Still can connectChange wifi password change SSID name change SSID to hidden Then I heard a frantict the internet is not working scream from upper apartment and a cant connect to my email in the one next doorA grin appeared in my face and reversed the changes for a moment and hear they can navigate again Then do the changes again After telling this to my work friend the grumpy one I mentioned in other tales he gifted me a wireless modem that He had in his office because he bought it with his money to try to do an extension for the wireless network and never worked this was his modemI changed the modem tested the black  white list features and sticked with this oneSo you know now I like to trully have control of something we own to avoid an unauthorized could use it without consent The ironic part was that my sister reseted the modem in my parents house a couple of weeks ago because she didnt knew the password I was the only one that had wireless devices in my parents house and their PC is connected using ethernet cable After doing that she protested because the download speed was too slowI secured the network again and gave her the password A week later the modem was reset againTRDR Bartender Free Wireless Internet for everybody,1383841762.0,Tales from lawless lands,86,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

homsikpanda,66,24,1pw9ss,49,hello TFTS ive wandered your subreddit a few times and this just happened and i felt the need to post it warning this is a bit of a rantbackstory im a supervisor for a phone company i deal with the difficult customers or those wanting refunds or appeasements because our device is too difficult to comprehend things like thatso i get a call from a customer who purchased a small aditional storage plan about a month ago and then decided this wasnt enough storage and decided to upgradeto the next largest storage planheres the first catch when you upgrade you get charged the full price  of the storage you are upgrading to and refunded the previous purchase amountcustomer  lets call her bad with money hence forth BWM decided they would purchase storage now instead of waiting till thursday when they get paid and of course were charged full amount for increased storage this put their bank account into over draft and they were then charged an overdraft feeso they call in wanting me to pay for the over draft fee as a policy we  do not refund charges from third parties and  do not give monetary appeasements if you want stuff from us you have to settle with picking something from the website nuff said youre not getting any actual money from us periodanyway BWM is pretty much in tears by the time she speaks to me had to go thru a few of our frontline agents and wants us to pretty much pay her  because she didnt realize that when you buy something it charges you full price for your purchaseits been a slow day im pretty bored so i decide to be nice and try to help her i could have very easily just said we dont give refunds for your stupid mistakes but i offered her an appeasement of equal value from our online store nope not good enough i need money because i need to put food on my tableshe then trys to figure out ways she can take an item and return it to our store or even a different store like walmart for moneywhich i explain no thats not possible were sending you a  item for free as an appeasement it doesnt come with a receipt if youre LUCKY the best you can do is return it to a different nonus store and they might give you instore credit which you still dont get your  that you so desperately need and it takes a week to get the item anyway so youll be paid before themstill trying to be nice i even explained you can sell the item on ebay if you really wanted to but no this was too much effort for BWMi even offered to refund her purchase and had to suppress the urge multiple times to explain that if we refunded the purchase your bank will most likely refund the over draft as wellthe call ended with her stating shes going to bring the phone back to where she bought it to return it and buy a different phoneatleast when she returns it shell get her  back gtgtbut seriously how bad with money do you have to be to  decide that virtual storage is more important then food and  its so important you cant wait the  days till you get paid to purchase it TLDR  women tries to get use to pay for her inability to do mathedit if anybody knows how to edit the title please let me know gtgt thank yound edit some people seem to be confused with the upgradinghow it works while attempting to not give away my company if you buy gigs of storage then  month  months hell even  months down the road decide i need more storage you then would go and buy  gigs of storage this then over rides the  gigs you already purchased refunds it and removes those  gigs and instead gives you  gigs its how the system works because its easier when you purchase  gigs you get  gigs you purchase  gigs you get  gigs you purchase  gigs you get  gigs instead of having the system trying to do a shit ton of math because i purchased eight  gig packages then a  gig and then a  gig so i should have  gigs now right nono you shouldntour system dislikes math like that and were not going to do math like that for the several billion customers we have gtgt  what you buy is what you get its like if i went to a store and bought a shirt that was too smallfor  off so i go back to the store and buy another shirt thats biggerfor full pricei still have to pay full price for the bigger shirt but i get to return the small shirt either before or after purchasing the bigger shirt and get my money back on that purchase our system does the return automatically ifwhen you get a bigger storage packageedit  HOLY SHIT IM ON THE FRONT PAGE O FIRST TIME EVER WHHHOOOUPDATE she called me backleft a voice mail and wants to speak to my nonexistent higher ups while this isnt entirely worthy of an update she mentioned on the voice mail that she was charged  in over draft fees and is now  in over draft our storage plan is  sssoooo this means she bought the storage plan without any money in her account at all which i had assumed previously but as i couldnt confirm this fact i omitted it i dont like to spread facts i cant confirm  this just further cements my assumption that BWM is bad with moneymathi called her back because im at least trying to be helpful D i cant give you cash in hand but i can give you  worth of merchandise hell if you asked id probably give you up to  in merchandise  she gets to speak with my customer relations department which while technically a move down the ladder they have different procedures and abilities then what i have ill post more as i find out more,1383595315.0,no we im not giving you free money because you overdrafted your account,73,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

lumpypotato,18,28,1pvkwq,121,So this happened a while back and the company since started using Google Drive  Google Apps for keeping files organized and syncd between multiple collaborators and having better permissions control but for a period of time the goto I need to share this solution was DropboxFor those of you unfamiliar Dropbox is a pretty straightforward file storage service that can be relatively easy for keeping and sharing files where necessary Ive used it personally for sharing large audiovideophoto files that were too big for email and it worked well for the purposeAnyways my previous company was a software house so there was a lot of documentation business plans howtoguides and other miscellaneous things stuffed into that dropbox folder This was a small company that got very big very quickly  something like an office of  people working out of the nowCTOs living room to having three offices and  employees within  yearsOf course such growth necessarily means no one tended the documentation of any of the core software libraries so that was my jobAs the process of documentation began and I started pulling files out of Dropbox for review we began adding more people to the dropbox share in order to review and update materials in general Dropbox has aninteresting feature Maybe its no longer like this maybe we did something wrong but at the time when you downloaded the Dropbox app and syncd a folder to your computer that folder was on your computer  meaning changes to it were instantly syncd to Dropbox and to other people connected to that folderNow this might seem good on its face I think Google Drive is similar in this case but there was a really big issue  if you wanted to remove a dropbox folder you had to do it through the dropbox app  and NOT by using the delete button This wasnt obvious right from the getgo and would very quickly lead us to troubled watersUnfortunately the instructions were not clear and in addition to various trapped genitalia someone deleted the entire repository hoping to clear several gigs of data off their computer I was the first to realize it pinging the engineer in charge of the original repository with a single nardchilling sentence I think our documentation folder is gone The aftermath was slow as at first people just assumed that the drive wasnt updating fast enough Then came concern followed swiftly by panic You see those core libraries were old  old enough where only two or three developers out of dozens really knew how the hell to get them to work and while I had some of them documented for the newer versions our legacy apps which we had very large contracts for and were working on at the time were running wholly on the everchanging will of Murphys Law and lacking the documentation for what was that library supposed to do again essentially translated into days or weeks lost troubleshooting the old code This was in addition to the collection of old engineering files related to design testing and plans for future releases nevermind the creative repository of old audiovideo graphicsLuckily dropbox allows you to restore to a previous version so not all was lost But the engineer responsible for the dropbox folder and one of the original members of the company decided this would be a good lesson to be taught to the developers who all too often would absentmindedly do something or another and ignoring documentation or established procedure proceed to muck up a simple problem and make it worse So he let them sweat over the problems for a day before restoring to the previous version noting that in the future developers would do well to read the documentation provided for all systems as neither he nor the other veterans felt very much like spending additional late night hours staring at our aging Jenkins machine trying to figure out which one of dozens of common errors the developer had made ignoring all previous warnings that had been given time and time againNeedless to say I worked to get our core documentation off Dropbox and it was eventually moved to a combination of local storage and google drive The old libraries were eventually migrated to newer cleaner ones new documentation was written common developer errors were logged and best practices released all easily available announced and shared in such a way that as long as someone took the time to read everything they would be able to code in peace and harmony without fear of nuking an entire repository by hitting the delete button or adding a library that would grind all development to a painful haltSo of course no one ever read any of it and our tiny little corner of coding paradise remained in many ways the chaotic garden of postapple Eden that I and many others came to love and adoreNote Some of you might feel our devs were bad but they really werent  we had great developers But as Ive come to understand it great developers can still make silly mistakes and when it comes to core code libraries especially older ones whose requirements are dictated by upperlevel managementmarketing sometimes what should be a simple integration is something far more complicated I am happy to report that prior to my departure they transitioned to something far more whoops proof,1383576979.0,Why Dropbox is bad for collaboration,149,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

PERHAPS LAST THURSDAY AD    Scene in  a blissful Thursday afternoon with me in my corner office the boss out of the office thanks to his kid being newly born the juices from the Keurig flowing yes truly a day worth of Elysium However an urgent call to the project manager changed all that and he came storming into my office as though he were possessedJack he began in his Nigerian accent I need you to go to CLIENTNAMEPray tell why I muttered quietly sipping at my coffee and playing Sins of a Solar Empire You are aware BOSSNAME ordered me not to leave the office if I could avoid it and youre to send bitchboy yesI know Youre the only one who deals with shit like this though he said continuing on through a blissful haze of unawarenessWhat did they do I said quietly picking up the Aperture Science mug on my desk I will not appreciate driving out to bumfuck nowhere for them because they decided to fuck around or the cosmic shitstain they call a director of IT fucked up again I raised my voice I do not suffer fools lightly IsaacHe obviously didnt get it and informed me of the situation though delicately no doubt to avoid offending my sensibilities haThe firm had a suite of inhouse coders and all but the lead developer had quit en masse over the week The lead developer had turned in his immediate resignation this afternoon but the stupid bastard thought he had locked his machine beyond what we could do to get into it On top of that theyd all taken their code and started a rival firm one specifically dedicated to doing what the original firm did but they hadnt made the modifications to their contracts that I had and the lawyers were soon to get involvedI sighed and packed up my kit then drove through the beautiful Austin hillsides to reach the firm in question The last remaining developer was there in his office with the incompetent head of IT looking on frantically and a huge shiteating grin was on his faceThe head of IT pointed me towards the developers two machines and with a slight smirk I powered them on noticing the huge grin on the devs faceOh a BIOS password Well Its not as if I havent seen these since I was in high school I ripped the jumpers off the machines motherboards resetting the BIOS passwords The developers face fell a little going from total elation to mostly lolwutjpg and I booted to TuxPE off my USB key shameless plug since I wrote the damn thing and removed the local admin password via NTPWEditAfter a quick reboot followed with a login session as local admin I added the Domain Admins group back to local admins aww it was cute he thought he could beat me then rebooted the machine and started a disk imageI turned to the lead developer whose face had suddenly developed a thousandyard stare and smirked And that my good man is why you dont bet against a Bastard Operator I made special care to emphasize the capitals and his jaw dropped when he heard the term Chuck care to escort him out and call the lawyersThe portly head of IT used his considerable bulk to escort the lead developer out and with a grin I RDPd to the domain controller I built it into TuxPE and reset the lead developers password then shamelessly looted a few shots of the highend whisky Glenfiddich I knew that the head of IT kept in his desk drawerA short drive later I was back at my desk and able to tell the story to my coworkers to their infinite

shoelaceninja,46,55,1ppz1t,190,I will start off with a brief background about myself  I taught myself everything I needed to know to build my own computer in high school for gaming  Since then Ive built a handful of systems for friends and acquaintances  Its not something I can really say Im too good at budgeting and looking for deals but Ive built a good number of reliable machines and Ive only had  unhappy customer who was a douche and kept plugging his monitor into the onboard card rather than the dedicated video cardThe other day I was put in contact with a woman who works for a local distributor of an out of state supplier the industry might be too revealing and its not too relevant  She wanted me to meet with her and build a new computer for their business  Pretty much all it needed to do was run quickbooks and be able to send quickbooks reports to the supplier  That seemed simple  I offered to take a look at their current computer and see if there was anything I could do with it I mean I could just reinstall the OS and potentially save them hundreds of dollars even if that meant less money for meRight off the bat she was against the idea  She began describing to me how old the pc was  It has vista  Its slow and full of stuff  The person who previously worked here messed it up before she left  Oh well dang sounds like you need some help thenToday I met with her  She began by entering sales receipts into quickbooks  She wanted to show me her work process and show me the problems the computer was giving her  This was my first warning sign but it should have been my second I was slowly beginning to understand why she didnt want to salvage their current computer  She was claiming the computer was messed up and slow but all of her problems were quickbooks related  I knew this because I use quickbooks for my work regularly and I observed her doing everything wrong  I even threw in a comment about something she missed and she kinda brushed it off  I didnt want to be rude so I left it there  My next warning was when in addition to a new computer she wanted me to make everything easy for her to do  I kinda didnt really take that one in until later  I just assumed at first that she meant make it inherently easier by building us a better computerSo she flat out didnt know how to use quickbooks and she repeatedly told me that she was not a computer person  Her athome computer use amounts to minimal internet browsing and minimal emailingI kept suggesting that it may be totally unnecessary to get a new computer  I told her that it all seems quickbooks related  She then told me that she was going to switch to quicken for the business and asked me if I thought it would be any easier than quickbooks  I honestly dont know anything about that maam  She responded with well I guess youre just gonna have to research it then huhWHAT  Almost all of a sudden it became clear to me that the only qualification she had for this job was knowledge of the industry and its products but was rendered nearly  incompetent because she cant use a computer in almost any capacity  Not only that but she was trying to lie to her boss and blame the problem on the computer  So she was trying to get me to train her on how to do her job so that when the computer gets replaced it looks as if that was the solution  Now I know this is an opportunity for me to make some extra money in offering to train her but I dont want to  Not for someone who would try and pull this stunt  I dont know what to do  I didnt make it obvious that I knew what was really going on  When I left I told her that I would quote her on a machine as well as recommend some laptops as alternatives could save money and their current system is a laptop and get back to her monday  I offered to email her the info and she quickly responded with have you not been listening I dont know how to use computersI honestly dont know how to approach this woman the next time I see her  Im more than willing to build her a pc but I have never and am not willing to provide ELI computer training especially to someone who is using me lying to their boss and making their boss spend money needlessly because of incompetenceIdk man I suck at telling stories  But if anyone likes this Ill definitely do a Pt  or more in the coming weeksgtposted by bladeravergtFor those who wish to tldr this  His client is evidence that you can lead stupid to knowledge but you cant make them thinkEDITI would like to thank everyone for their comments  This is by far the most response Ive ever gotten to a reddit post and Im a little shocked to be honest  Ive decided that the best course of action for myself personally is to refuse to do business with her in any capacity though I will not be going over her head to her boss  She is a friend of a family member and I would hate to cause any strains on relationships between them because I know that would end up causing me problems down the road with my family member  EDITIt also seems that the supplier portion of the business does not have its own website and all avenues of communication end up at the local distributor  So I cant even figure out how to get in contact with her boss  She is also unsupervised at the moment  I feel very sorry for this business  Even with my limited knowledge on quickbooks if I was thrown into her job today I would at least be capable of teaching myself to do what was needed by the end of the day minus familiarity of products and the industry,1383349477.0,The computer is incompetent not

Zehnpae,227,389,1pk90e,1459,One thing many people dont realize is just how layered and interbred internet services can be when it comes to selling and reselling  One of my many illustrious career paths was a network operations position for a managed services company  Our clients were typically technical clients in and of themselves usually these hosts and resellers for smallmedium businesses  Over time due to acquirements trades and resales that I was the NOC admin IE Tech support guy for one company well call Carpenters Bargain Internet who rebought some of its services from another company called Jimmys Premium Networks who we also happened to be the NOC for  And then one day we were hired on as the NOC for Big Lawyers on Wallstreet office who happened to be getting their internet fromCarpenters Bargain InternetThis would have been fine until one day the moons aligned and I get a call from Big Laywers on Wallstreet because their internet wass down  Now as part of my job description I had to call Big Lawyers ISP who was again Carpenters Bargain Internetwho was me  So I did the only logical thingI talked to myself I asked myself why the internet was down  I told myself that we werent certain yet but wed investigate  Our technicians would looking into it and then get back to themOf course our techicians was me  And by looking into it I meant that Id ask myself why my services werent working for my client  Now as a technician for Big Carpenters Internet it was my duty to look into the problem  I checked into who we got our lines from for Big Lawyers on Wallstreet and wouldnt you know it we got them from Jimmys Premium Networks  I did the only sane thing anybody would do  I sent an email to Jimmys Premium Networks asking why the internet wasnt workingI waited about  seconds for the email to come to myself and then explained to myself that I was just made aware of the issue and would get back to myself once I knew more  I then called myself at Big Lawyers on Wallstreet to tell myself that we were investigating and would email myself when I got an update  I then contacted the owner of Big Lawyers on Wallstreet and told him that I didnt have an update yet but expected one soonI had to keep doing this for about  days keeping track of every imaginary phone call and leaving an email trail between different mailboxes that I all monitored  The most bizarre was when Big Lawyers asked me to demand an explanation for the outage  Nothing quite like writing yourself a stern email and informing your boss that youre very disappointed in your own lack of communication with yourselfIn the end it turned out some crazy farmer in Virginia cut through a fiber line by accident but then buried the line back up and wouldnt let the authorities on his property to fix it,1383163421.0,The surrealism of managed services or Why are you hitting yourself,1848,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

nerobro,5,12,1pkatj,65,Level  handed up a call to me  The customers VPN isnt working  While they do have access now to our core routing equipment theyre unable to determine if a customer has a VPN  Fine  Ok  Whatever  Im familiar with the customer theyre sending my way and I know they DO have a VPN  The Level  tech tells the Customer that Nerobro will be calling them back and i proceed to go to work  Poking and prodding at their network config I find that while all three sites are set up to work with the VPN the router we installed at one site doesnt have the proper routes to pass the VPN  Its been that way for a while  A long while  Probably months  At least since we replaced the router out there  I wonder how long this has been a problem  But I fix the issue anyway and pray the customers firewall is set to accept traffic for their VPN IP space  Then I call the customer back and the frustration just bleeds through the phone  You could have mopped off my desk  The actual story isnt the VPN broke  Which I fixed  The problem the customer was running into was my application server died  I rebuilt it now we cant reach it from the other sites  Which is a whole other story  I tell him that I fixed the vpn but I dont think thats the source of his problem and that he should contact the person who manages their network  He completely bypassed that suggestionI tell the customer that I did find that the VPN was broken and I repaired it  But were paying you for it and its not working now  You need to fix it  But I HAD fixed it  And thats where things really turned downhill  The customer didnt actually know their VPN wasnt working  They just assumed it was and knew it was on their bill  When the VPN they were using stopped working they assumed it was us  The customer has firewalls at each site that most likely provided their VPN connectivity  Outside of the pseudo MPLS VPN we were providing them  The idea of routing separate subnets through the same interface completely blew this guys mind  He just wants to know how to make the vpn work  As an aside why is it always just want to know X turns out to be I just want to know how to make the sorcerers stone cant you tell me instead of cant you just tell me how to make it red  I emailed the guy the relevant network information for each site  Routed subnets IPs to connect to our routers etc  I called him back and he doesnt know what a  is  He read the s as  through   I had to explain what CIDR was  I had to explain how routing worked  I had to explain why there were separate public networks and private networks at each site  I had to explain that his firewalls did the routing at two sites and we did the routing at the third site  Dont ask me how they weaseled us into doing thatAll through this he kept harping back to Were paying you for a VPN  How come it was broken  and Why were you charging us for it if it wasnt working  We dont monitor customer VPNs we depend on customers to report problems on them  They werent using the VPN so there was no problem  And then the customer demanded to know how to make this all work  Which I can explain in general terms but in specific cant tell him That requires knowing the OSs of each firewall  And were not in the business of configuring peoples firewalls for them  The most frustrating part is that this is all a giant red herring  His network was working fine before he rebuilt his application server  And that means it was working WITHOUT the VPN  In the end I told him that in the interest of getting this fixed he needs to talk to the person who built their network  As going down the path we were on means rebuilding his network to use our VPN instead of the configuration that they were using  I havent heard back  Hopefully he got it fixed,1383164640.0,The Enemies Within Fix my VPN Whats  And were paying you so its your fault Episode ,77,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

nerobro,32,13,1pgzef,86,TLDR No its not our network  Dispatch people now  But it was your networkI really try to avoid tales that are of the user failure variety  Theyre not fair and theyre old hat  But this week I have two of them  The first one is a customer with a high speed connection   megabit  Thats something serious  If you have any doubt call up your local mabell and see what meg metro ethernet costs  Now the customer has history the people we lease the  meg line through for them have failed in recent history    So we enter my part of the story  A ticket gets escalated to my queue because nobody else has any idea whats going on  I call Mr Wormwood as hes listed on the ticket  At the same time Ms Honey the manager of the other department is sending emails and attaching the office managers name and cell phone number to the ticket  I find their interface check their traffic Theyre moving virtually no traffic over their  meg circuit  Since its a resold line I cant actually check the demarc equipment so I roll a ticket with the telco  Here is where I made my mistake  I didnt do a show arp  That command would have shortened this by an hour or two  I called and spoke to Mr Wormwood their technical person on site who tells me theyve rebooted their firewall and theyre still going out their backup T  I ask what kind of firewall it is they tell me its brand and feeling confident its not sonicwall stupidity we move on  In my head your equipment is good my equipment is good it must be the telco  I tell the Mr Wormwood Im going back to the telco and Ill have an update on a dispatch solution within the hour  Twenty minutes after I promise an hour callback to Mr Wormwood Ms Honey calls me  The customers office manager is freaking out  And I need to call Ms Trunchbull back immediately  She needs answers and needs to know the fix now  Tennatively I pick up the phone and make the call  Ms Trunchbull believes that because shes spending a lot of money on her internet we manage her network  She also believes that we own the DMARC equipment  I explain that were already working on it  But she wont have any of it  Trunchbull My internets been down for  hours this isnt acceptable  Were paying you thousands of dollars a month this shouldnt happenNerobro Im sorry you reported this issue less than an hour ago  I promised Mr Wormwood that Id have an answer from the local telephone company in an hour We need to give them time to workTrunchbull You need to fix this now you need to send someone out here to check out your equipment  Theres a red light on the box here that has to be the probelm  I pay you lots of money you should dispatch right awayNerobro The equipment on site isnt owned by me  Its owned by the local Telco  Even if I sent someone there they arent equipped to diagnose test or replace that equipment  I have a ticket open with the local telco and well have that fixed as soon as we canI finally get her off the phone and go back to troubleshooting   I get permission to dispatch someone there I call the telco to insist someone goes out  My manager having already okeyed any costs involved  I go back to checking the line  I finally issue the magic show arp command  I see the customers firewall arped up  So I try pinging it  Shockingly it responds  And it responds with a decent ping considering the  miles dozen routers and switches between my desktop and their office  I call Ms Trunchbull back  Because Mr Wormwood isnt answering the phone  Ms Trunchbull just wants to complain  Trunchbull  I cant be on the phone Im supposed to be in a meeting  My internet has been down for  hours now why cant you get someone here to fix itNerobro The dispatch requests are already pending  Those take some time  The telco we can expect to take another couple hours  And were still waiting for my dispatch department to get me an answer  But I did some further testing  It seems your internet might be ok  Could you check it for meTrunchbull  FINE  No still the same problem  I cant reach my webmail or my citrix server  Its not working  Send someone outNerobro  I didnt see any traffic when you tried to connect  Id really like to check out the network on your side  Is there anyone techniTrunchbull NO  Everyone technical is in the meeting  I need to be back in there  Just send someone out to fix itNerobro  I understand but I think we need to have someone check out your firewall  Id like to know how it determines which link is upTrunchbull No we dont have access to the firewall  Were not going to pay our consultants to look at the firewall  I cant believe this your service is terrible  If we werent under contact Id drop you right now  And that red light is still on  Fix itNerobro  I am working on getting people out there  When my tech arrives he will only be able to test the internet connection  I am quite sure his tests will prove the connection is fine  If thats the case well still need someone technical on your side to address the issueTrunchbull Just get someone hereSo we did  About an hour later one of our supermen of field services gets on site  He plugs in tests it  And it works   meg both ways  For good measure he reboots their firewall again    And their internet comes backAn hour later the Telco Tech shows up too  Turns out the dmarc equipment has a red light on the Ethernet port that the customer is not plugged in to  Something thats not a problem at all  Just a spare port they could use  The next day I get an email update from Ms Honey  It turns out that  was flaking out that day and the customers firewall used ONLY  to determine which connection was up and working  So their firewall was failing over to the backup T  Customer was down for  hours  Ten minutes with their network people would have brought them back up  Lessons  Dont forget to check ARP and as a customer CHECK YOUR GEAR,1383062984.0,The Enemies Within A break from convention and a meeting that cant be

coydog,18,10,1pebcj,69,I previously worked at an office supply store that also did computer repair and services here in the US  We were frequented by a big doofus of a customer I will refer to as Dumbnonymous  Dumbnonymous liked to come in the store and tell anyone who would listen that he was a master hacker  Being that he was  years old had one of his eyes that could look around the corner while the other looked straight ahead always had this creepy smile on his face and weighed probably lbs plus I figured there could be some smidgen of truth here  Just a smidge though  I cant imagine any hacker announcing this to everyone he comes in contact with   One day Dumbnonymous comes in to buy a computer and one of my associates is helping him  Bright guy writes his own programs  I am listening in as my associate is helping him  Dumbnonymous isnt let him get in a word edge wise as to the best of what I can recall he was saying things likeIm a hacker  The government has been after me for yearsThey cant catch me though  Im watching my associate who is clearly annoyed and rolling his eyes as Dumbnonymous sings his own praise  My associate talks to him about the services we offer such as set up and the dreaded service plan and of course Dumbnonymous is rejecting all as he sings his own praise again and again being a hacker   Then I hear Dumbnonymous contradict himself  Im not supposed to be buying a computer  Its illegal for me to own one since the government busted me  Uh what  Two minutes ago they couldnt catch you and now you have been busted  So we get dumbnonymous his laptop which of course was the cheapest piece of crap we sold  He is at our tech counter checking out  I am there because he is paying by check and I have to verify it due to the amount  Then the questions startWhat should I use to back this up  Floppys or can I use CDsUh how about a flash drive  Its  and almost NOBODY is using floppysHow do I make the recovery disks  Well Dumbnonymous thats a service we offer  Sorry after wasting half an hour with this dude no simple info for free  Besides he is a MASTER HACKER  He asked other questions and ALL were what a customer who has very basic PC user experience would ask  Up to the time when I left a few months back every time he came in he talked about being a hacker   ,1382980133.0,Sure you are Mr Doofus Sure you are,79,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

stupidity every time Beside the fact she cant shut up and constantly chats bs all day currently shes talking about something shes seen on Twitter about breastfeeding apparently to the air in front of her shes also just not very ITsavvy and yet stops any of the team doing anything IT Its a clusterfuck Theres no saving this department with her as a boss Ive just learnt to get on with thingsIve worked in my current techie position for six months and its a small department of four with one based out of office In the office is my deaf colleague who works solely on the website and makes very bad graphics and my boss who likes being the boss We provide support to  people with software and hardware issues and also do the general office tasks of creating emails changing passwords and ordering new stock Did I mention were also the PR department It gets busy So my boss was off for a week This is the only time anyone dares approach our department with their nigglesqueries since my boss will talk down to anyone who dares come to her with any sort of problem If you didnt send in a request for help through our staff Intranet first shell complain If you did shell complain God help you if you just walked into the office I suppose this is a good thing as it creates organisation but the way she goes about this means the department has a very bad reputation and everyone just leaves their PC problems because they cant be bothered with her So when shes out of office I suddenly get a lot of calls reporting viruses yes we let users install their own software without request  help me incorrect installs password requests and general My PC has something wrong with it pls help comments Im fine with this since for some reason my boss hates me leaving the office and grasps at any excuse to keep me at my desk It makes doing my job as an ICT support techie very very hard and frustrating So when shes out of office and I get a call to fix something I am filled with glee that I can actually go and do somethingI get a request from the office across the corridor to look at one of their computers Its apparently slow takes ten minutes to load up and the Internet crashes often They also requested a new keyboard as now stickers with letters on have been covering all the buttons for six months and their requests to my boss as far have been ignored I replace the keyboard why wouldnt you replace the keyboard We have twenty extras in the upstairs supply cupboard alone and then have a look at the PCIts pretty bad It takes twenty minutes to start up from shutdown and I ended up staring at the customised running horse loading cursor for longer than my mind could handle I look at how old it is  its eight years old Someone is trying to use a PC running multiple programs that is eight years old and it hasnt been exactly looked after during its run The program our HR department uses is quite highdemand on even our new laptops so no wonder this PC was struggling to keep up with it I look at what it loads up on startup and theres nothing out of the ordinary there Their installed programs were minimal and even when I did some cleanups of unused files and so on it was just far too slow No viruses malware or anything suspicious After spending an hour most of that was spent waiting admittedly looking at it I said perhaps it would be best to replace the computer considering the programs they use daytoday I really doubt the computer was useful to anyone at this point but my boss is famously frugal with our generous allowance for buying new equipment and its hard to persuade her to replace anything Im currently on a five year old laptop that cant be switched off because it will not switch on again unless you heat it manually if you do let it power down Its slow for what I do but its a stepup from the computer I was given when I started which commonly bluescreened and was also chockfull of viruses in the beginning But I digress So they happily put in the request and my boss when back from leave has a look at it and grudgingly admits its not really up to scratch for office standard anymore But instead of a new one why not just use the spare PC in the next room What the PC discontinued from someone else for similar reasons a few months ago My boss nods Its been a while it must be okay by nowI literally just stare at her as she says this and then somehow manage to gather myself to say Well should I switch it on and see if its fit to be a replacementMy boss shakes her head No were busy with your forty minute six month evaluation tomorrowwhat Why cant I look at it now Or you know have a look at it in the other six hours I work tomorrow What Its been a week and theyre still using the same computer as were just so busy in here that we dont have the time to look at it Im currently on Reddit and shes now talking about what TV she watched last night Every time I bring up going to look at it she glares at me and says But were

SerBeardian,90,154,1owddm,528,Today I had a lovely win so I wanted to share it with you all Sorry for the long postPreface I work Frontline Support for the smallmedium business services of a major Australian ISP We deal with both internet and emaildomain issues for domains hosted by us as well as general computer issues directly related to internet accessThe Story I get a call this morning from a dealer Basically a franchisestyle salessupport for our services who has this client that has recently set up his emails with our domain and is not able to send any mailI had just written up an Ultimate Guide to Domains and Emails for our team to use and am pretty savvy when it comes to domains so I think This will be easy enough and run through the basicsIs the domain with us Check Are the RegistrarName ServersMX records acceptable Check No glaring problems with the Domain Check Mailbox set up and working on the Mail Server CheckEverything checks out I tell the dealer to connect the customer through minute later the call drops Im weighing up whether to try and contact the customer direct or take a different call I decide service is a better choice and start hitting the contact numbers on the accountrd attempt I get through Lets call the customer JG Older gent in his early s I introduce myself and explain that I was supposed to be helping him out but the call dropped with the dealer He seems friendly enough but in a rush I ask him if hes ok with me just remoting into the computer and setting it up for him He gives the ok and I prep it from my endI get him to go to wwwlogmeincom no dice Try again nothing I send him an email direct link and it doesnt come through right away At this stage hes pretty upset since hes been having problems for a month and were roadblocking from go Hes gotta make a call overseas in  minutes and cant hang aroundI try and get him to call me back when hes done since our queue is fairly full right now but hes having none of it and wants a call back in  minutes I say fine I might not be able to in  minutes but Ill call back same day standard calls and an hour later the queue is low enough to warrant an outbound call I hit up his number and get through right away Btw This guy picks up the phone like he can hear me diallingHes feeling a bit better since he got his call through ok so we get started Try the website no luck getting through Send him  emails since the first one arrived but theyre not going throughFinally he mentions that he had some DNS problems the other day I think hes probably still having them considering some pages do load after a while but others dontWindowsRcmdipconfig allDNS servers are something strange not oursWe joke about what they might be and I figure we can just use Google since I can never rememeber the IPs of our DNS serversWinRncpacplNetwork interfacesRight clickgtpropertiesgtdoubleclick TCPIP vIP and DNS are auto so no real idea where the others are coming fromI get him

get to logmein and I get him to download the fileBam Antivirused Fuck NortonTakes  minutes to get around Norton and get logmein downloaded and working Finally Im in and in control Lets take a look at

his lunch while I poke and prod the computer Hes done in a few minutes and we get back to general chitchat while I fiddle with it Coming up on  hours and Im finishing in  minutesNow thoughout this whole time the connection kept dropping out every few minutes I mention this and JG drops the bombshell that broke the case His previous ISP was a wireless one using a dishantenna on the roof and he

his other ISP emailPaste into SMTP for our emailDone and freaking DONEEverything works Emails send ok Emails receive okWe laugh it offI get him to send an email to the dealer to get him switched across to our equipment and change the SMTPs backSupport completeBonus roundHe asks me how to renew the license for Norton since he doesnt like using his credit card onlineI recommend using a free AV instead and get him to ask the dealer or his It support since we cant recommend any specific AV programsJG Aw come on nobody will knowMe Well you know the calls are recorded and allJG laughs Well alright Ill just get dealer to recommend one but if anyones listening Id like to say youre absolutely brilliantMe Wellllmy manager is sitting right over there how about you tell him yourselfJG Sure Why notMG Cool Ill get him in a secGrab my Team Leader Whos a pretty cool guy for a commendationHe comes over starts chatting with JG and taking down notesand then they start talking about AFL and

Smith,16,54,1ovjrb,229,So heres another story which happened a few years ago and Id figure all of you would enjoyIn the company I work for we have a team of developers who work to create applications which are used both internally and externally One of these applications which was under heavy development for months happened to be an automation toolset which was designed to replace an older more archaic system that would break if you even tried to look at it funny and was starting to no longer fit the companys needs This new automation system like the system it was replacing tied into Microsoft Exchange to drive one of its automation tasksNow as these are developers I provide a selfservice solution to them for development They can get ondemand virtualized dev environments from a dedicated cluster of servers in our datacenter with dedicated network capacity segregated from the rest of the network excluding services such as subversion which are needed for dev work and Internet access after submitting a ticket requesting such ability Being selfservice the virtualized environments can be reloaded to a clean image of their choice can be restarted and scaled at any time as they need As a benefit to being virtualized if a host goes down for any reason the developers can continue their work while the downed host is being brought back online yay for fault toleranceSo with that said the developers should have everything they need to work on and test every bit of every program they work on without having to bother any Helpdesk personnel or a SysAdmin Before this development environment existed the developers were often creating and testing their programs locally on their machines We have policies on how development work must be performed and one of which includes running all dev code in the test environment until it is ready for production This of course is where the story startsIts a Friday evening and Im preparing to disappear from the daily torment of Can you fix my computer or Why is the Internet slow or Where is my file by taking a weeklong vacation to just get out of the office I check my email for anything important check over our system monitoring to see if any networked hosts and devices were in alarm lock my workstation and desk and proceed to walk out the door Suddenly the phone rings a rarity for the time of day Its the HelpdeskHey Smith weve received a few calls and tickets in from some users who are reporting problems with their email in the past half half Most of these users are not able to synchronize their mailbox One user reported their mail client started crashing We were able to resolve that problem but their mailbox will not synchronize The problem appears to be with the Exchange servers Would you be able to check this one outI agree since Exchange being down is in other words the end of time as we know it After all I could have overlooked something before leaving for the day I ask a few questions about the problem that was at hand making sure the helpdesk followed all troubleshooting procedures before escalating the problem to me and received a list of the users I agree to take a look at the issue based on the answers I received back Knowing that many of these users were sharing common servers and a common Exchange store I proceed to take a look at the problem Servers up Yes Network running properly Yes How about loads OhThe load on one of the CASs was through the roof High network utilization high CPU usage The database store hosts were showing higher than normal IO usage and network utilization We have a legitimate problem I dive into the problem deeper at this point A few commands later in PowerShell and a bit of crossreferencing some network logs I can see that all but one user on the affected Exchange cluster have left for the day and their mailboxes are dormant One user was still logged in and problems were ongoing I check their mailbox statistics and the monster appears from tall grassThe users mailbox was growing and it was growing quickly in just one folder The Deleted Items folder It was at GB Seeing this I quickly lock down the mailbox and place it into a readonly mode The server loads drop and network usage settles back to normal levels An alarm finally comes through showing high load on the affected hosts and security warnings start to arrive about Access Denied for the affected mailboxA few minutes later Im on the phone with the user whose mailbox I shut down They are a developer As it turns out they were testing some new code for the new automation system outside of the development environment I provide for them where they have their own mail environment too and for testing purposes tied their own Exchange account into the program While asking them why they were testing software outside of a dev environment I take a peak at their Deleted Items folder and then delivered the news on what they did As it turns out the program they were testing was recursively duplicating their deleted items folder caught in a loop and grew the mailbox at an exponential rate An unexpected featureReminding the user of our development policy I get to work on cleaning up the mess and the user works on getting their program shut down and back into the dev environment Given that I care for my users and given a restore from backup would have resulted in hours of downtime for other users I elect to create a quick Powershell script that will clean up the duplicated items and leave one copy of each message in their mailbox which they agree to I informed the user that they will need to have the helpdesk repair their mail client after this incident and send the ticket back off to the Helpdesk stating the Exchange problem was resolved A few hours later the script completes The users mailbox went from GB down to a comfortable MB with not a single message missing I leave the office ready for a vacation amazed at the fact that a mailbox hit GB The helpdesk come the next working week was able to get the user up and running again with their email client and all was well with the worldSome notes to wrap the story up Why wasnt a mailbox quota enforced for this user which would have stopped this mess Well when upper management crashes down on you saying limiting a mailboxs size stops productivity no amount of explaining is going to get them to turn back on their demands for unlimited storage So everyone gets unlimited As a bonus I do get to bug them for more money when it comes time to beef storage up reminding them of their poor choices EDIT TLDR User tests program outside of dev with their own mailbox makes a GB deleted items folder Planet implodes from the weight of email,1382323075.0,Is Exchange down,283,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

trn,75,139,1oknha,618,My last set of stories didnt get me downvoted into oblivion so I would like to share a couple more  Granted the stories I shared last week were true gems but there are a series of honorable mentions which I shall recount directlyThe EntityOne of our employees brought his computer in  It was of the notorious EMachines breed  Anyone who has worked on one knows that they are simply the worst computers sold at our fine establishment  Employee complained of fans dying overheating unexpected shutoffs  Wanted free service naturally  Thinking the problem was electrical I whip out the multimeter and pop the case  Powered computer on  STENCH  I powered through the smell and tested fan leads  V  Computer warms up over  or  minutes as I wait for a failure  No such failure  I see what appears to be a dense dust bunny in the bottom corner of the computer and suggest that we clean with compressed air  Upon further inspection the mass appears solid  Human nature takes over  I grab my screwdriver  poke  Ball turns from a ball into a writhing mass of insects  Ball disintegrates into what seemed like hundreds of little bugs scattering to cover the circuitry of the motherboard  Some are zapped when they become the path of least resistance  Computer becomes one big NOPE  We close the computer and entomb it in plastic wrap  Employee experiences eternal shame and never picks the computer up  It stayed on our shelves for months until policy allowed us to dispose of the unitLittle Head of HouseholdCirca PS heyday back when we handled all returns not just computers  Mother and child approach counter with a Playstation   Unit wont power on PSs are currently repair items that need to ship to a depot  One of the guys explains this  Because there is strength in numbers I walk over and tell her the same thing in different verbiage The mother understands and prepares to hand the paperwork over to us  Strike up conversation with the annoyed boy couldnt have been more than   I ask him what his favorite game is  GTA   I Laugh  Hes too young to be playing it  Humorchallenge him by asking what his favorite mission is  I dont do missions  I like running over hookers  Im astounded  Im waiting for mom to intervene  No such intervention  I need my game from the CD drive  Sure enough its GTA  Attempt to give the game to mom  Its mine  Child snatches it from my hand  Mom gingerly hands over paperwork and child performs the most insane thing Ive ever seen from a prepubescent  Im literally pausing for emphasis  Ready  Seriously ready  Child reaches up grabs mother by the CHIN  Pulls her down to his level and says with all of the seriousness of a serial killer  We will not be sending this off  We will be buying a new one  Looks mother dead in the eye  I mean just some straight up gangsta sht  Mother calmly waits for child to release her looks at us and says  Well just buy another one  Child and mother walk off  Read that series of sentences again  Ill wait  We were all disturbed  I know my mother would have inserted that GTA CD into my anus had I even attempted something like that then she would have slapped the teeth out of my mouth and then forced me to eat the PS  That was in  I can imagine where that kid is now  Hopefully in a supermax penitentiaryThe Chemistry LessonIt is a well known fact that waiting for a depot repair sucks  It takes weeks and half of the time your item isnt fixed because well depot repair guys care more about leaving at pm than fixing the things they fix  So for some nice customers we would ensure that the item being sent to the depot was unrepairable  Cue the DC Generator  Originally slated for supplying v DC to components for testing it led a double life as an assassin  Two seconds when connected across capacitors and such led to the release of that acrid magic smoke and the impending disposal of the host product by the depot team ensuring a replacement unit was in order  The electrical assassin was also used for fun  Frying circuit boards was a favored pasttime of bored employees  My coworker and I were partaking in said activity when we decided to see how badly we could burn out a PCI modem  After many minutes of frying components and spraying capacitor liquid onto the wall we employed our second favorite item into the mix compressed air  Not psi of air canned air  When held upside down a freezing stream of chemical is ejected and can even cause frostbite on bare skin  Its perfect for cooling down burning components right   a spray can later and its subsequent sublimation into a gas we cause a chip to arc and burn in an ember of awesomeness  The chemical in the canned air reached an ignitable fuelair mixture  And did it ever ignite  WHOMP  The entire table becomes engulfed in flames igniting the arms of my coworker and creating copious amounts of ozone  Customer on the other end of the department leans across the counter to enjoy the festivities  Coworker runs around the bench with flaming arm hair  I could only imagine Danger Will Ronbinson as he robotically attempted to wave off the fire  Entire department smells like burnt hair and spent chemicals  In the ultimate act of cowardice I conveniently notice that its time for me to clock out and I disappear from the premises knowing that I was probably going to get fired  I didnt and the accident became

sound of Outlook reciving an email Ugh I thought to myself as I reminisced on the days when I felt special with each and every emailBetween my bitches the allhands announcements and occasionally some actual work I was easily getting  emails a day Needy fucksI read the little popup notification ALERT TEMPERATURE WARNING For fucks sake I know its hot outside Its Iraq In the summerI hate having unread emails in my inbox I dont know its probably some OCD thing The email pops up But I clicked on the email    From some automated address    To Server Team Distro Group    Subject ALERT TEMPERATURE WARNING        RED ALERT ALL HANDS TO BATTLE STATIONS        The temperature in the Alternate Technical Control    Facility has reached  degreesThats not right I thought to myselfI wasnt too worried about it though We were always having problems with the temperature sensors Those systems just did not like all of the moon dust floating aroundFor those of you that have never been to a desert everything gets sand in it no matter how hard you try to keep it out no matter how many filters you install You always have moon dust in everythingThe climate monitoring systems in out technical control facilities were only an exception to this rule in that they tended to collect more dust than anything else Because of this they were in a constant state of malfunctionBut I called the server chief all the same If there really was something wrong we needed to get it under controlHey SSgt Tony Its LCpl McSparklenuts Did you see the alert email about the temperature in the alt TCFNah I unsubscribed to the alerts I was getting too many of them Whats going onWell the temperature sensor reached  deg wait I just got another email  degrees The temperature is rising down there Services still seem to be up but if its really that hot in there it wont last for longHang on Ill call down there and see whats going onWe both hung up our phones I sat there getting ready to start shutting things down remotely while I waited for him to call me backThe phone ringsHey LCpl McSparklenuts the guys down at the alt TCF arent answering the phone I need you to go down there and check this outRoger that SSgtI donned my flak jacket and kevlar grabbed my rifle and prepared myself for the journey ahead The alt TCF was easily  of a mile away and the vehicle was gone Fuck Guess Im walkingAs you can imagine a  mile walk when its  degrees outside is not fun As soon as I stepped outside all the energy that I may have ever had in my body was instantly eliminated But I diligently trudged through the sand and rock and proceeded to my destinationAs I closed in a horrifying site met my eyes The air was thick with smoke and was that the air conditioning unit was on fireOh this is just not my day I thought to myself as I ran over to the breaker box I cut the power grabbed the fire extinguisher and managed to put out the fire thanks to that mandatory fire warden class I had attended only a few weeks prior Wow That wasnt just a complete waste of my timeAs if on cue the Marines that were supposed to be manning the TCF walked around the corner carrying their little styrofoam boxes of food from the chow hall The look of shock on their faces was pricelessI quickly explained the situation to them as we moved towards the door of the facilityWe entered Another horrifying site but not unexpected The temperature sensor was working perfectly It was a bonechilling  degrees inside that facility Alarms were emanating from just about every network deviceI ran over to the phone to call SSgt TonySSgt there was a fire down here The AC is cauput We need a new one Im going to try to shut everything down to try and save the equipmentNo dont shut it down thatll take too long Just turn it off We have backups if need beI called out to the others so they could start turning everything off while I finished up on the phoneUhh what do you want to do about the file share SSgt We dont have redundancy on that right nowCan you get it down to the other TCFThe vehicle was gone I had to walk down hereWell just leave it on We cant have it go down right nowSSgt if I leave it on its only going to be a matter of minutes before the thing turns itself offShit I forgot it does that You gotta get that thing down to the other TCF as fast as possibleRoger thatThere was only one thing I could do at this point I disconnected the file share pulled it out and ran of a mile isnt that far when you are walking It seems a little bit further when you are wearing a flak and kevlar but still not too bad But sprinting with an additional  lbs of weight on you with a rifle getting in the way of your legs is painful Im surprised I didnt die from heat exhaustionBut I made it As I arrived with the file share puffing for breath the LAN team was jsut finishing up the switch configs to put the share online without having to change IP addresses and DNS entries Well that was a relief I guessMy fellow server team members took the machine  But I just grabbed a bottle of water and collapsed to the fetal position on the floorMy respite was interrupted however by our diligent lieutenant walking through the door He was dressed only in his workout gear carrying his protein in one hand and the keys to the truck in the other Why the fuck are you just sitting there when there is an emergency You should be helpHe was interrupted by SSgt Tony there to save my assLook sir LCpl McSparkle just ran  of a mile if full PPE with that server over there I told him he could take a break I would remind you sir that had you not taken the truck to go to the fucking gym he wouldnt have had to do that Give the kid a breakThe lieutenant was furious but he had a new target He left beckoning SSgt Tony to follow himSurprisingly getting the file share up again only took a couple of minutes I was expecting problems but there were none That was a reliefI got back in my chair and got settled in watching some show or another intent on not doing any work for the rest of the dayThe door opened again and in walked the Lt and SSgt Tony The Lt murmured some form of apology and scampered Lts dont like to apologizeSSgt Tony stuck around for a bit though I thanked him for taking the heat off me and asked him how bad things wereMeh I just got a bit of an ass chewing for talking to him like that Im a SSgt Theres not much they can do to meHe tried to give me the rest of the day off I declined and told him I would stay I had internet at work so I was happy with that and there really wasnt that much left to do for the dayCalls were made and the AC unit replaced the next day The investigator said that the previous unit had faulty wiring and had just been a ticking time bomb We got everything back online and things were happy Ahh well So go the days of deployed IT But I can say that was the one and only time I ever had to run with a server Over the next couple days we got some

firestormv,29,43,1oiw5y,215,This was a story from back in the day when I ran my own contract company with a buddy of mine  This customer was a large psych office and was a big deal for both of us so we wanted to make sure they stayed happy We arrived on site and my friend went about working on the phone stuff and I talked to the lead doc the owner about what was going on    Him  Well ever since you two did that expansion  phones  network about four months ago weve         been having some problems    Me What are you experiencing can you show me    Him  The  is slowFor some reason the entire office was running a  terminal emulator to access their medical records datastore No one knew the name of the application but just called it the  even though it somewhat irked me on a lower level This software must have fallen out of the s but it served their needs well and up until now I left it alone as it just worked as long as there was Internet access to the office While the office was a large deployment  at least  devices after the expansion the network was a simple business router and twoswitch stack Hardly a complex solution I hadnt really messed with the  software but I did know it was a hosted application and that issues with it usually mean Internet connectivity problems for the officeI started out with my usual troubleshooting methods and stopped short when I found that he had about every letter in the alphabet mapped to a network share on some server that was obviously down  Every mapping had the big red X through it so I knew something was up    Me Whats the deal with these mapped drives  You dont have a server around here do you    Him Oh we do but thats been like that for ages It wouldnt affect the  will it     Me It shouldnt but thats kind of a big deal if you have a server and you cant get to it Lets address the       server first and then well get to the   Im more concerned about access to all those shared drives       right this moment When was the last time you accessed the server    Him Well its been about a year now    Me Has anyone else been able to access the server    Him Not for a long time I figured it just kind of expiredAt this point I was floored  The last time they had an outage was when the Internet went down at their site and they called me six times in as many minutes freaking out because they couldnt access their medical records datastore I got them back up and running quickly reboot the router test internet test  good to go but still had never seen any evidence of a local server until today    Me Do you know where this server is in the building    Him Yes its in name redacteds office    Me Ok lets go check it out We walked into another office and I started tracing the cat from the wall jack  It went under the workers desk and into what appeared to be a service panel built into the wall I opened the service panel came across a very dusty keyboard and a black and white monitor with the Press CTRLALTDEL to login prompt burned into the screen Tucked away behind the monitor was the server that time and everyone forgotThis was an old NT AT computer in a generic whitewithblackplate computer box that was covered with dirt rust and about a half inch of dust Im surprised Indiana Jones didnt find this thing first I pulled the machine out from its crypt and sure enough the server had died a rather painful death a long time ago from what appeared to be a blown power supply judging from the scorch marks on the back of the case  Upon seeing this the doctor freaked out saying that it was suddenly the most critical thing in the world and that his entire business would go down in flames of course which is why it was put in a maintenance crawlspace    Him Oh my god Please tell me you can fix it    Me I dont know  I may be able to but this thing is so trashed I am not sure if it will be recoverable At        the least I can try to do data recovery on it or we can send the hard drive off if I am unable to    Him How long will that take    Me  If I can replace the power supply and the machine works Ill bring it tomorrow If not but the drive         works a couple of days  If we need to send it off to a data recovery specialist it could be a month or        more and will be quite expensive  It all depends on the hardware    Him How are we going to access the  now    Me  This server has been down for quite some time at least a year  How have you been normally         accessing the     Him describes process    Me Well lets try it now and see what happensHe and I go back to his office and he starts up his  emulator and it connects  He logs in and pokes around a bit and breathes a sigh of relief    Him Looks like the server is working    Me No your  is a hosted application elsewhere  The server that I pulled out of that crawlspace has        nothing to do with the     Him What  Are you sure    Me Up until an hour ago I didnt even know you had a server  The  connects to a hosted application         which is running on a server in a datacenter probably on the other side of the country  Youre fineHe gives me that look of shock then panic then slowly eases back into some semblance of not freaking the heck out    Me So what do you want me to do with the server Do you want me to try and do some data recovery on it         or do you want to hang on to it    Him still skeptical of the  application Lets see if everyone else can connect to  then well seeInsert another hour of running around from person to person trying to connect  Everyone was able to connect successfully and rightful order had been restored    Me How about this Im going to take the server and pull the hard drive and put it into an enclosure for         you  The computer itself is garbage but the hard drive may be OK  This way if you need any files off        of it you can plug it in like a keydrive and find what you need    Him Sounds good to me although Im not sure anyone has used it so it may not even be needed anymoreI took the server home and sure enough the motherboard was shot and I didnt have a replacement I could put in so I gave him the hard drive after I had confirmed it was working in a USB drive sled enclosure Indiana Jones would be proud I unearthed an old MHz Pentium II computer running NT which had met its demise in the deep dark recesses of a crawlspace in a

campycapper,191,187,1oflip,847,Well I received a message from a user asking me to update my tales from Bob the most hated evil bastard teacher ever So I thought I would share what my last year has been like with him The back story comes into play here httpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsxevetheteacherfromhellAnd when I finally lost my shit at my administration because of them allowing Bob to continue his destructive warpath here httpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentszewihatebobpartiianupdateOver the last few years working as an IT guy in a public school system I have witnessed a destructive force of nature that feeds on technology and the tears of IT guys  The single greatest horrors I have endured have been at the hands of a maniac who is so selfdeluded that he believes he is a God among the technology professionals He teaches social studies and his name is Bob I hate Bob I left you last time with the glorious revolution that his technology was going to be pulled from his classroom Unfortunately that lasted only a very short time My administration quickly informed me that he is a long lasting and respected teacher and that my soul was worth less when compared to his teaching So I was forced to replace all of his technology and allow him to begin his process of torment yet again But to be fair he has learned many new things and has finally left some of his old destructive ways in the past I have not had a single cable cut in over a yearSo I will begin with the first story about how he crashed the entire network  We moved to a new system and I am no longer the network admin but I still run all the IT work throughout the school I just do not manage that network  It was a Wednesday and I had just made it home after a long day of teachingit workand my second job They pay teachers and it guys junk so I work other things when I received a distressed message from the new Network manager His entire domain was crashing because our site was pulling so much bandwidth I knew exactly what the problem was right away but not before I got blamed for wiring something wrong or using our network to pirate material  I had to come back to the campus late at night so that he could load up my desktop and view what I was running Of course I had nothing running I do not pirate nor utilize pirated material at work as that would be really stupid After that I made him walk with me to Bobs classroom In his infinite wisdom Bob had found a spare cable in his classroom and decided to plug it into the two unused network outlets We removed all switches from the classrooms and built a network closet and installed tons of new outlets It is beautiful So Bob had created a giant loop in the network and crashed the entire domain This was only the third day of the year That was only the beginning By the end of the first week I was reminded that Bob has a master key to the entire building and even at my request it was not taken from him I have an IT storage closet where my entire wonderful well organized inventory sits waiting to be placed into classroom or utilized throughout the school It is not a big closet but it is mine mine mineI had organized the supplies in the closet the day before so that I could install a couple of smart boards and run wiring for projectors Now I am a bit particular when it comes to technology my cables are organized my drawers are organized and everything is inventoried so that I know where it is and what I have Then comes Bob I do not know if he comes in at midnight in a drunken rage and has a personal vendetta against me or if his mental capacity is limited in another form but he is a nightmare When I came to work the next morning I immediately went to my closet to grab the well placed supplies for the day and begin work Went I opened my small IT closet an avalanche poured from its interior Bob needed a monitor cable and decided he had the authority to grab it out of my closet himself It was if a tornado had entered into the room got in a fight with a flock of angry ducks and shot with a smoothbore canon  Cables that were hanging from hooks were in giant knotted balls lying underneath brand new projectors that had computer towers thrown on top of them Every drawer in my cabinets was left open with the contents appearing as if someone threw my grandmothers mixer on high speed inside them It was chaotic and he was still without the monitor cable He stated he could not find it and that I should make it easier for the teachers to find the pieces that they need I now have a master lock on my closet and a lock on all of my drawers What boggles the mind on top of the filing cabinet was a tub with clearly marked on side monitor cables But wait there is more There is always more with Bob God damn it I hate Bob This is the story of the missing computer and Bobs gifting I was called in one days to Bobs classroom something was not working appropriately which is normal in a school setting  a plugin needed to be updated for the material he was using As I walked into his classroom I was immediate struck by that feeling that something was off I just could not put my finger on exactly what it was Now whenever I am called into a classroom it is without fail more problems than just the initial request So I expect to spend a good  minutes dealing with a variety of small problems Like Bobs headphones have stopped working so he tried to splice two headphones together so kids can sit on one computer and listen to the same lecture But as I am sitting on a computer dealing with a broken mouse and failed Java update it finally clicks in me one of my computers is missing To be specific the entire setup is missing I immediately grew concerned as no technology is supposed to leave the classroom that I have assigned  without my permission Now Bob has a habit of giving things to other teachers that he thinks will help them so I assume that he has done this with the computer When I asked Bob what had happed he informs me that the computer was not working so he gave it to a student to take home and fix Holy hell the words escaped me I wanted to cuss and raise hell about how incredibly stupid it is to send a brand new computer home to a student or even that it could be dangerous to do that but I am out of energy Bob has beaten me I track the student down he had the computer going on for a week or so When I finally got it returned the student had removed capacitors from the motherboard and opened up the hard drive and PSU I never learned what was actually wrong with the computer as it went straight to the trash Bob will retire in two years He is old and will hopefully die a few years after that When it happens I will dance on his grave and decorate his tombstone with cut network cables and broken motherboards May the devil see him in hell where he will be troubleshooting his own stupidity for all eternity I hate BobTLDR My existence is full of

mallorywilkerson,27,22,1oflir,96,I recently was moved from my School Districts main IT office to a position that deals mostly with Nutrition Services My School District is TINY so I personally dont know why Nutrition needs their own person but I have a lot of idle time and no one mindsAnyway I managed to convince the Director of Nutrition My boss in this scenario to buy all new computers for the kitchens and offices The old computers were absolute shit and the old person who used to be a sub kitchen workeruntrained IT person with no fucking standards Naming convention whats that Tape a monitor together instead of replacing it with one of the five in my office Thats just how I rollWhatever thats happening Im almost done Just one school left to replace and two office computers which is great because its fall break and I have tons of time Nutrition Assistant Director emailed last Monday to tell me to work with the old IT slug of a woman to set these upMallory and SlugWith the schools out next week I would like the two of you to work together to get the new computers installed at the sites I realize we are waiting on the RJ cables but I am hopeful that they will be in by next week Please send me a list of schools that still need replacement so I can get an idea where we stand I know Slug is planning on being out on Friday so that gives us Mon Thurs to work with ThanksWere waiting on these weird RJ to USB cables to come in but they arent essential to the replacement process I replied to tell her I only had one school scheduled to be done this weekall the rest were basically done And are done now I have just one school left as plannedNo replyTo throw some fun into the mix were up for some audits so theres a chef boot camp here Today Tuesday and Wednesday I was notified of it on Wednesday of last week via email with NO dates or times or specifics on equipment The Nutrition Services secretary cant get it in her head that I am not part of Central IT and for some stupid political reasons cant access their work order systemdont have one of my own Ive told her many times that when she puts in a work order it goes to someone entirely unrelated to meNutrition and I have no way of knowing it exists or what it says Well Secretary put in a work order and I only learned it existed because the IT Guy responsible for the Blah Blah campus emailed her on Wednesday and CCd me to sayCan you please provide a list of what AV equipment youre looking to use for this training  The Blah Blah Campus doesnt have a guest network so I am unable to provide a guest log in at this time  Can you also provide more info on what is needed here  If a district computer can be used it will have access to the wireless networkThanksWhat the fuck Secretary I reply to all saying Im sorry for the confusion but we dont need any equipment Thank you for letting us know about the guest network It has always been this wayNo guest network at Blah Blah Campus Always since the schools were built and I worked in Central ITDirectly after that I got another email from Nutrition Assistant DirectorMalloryDid you make a plan with Slug to get all of the schools replaced next weekLet me knowI emailed back to say I actually didnt think wed have anything to work on together because Ive done all but one simple schoolFucking crickets for two days I plan on coming in on Monday at my usual  am time and setting up for the  am meeting time that I only found out via someone elses shared Outlook calendar thank you Secretary No mention of whats needed so I planned on bringing all I had my projector cart screen and master key to the classrooms that are kitted out with all this as well Covering all bases I can pm Friday two and a half hours after I leave for the day Nutrition Assistant Director emailsMalloryIf you havent already email Slug with your schedule for replacing school computers next weekIt was outside usual hours so I didnt replySunday morning I get woken up by a phone call from my boss The boot camp came a day early and they need access to a guest network I told herSecretary and I got an email from the IT Guy that runs Blah Blah campus saying there is no guest network but a district laptop can connect to the wirelessThanks again Secretary I can always count on you Boss says Well Ill email the Central IT Director to see about thatShe emails the Central IT Director thisHiI am working with BootCampPeople and DepartmentofEducation today Monday and Tuesday they need to have access to the Internet  Per Mallory that is not possible at Blah Blah Campusis

ENUMBERThank youMallorys BossI wasnt CCd on this email or anything I had to find out about it through someone elseAt pm on Sunday boss texts to ask me come in an hour early on Monday because the BootCampPeople have moved the time up Yay She also emailed this nonsense two minutes later in response to an email I sent to only her on Thursday It was letting her know I was beginning work on her new computer and that I planned to install These Programs could she let me know if I missed anything essentialMalloryNutrition Assistant Director said that you might be able to set up my new work station this week  Please move everything over that is on my old computer to the new one  Do not delete anything we can go over everything next week and remove anything that I dont want  I also am suppose to be getting  screens do you have my new screen and the thingy that connects them  I will see you in the morningGives an idea of what Im working withAt  pm my roommate who happens to be the Active Directory Admin gets an email from his boss Central IT DirectorAD AdminRoommate could you take care of this Blah Blah campus situation tomorrow am This will require early actionCentral IT DirectorWrite it on your heart that every day is the best day of the yearChinese fortune cookie From iPadThat email signature is real btw And the email was a forward of the email from My Boss which is the only reason I know that email existsAD AdminRoommate repliesCentral IT DirectorIm not sure I will be able to help There is no guest network at the Blah Blah campus how would you like me to go about this I am not aware of a way of granting guest internet access at the Blah Blah Campus so the only thing I can think to do is put them on Kindle or Apple Kindle might be better so we can remove them later Let me know what youre thinkingAD AdminRoommateHe got no reply that evening despite sending the reply immediatelyToday I came in at  am and realized my Outer Door Master key works on only one door on the entire building where my office is located Im in an office inside a school I ran around the building until I found a good door then got my presentation cart and started the walk The building I needed to be in is one of the five  schools on my campus Its about  mile walk through the necessary ramps and paths one has to wheel a cart through I like to walk the paths on my breaks so I tracked it on my pedometerI got into the building with the presentation and wheeled my set up into the conference room to find everything is set up already So is another classroom IT Guy ignored my email set everything up anyway and neglected to inform me But one presenter guy did need an  inch audio cable for sound to come out of this iPod dock he brought with him Now in this recent department change my boss supplied me with a desk some shelves all those new computers but nothing else I asked for other things and got nothing due to budget constraints The presentation kit I have is even on loan from central IT I have NOTHING in my office but the kit spare keyboards old monitors and a printer I can shop for parts but was essentially destroyed by a heat box I tell the presenter I dont have anything on me but I can try to scour some classrooms in hopes of finding something I didnt find anything This is probably because the projectors have speakers built in and the teachers use those without fuss but this guy was just hoping to use his dock and didnt bring a cable with him for whatever reason My boss was upset by this She then informed that she wants the guest network set up and that Central IT Director called her at  pm last night and promised AD AdminRoommate would have it set up for her I walked my cart back to my building and tried to double checked my office for a cable but the front doors to my building were still locked and I had to run back around the lawn to the side door and through the gym like the journey this morning with the addition of going through the lobby back through the front doors so I could wheel my cart in Oh they joys of being earlyIts  am now two and a half hours before AD AdminRoommate is supposed to be inI text AD AdminRoommate and ask him what he thinks Turns out he got this email at  am from Central IT DirectorThe kindle sounds okay for this time  Could it be setup with time an expiration date  Would it work setting them up in the BYOD Something to think about Or should we think about a limited guest login in District Name  That login could have an expiration datetimeLets talk with Network Admin about this one today I am sure as the student center or other buildings at Blah Blah Campus are used more and more for community events this will come up againNow this Blah Blah campus has been around for years and school has been in session for months Why this is a new conversation is due to the Central IT Director having no idea how his department works Keep in mind he isnt even talking to the Network Admin in this email AD AdminRoomate texts me to tell me to get the computers MAC Addresses and send them to the Network Guy Network Guy wont be in the office for another  minutes Its  am at this point I explained to the presenters I can add them to one of our networks but I will need to get their MAC Addresses  out of  decline because whatever I got two peoples addresses and emailed them to the only two people who have the ability to add them Network Admin and IT Guy for Blah Blah Campus and I CCd the Central IT Director I waited for a reply And waited Boss was staring at me as if my sitting down and waiting for reply was hindering the process even though I explained that the Central IT Department doesnt even open its call line until  am and their people start arriving between  and  am  am I get a text from AD AdminRoommate saying this is the magical hour they decided to set up a guest network and heres the password No official email response from anyone else in the department until  amPresentation ended at  am No one told me until I gave them all the password Luckily it will help them tomorrow and Wednesday but today I get to look like a fail whale I might be paranoid but when I have to stand in front of someone who knows me as The IT person and tell them Well theres actually an IT Department that regulates the buildings and I am not a part of it so I have no control over this particular situation They for some reason didnt have a guest network an hour ago but they have one now and you can use it Yes I no longer need your MAC address I feel like people look at me like Im lying to cover my ass I mean the story is asinine But at least its mostly over Just before I started writing this I got an email from Assistant Director of NutritionMallorySlug is ready to assist you with replacing all school computers Where will you start will it be First school in alphabetical orderI replaced that school first weeks ago I wish I could punch someone right now Bonus picture of ruined

Spignificant Productions                                                  present                              Here Comes the Bastard Crushing Hopes and Dreams    Two weeks into my new job and already I was slammed with things to doOur ticket queue was at  on any given day which was fine We usually had it reduced to  or less at the end of the day as is between me and the other officebased tech A lot of it was the techs using it as a reminder system for work they were doing tooOne of our major clients a religiously affiliated high school had ordered   yes   Dell Latitude STE slate PCs xbased Windows  Pro tablets without consulting usUsTheir IT firmლಠ益ಠლNevertheless we got in on it and ripped their Dell rep a new one for telling them that one of the big points only available in Win Enterprise would be in Win Pro As a result Dell comped us a MAK for  Win Enterprise licenses plus the services of a project firm to get all the tablets reimaged and deployedIt fell to me to get the image created and after a night of cursing and swearing since they were UEFIonly and couldnt boot to PE or Win off their flash drives  and yes I tried a lot UEFI only likes signed things and FAT  I cursed swore and built a WinPE  boot USB with the Win installer and all the drivers slipstreamed in An hour later I had my install and over the next day I nurtured and crafted it into an image for the tablets complete with pervasive branding lock screens Default user profile branding default home pages et cetera Office  Enterprise was installed again activation MAK So nice the programs they wanted GloBible and a few others were installed and I tweaked the HELL out of it to go even faster than it shouldWhen I was satisfied with the gold master image a Dell tech and I sat down the next morning created a WIM from it and split it to allow it to fit on the FAT flash drive booting via UEFI remember GB isnt half bad for a Win image especially with Office installed We handed it off to the imaging company confident that theyd fuck it up somehowBOY WERE WE RIGHTWe got them back and there had been a second local admin account added No matter we thought wed fix itThen we found out that the faculty and administration wanted a whitelist for the Windows StoreThis isnt possible normally Sure Applocker will let you block apps from running or downloading thats fine We had our GPO in development for that They didnt want them to even SEE apps that are PG or higher on the store T or higher for you ESRB people This had never been done supposedly and wasnt even supported by MicrosoftSure enough some sysadmin in North Carolina had done it for his district and Dell was desperately trying to hire him We got in contact with him to mirror his setup which worked pretty well It also implemented by the by web filteringAt any rate I digressThe tablets were imaged rolled out to the students at the high school and on launch day we disabled the local admin accounts on the PCs via a single psexec command psexec assetlisttxt net user LOCALADMINNAMES activeno where assetlisttxt contained the list of every tablet name exported from AD as CSV copypastad from Excel into Notepad Due to a scheduling quirk and the sysadmin who was supposed to apply it being out for a few days we didnt have the AppLocker whitelist GPO rolled out but we had the Windows  management VM in place with the whitelisted apps installed and the GPO was configured and ready to be linkedI was sitting at the office listening to Tears for Fears on Pandora and enjoying coffee and the schools tech called me in a panic Jack whats going on there Kids are downloading apps here Theyve got Angry Birds on some tablets Ive seen Netflix on others and one kid has pulled  gigs over the Internet connection Didnt you roll out AppLocker yetI sighed and got up from my chair Cool your shit Skeezix Im on my way to the high school Ill see you there in  A few clicks later I was in the management VM inside the Group Policy editor I linked the GPO to the Student Tablets OU then thought about somethingGPupdate takes too long to check in and apply I tapped a finger on my chin I have an ideaAfter a quick drive to the school I met with the tech in the cafeteria where lunch was being served The kids were crowded around the ones whod gotten their tablets and a few were watching Netflix one even had Breaking Bad on I resolved to torrent that show when I got home that night The tech was running his hands through his hair in frustration and I smirkedSo what are we going to do he said resignation evident in his voice Theyre saturating the Internet connectionWell its easy I replied launching X on my phone and RDPing into the management VM which Id left a dialog box up on The GPO is deployed and linked its active We need them to check in and update the GPO The easiest way is to take the tablets and restart them Thats not an option for these overprivileged little brats though  remember what happened last week when we locked out all Apple devices thanks to them oversaturating BOTH Internet connections downloading iOS  on release dayAt his nod I flipped my phone around him and showed him the window up on the VMJack what does shutdown i doThe target machine dialog had the list of every deployed tablet and the message AH AH AH YOU DIDNT SAY THE MAGIC WORD in the comment field with it set to restart with no warning to the usersPush the button Frank I said with a smirk ripping off Dr Forrester and he tapped the OK button and kicked off a restart on every tablet in the schoolA minute or two later the students were in an uproar when their tablets restarted and the nonwhitelisted apps  Netflix Pandora and the like  returned the message This app has been blocked by your system administratorWe stepped over to the microphone and speaker system that Id asked the tech to bring in there before I arrived and tapped the mic to ensure it was liveAttention students I said my voice echoing over the cafeteria We apologize that your tablets rebooted without warning and that you didnt have a chance to save your work The last word was said with clear snark Please note that when your parents signed the agreement to let you all have the tablets you agreed not to install applications As such weve just removed that temptation from you since some of you cant be trusted You know who you areThe clamor and ragefilled yells started up We also would like to point out that the agreement included you all not trying to bypass security restrictions So think twice before you try to do what we know youre going

MarkAsread,34,52,1obrsi,200,I was contracting as a webdev at a Californian media company which was trying to reinvent itself as a digital trendspotter They wanted to be the firm with their finger on the pulse of the Kids and how they used the Social MediasThey wanted a project which would be amazing lend itself to infographics and establish them as the Guys Who Really Knew Their Stuff The MD was going to stand in front of a big crowd about six weeks from now and wow them with some Big Data on a big screenWhere was the Big Data coming from They reached out to a local university which liked to get its logo on things like this and conceived of The Great Online Photography Project of  What we were going to do was download and analyse information from a website used by The Kids to share their photos Lets call it OutstagramThe university sent along a seriously geeky guy to the meetings His English was halting and a bit random but his glasses were impressively thick and his hair was impressively unkempt Anyone could tell he was a hardcore geek He had created The SystemThis guy who well call  whats a typical Chinese name Well call him Nelson Nelson had apparently devised a way to download all Outstagrams data for the whole of its history a webstartupimpressive three entire years All you needed to do was draw a rectangle on a trickedout Google Map and it would immediately ship you bulkcontainerloads of JSON He talked breezily about downloading whole citiesworth of data  We would then slice and dice this data to provide amazing insights  People in San Francisco take a lot of photographs in the morning People in LA take a lot of photographs in the evening People in San Diego take  of their photographs on the beach Anyone who so much as mentioned Brand X a major client could be identified crossreferenced with FriendFace and their behaviour tracked in a laughably innocent preSnowdenera kind of a way Who knew what amazing and highly monetizable insights could be drawn from these masses and masses of dataThe only teeny tiny possible problemette I could see with this plan was  it couldnt be done As soon as Id got back to my desk Id had a look at Outstagrams welldocumented API and you definitely couldnt do that No rectangles No slurping down of data in bulk a couple of pages of historical data was considered fair use There were legal notices saying you couldnt do it There was documentation saying you couldnt do it I even saw people asking in official Outstagram discussion groups how to do it and being told definitively that they couldnt by Outstagram company employees After all if you could do that you could simply take a copy of Outstagrams entire database which currently had them valued at eleventynine squillion dollarsSo I explained all this to the Project Manager who said and I quote Dont come to me with problems Mark come to me with solutions Nelson must know what he was talking about I guess I must have misinterpreted the API doco  and the specific legal restrictions  and the terms and conditions and the comments in the forum and well all common sense and logicI wrote to Nelson and asked him for a sample of the data preferably from way back in the Cretaceous Period of Outstagram history or as you and I call it It probably should have tipped me off that he sent me the sample data in a BMP fileNot a steganographically encoded innocentlooking BMP file in which the data was surreptitiously interwoven into the wallpaper A BMP file straight from Paint with screenshot of the JSON data in his Command Prompt window because he apparently didnt know how to export the data to file by doing some command gt samplejsonBut never mind I could read the data and I could see that he did indeed have data from way back in  when dinosaurs roamed the social media earth Data from a specific location That location being the San Diego Hair and Makeup Expo June  Oh great He wasnt stupid He was just deluded Having extracted information by location and accepting any folksonomic technical term meaning pulled out of your ass definition anyone with a smartphone wanted to use for location he had indeed got information all the way back to  For that one Location which had only existed for three days in the minds of some hairdressers in  hed got his allotted couple of pages of data and extrapolated from this that he could get any amount of data for any date for any locationI let the manager know this but once more before Id even finished my explanation of what false positive meant I was told not to come up with problems Only solutions I was a geek Nelson was a geek Talk to him and sort it outI tried to take this feedback on board and sat down for a conference with Nelson Who knows maybe hed found a way to game the system Maybe I was missing something Lets give the guy a chance How exactly did his system workHe started drawing on a legal pad Take a given rectangle with coordinates AB top left and CD bottom right Now we start looking for Outstagram data We start at AB Is there any Outstagram data found at this point We grab any available data then we move on We add one metre to A and start looking for Outstagram data at coordinates A B Is there any data at this point And repeatNever has the phrase Im going to stop you there been uttered with more trepidationJust to be clear I continued temporarily holding back my urge to weep hot salty tears of despair Your method of processing a given rectangle is to add an enormous number of latlongs to it and poll Outstagram repeatedly to see if it knows anything about each latlong And any given rectangle  km by  km has precisely  of these dots He nodded cheerfully Finally I understood the true brilliance of The System But possibly it would be  because he wasnt sure if it was zerobased or notThats very  thorough So how long did it take you to download the data for the whole city the first timeYou should probably stop reading now if you expect this story to have a happy endingOnly now thirty days away from the due date of the project did I discover that Nelsons System had never actually not really not what youd call truly run as such It had run for about five minutes on his laptop just to test it outFaced with the choice of a going back to the managers with this new and suicidally depressing information or b being a Team Player who Came Up With Solutions Not Problems I wimped out We put the system into production Im not really a Java guy but Ive got the general idea We rented some cheap Tomcat space from a helpful hosting provider uploaded a WAR file roughly the size of a BluRay disc deployed it drew some conservative rectangles around downtown and hit Go At least Nelson assured me it was the Go button because many of the system labels were still in ChineseShortly after this we got some emails from the service provider Shortly after that we got some text messages from the hosting provider And shortly after that we got some phone calls from the service provider The System was using  of its allocated system resources everything else on that server had ground to a halt and it had filled up its disk quota after ten minutes Because of course of all possible ways to store the data MongoDB was the best Straight from JSON to disk amirite What could possiblye go wrongAnd this is the moment when I found out that not only hadnt Nelsons system ever really run but also that it wasnt Nelsons systemNelson was more what youd call a system Designer Hed determined how the Google Maps interface should look and how the information once retrieved should be displayed The guy whod actually coded the system was another guy who well call oh I dont know whats another typical chinese name  Edwin And Edwin wasnt around He was in a country well call China because thats its name for a festival well New Year see above We werent sure of his phone number but we definitely had his email somewhere And in case you missed it no The System had never actually run except in very limited testsWe upgraded the hosting account then upgraded it again Twice We were now on the Double Super Premium Platinum Ultimate Executive hosting plan and still the CPU and disk were barely keeping up The System to put it politely had some issues And more to the point as management reluctantly began to realise it wasnt retrieving the data they thought it would and it never wouldAt last they had come to see Id been right about this all along And to their credit there was an instant and substantive change in their attitude to me At the next meeting they didnt say Dont come to me with problems come to me with solutions They said Can you please let us know all the usernames and passwords for all the systems youve set up or worked on Thanks and scheduled a meeting with HR for  PMI cleared my desk logged out of everything and said goodbye to my deskneighbours in anticipation I was being let goAnd once again I

HereticKnight,12,16,1obnlt,83,Short time lurker first time poster This story is not one of use error its about the mistakes we occasionally makeBackground In college I had worked the campus helpdesk and through hard work eventually became the lone assistant to our twoperson desktop systems team This meant that even though the college paid me the standard student worker wage of hour I had admin access to the web interface that gave us full control of all the campus machines in order to do my jobOne of my first unsupervised assignments was to go to one of our labs and run a script on the machines there It could be done remotely but involved rebooting later in the process so I needed to make sure any students saved their work I arrive open up the web interface and start carefully preparing the command I needed to run You can see where this is goingOne of the fields is of course the name of the script to run I type in the first few letters and it suggests the possibilities I tap the down arrow a few times and without thinking tapped Enter For a moment I saw the page that said Command Confirmed then the computer began to reboot I look around Every other computer in the lab is rebooting as well The command I wanted didnt cause a reboot Oh Fuck What did I doThen it hits me like a blow to my gut A memory floated to the forefront of my thoughts It was of the command page and near the bottom a small checkbox calmly labelled Apply to all machines It is selected by default I couldnt remember if I had unchecked itHeart Attack Mode EngageImmediately visions of unemployment were upon me Thousands of computers could be effected The daemons had been given their orders to follow without question and it was too late to stop them Had I in a moment of weakness unleashed damnation upon the campusI sprint into a neighboring room and no rebooted to be seen Fortunately I had already told the page to only run on the machines in the one lab and had unchecked the evil checkbox of evilEqually fortunate was that everyone in the lab had saved their work recently so no data was lost The command I had given was the first one on the list of potential commands which was simply to reboot with the mouse and keyboard disabled No damage done and easily reversible I gave myself a minute to catch my breath and fixed everything without further incidentThat incident made me far more careful in dealing with the interface and ultimately made me a more deliberate better worker I never had another incident like that again and was praised for my good work that followed Better to screw up small early than screw up big later rightTLDR  Pressed a wrong key while using a campuswide administration tool Just about anything could have happened and the vast majority of them would have been terrible but I lucked out and only reboot the machines in the lab I was in Also its a poor design choice to have scripts default to executing on every machine at onceAnyway I know you guys must have interesting tales to share Free humility for all,1381623572.0,We dont goof often but when we do,99,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

Smallwater,7,32,1obnqg,74,So I posted here beforehttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsorgllightsonrouterout about me not being in any field of IT I am however in college for IT which all the fellow students in my dorm translate to computer wizard  Now most of the new students people who just moved in the dorm ask everyone they meet in the first month what they do which is normal to ask And one of them lets call her User immediately jumped the chance when she me say heard IT  Oh could you help me Im trying to set up a wireless network but I dont know how to do that  Sure thing The way I see it I do know how to do that and if I can make someone happy with  minutes work why the hell not  Now as the title says this wasnt a  minute job Partially my fault partially because of a problem between the keyboard and the chair and later on partially another idiots fault Lets start with my fault  For the more conservative among you I apologize beforehand I am in college and some products get used Now a disclaimer where I live it technically is legal to posess and use marijuana for personal use  That particular night we made was brownies Special brownies Yes the ones that make you go wheeeeee So I ate a piece along with some friends when User came to join the party We make some small talk and she mentions the router  Well I didnt have anything important to do then so I said lets go fix that sucker Bad idea I went to her room and sat down at her desk and everything was spinning Im talking walls turning voices tuning out a fullon trip I took a look at the router and noticed a Postit retrospectivly Im surprised I even noticed it with scribbled on it some IP adresses to configure the router and the networks name No problemo just let me connect it to the PC type in the IP and Crap No game it cant find the page  By now my addled brain was trying to find out why it couldnt find the page I checked the cables barely checked the power and everything is as it should be I try to search the network on the PC but I cant find it I check the power again but its all there I say something about resetting the router and reconnect the power cable  Right User piped in someone else also told me to do that  I managed to ask her who told her to do that The lady at the helpdesk  Wait what  What did you do to reset it exactly I asked  Oh I just pressed the button User responded  Stoned me thought she ment the power button so I pay no heed to it and I continued to try to reconnect to the router and checking its power I was really out of it so it took me a quite a while to figure out that instead of just pulling out the power cord every time I could just use the power button So I started looking for the power button  Huh No power button  Uhm User where is the power button you pressed  Huh What power button  And here we come to the second part of the problem I facepalmed internally when she showed me how she resetted it With a paperclip Folded open  You see what Im getting at here Oh yes she resetted the router alright By pressing the reset button  Goddammit  Now I must admit I was rather defeated by a mere wireless router I blame it on being in a higher atmosphere but that doesnt change the fact that I failed miserably  I apologized I couldnt help her told her shed fucked the router and then apologized because I was in no state to fix this I wasnt even able to tell the time on my smartphone and I couldnt remember how to get into a defaulted router I told her Id look into it the next day    Enter the third part of the problem Convinced I wasnt good enough to fix it she brought in her ex Who she claimed was also a tech wizard so lets call him Mr Tech Wizard or Mr TW  But even he couldnt figure out the devils machine I came in while he was trying to get it to work and I talked to User a bit about school and other things while he fiddled around I looked over to the tech wizard who was working in IE what Firefox is right next to it and saw he still wasnt finished He says its broken as he cant connect to the router I take a closer look and see he has the router connected to the PC but from the wrong port on the router By now I was surprised he hadnt installed a Bing searchbar yet  I tell him to move connect everything correctly connect to the now suddenly visible default network type in the magic IP and set the thing up I test the connection but I still havent got a internet connection  Mr Tech Wizard almost gloated over the fact that I still couldnt get User internet but that stupid smirk was quickly wiped off his face as I noticed the little yellow triangle next to the wifi bars No valid IP  Alright I opened up the properties of the wirelss adapter and checked the IPv properties And there was the problem right there Mr TW changed the default IP to  in the hope it would magically connect to the router I switched to automatically obtain IP and suddenly Google was able to pop up Glory for me ignoring exGF for Mr Tech WizardLooking back I do think that I cockblocked that guy who was hoping to score some merit points with his ex but then again dont say you can fix it if you have no idea what youre talking

OfficerNelson,63,63,1o8vfm,338,This is a bit of a nontraditional angle on tech but the job is called theater tech so have fun readingI currently work in a theater as a lightboard operator This means I get to generally forego the pains of dealing with customers so much so that I sit in a black room and most of the time play video games with the soundboard op The job is supposed to entail two things programming the board during tech not as fun as you think  the lighting designer literally tells you the commands you need to put in and running the board during shows again not as fun as you think  modern lightboards run cue sheets which allow you to press GO whenever the stage manager says go and it handles fades scrolls etc automaticallyDuring preshow the most exciting part of my job occurs  dimmer check This means in essence gambling with the theater gods to see if any of your lights are burnt out today One particular day about a week ago I run the dimmer check and joy of joys  all of the lights were working This means its time to weasel out of vacuuming the floor cleaning the green room etc by setting up my laptop and poking around TFTS until the soundboard op gets to the booth and we can fire up some Civ IVTypically a booth operator can see the show by way of a window For this show the theater arrangement was flipped backwards so the set was directly obstructing our view As a result everything we did required the assistant stage manager ASM to report everything over the headsets As with every night my dimmer check involved two things  pulling up all lights and going down to check them all then pulling up each channel individually and the ASM reports good or whatever problem there is for each oneTonight though something went horribly terribly atrociously wrongThe soundboard op and I get through the first cues and hes screwed me over by surrounding me with cities within the first few turns All of a sudden the stage manager SM comes on headset and whisperscreams that the scrollers are showing green Bad news Very bad Color scrollers are boxes where the color gel overlay would normally go which runs through a stitchedtogether series of different color gel overlays so different scenes can have different color washes without multiple lights or expensive LED cansI check the cue sheet the scrollers should be red Indeed the board is outputting the correct color code I confirm with the ASM that they were running correctly during dimmer check they were I try to bump the scrollers back into the right color  no luck Remember I cant actually see the scene so I have no idea what is going on and the soundboard op is waiting for me to finish my turnThere is no scene where the scrollers are green I can only imagine the poor confused actors roaming around in a sea of green reserved for the strangest of shows In fact Ive never seen it used Ever But lest we not forget the  rule bestowed on me as a lightboard op  never fuck with the lights during a show My predecessor didnt heed this warning and accidentally overwrote the patch data plunging the whole theater including the lobby into total darkness during a show until a backup could be restoredSo there I sat too scared to break the rule and too worried to sit around doing nothing I kept frantically scrolling through cue sheets patches channels everything trying to see if there was something that wasnt right NothingIntermission arrived The ASM broke out a ladder and climbed up to check the scrollers While up there he confirmed that the power was on indicated by an LED on the back Still no luckWe considered the fact that the motor might have burned out but that wouldnt explain why all would have burned out at the same time Regardless we broke out some replacements plugged them in and tested  no diceAt this point we were desperate The audience was mingling its way back in I heard that one particularly tough customer had demanded her money back for the botched performance I was told we would have to disable the scrollers for the remainder of the show which would leave us with only white Not much betterThen the ASM had the bright idea of sending me back into the patch room and check the cables This is a cramped room where all of the wires from the lights get plugged into individual dimmers which are chained together into a series of DMX splitters which are then sent to the board  basically a network although unidirectional And in a xx ft room not conducive to human visitorsSo lets start checking cable connections Never mind the fact that people are waiting for the show to resume  weve got to reseat every possible cable since the master electrician failed to provide any sort of documentation on which cables are which patchesA good  minutes later I crawl out covered in dust cobwebs and a variety of unspeakable substances only to find that all of my work was for naught Up to the booth I trek defeated and helpless I reluctantly parked the scroller lights at  and we continued the show Fortunately I was spared the horror of the nonworking color wash although I still lost that damn Civ roundFast forward one last time to postshow The audience is pouring out equally disappointed in my failed handiwork The stage manager begins to berate me but in a Hollywoodquality show of depressed selfdisappointment I subconsciously convince him to leave me be while I carry out what I secretly believed to be my final postshow dutiesCue ASM ASM is not so pleased but not how I had expected him to beASM You dont know what the hell youre doing and Ive had enough of it Well be bringing in a new op for tomorrows show technicaldirector will call you tomorrowMe I recall you were the one who advised me that the scrollers were working From my position I was under the impression that there were no problemsASM Just do your postshow and get outI wasnt going to let it go that easily This was a competitive job given the high salary and our job requirements play video games and push a button every few minutes which was much more appealing than those of the burger flippers across the street earning hour I refused to be fired for something that I could not even see was happeningPostshow done I call up the master electrician for the show After yelling at me for a few minutes for waking him up it was around  AM this occurredMe We had a problem with the scrollers None of them were runningME capitalization matters kids Did you check the boardMe Everything was workingME And you checked the power and patchesMe At the expense of my clothes yesME So the scrollers are on theyre plugged in and theyre not scrollingMe Thats rightME Good luck then handsetstateONHOOKGreat Time to face the music I guess Postshow duties having been completed I headed down backstage to check in with the ASM for anything else not sure whether my termination had already taken effect ASM didnt have the authority to do so so I assumed notUpon reaching the ASMs post I noticed something strange  an orange extension cord hanging down against the wall unplugged It didnt dawn on me until the ASM walked back and picked up his phone  followed by a white cable terminating with a small white box in the wall socket next to the unplugged extension cord Could it really just have been that simple And the ASM already checked the power it was clearly on during intermission But then I realized  the ASM checked it using a flashlight Those LEDs arent designed to be bright since theyre on when the theater is pitch black If the ASM in his infinite wisdom shined the flashlight on the LED no he couldnt have been that dimASM You can go ByeI wasnt going to leave so easily I calmly walked around him reached down and unplugged his phone which prompted some serious complaints until I plugged the extension cable into the wall and the beautiful crinkling sound of scrollers scrolling echoed around the nowempty theater Then after a good  seconds of angered frowning at him while he slowly progresses from bitching to enlightened there was an even more thrilling sound which rocked me straight to my maliciously spiteful coreASM  oooohI smiled nodded once and leftI have yet to receive any

randommusician,24,18,1o8pya,82,Anyone who has spent a reasonable amount of time around theater people has probably come to the realization that at least from their point of view every theater anyone has ever performed in is haunted in some way       This theater was no exception it was a tiny theater on the second floor of a late th century brick house the bottom part of which had become a bar     The show in question was my first show with this particular theater company but the second show I had played for Im a pianist at that particular theater so I was already familiar with the ghost      The spirit seemed to like to manifest himself in the theaters lighting system  Periodically either during a dress rehearsal or performance something would randomly happen to the lights  Sometimes the house lights would come up sometimes there was a complete blackout and sometimes the lights would change to a random cue from no discernible part in the play  People had tried everything over the years from reinstalling the software used to do the light cues to straight up replacing the computer but to no avail  We clearly had a haunting on our hands not a technical issue    It is also worth mentioning that the technical directormanaging producer for this particular production was a girl well call Sarah      Sarah and I soon became rather taken with one anotherI with her because I have a terrible weakness for redheads and her with I because of my dashing good looks and roguish charm Or perhaps because she had been giving most of her spare time to a semiprofessional local musical production for several weeks at this point so I may have been the first male who was more of a cat person than a dog person she had been in close contact for a while if you know what I mean  Sarah also happened to work in a technical capacity for a hotel so she knew a bit about troubleshooting computers     Midway through the first act of the third performance with no one anywhere near the computer with the lighting software on it the house lights come up seemingly of their own free will  Its worth noting that the light cues were done manually for this show not run on a timer       Out of purely technical interest I assure you Sarah and I bravely volunteered to stay after the show and investigate the problem taking our chances alone in the room with the ghost      After many attempted fixes and much googling we are finally able to locate the problem  After a little over  seconds of run time  days the lighting program would crash itself going to the default whoever had programed the lights for that show had set either house lights a blackout or possibly the first scene they had created the lights for during tech week      Turns out that no one had ever thought to turn the computer off between shows or even to exit the lighting program      TLDR I am thy fathers spiritDoomd for a certain term to walk the night and crash after several days of runtimeEDIT removed a detail from the description of Sarahs day job she was uncomfortable with  Also Hi Sarah Didnt know you were on reddit,1381519756.0,The Tale of the Theater Ghost,100,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

goodBEan,27,27,1o2qkn,69,A little backstory a few months ago my sister bought a laptop for my  year old nephew thinking either birthday present or Christmas She asked me to setup a few things and make sure everything is good One of the things I did was setup my nephew as a standard user account and added a backup admin account as a precaution I shared the password with my brotherinlaw and it was all goodA few nights ago I was over at the house for a family get together I was asked to do a quick check on the laptop because it was running slow Figured alright since I was bored as hell So I updated a few pieces of software and checked a few things At one point I went to check to see the hard drive to see if it was fragmented Windows asked me for the admin password and I couldnt exactly remember it So the next conversation is when it all went down hill I was sitting on the kitchen table my brother in law was on the couch with everyone elseI changed the namesgt ME Hey Rob do you still have that email or paper with the admin password on it gt gt RobOh yeah the password is   keep in mind it was right in front of little billy and everyone heard itgt gt Billy really thats what that wasgt gt ME facepalm are you kidding megt gt Rob what its no big dealgt gt Mymother Its not like its the admin password for every computer in the family buisness that I was forced to give up oncegt gt mysister What you think somebody is going to hack in and steal his science paper on lama spitgt gt ME with even more of a wtf expression on my face you dont have a clueSo my family is kinda clueless about this sort of thing and thinks that there is no reason for anyone to go after us I could explain why its stupid to be that careless but they wouldnt listenBTW as a bonus before anything happened My  yr old nephew showed that he knows the password on mommys iphone,1381338877.0,Lets blurt out the admin password as loud as possible,96,TalesFromTechsupport,hot
atticusmas,11,20,1o39j1,37,Im a high schooler and I am on the IT team for a small prep school At the end of the day we start getting people saying the internet is broken This is not actually all that common so when it goes down we go into emergency mode Usually when the internet goes down it is for one of two reasons  either someone has decided to plug our ethernet back into itself due to extreme stupidity this happened many times or someone has plugged in their own router that starts assigning IP addresses to people on the network and confusion happens This is usually the case because a lot of parents and sometimes teachers want internet but dont have the password so they bring their own routerSo in either case we have to look around the entire building trying to find what the problem is Router is pinging fine so we dont think that is the problem We keep looking asking all the staff if they plugged in a router  nothing We go into the server room and see a lovely seizure of lights blinking on and off and on and off We try to log into the routerBut our password isnt working Were sure its the right password I suggest we try a default login like admin admin and it logs in Turns out all settings on the router decided to clear themselves for no reason We figure that the router just crapped out on us so we go and get a new routerWe spend a couple hours around looking at stores and eventually getting dinner and we buy some cheap Cisco small buisiness router and set it up Internet is pretty fast but logins are taking literally ten minutesWe dont know what to do at this point as it was around  then so we left In the morning our school tech admin looked at the settings again and we had accidentally set up our router to request logins towards our ISP which then went back to us causing the long wait TLDR Hours of work that wasnt necessary and could have been fixed in an hour max if we had a better system,1381350563.0,Router died at school for no reason queue six hours of work,57,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

TollhouseFrank,510,1174,1nzgin,2142,Another story from my magical job at that now closed dialup company  I had been at the company now for a year and a half or so was there slightly over  years and had become good friends with some of our regulars  aka repeat callers  If you have ever worked at a small company and have regulars you know how it goes  You see their phone number on the caller id and you know who it is and what the problem is before picking up the receiver  Some of the regulars were not so nice and were not friends  they were more like enemies to be treated politely so as to get them off the phone as fast as possible with as little stress as possibleOne of these repeat enemies  errrr callers  claimed to be a professor at a local college in its engineering department and all the time talked about the boost in spending after it got paired with a much larger college near the northern panhandle if you are from WV you already know which college it is  He was very snooty and because he was so smart had a Doctorate and taught a real discipline not a fake industry like IT that he was better than me and all the other techs  You could hear the disdain in his voice everytime he called  You could tell he thought we were beneath him and should service his every whimWell after dealing with him for months and his disdain over everything  even calling me a liar when I explained to him how noise on the phoneline interfered with the signal  I finally got the shocker of a call from him  As an explanation of the lie about noise on the lines  being an Engineer he was too smart to fall for the lies of interference and instead kept telling me how noise on the line wasnt possible because it was against Electrical Physics Properties or some such thing Anyway he calls in one day and claims to have a bought a new computer and wants us to walk him through setting up the connection  aka the only useful damn thing you retards can do  That is an exact quote from that call  After doing the usual steps and being ready to get him off the phone I tell him he will have to hang up to then dialin and try the service  But WAIT my friends he is an ENGINEER  He thought ahead  He was on his brand new Portable Mobility Enhancement Device  Crying inwardly I went into robot mode and waited as he tried to dial up  x  x  x  by the th attempt it was obvious he was getting no dialtone  I asked him to double check to make sure the phone cord was connected at the wall and at the computer  He got mad and cussed at me but then confirmed it was  I even had him unplugreplug both ends until he heard the click just to make sure it was firmly seated  After he tried again still no dialtone I concluded his pc had a bad modem from the factory it happens modems were throwaway devices and had terrible failure rates and as I was starting to suggest this he cut me off and stated the following gem of wisdomI dont need a modem  This new PC has a Universal Serial Bus port  I just flattened the end of the phone line with a pair of pliers and jammed it into that port  It is Universal so that means it will fit and use anythingI was stunned  Beyond stunned  He was a self proclaimed Engineer and Useful Member of Society and I was a Useless IT Retard  Yet to hear him admit to purposely mangling and misusing a phone jack and USB port I have no idea how he fit it in there even squished with a pair of pliers just floored me  At this point I just started laughing  It was all I could do  I laughed hard and long  The more he got mad and yelled and cussed at me the more I laughed  After a few minutes I calmed down enough to tell him to take his brand new computer to his IT Department on campus and have them explain to him why what he did wouldnt work  Later that month he sent a strongly worded letter to us asking us to disconnect him from the service because our dialup did not work with Universal Sandwiches  Yes a direct quote from his letterTLDR  USB will work with anything even if it doesnt fitEdit   To the detractors I cant count that high so I cant keep track of the upvotes  For everyone else  Thank you for the hilarious stories that are similar to this one,1381241232.0,IT is a Fake Industry,3316,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

yabossobay,40,28,1o04f2,247,Greeting TFTS as my first post I present to you some tales from my time so far as an IT in the USN over the past year or so I love my job and being in the navy as an IT provides for some interesting work environments and as you might guess some interesting users These all take place onboard a warship floating around in the middle of nowhereThe tale of the broken computer and my awesome bossThere is a particular group of users with the job title of OS Operations Specialist who just love to call the ITs whenever the most simple of problems arises The following is my favorite dealing with themgtOS Hey you need to get up here one of our computers is broken I cant do my jobgtMe Well whats the symptoms what do you see Any errorsgtOS No thats the problem I cant see anything on the screengtMe sigh here we go again Alright Ill be up there as soon as I canSo I get up there and the user shows me to the broken computer He turns around and goes off to speak to one of his OS buddies and leaves me to look into it The computer tower itself looks to be working or at least powered So its time to start checking cables I notice that the monitor LED power light is off standard monitor orange light being asleep blue meaning connected and powered onThere is no way they just dont have the power connected to the monitorI check around to where the monitor is plugged and find the surge protector Yep The slot where I presume it would normally be plugged into is instead occupied by one Iphone changer with the monitors power cord hanging next to itI fix his computer and go back to my shop to tell my boss what just happened After the story was told he said follow me I need to see this And together we both walk back up to the space the OSs work at We get up there and then this happenedgtBoss To me This the computergtMe YepgtBoss Proceeds to reunplug it again and turns to megtBoss When they call back down just come get me and ill handle itgtMe Um Aye ayeWe go back to our shop and not minutes later they call again telling me its still broken I pass the phone off to my boss as instructed and he saysgtBoss This is IT how can I help you sir or maamgtOS Yeah I just had your IT come look at our computer and its still brokengtBoss Yep I know He fixed it it was really an easy fix But I unfixed ItgtOS What why would you do thatgtBoss Very sternly Because your division wastes our time more than any other on the ship and we have actual important trouble shooting to do as well as comms to set up and we cant be dealing with your department all day Now im going to teach you how to trouble shoot ReadygtOS  yesgtBoss Alright pretend its your microwave in you house and it doesnt have any lightsor time displaying on it what the fuck would you check firstgtOS Uhhh see if its plugged ingtBoss There you go buddy Dont call us again without checking for stupid shitMade my entire day of course they still called about super easy things from time to time But significantly less nowOH GOD WORD IS EATING MY LETTERSSome of you have already guessed whats going on in this one I cant even be mad at this because as kids we were all very confused on what was going on when it happened to us writing essays in middle schoolYessir I speak of Overtype The thing that happens when you bump the insert key on accident and everything you were trying to type into the middle of that sentence is now typing over it instead I even knew what the problem was and so I trekked all the way forward from my IT shack and busted into their room Walked over to the affected computer and slammed that insert key with the force that only thousands of dollars of the Navys money and  months of school could provideAll in all it was a good dayThe tale of the great Outlook CalamityThis one has got to be my favorite story to tell about the thought process of users The user was very polite just not at all technically inclined and I dont personally mind that as long as they make an effort to learn which most doEnter monday just got underway and we have some new shipmates onboard Mostly shipriders temporary assigned to the ship for the duration of the deployment and so I get tasked with setting up their AD accounts and emails and such All completed without a problem easy day easy moneyA few hours later Grand Central Station the name we gave our main helpdesk phone rings ensuring us our day would not be without some fun trouble calls Being the closest I answergtMe IT speaking how may I help you sir or maamgtSRshiprider Yes good morning IT this is LT so and so I managed to log into my computer just fine but I seem to be having problems sending emailsgtMe Okay sir can you give me some symptoms on what outlook is doing for yougtSR I write my mail and then it just sits in the outbox and doesnt go anywhere Everyone says they arent getting my emails back on shoregtMe Oh okay sir give me a few minutes im on my wayOf course to me this sounds like outlook just lost connection to the exchange server simple reconnect should do it I check our server just incase and make sure its a localized problem and not network wide then head to the LTs space I even send a test email to see if he gets it when I get theregtMe Hello sir let me have a look and see what the issue isI see about  messages in his outbox like he said but he is still connected to the server AND my test email is sitting in his inbox Strange So I have him show me what he is doing to send his emails thinking it might be a plugin issue we have one that stalls outgoing mail sometimesHe shows me that he opens up an new message by clicking new message writes a few lines Good so farHe then hits save interesting but whatever maybe he likes to be safeCLOSES OUT OF HIS MESSAGE Goes to his DRAFTS and proceeds to CLICK AND DRAG the message into his Outbox foldergtwutgtMe  oh sir theres the issuegtSR What whats the mattergtMe Sir you have to actually hit send before closing out of your message you cant just drag it into your outboxgtSR ReallygtMe reallygtSR Oh thank you Ill try thatgtMe No problem sirAnd of course like any good IT I go back to my shop and tell them all the great thing that I just witnessedThanks for readingTLDR Even in the military most of my job experience could be used for an application for a babysitter but I love it sometimes,1381258319.0,The Tales of the

trn,28,35,1o0ats,156,I worked for a certain retail clipontie badge wielding IT provider for the better part of  years starting in   I had done PC repair since Windows  so Ive seen a bit of everything that normal humans do to computers  However during my stint in store and in home I ran across some very awkward and very rare circumstances  I hope this entertains disgusts and educates  Those years opened my eyes to the state of America and the consumerbased society we all know and loveThe Secret SauceIn store  End of shift  Two college age young men walk in with a closed laptop  They brandished a service plan and demanded a computer replacement on the spot  I began my typical diagnosis opening the laptop and attempting to power it on  AC Power nothing  Battery removed w AC nothing  No POST no lights  Keyboard is crunchy but that happens  Customer admits liquid damage  Okay Accidental Damage covers it  I start to unscrew keyboard to look for physical damage  I then get a whiff of spoiled beer  This leads to the final admission of I was drunk and threw up on the laptop  I calmly quarantined the unit and proceeded to wash off three layers of skin from my hands  They didnt get their replacementThe Redneck Mating DanceIn home repair of spyware what else do we ever get called in for  Trailer in BFE   wheeler cab in the gravel driveway pickemup truck on blocks in the front yard  I began doing my repairs in a house that looked far better on the inside than it did on the outside  A father mother baby and mystery tenant in the back room  My repair is almost complete  Computer is a complete loss and Im restoring to base image  Dad talking about how his daughter should find a nice smart guy like you  Im thinking how strange it is for him to be marrying off his  year old to me  Minutes later the actual daughter and progenitor of the baby and pregnant for a second time marches across the trailer after a shower in only a towel  Okay  I understand now  Minutes after that said daughter marches back across the trailer from her room very slowly and very pregnantly with only a wet white TShirt on and no undergarments to speak of  Father acts as if nothing happened and mother continues to chain smoke in front of granddaughter  I stopped making eye contact with anyone in that home and hastened my retreat from Defcon  to Defcon   PS  She wasnt bad lookingThe SelfInstallerIn store diagnosis  Man walks up and immediately starts using the biggest computer words he can to establish his dominance as Alpha Computer Owner Who Knows All  He produces a stick of RAM not matching the aftermarket brand of the memory box  Its OEM RAM  Box says Kingston  I explain that this isnt the RAM Im looking for  He agrees  He says I upgraded the RAM myself  I bought two modules and Im returning this  I conclude that the RAM came from the laptop itself  I tell him that he can keep the RAM from the laptop and he needs to give me the RAM module that he didnt need  The laptop was a Gateway with  expansion port  He tells me that he installed both  Curious I open the laptop and see the expanded RAM chip but I also see a mess of cracked plastic circuit board pieces and mounds of solder  He had removed the solderedin DIMM through use of copious kinetic force and then replaced the module with a solid line of solder across the contacts  I explained that he had ruined the computer and that he could have just bought a gb stick instead of xgb  He called me a liar stating that the computer worked fine before he brought it in here and me revealing the problem has ruined his  day old laptop  He demanded a comparable model and thus the battle between management and the customer ensued  He actually was given a new laptop  Made me sickThe Conspiracy TheoristIn store diagnosis  Man brought in computer telling me that his modam layman terms for the Internet didnt work anymore because someone hacked him  I was also told to fix it on the spot so he could watch me  Furthermore I was told that I could not under any circumstances take the machine online uhhh I kind of have to to prove that the fix worked  Explained that both of these concessions werent possible due to time required to fix the computer and necessity to test the fix  Rage ensues and the managers talk him down to an in store repair instead of depot repair  Several days later the repair is complete its a bad NIC  PCI NIC installed to bypass mobo NIC  He comes in and inspects his computer  He asks who provides our electricity and for how long I had the computer connected to power  The answer is I dont know Duke Energy and Its been plugged in since we started fixing it  More rage ensues because the government can use power lines to communicate to computers and theyve been working with Microsoft to build that into Windows XP  Okay  More rage ensues as he sees a dent in his case  Manager offers to replace case for free  Man rages more demanding to know why his computer wasnt locked in a cage when not in use  Asks if anyone shady has been in the back room  Once calm enough for me to explain the fix he goes ballistic and slams his fist on the counter exclaiming that I am unqualified and that I am part of the problem with America  He KNOWS that the problem was the CIA hacking into his computer because they KNOW about the things hes been downloading  His face turns beet red and he accuses me of copying his files to a removable source  I cannot speak at this point as Im scared  He takes this as an admission of guilt and threatens me with breaching international law and that I would rot in a foreign prison if I tried to run  The man was escorted from the premises by loss prevention with his fixed computer  The bill was zeroed outI have plenty more and many are NSFW but I hope my donation to the archives of tech support are worthy  I also know that similar things have happened before though the rarity of them make them worth mentioningThanks and keep

KansasWizard,25,60,1nxf4k,54,Hear a tale of the ISP run by a pyramid scheme corporation story timeOnce upon a time there was a company who specialized in stuff Lets call them Shamway Now Shamway was a busy little company who was not liked across the land for its methods of selling goods to it customers Now some years before the government of the land had disciplined the company for being a big bad wolf they decided that not only were they going to sell services such as dial up internet services Also in the land was a young apprentice wizard who needing training in the arts and coin for sustenance joined with a local merchant house contracted to run the support for the dark companys ISP Soon did he face trials and stood against the undead and the insomniacs working the night away for the Shamway  while in college I wanted to be at least be able to afford noodles so I took an overnight position as a phone in support tech for an ISP run by a pyramid schemeDuring the day the merchant house was filled with skilled and unskilled workers working on several different contracts for various companies including the Hell and also Hell Packed with space for over  workers  During the day the company had multiple service contracts running but most of them were handed off to other call centers later in the day toward evening the QN contract being one of the few that stayed with the call center  ere when the moon arose only a handful remained within the walls to defend against the tide the young wizard among them There was Sir Kyle the Super Lucas the Rogue of Level  and about  level one minions on rotating shifts in the whole merchant house And lo it came to pass that the wizard befriended the Rogue and learned many tricks between rounds of battle with the hordes of Shamway There were many tales like those that are told where ever we gather such asYes you do need to connect the phone cable to your computer andor modemYou will need to have a modem installed to use the serviceNo your password is not all stars Im sorry your phone is calling Montana and you are in Missouri No we cannot refund you for the long distance charges it says that every time you dial into the systemYes you do need a computer to use the product you have been soldYour username is derp and your password has been reset to herpderpYes maam you will need to be in front of your computer to complete the setupThese low level battles prepared the young wizard for more stalwart foes of the Shamway known as the Diamond People These people had fallen under the lure of the company and drove unsuspecting people to their doom through the promise of gains and riches Sir you cannot dial out the same time I am talking to you if you do not have a second line no matter how many Diamonds you areSir you cannot use that language even if you are the regional diamond leader once more and your call will be disconnectedKevin the Super would descend from his tower now and again to survey the call times but did not partake in battle for he was a lout and a pus filled cesspit with care only for call lengths and resolution tickets Verily if one asked for a supervisor ye would be tossed from minion to minion until thine head spun As this was normally a Diamond person anyway we did not care for their attitudes suck eggs The Shamway dialer application was a festering pox and did crash constantly for no good reason and for many bad ones Integrates email and browser all in one system like the old AOHELL or JUNOOOOOO systems of the time It would dial long distance by default and pose cryptic messages instead of line busy or no dial tone The favorite tale of the young wizard was actually one of hope though One night when Kevin was home with the plague or so one hopes the wizard took a call from an elder who reminded the wizard of his own elders and thus he did above the call of duty She did not know the ways of the rodent or the board of keys but was willing to learn in order to send a missive to the progeny of her children So it was performed by ritual the entry of the name and password the connection of phone to local principalities and the appropriate sacrifices to the electronic messenger gods that they would transport her missive henceforth to her bloodline Though the wizard was chastised for the length and girth of his call the lack of all other calls at the time saved him from being fed to the dragon of HR that day And that my friends is some tales from the wizards past hastily written and posted for your pleasure If you will excuse me I just got a tech support ticket

the Bastard Part     Things had settled down over the weekend My fiancee and I had enjoyed a night of fine jazz some good wine snuggles  you know the finer things in lifeMonday morning I arrived at my new office and pulled up right as my boss did and helped him unload the components from Frys for my new desktopHe showed me the office told me to help myself to anything in the break room and since there were some excellent bagels and a Keurig coffeemaker I couldnt but oblige his generous offer and presented me with the parts He seemed surprised that I brought my own monitors especially since hed brought two Asus LED panels for me but then again Im kind of a stickler about that  anything less than x simply wont do for a machine Im expected to work on  hours a weekAfter about an hour and a half and with liberal use of expletives and a few cups of coffee my new machine was assembledhttpimgurcomaBLfHb For a work box the specs were pretty tasty  an i a GeForce GTX  a GB Sandisk SSD and he even bought a Corsair H watercooling kit for me tooConsidering my previous cubehttpimgurcomatfk this was a massive improvementA quick installation of Win Pro x later and I was off on my way into Spiceworks working on ticketsLater that day I found out my new projects that would keep me busy for several months Among them were full network audits for each client we had plus the creation and implementation of a proper CRM system the creation and maintenance of an imaging system a custom Windows PE repair and recovery environment and imaging testing and deploying  Dell Latitude  tablets with Windows  to a high school we ran IT for With a smirk I fired up DISM on my box and marveled at how fast it wentSeveral days passed and I settled into the rhythm of the new job in my corner office set back in a heavily wooded area in the Barton Creek Greenbelt in southwest Austin The caffeine ran freely and I met the other techs and sysadmins over those days and our companypaid lunches My old friend and I would be sharing an office once we renovated the server room and moved the rack elsewhere and we were promised carte blanche to get what furniture we liked for it Believe me I made my plans and Ergotron arms walnut desks and plush carpets featured into them quite heavilyOf course I received occasional texts and calls from techs back at the hospital chain They were treated cordially and nicely all of them especially the ones who asked for tech support There was of course one call that I was waiting for that I knew would come though all too reluctantly as the caller would be prideful and loathe to admit he needed helpAnd we all know who THAT was yesYes the PFY was due to call any day now If you think back youll remember that the fiancee and I spotted some things that would definitely cause him alarm when he noticed them  assuming he ever did as his skill at scripting was equivalent to the average Tibetan yaks skill at water polo Sure enough the date in which the critical things would start happening was upon him and one cool and rainy morning after settling into my chair and turning on Pandora to my Stan Getz station the distinctive ringtone Id set for him echoed through the officeSWIPER NO SWIPING SWIPER NO SWIPING SWIPER NO SWIPINGI flicked my finger across the screen of my phone and put it on speaker as I picked up NNNNNNNnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnhelloHi Jack its PFYNAMEHERE Whats up The PFYs voice was crackling and sounded distant  yep he was on speakerphone and that meant there were at least one or two other people listening in on the call in the same roomOh not much not much I spoke sipping at my coffee and clicking around in Spiceworks Its nice not to have to be on call    for things that are out of my control you know Being root again  this time with official blessings  is a good thing And youWell were in the middle of a massive rollout here for a certain clinic  you know that big one with  or so tablets that was your client at the company you were with before you came to us he repliedOh you mean my baby So whats so urgent that you need me The network admin from my prior company should be able to assist you with anything you all need for them since hes running them nowThere were a few seconds of silence on the other end of the line and I continued Given that youre calling me personally Im going to place a wager that this has something to do with something Ive done for them Would I be right in saying soIts not so much what youve done for them he said continuing on in a calm voice Its what you did before and what we need done nowIm not sure I follow I shot back just as calmly Would you mind clarifying not merely for my benefit but for the other people I know are in the room with you since I can tell from the echo youre on speakerphoneI heard muttering for a few seconds then a quiet thump or two and his voice was magically clearer Look you know exactly whats going onI have a hunch Let me guess Youve finally gotten canine herpes from the head of ITs shihtzu A sip of coffee went down my gullet before I shot off another reply Or perhaps youve gotten your hands on what you perceived to be a MIRV warhead for a Soviet SSBM but it turned out it really was an espresso maker I sipped again Or perhaps karmas finally biting you in the ass hmm Send them out of the room or else theyre going to hear EXACTLY what I have to say to you when I start yellingTen seconds passed during which I could hear the PFY arguing with the others and then he was back on speaker after a thud indicated the door closingFine Jack spit it out or nut up and swallow itI didnt know you were an Archer fan I replied nonplussed as I crossed my arms across my chest You know that I know what you did Youre on your own to fix it ESPECIALLY since I saw what you did to itThe hell are you talking about I didnt do anything wrongPlagiarism is bad mmmkay Dont try to deny it its very distinctively my code and stripping the credits from it was a naughty thing to do Taking a buggy development version and claiming it was yours was an even worse idea You know that the one you copied was marked DEV USE ONLY for a reason right I had added in several features well its moot now its your problemJack seriously please  Dont you DARE beg me for help You plagiarized lied and made them think its YOUR code YOU can be the superhero and fix itOffice isnt activating on any of the tablets The desperation in his voice was evident The VPN client is broken on every single one of them its spitting back errors about not being a recognized asset They dont ever go to sleep or hibernate not one of them And worst of all Dragon doesnt even point to the right server I have to touch every single machine to fix itOh so youre basically having to do real work because you cant fix what you fucked up The derision in my voice was evident and the caffeine was only fueling the snark I was feeling Not my fault you cant fix this and you still havent given me a reason to bail your ass out of the fireA bottle of Glenlivet he said desperation evident in his voice Glenlivet  Isnt that what you said you likedI prefer recognition for my creation far more I replied finality in my voiceCome on Jack theres got to be some way that we can both get what we want here he beggedIm going to be frank Nothing you have could POSSIBLY make me inclined to help you and even reporting any and all suspected policy and AUP violations on my part wouldnt gain you a damn thing since Im gone HOWEVER I could always point out to the IS security team that as people like us could potentially have access to eClinicalWorks with multiple accounts what with us being able to shouldersurf users during deployments and my its amazing what scripts one can write for oneself with credentials from other users as that would evade the audit trail especially for interesting things like oh tramadol In fact I daresay that a user who has our skill level with it and sufficient creativity  well they could mark someone as a recreational drug addict in eClinicalWorks then tag them as being positive for oh say HIV or some other nasty little disease Tuberculosis perhaps Something that has a oneweek report requirement to the county board of health And my that could most definitely affect ones standing  false records would be an absolute nightmare to remove and the complications  why if they could affect someones custody battle thats beyond the pale isnt it let alone the repercussions that could occur from someone being unethical enough to actually do such things considering that EVERYTHING is traceable one way or another and Im able to offer my skills as a forensic analyst if necessaryYou utter fucking bastard he hissed into the phoneNow now behave yourself Youre in a Catholic institution I retorted Were speaking in hypotheticals only of course Ive no desire to screw things up Thats your job you know since you cant script worth a damn Of course if you had simply taken the production script version I had instead of the dev one all of this would have been avoidedSo youre just going to leave me out in the cold thenI wouldnt say leave you out in the cold No its more like the time I was in Japan  you know when what was a clear dayhttpimgurcomaVDlvX took nine minutes to turn into an absolute shitstorm of a blizzardhttpimgurcomaVDlvX where I blew out both knees and only survived because vending machines sell cans of hot coffee Yeah more like that I swallowed the last of my coffee and flipped the phone over hanging my finger over the big red disconnect button Maybe if youre lucky youll find the metaphorical coffee machine that saves your assJack you son of a  My finger jabbed down on the button and the call hung upI leaned back in my chair muted the ringer and got up A quick walk to the fridge yielded a bottle of Chameleon ColdBrew and I poured a mug of it sans water and dilution Upon return to my comfy chair I sipped victoriously

ComputerGeek,32,15,1numj3,100,So its been awhile since my last submission involving my coworker Skippy and I wish I could say that is because he has been getting better but sadly that is just not the case Most of his cringe inducing behavior comes in the form of asinine comments that he makes through out the day one example is the story he tells us about how his uncle took his speed boat up to Alaska and how the US Navy shot a torpedo at him for getting too close to a Top Secret Base and other impossibly terrible tall tails like that But on to the technical stuffNow none of us likes dealing with printers I personally believe that Mr Bill Gates most evil act in life has nothing to do with Windows it was his undelivered promise to us of a paperless office So despite his obvious ineptitude in the fields of every thing else you can forgive me for sending Skippy to clear a paper jam on one of our larger units a few months ago he is after all still the FNG Now because I do not have the fingers of a year old Asian I often find it helpful to use a pair of pliers to pull out the more stubborn little bits of paper I therefore suggested to Skippy the use of my personal set of pliers which he gratefully accepted He takes two tools from my desk and leaves Now feels like an appropriate time to mention that I leave all of my tools in cases for easy transport so it is especially strange that he did not take the entire sets with him Up until this point its been a pretty slow day and I am amusing myself by setting up a row of parallel capacitors for some amusement later on Since I am salvaging these parts from broken equipment I reach for the case that I keep my side cutters in and I find that they arent there This isnt unusual at first since we are pretty good about sharing tools so I ask the other guys in my office but nobody has them I look again at my case and see that the needle nose pliers are still there and I pause It is at this point I feel my spine go cold and I start experiencing audible hallucinations that clicking noise that HDDs make when they die started coming from inside of my head saying No it cant be  he didnt ltCLICKgt No it cant be  ltCLICKgt No it can I shoot up out of my desk and sprint across our floor to the commercial grade printer that had the paper jam I see Skippy sitting at an unoccupied desk around the corner stabbing at the now completely disassembled feed roller with my side cutters Me WHAT ARE DOINGSkippy AH Geek you scared me Im just clearing the paper jam like you told me toMe With my wire cuttersSkippy You said it was alright if I used your tools What Why are you looking at me like thatI now lose my ability to speak how do you respond to someone like this How do you teach someone who is too oblivious to read the digital display that tells you where the paper jam is and how to clear it I was too late he had already lost two proprietary sized screws along with a spring and the roller was kinked in a dozen different places from where he had stabbed it with my flat head screw driver The K printer that we had leased was now an absurdly expensive paper weight The only thing he had to say was Dont we have a service contract on it He repeated this several times for the next few minutes before he realized that we had all heard him and were choosing not to respondAs punishment we all agreed that it is only fair that he be the one to tell our receptionist exactly why they would be without a printer until I could scrounge up parts from Ebay so that we dont end up having to pay the leasing company the retail cost of the unit yes we did manage to pull his ass out of the fire It was a team effort The story he ended up telling was that the printer had broke because the receptionist was printing with staples  and that this had damaged the roller To confirm you suspicion yes the jam was in the feed roller for the paper tray on the opposite end of the machine from the collator A few other smaller storiesI at one point thought it would be beneficial to teach Skippy how to write in Pearl PERL Perl this being the scripting language that everyone else in the office has a common understanding of This lead to questions such as Why doesnt the loop work if I put a semicolon at the end What is a function What does the command open do and my favorite after he got frustrated with learning Pearl Dont you write stuff in C Why dont I learn that instead I also had to physically take his Insert key away because he thought he had to hold it down in order to insert text in NotepadWe have an upright vacuum cleaner in our office because despite my objections before it was put in my office is carpeted a nice dark color so that you dont stand a chance of seeing any dropped screws unless you lay your head parallel with the floor So we asked Skippy to run the carpet over a few times to pick up what ever clutter my supervisor thought he saw Here is the modelhttpswwwgooglecomsearchqdirtdevilultraswivelglideampessmampsourcelnmsamptbmischampsaXampeiWZVRUpGdJezAPHqIGwCQampvedCAkQAUoAQampbiwampbihampdpr we have Skippy couldnt figure out how to unlock the handle from the upright position so instead of asking for help looking it up or spending more then ten seconds trying to figure it out he crouches down and starts pushing it from the bottom We dont have a small office so this caused all four of us to stop working and watch this display of  I dont know what  ingenuity In a rare show of humor my supervisor waited for Skippy to finish cleaning the entire office this way in which time several people walked in to ask for help only to spot him doing this and forget why they came in before showing him what button to push in order to use it like a normal person would,1381079077.0,They Never Taught Us That In College Part II,115,TalesFromTechsupport,hot
brerrabbitt,41,24,1num5n,95,While I am not IT nor do I work primarily with computers I do handle tech support issuesIm an Electronics Tech by trade and work in a number of fields Industrial automation is one fire alarm systems is anotherThink of people in my trade as being what every good little IT person wants to be when they grow up There is nothing more satisfying than finishing up a job pressing a button and watching a few tons of machinery start moving around under the direction of the operator or a PLCAnd speaking of ITThere had been constant strife between us and IT due to several issues One of the most common being that their updates would often render the software that we used to handle hardware nonfunctional Another that ground our gears was them constantly taking over electrical rooms and placing their locks on them in strict violation of code The firemen might need to get in there to shut down a panel if the building is of fire and this would delay them it also delayed us if we needed to work in the room as wellTheir explanation was that rules were rules It did not matter that the only thing my laptop ever interfaced with was a PLC alarm system or other type of electronics device they were mandated to update our laptops even if the updates rendered our computers useless The same for the electrical rooms they were now secure areas but out of the goodness of their little black hearts they would let us in if we scheduled a time a week or so in advanceI received a trouble call for the fire alarm system in the building that they worked out of one day It seemed that many people could not hear the fire alarm when it actuatedI did a building walk around after announcing that I was testing the system I put the system in alarm and did in fact find that the alarm could not be heard in many areas of the building This was due to post construction renovations that split several large rooms into smaller onesAn evil thought entered my mind I pushed it back but it kept sliding towards the forefrontI looked at how much conduit I would have to run and figured a cool shortcut that met code and would make the shop look like we had entered the st centuryThe building had a post construction mass notification system installed that conveniently had a fire message recorded on it  One single conduit run a control relay and a bit of rewiring and the building except for the IT spaces was up to code If the fire alarm actuated instead of bells they would now hear the calm voice of a woman telling them to evacuate the building because of a fireThe IT spaces The lovely quiet extremely well air conditioned IT spaces  Yup the bastards made me schedule a time before I could work in there to finish up the job I would feel no guilt over what I now had to do Im an evil bastard at heart Instead of switching their audibles from bells to a speaker repeating the recorded message it was a matter of minutes to change the alarm bells to their highest setting They would no longer merely alert you to a fire but would now drive you from the spaces holding your ears in painAir conditioning Hmm that needs to go off by code when a fire alarm is initiated I even had a wiring panel in the same room as their AC It was but the work of a few minutes to bring this up to code as wellAnd to ensure the safety of the IT personnel I wired it up with a manual interlock that had to be pressed to restart the ITs air conditioning system By gosh this was a safety issue Who is going to argue against thatPity the reset for the interlock was in an electrical box that only our shop had the keys toI tested out the system and bagged ass out of their building before anyone realized what I had doneIt brought a smile to my face every time they called our shop after a fire drill to restart their AC system My boss would simply reroute the call to me if I was in the shop and I would ask them when they would like to schedule an appointment to reset their system That that did not last as long as I would have liked they whined to the big boss but I did my best to take my time responding to their emergency loss of cooling to their serversRules are rules after allTLDR I really should have told someone where that reset button was before I quit,1381078779.0,Where the intrepid Electronics Tech gets one over on the IT guys,119,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

GeneralDisorder,7,9,1nnbxa,51,I have a specific coworker who if reading this knows exactly who they are who took a call regarding some blah BS thats coming up shortly This particular tech is really good at what we do works a small team where security issue and legal issues get escalated and has vast knowledge of the web hosting industry as many of us doI happen to specialize in a department thats very small and absurdly specialized and so this is where I come into the story The initial call went approximately like thisLT this stands for Loud Tech Hello ltblahgtRC registrant caller Hi I want to change my blue record for nsnotfuckingregisteredwithyounetLT Hold just one moment LT to the room What is a blue record Something about name servers Im not sure what hes asking PAUSE The caller said glue recordhttpenwikipediaorgwikiDomainNameSystemCirculardependenciesandgluerecords Closest analogy explanation is A DNS record that tells the world this domain serves DNS and the name server lives at the following IP address We do this We do this for any domain registered through us And of course most other registrars also offer this service The record they want to change is registered with Otherstrar INC which is a fictional name which Ill use for any registrar that I dont work forLT to the room Oh Glue record Ok Got itLT Im sorry about the hold It looks like notfuckingregisteredwithyounet is registered with Otherstrar INC To change the glue record you have to contact themRC blah I dont know what his response was to this I wasnt there I was on another call at this timeLT No this is not something we can change here contact Otherstrar INCRC Let me talk to someone who knows what the fuck theyre talking aboutLT Ok thats not happening Im going to end this call ltclickgtSo there you have it Customer calls the wrong place wanting to change something and doesnt believe our tech I have a theory why but Ive said too much already Of course he doesnt like this correct and completely true answer so he calls back and demands a manager This issue has already been wellbroadcast by LT who is loud and is aware of it unashamed A manager somewhat has already been made aware of the call and that this guy will  likely call back The tech sitting behind me who we can just call N for Noob number  gets this call and is yelled at to get a supervisor because blah blah Yes RC is angry that he got the correct answer and didnt believe it So our nearest MOD says to N yeah Ill take that call Send him over My EXT is MOD Hello this is MODRC rabble rabble rabblePAUSE It doesnt matter what was discussed at this point But the story was somehow incompatible with the first version of the story and MOD is repeating back the majority of whats been said hes not on speaker that would be disruptive FWIW Im listening and at some point this user claims to have changed something I happen to have full access to all the records of everything this guy has ever done in his account and his claim goes that he did something today But the only record I have is that he logged in He hasnt changed anythingMOD Ok Let me do a quick search because this is a little outside my realm of familiaritySo MOD puts RC on hold and is asking LT What did he ask for It doesnt seem to agree with what he asked you Of course LT is agitated by this as is often the case when someone calls in asks a question then insults your intelligence for giving the correct answer I had been listening in and trying to help them out from the start as I am the goto registrar guy in that particular room So I ask MOD if he wants to send the caller to me He says yeah thats probably bestMOD Sorry about the hold here I just talked with out ThisSTRAR INC specialist and he wasnt quite sure what your end goal was If you dont mind Id like to transfer your call over to him His name is GeneralGD for GodDamnit Im late Thats me in case youre confused Hello ThisSTRAR Support this is GeneralRC Hi have you been briefed on the call so farGD Yes Im aware of both calls you had I actually seem to have gotten two different requests One was about changing the glue record for nsnotfuckingregisteredwithyounet and something about changing the whois for isfuckingregisteredwithyoubiz So what exactly are we trying to accomplish hereRC Ok I want to change the IP address nsnotfuckingregisteredwithyounet So I go into your backend and I called in and got this moron who said you guysGD Let me stop you there for a second So you want to change the IP of nsnotfuckingregisteredwithyounetRC Thats correctGD Ok And notfuckingregisteredwithyounet is registered with Otherstrar INC correctRC YesGD Right So to change this glue record you need to go where the glue record was created You need to change this at Otherstrar INCRC AH I got ya Ok I see what I did wrong now Thank you You could tell he was a little embarrassed Total time on my phone  minute thirty some seconds want to say  but thatd be way too true and would have to instead get posted at rthathappened He was clearly embarrassed when he figured out the initial confusion and realized he literally was just given the right answer immediately before starting this ridiculous argument EDITs I suck at proofreading,1380800418.0,To Coworker Let me talk to someone who knows what the F theyre talking

ericbrow,15,23,1nmuu5,164,I used to work as a tech in a shop that supported small businesses and homes  One of our customers was a county  center  The director had lost some information at some point in the recent past because he had stopped checking up on the backups on his local machine something he didnt want to pay us to check  Since that fiasco we set up a system where his stuff would get backed up to the server and then backed up and we did check the server backup  One day he had been working on a document and lost it  He called our office and I unfortunately picked up the phone  Its gone my document is gone  You guys had better have been checking those backups because LIVES ARE ON THE LINE HERE  This is the XXXXX County  Center and this is of VITAL importance  He flipped out further but you get the gist  I asked him a few questions about what he had been doing and it sounded to me like he had just forgotten where he stored it but first he demanded that I check his backups  After checking his backups something our company did daily as a paid service for them I then started trying to get back to his document but he started freaking out again on how we had to get that information back because lives were on the line  I finally interrupted him  Is this how you train your dispatchers to act in times of crisis  He finally calmed down and checked his Word history as I had been trying to get him to do and found his document  The life saving information  A proposed budget for the next fiscal year the budget that was due in a few weeks and he had one half of one page completed,1380774651.0,Lives are on the line here,187,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

Evenstar,23,12,1nn8os,36,Hey TFTS those of you who know me know I am a moderately talented user with a lot of knowledge about computers but sometimes not the practical application of that knowledge Thats ok google will tell me DCue to a couple of days back I get a skype message from my mother in law who I really do love I love her to pieces and shes a shitload more fun than my family But and its a big but ALL the computer related talent in the family went to my husband She will listen to any instructions you give her and sometimes she will remember them tooBut she also has a talent for misapplication of those instructions unlike any other user I have ever seen Sometimes it seems she knows just enough to get her in to troubleSo two days ago I get a message from her quite late at night her time we are currently situated on different continents telling me that her office suite has stopped working on both computers No biggie I get her to give me her teamviewer pass and put an activation key in Damn it didnt work why not Shes running professional  and it turns out I need a Mak key or bulk license No biggie I sift through my pile of keys and find one problem almost solvedAnd you have lost connection Sigh MIL has gone to bed so I cant get her to help me log back in I send her a message asking her to contact me the next day when she gets back on her computer as it was a simple activation key fix I shouldnt have said it was simple Big MistakeThe next day she comes online briefly but doesnt message I assume this is because she is busy with something not an uncommon ocurrance and doesnt need her comp today The next day she comes online and messages me Good I think lets get to the meat of thisShe asks me if I will remotely maintain her computers and give it a look over once or twice a month I am somewhat suspicious at this statement but agree and relay it to my husbandYour mother is asking me to help her maintain her computers on a regular basis and to do a bimonthly cleanse When she says things like bimonthly cleanse I am concerned as to what THE USER is actually doing to her machines DH thats DH like asking her to come clean your house DH but its a good ideaSo I remote in andshe says she needs to tell me something Oh Oh This cant be good And I get thisWhen I picked up the Microsoft  pack from office works I had initially forgotton I had it and finally remembered you may recall when we tried to get together on team viewer I dont know how we lost contact by the way However after we lost contact I was battling again with the computer until I called Microsoft and got through to V on Wednesday at around  pm  Let me know if you would like to have some of his notes By the way he asked me to insert a flash drive into the Dell after getting info from the HP I still have the drive so let me know if you want to view it to see if there are any details you could use However after  hours of his attention he was not able to put the  microsoft program into the HP and he has put Microsoft  on the Dell This leaves me confused However they want me to pay for support for a  year period which the price is  what do you think about thatPersonally I believe I was given the wrong impression by the customer service person P whom I spoke to initially before the technician V P said that the price for technical support would be very minimal Please comment you views DIL by the way I have not yet paidOh no Microsoft is asking her for  bucks This sounds oddly fishy I asked her to give me a URL for the company she called It isnt microsoftTheyre a tech support company in Australia whose name reminds me of US transport security administration though quite cleverly their website url adapts depending on what you google search for so it seems not dissimilar from the microsoft siteI am still a bit stumped as to why she went for external support and didnt call microsoft Because she thought they were MicrosoftShe doesnt have the entirety of the support log but she does have some of itThe log reveals that they tried to bill her card after not having specified how much for They would link her to the pricing page which gave a price range They were demonstrating that her computer had infections ERMAGERD INFECTIONS by running cmd ipconfig what were they doing telling her her IPV address was a virusOh and they have so little faith in their log me in they linked my MIL to teamviewerAt this point I am seriously pissed offI mean Ive seen shady business practices but this takes the cake in terms of what I have seen lately and I live in Africa where people paste images into word dont really like MS paint and have NO idea what snip is They also enter random monitor resolutions just for kicksSo I enter their live chat function on their site not paying to call if I dont have to and ask to speak to V She tells me to call I explain I am halfway across the world and can she transfer me pleaseShe says she will remote me in and to click a support link I do and she tells me to enter a code and click downloadEXCUSE ME its good business practice to inform a consumer what they are downloading onto their personal system before just saying click download You should probably tell them what it does too Whats your support addressShe doesnt respond to the first half and gives me the address will quickly logging offBelow is my email to themHi TeamI am contacting you to discuss your handling of some remote support service you completed for MILFirstly I contacted your team myself and I cannot believe you instruct your customers to enter the code and click download without any explanation of what they are downloading just statements like I am going to connect you remotelyThen it leaves a customized version of log me in on their computer after you are done The first rule of good tech support is that it works better than when you got it in the first place and that you do not leave anything behind that wasnt there beforeSecond you did not fix the issues with her office installation but rather decided to install different versions parallel to what was there in the first place taking up a limited amount of harddrive space and rather than using her version of office  on both computers you decided to arbitrarily install office  on one of themThen when it came to payment MIL does not have a specific price from you just a link to your pricing page and several attempts by you to get her to pay for  years of support and attempts to support your case by opening cmd and showing her how many infections her computer must have and telling her office suites require loads of support For one they dont They might occasionally require an activation key but they do not require support And trying to convince someone that cmd demonstrates viruses is just completely ridiculous In my log I have a statement from A that he wants to try BPay from another computer or netbanking and that her card didnt go through Tell me if you ran her card how much exactly did you try to bill her card forSo let me recap You would not give her a one time price you tried to show her evidence of infections through cmd what were you doing pointing at her IPV address and telling her it was a Trojan trying to sell her on three year support while just linking to the pricing page when asked for a bill amount you did not issue and invoice and you used cracked keys to run her store bought version of  which has its own official key parallel to her  and installing  on the other You then tried to bill her while on the remote session for an unspecified amountNone of this is appropriate or good technical support Instead you have left me with laggy messes to clean up because you felt taking up more harddisk space by running two versions of the same program was a good idea MIL is now not sure what needs to be fixed but knows that things do not work correctly now And the sheer gall of not explaining what it is your customers are downloading before they have done so is morally reprehensible Ill be interested to see if I can even pull an events log from itSo this is your opportunity how are you going to fix this And do not do not remote in to either computers without first explaining to me what you are going to do about these issues and what your bill would have been had you actually given itLast dont waste your time trying to explain to me how pointing out nonexistent infections in cmd was actually helping in case you cant tell I actually know what I am doing and if I see more of this disingenuous way of providing service I will absolutely not hesitate to report you to The Department of Fair Trading as being fraudulentEvenstarSo well see and Ill update Now I gotta go untangle the mess they left and uninstall office   hours and they couldnt make  install so lets just put  instead How did this happen I left her alone with her computers for  hours I have already agreed to bi monthly supportHow my sanity will fare is something else entirelyWish me luck OBLIGATORY EDIT So have since discovered that the computer that supposedly has office  on it has no office at all and that midway through yesterday they got my MIL to download sandisk secure access utility and run it But the question is what forOBLIGATORY EDIT  All the formatting I do seems to work except for paragraphs I cant get line

PC for an Accountant and it has never been serviced  Or reimaged  Strike The server has a single Gb HDD which contains the OS and all applicationsfiles including the Gb of archived emails from Accountants Outlook backup  I only bring this up because for years yes years the Warehouse has been clicking cancel when prompted to update their shipping software because it will break it  As you can tell by now the reason it would break it there is less than Mb of free disk space  So low and behold Temp Warehouse Worker wasnt aware of the SOP to reject the software update and clicked OK  Strike  is in here somewhereWhat happens next is that the HDD crashes and the Warehouse is unable to process shipments  Shipping Software Support is called IT Support is called and PlayTones is called  Who fixed it first you wonderWell Shipping Software Support isnt any help besides stating that the transactions already logged for the day can be processed but no new shipmentsIT Support cant ping the server Go Figure so they ask me what the Server is doing  This is my first introduction to Mr Dell Optiplex and all of its outdated glory so my previously stated knowledge was all gleaned after this point  I entered to a cool gust of refreshing air in a welllit but cramped closet with white walls and black cables on the ground  I identified it by the label on the chassis saying Shipping Server at the very bottom of a blade rack on the lonely shelf that has become ubiquitous with death  Found that the single monitor in the rack of course its CRT is hooked to a switch and the server is connected to input   Switching to the server blue screen of Boot Media Unreadable I dont need IT to tell me its a HDD failureI tell IT that I know what to do pull the HDD and hook it up as a slave to another machine to hopefully retrieve the database notbackup up anywhere else  Tell them I will need to locate an IDE port somewhere if there is another machine this old that still works  IT says No its probably SATA and we left a drive reader in HR for wiping exemployee machines  Strike Theyre wrong its IDE and no we dont have any way to connect it  Now it is pm and EOB is pm  Warehouse now has a queue of shipments waiting to be processed but cant ship them out  So I tell my boss Im going to Worst Buy to get a part and I will be back before pm  Before I leave I check online and they have  External IDE enclosure in stockIt takes  min to drive there without traffic  What happens next is nothing that I am proud of this isnt a fairytale after all but I get pulled over for speeding  The cop is really nice about the whole thing and lets me go with a written warning  All I had to do was say I have to get to Worst Buy and back to the office by  so my shipping dept can do their jobs  I think I just learned how to not get a ticket bonusSo I get to WB and the computer dept is confident that the part isnt stocked anymore despite the website inventory  They direct me to Radiohack a local electronics junk store  Again no luckSo its now nearing pm and I call my boss to give him the bad news  We decide that there is one more store that would probably have it  Its not close to the office but it is near my home so I decide to go  Get there get the HDD enclosure and its pm  I go home with the part and bring it in the next morningWhen I get connected I realize how bad the HDD was managed what with the  Incredibly small size for the data requirements  Lack of free space  Irrelevant and obsolete data for the current task  Sheer age of the HDD used as the sole retention point for business critical dataI extracted the required stuff kicked the HDD back into the Optiplex chassis and loaded the software onto a spare laptop I had laying around  Granted I did have to roll up  versions to get to current rev because the data needed to be reformatted as part of a software update so this took ALL DAY  Also updated each Warehouse PC with latest rev of Client software and now the system is stableI told my boss that the current server laptop should be replaced with an actual server but seeing as how he has a laptop hidden between his desk and the wall in his office online acting as a connector for our customer database to link with outlook server I dont think he caresI also knew that no one cares when I didnt receive a thank you let alone a raisebonus since I was hired  At that realization I stopped caring and read TFTS for the first time and now I spend  hours on reddit EVERY DAYTLDR Critical ancient server breaks when decade old HDD fails to hold more data than physically possible PlayTones steps in to resolve and ends up permanently affecting his productivityedit Queue not cue  Tried to fix the bullet points no luck ,1380732334.0,Not my responsibility fix

stringPlayer,7,1,1nlrd4,29,Hi TFTS  It was about time for me to sign up and give back to the folks here that have given me so many facepalm moments Id like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves and I hope weve passed the auditionThis tale goes back to the heady days when I was a Unix consultant and making some very good money  I knew some people at a company a bit south of Boston that was one of two that had been bought by a British firm and the Brits were closing down the other company and moving its data center from Washington DC to a colocation site in Boston  When the people I knew heard I was available they hired me on even though Id given them my I really dont want this job rate without blinking an eye  Damn I thought  I left money on the tableI went in to meet with them and they introduced me to their recentlyhired Senior UNIX System Administrator his actual title after apologizing for not knowing I was available for the job  This guy was well over  lbs and friends of mine told me they ran when they saw him heading for the bathroom as such visits tended to leave the area around completely stenchified for at least an hour afterwards  At one point we traveled down to Washington to see the site we were to move and it was the first time Id ever seen an airline have to pull out the seatbelt extender  I really felt sorry for the person that had to sit next to him on the flight as she only had about  of seat left after his lardass was in placeBut thats not what I came to tell you about Came to talk about the draft I did not have much respect for this person as a SysAdmin  He freely admitted that the most valuable tool in his kit was his Rolodex of vendor support numbers  At his previous job there was no hardware or software that was without a full platinum levelhttpwwwtheregistercoukPrintbofhepisode support contract  There was little hed ever had to do when a problem arose other than call one of the numbers in his Rolodex for helpFast forward a few weeks to a miserable New England day in February the kind of day where the weather cant decide whether it wants to snow or rain so it compromises and pelts down sleet and freezing rain which once it hits the ground is buckets o slush until later in the day when it freezes in place and wont budge until some time in May  This day found me happily working from home over my dedicated K line hot shit at the time all warm and cozy with my modded Sun IPX and my Amiga  to keep me company  Yeah Im old  Get off my lawnThis blissful scene was interrupted by a call from the supposed Senior Sysadmin who told me there was a problem with the new Sun server that had been leased to manage the backups and the tape library  Id had it all set up and there wasnt anything on it other than the OS and the oddball backup software hed had the company buy so I couldnt imagine what was wrong  I into the spiffy virtual KVM that had been installed and found that I couldnt log in as myself nor as root  That aint right I said to myself  I rebooted and the system came back up but I still couldnt log in  Now Im really scratching my head  I told him I couldnt log in at all and that wed probably have to boot off the Solaris CD to see what was wrongBoot off the Solaris CD  Which one is thatUm the one that says Solaris  that I left in the rack last week when we installed the server  Call the colos helping hands number and have them put the CD in the driveOh I didnt want to leave that around so I put it in my bag before we left  Never mind that we had a number of them in the office already never mind that their intrinsic value approached zero hed put it in his bag for safekeepingWell I guess youll have to drive up to Boston to bring it back there I saidCould you do it he asked  I believe I invented the facepalm at that moment  Now usual time to Boston for me was about  minutes but on that day it could have easily approached  hours so I declined  Some whining about how it was expected tomorrow occurred but it wasnt my problem and I told him so  Off he went to Boston and I figured that was the end of it but that wouldnt be a TFTS would it  The real WTFery came once he finally arrived in Boston  My phone rang and I heard this OK Im at the colo what do I do now  Wait whatPut the CD in the drive and boot into single user modeYeah  How do I do thatLets take a moment to note two points here   The instructions for booting a Sun from the CD were printed inside the CDs cover   He was hired as a Senior UNIX System Administrator  Not a junior not a trainee not even a PFYwannabe but a Senior SysAdminI took a deep breath had him insert the CD and booted into single user mode via the KVM and mounted the filesystems where I found that the root partition was  full whereas yesterday it had been under  full  Not only that there was a single file that was taking up all that space  etcpasswd  On top of that it was a file filled with nothing  I needed more information  Sadly the default shell at this time was the plain Bourne shell which had no command history for me to look atWhat were you doing with this systemNothing   just checking out the tape drive  Trying to write a file to itUh huh  Which fileUhhhh the password fileAt that moment I knew all  Hed tried to give the command      backupcommand etcpasswd gt devrmt  but instead ended up typing      backupcommand etcpasswd lt devrmt  which happy started reading the entire empty tape into etcpasswdOyI restored the default etcpasswd from the fortunately there had been only one account added mine and the root partition was instantly back down to its previous level  WhewSo theres my tale of stupidity for the day  But But the title of the story is Backstabbery  Wheres that come into play I hear you cry  Well I couldnt let this go so I went to my friend this asshats boss and told him that his senior sysadmin didnt even know how to boot a Sun from a CD  He shook his head saying that he was the best of a small number of applicants this was a while ago rememberThe next day I got a call from my friend who told me that hed fired the asshat  The move went great after that  High visibility clients never saw downtime and the project came in on schedule and under budget  I got a big bonus followed by a job offer which I took  Dontcha love a happy endingTLDR A company hires an

mcsparklenuts,60,103,1njmxw,355,Hey TFTS Thanks for your support on last nights story Here is Chapter  of what I hope can become a sagaIn case you missed the last installment check it out herehttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsnhjdinwhichiamafreshbootthewheelisOh and to clear something up a little bit this was while I was in the Marine Corps Things work a little differently than the other services I was also promoted to Lance Corporal between the last story and this one Not really a big difference just an increase in pay really It wasnt merit based just an automatic promotionOur office was a confined little space It wasnt truly even an office but an unused vault that had been repurposed With five of us stuck in this little room we were a constant fire hazard You couldnt move a foot without tripping over someone or somethingNow the way that our office was arranged there was only one workstation where you could really have any privacy No one could see what was on your screen and you couldnt see what was on anyone elses Cpl Elvis had long since been banished to this desk well before I even got there as it was easily the least sociable spot in the roomAs I was not in this desk it did not take much casual observation from my cohorts to deduce that I had been the one to write the infamous server check script The attitude in the room towards me was generally that of indifference however Most of them were still unsure of me and my bootness It would take something more to establish my right to coexist with themAnd so it came to pass my days of scripting were just beginning Now as a beginner the scripts were simple at best I was trying to figure out what I could do and how powerful I could become I played and played in the little sandbox that was our network Since this was a training evolution it didnt matter what I was doing with anything really It was as much of a communications exercise as it was a staff training exercise and my access rights were bountifulI didnt necessarily work from the same workstation every day so all of my work including my scripts was stored in a shared location There wasnt really a need to protect anything so I didnt implement any folder permissions This would work in my favorSo over the next few weeks I was still fuming over the Cpl Elvis incident from the last installment I was still furious and plotting my revenge There had to be an opportunity Things were never exactly quiet I needed to do something and place the blame squarely on him But howMy thoughts were interrupted by the familiar sound of Outlook receiving an email Somebody loves me I exclaimed in delight I AltTab to my email thats how you know Im a real computer genius sarcasm to read this message from my future loverAlas It was only a policy letter and I was only CCd Blast I guess love will have to wait for another dayI read the policy letter though Such a dry read written in military format And it meant more work Apparently our Active Directory display name naming standard was not in compliance with DoD standards and every account would have to be changed from FName MI LName to something like LName Rank FName Unit Section Billet This was not going to be a fun taskAs the bitch of the team I was likely going to be tasked with this It was another one of those things that no one wanted to do But wait I might be able to script this To the internet I wentWell after a bit of googling and a bit of playing around testing things I managed to work out a script that did what I wanted it to Probably could have done it better but I was happy with what I had worked out so I was going to run with itBut I noticed something Files in my script folder were locked for editing That could only mean one thing Someone was going through them But why There was nothing really good in there just the server check script and a couple things that I had been playing around with To the logs I went I didnt really care that someone was looking but I needed my filesCpl Elvis Once I saw the name I cared The anger came flooding right back in having been forgotten in my work I needed to do something about himAnd then it came to me a deviously wonderful ideaI hadnt saved my script to the share yet so I made a backup copy and began my changes To anyone who casually looked at it it would appear that the script did exactly what I had initially intended it to do but I changed a couple of lines to basically make the display names unintelligible With a second copy I made a script that would fix the changes to proper orderI uploaded the former of these scripts to my folder and kept the latter to myself As if on cue SSgt Tony appears at the doorOk gang I have a task for you We got a policy letter in and we need to change everyones display name and bring everything up to speedVarious methods were discussed as how to go about this I sat there quietly waiting for a lull in the conversation Eventually I chime in I read somewhere that you can use a script to change the display names I think we have all the information we need to get it done Maybe Cpl Elvis could try to do something since he made that server check scriptSSgt Tony looked at me quizzically We exchanged a glance and he knew I was up to something but it seemed he also knew I had a plan Quickly he turned to Cpl ElvisThats not a half bad idea Cpl Elvis put something together and get it done I want you to work on this personally I have other things for the rest of the team It is your top priorityCpl Elvis looked like he had just been hit by a bus that hit him at near lightspeed so I decided to chime in againIve been working on some things myself You might want to look at my folder on the share Theres some stuff in there that might help you outHe was oblivious to my hatred of him apparently and took the as a gesture of friendship Oh if he only knew my plan insert maniacal laughter hereIt was only a few minutes after the meeting that Cpl Elvis had apparently struck gold He announced that he had a script ready After my private assurances to SSgt Tony that nothing was going to be permanently damaged he gave Cpl Elvis the green light to run the scriptAnd run it he did It took about half a second for the look of selfrighteous delight to turn into absolute horror He stared at Active Directory for a second but then turned slowly to meThis is all your fault LCpl McSparklenuts YOU made this happen and youre gonna pay big timeHold on now Cpl Elvis chimed in SSgt Tony This was your script wasnt it You made the changes didnt youI uhh yes I made it but I used the stuff that LCpl McSparklenuts had told me would workLCpl McSparklenuts can you come take a look at this pleaseI walked over casually and took a look Sure enough he had run my dummy script again without changing the heading Oh yeah no I didnt say it would work I just told him to take a look at the stuff that I had because it might help thats allCan you fix it the fine SSgt askedProbably give me a couple minutes to take a look at it I went back to my desk and pretended to play around with the script a little bit I closed my editor and ran the script to fix all and everything was perfectAfter verifying I called out SSgt Tony Ive fixed everything All the display names are right nowHe came over and took a look Ok just do me a favor and make sureHe turned to Cpl ElvisCpl Elvis you are hereby banished from this server team Report to the help deskAfter he had skulked out of the room SSgt Tony turned to me and said That was some pretty fancy work What would you have done if it hadnt workedI dont know probably shit myself SSgtWe exchanged laughter A high five was in order I had had my revenge and all was well in the world Well maybe not at the help deskOther

Gambatte,26,22,1njqi1,80,Several years ago the company I worked for changed its internal requirements meaning that all technicians who might work on power cabling had to be externally certified at the companys expense at least My team and I flew through the certification course in a couple of days and resumed our normal work loadAt the time we were supporting technical functions within a building that contained several different specialized schools One of these schools conducted classified network training aka how to build networks to safely handle and contain classified material so everything in that school was locked down to an internal maintenance crew despite everyone on my team maintaining the appropriate security clearance to do that work as wellThe end of the financial year was fast approaching and like all good departments we were finding creative ways to make sure that our accounts were sufficiently empty so as to ensure that our budget didnt get slashed in the coming year One of the ways we did this was to replace and replenish the extensive collection of tools my workshop maintainedOne of the tools that desperately needed to be replaced was a pair of shears great big heavy things that would cut through metal like butter  so they were ideal for cutting through large cables one a single clean bite Not something we did often which was why these shears had gone so long with out being replacedWe finally got the shears replaced and the old pair was disposed of On the FIRST DAY that the old shears were irrevocably gone from the workshop Brilliant Guy shows up from the lockeddown school maintenance crew The conversation went more or less as followsgt BG Hey I need to borrow some tools not an uncommon occurrencegt ME Sure thing What do you needgt BG Wire strippers and cutters mainly We got some new kit and I need to make up some power leads but I dont have all the tools I need in the school maintenance kitgt ME Oh yeah Did you get the external certification donegt BG Yes Just finished the course last week actuallygt ME Nice Did you want one of my guys to make up the cables for you Theyre not busy honestly they could use the extra workgt BG Nah Ive got it I havent got much on myself actuallygt ME No worries One of the guys will grab the tools for you just sign for them on your way out Give me a shout if you need a handNot even  minutes later the power suddenly goes out in the building We scramble into action shutting down as much of the servers that are running on UPS as gracefully as possible basically getting the building into a completely poweredoff state without significantly breaking anything Once we were sure our gear was okay we started the investigation Sure enough the trail leads us straight into the secured school to the new equipment rackAs it turned out Brilliant Guy had wired a power plug on to his cable plugged it into a live socket run the reel of nowlive cable out to the rack location then cut through the cable somehow managing without causing himself any injury to trip every breaker between himself and the main building feed including the main inverter breaker  and melting a perfectly circular section of the jaws of my BRAND NEW SHEARSTLDR If youre going to try to electrocute yourself dont break my tools while doing it,1380671438.0,The joys of certification,102,TalesFromTechsupport,hot

mcsparklenuts,47,73,1nh4jd,307,This is my first tale I hope it finds a home here Please be gentleThe setting Four score and seven years ago err maybe just five actually This tale begins in  I had just finished my occupational training in the military and was taking my place amongst the enlisted ranks in my first unit During the check in process for the unit I was assigned to the company that was getting ready to deploy in a couple months There was a lot of training going on and I was coming in right in the middle of it I also received my assignment within the company I was going to be part of the Server TeamNow I may have been a little overly excited about this I had just completed a year of training including boot camp combat training and MOS school and I was ready to put my knowledge to the test I had mixed feelings about going on deployment but this is what I had signed up for Yeah I specifically joined the military to play on computers Dont judge meFor the most part new joins to a unit are not actually greeted that fondly In fact generally new joins are referred to as boots until the boot camp brainwashing has worn off They can be obnoxious and annoying and nobody really wants to deal with the guy that is so afraid to move an inch that they ask for permission to walk Well I was about as boot as they cameBeing on the Server Team was a highly coveted position Everybody wanted to get their chance to play with the cool stuff mostly because help desk and LAN are a bore fest Here I was a fresh boot getting a prime spot while others had been waiting a year or more hoping against hope that they could be where I was so unceremoniously thrown And I later found out why but that is a story for another daySo there I was first day on the job I had come in during the middle of a training evolution and everything was running pretty smoothly Sure there was a minor hiccup here and there but nothing critical I was ready to start doing cool shitWait not so fast As the most junior member of the team and the lowest ranking I was going to be doing the tasks no one else wanted to do This pretty much consisted of server health checks There were about  servers that we were working with and the health checks I was supposed to be running was an Excel spreadsheetmadechecklist that was about a mile long Going through each of the servers and doing the checks manually took about six hours and incidentally the checks had to be run every six hours So every day I was supposed to spend my entire shift running health checksWell after about the first five minutes doing this it was getting pretty old After an hour I think the sight of the poorly formatted excel sheet was making me physically ill But being in the military it puts the lotion on its skin and it doesnt ask questionsBy day three I had figured out that I could actually create my own custom MMC from which I could gather over half of the information This cut down the time it took to do server checks by about half But I was not content I did the checks and in the free time that was left over I researched how I could make things better Network monitoring software the obvious solution was out of the question There was no way they were going to make purchase like that for a training evolution So I decided to try my hand at a little scripting I was pretty new to the concept but I had a little programming background from for dummies books That and my knowledge of the Great G got me throughExcitedly every step of the way I was letting my middle supervisor lets call him Cpl Elvis know what I was doing He seemed to appreciate the enthusiasm and really didnt have a problem with me spending the time on the project so long as the server checks were also getting done and he could watch whatever movies he had brought into the office that day your taxdollars at workAfter about three weeks juggling the scripting with the server checks cleaning the bathroom and insertrandomtaskshere I managed to come up with a pretty functional script I was happy with the results It didnt create a fancy web page or autofill the Excel sheet but I could run the script review the output and fill out the Excel sheet in about  minutesBeing proud of my accomplishment I presented the script to Cpl Elvis and showed him all that it could do in its infinite glory He was particularly impressed and told me he was going to show what I did to the Server Chief SSgt TonySo I go about doing my thing basking in my own glory I didnt hear anything that day and I wasnt necessarily expecting to It was what happened the next day that took me by surprise and showed me precisely the environment I would be working in for the next four yearsSSgt Tony came into the office for shift changeover that morning This was a special occasion He had an announcement to makeGood morning my fine young minions I wanted to take a second to talk to you about the way we are doing server checks It has come to my attention that Cpl Elvis has taken the time to write a script to gather information from the servers so that you can fill out an excel spreadsheet WHY THE FK ARENT YOU FKERS USING THE NETWORK MONITORING SOFTWARE WE PAID OVER K FOR THAT STNeedless to say I was furious I had spent three weeks on that script to  have Cpl Elvis take full credit for my hard work and dedication and  find out that pretty much everything I had done was irrelevant I couldnt express my anger for fear of sounding disrespectful a chargeable offence in the military so my only option was to sit there and fume about itWe broke from our meeting and did our changeover Nothing really important as I recall There usually was never anything important It was then that SSgt Tony called over to me and asked for a word in private This was a pretty bustling building mind you Simulations were abound and there was really no trulyprivate location So naturally we went to the maintenance closetI found out at that time that SSgt Tony was actually a pretty cool guy He had looked over the code of the script and seen immediately at the top  Created by PFC McSparklenuts Cpl Elvis hadnt even bothered to write himself in thereWe talked for a bit He was pretty impressed with what I had done being so fresh out of school a school that is not known for its excellence in quality and apparently Cpl Elvis had a history of taking credit for other peoples work He explained that Cpl Elvis was a shining example of what not to be and that he was only on the server team as a running joke amongst the section chiefsHe gave me one piece of advice before we left that maintenance closet Get even Do whatever it takes but dont be disrespectful And even I did get but that is a tale for the next installmentEdit I

ThePlat,5,15,1ngj0l,101,Well here we go finally done lurking and figure I might share a story for my first postSo a few years back I got my first job in IT I was hired on as a temp at a nonprofit that offers vocational rehabilitation services including a clerical training program to adults who have lost their job for various reasons I should note that at this point I had no formal IT training and simply used what I had learned from building and fixing my familys computers Needless to say I extremely nervous that people would ask me overly complicated questions that would just make me look like an idiot My job at first was to simply load an image on  new computers for the clerical classroomAbout two weeks in we were ready to deploy all the new machines One of the full time guys and I went to the classroom and started on one row of computers so the students in the other rows could keep working Out of the blue I had an older gentleman ask if I could take a look at his computer because it was possessed as he described itI walk over to the machine and just saw a plain normal desktop I grabbed the mouse and tried to get into Control Panel but as soon as I opened the window it closed again I clicked on other programs and theyd instantly shut down as well I right clicked on the desktop and a new folder would spontaneously appear before I even saw the menu open I was nervous this was the first big problem Ive run across and Im standing in the front row of a room of about  people As I go through all the possible things it could be I looked down and saw the students workbook open on the desk Finally I decided to try to restart the computer As I reached for the power button I noticed something peculiar about the computer there was no keyboard After a moment it dawned on me I picked the heavy workbook off the keyboard placed it aside and the computer miraculously fixed itself That was definitely the moment when I learned to approach a problem with a lowest common denominator mindset,1380569469.0,Makes me feel as clueless as the user,116,TalesFromTechsupport,hot
