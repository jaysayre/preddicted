NovelIdea,8,0,1ri89x,14,I was trying to explain the expanding universe to my kid and told him we know its expanding because light from distant galaxies gets redshifted in direct proportion to their distance from us He wanted to know why that HAD to mean the universe was expanding and said but what if light just lost energy steadily as it went wouldnt that look the sameHaving reached the limits of my education I went out on a limb and speculated that we must know that light doesnt lose energy over distance and left it at thatHe may have been satisfied with that but now Im curious How DO we know expansion is the cause of red shift,How do we know red shift is caused by the universe expanding and not by something else,14,askscience,new

LetThemEatWar,5,2,1rgf8v,11,I know that they say an area of hot air becomes less dense and so it rises above colder areas of air However this seems to be treating areas of gas molecules as though they are a coherent aggregation like a solidTo explain my question let me refer to an example a plank of wood floats because the molecules constituting it are less densely packed and so water is held down more strongly pushing up the wood relative to the water at least thats my understanding But what if there was a single constituent molecule from that wood existing in the water Would it float It is neither densely nor sparsely aggregated existing all by itself So back to my original question arent the individual molecules that make up a heated area of air independent like a single molecule from that wooden plank And if so why do they act like an aggregated body with those molecules around them just because they are at the same temperature Thanks Hope this made sense to someone,Why does a single gas molecule which is hot rise above another one which is cool,13,askscience,new

BackThatThangUp,1,1,1r6lk9,1,Hi allMy understanding as a layperson is that casein is the component in milk that helps to counteract the capsaicin that causes the hotness of spicy foods  It apparently does this by surrounding the fatty capsaicin molecule and dragging it away from the taste buds in much the way that soap surrounds and then pulls away grease Im curious if a solution containing a significant amount of isolated casein would do a better job of pulling away the capsaicin on the tongue and tastebuds or if milk already happens to contain the maximum effective amount of casein for that purpose Would it be effective enough to justify bothering with it Also would there be any drawbacks to a solution containing so much casein such as toxicity Would it be effective as a gargling solution like Listerine for spicy foods if that was the case,Would a solution containing a significant amount of casein do a more effective job of soothing the burn one experiences when eating spicy foods than an equivalent amount of milk,2,askscience,new

YouRackaDisciprine,4,1,1r6tl1,1,It seems like as time passes DNA polymerase genes that make fewer and fewer errors are likely to become more common since they will more faithfully copy their own genes Obviously there is some baseline level of fidelity necessary for reproduction but a completely error free polymerase will not allow for any adaptation at all Is there an optimal error rate for evolution This question cant be answered without further qualification since it is not clear what exactly is being optimized ie evolution does not have a goal but Id like to hear your thoughts My real question is this Do all species ultimately reach some evolutionary plateau or at least approach it asymptotically as the fidelity of the DNA replication system approaches  Note Im aware that DNA copying relies on various proteins besides just DNA polymerase to copy genes but that doesnt really matter Ultimately there is some system of proteins that replicates DNA and their overall fidelity will tend to increase with time ,Does the genetic mutation rate level off with time,2,askscience,new

rtechnix,2,1,1r329d,6,Obviously the way tectonics and the hot spots work the islands get older as you move NW Naturally this means that erosion will generally make those islands further from the current location of the hotspot smaller However is this enough to explain the rate of decrease in island size or even what appears to be the old island size looking at the wide shallow peak of the seamount in the bathymetry or is there something else too Such as the plate slowing down and giving the hotspot more time to form volcanoesOr alternatively I suppose the question could be rephrased as were the average largest sizes of the islands in the chain about as big as the current main islands or noI ask because some of while some of the closest atolls look like they made had a similar land size in the past to current islands looking at the bathymetry with a large flat shallow part and more gently sloping sides past about Maro Reef they suddenly become much smaller and steeper Around Midway and further up theyre just specks Are the erosion of the seamounts enough to explain this or were those islands actually much smaller too,Is the decreasing in size of the Hawaiian island chain going northwest due to just erosionatollformation or are there reasons why more recent islands have had a larger peak size,7,askscience,new

puhpow,12,1,1r0cxy,4,Light confuses me and I was hoping someone could help clear up a few questions I hadSo nothing can travel faster than the speed of light And the closer something does travel to the speed of light the slower time goes relative to that object Is this correct So theoretically if something travels faster than the speed of light this object would travel back in time I was hoping someone could explain to me why light and time are directly relatedI believe my confusion arises because I find myself comparing light to sound For example if someone fires a gun it takes time before that sound reaches you If you outrun the sound you will not hear the gunshot for a second but it doesnt mean the gunshot never happenedWhy is it different for light Using a similar example if a star explodes it takes time before that light reaches you I would assume that if you outran the light it would only mean that you wouldnt see that happen for a bit and not that you were outrunning the event itselfDoes that make sense Hopefully I explained my confusion clearly Thanks,Question about the speed of light and why it is directly related to time,5,askscience,new
