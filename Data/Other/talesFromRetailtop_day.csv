DolfyuttSrednaz,58,45,1rh8hc,204,I have got to say after working  years in retail parents should be responsible for their childrens actions I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses but I never blame the kids I usually dont even blame the parents because kids are kids but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth I blame the parents that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes reminding customers to keep their little shits in line So when a customer like the one I had comes in I usually inform my manager who will be called Jared of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance A middleaged couple stumbles into the store with their  year old son They head off to furniture but their son makes a beeline to toys I immediately call Jared and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible Before the kid makes it to toys he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers After  complaints Jared stops the kid and drags him to his parents who dont give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off The kid bolts towards toys and stars ripping toys down off the shelf The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom Once in there he places them on the floor and proceeds to urinate on them Jared walks in on him finishing up and drags the kid back to his parents leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him Jared tells the parents what he did and that they have to clean up the mess This switches the parents into rage mode They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this And he will be punished severely when they get home Jared tells them calmly I am punishing you not your child You guys made no effort to control him and even brushed me off after the first incident You guys will clean up every mess he has made and then you can leave You are no longer welcomed here They start yelling profanities at him and their kid saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldnt have to put up with this After they cleaned up they left empty handed Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation It is the second worst customers I have ever had even if I didnt directly deal with them The worst by far has to be a couple out of towners That is for another day though Thank you all for reading this and tell me about your nightmare parentschildren in your store,Parents not their kids should be punished,249,talesFromRetail,top_day

adelajoy,15,16,1rg29x,71,I spent two years working at a big warehousestyle grocery store I worked mostly as a cashier but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a weekMost of the crappy moments have all blurred together but there are a few particular moments that stick outThis grocery store is the only one in the area that doesnt bag your groceries for you Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down away from the till This speeds orders up requires less staff saves money and drops prices People occasionally complain about it but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them theyre welcome to  The store isnt exactly famous for customer service but I think the prices make up for thisI was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time This meant that my belts would often get full I had ways to deal with this I knew how fast people packed I knew how soon a belt would clear I was really good at my job One day the lines were insanely long I was working really fast everyone was buying a lot I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts so I squeezed the smaller order down a little watched for a moment and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him I started scanning the next order and smiled at the customers  a man and his very pregnant wifeThe wife snapped at me Can you just waitExcuse meCan you wait I dont want you to crowd out that other guyI looked and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries I stopped scanning anyways and maybe glared at the lady I dont really like it when other people tell me how to do my jobEventually he was packed and gone so I started scanning again While I had been waiting I had lined all of their canned goods up I can scan cans super fast if theyre all really close I started scanning the canned goods grabbing a can tossing it to my other hand and setting it on the other belt Except that this woman had walked around The belt she got was behind me and was standing behind me trying to bag the cans as I scanned them Im sorry but Im not actually looking where the cans go I know the space and I need to watch the computer screen not my hands Well she kept trying to grab the one Id just set down which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can I wasnt by any means throwing the cans but I was moving quickly and she was in my space so she was getting hit I didnt actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband So I slowed down apologized and moved on to her other groceriesShe then had a bag of apples She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it and tied it shut I have to weigh each type of fruit separately so I opened the bag weighed the first apple set it aside I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away I weighed the second apple and set it aside He grabbed that one too When I weighed the third my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut but the other two apples were gone I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately he was welcome toThe couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies One of the bags had been ripped all the open right down the middle and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt I considered not telling them because I was mad but I took a deep breath rounded up all of the stray perogies put them in a plastic bag and informed the lady I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag She snippily replied Yes as if I should have just known Some people dont bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line so I always ask Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept goingWhen I finally finished They bought a lot of stuff the husband paid while the wife stormed over to customer service I watched as she talked to my supervisor and eventually a store manager I was getting pretty nervous Oh also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question I was pretty angry by the time they leftAfter they were completely done my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer serviceShe said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me Apparently the conversation went something like thisPregnant Lady I want to complain about the cashier on till Nice Supervisor Till  Do you mean till  I was on   one of my quicktoanger coworkers was on PL No I mean NS Like the girl with brown hair not the blondePL getting frustrated YesNS So what did adelajoy doPL She was rude and short with meNS Adelajoy Are you surePL Yes She also threw canned goods at me ripped open a bag of perogies scattered them everywhere and scattered all of my apples too She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them aroundA store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint which means it probably went in my employee file The lady was calmed down and left and that was the end of it Typically the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints and make sure they wont happen again The fact that I didnt means either the manager simply didnt believe the woman or wasnt concerned because it was my first and only The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened I told her my side and she just laughed it off I admitted to being short and snippy but the rest was just ludicrous I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open considering I told her about them got a new bag and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies Also why would I take the time to do that when I was clearly rushed with everything elseI get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones and tend to be angry shorttempered whatnot but I think theres a line Also the fact that her husband didnt stop her stand up for me or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of

DrunkenBlackBelt,7,11,1rhw8z,56,Im back bitches  About  months ago I got a second job working part time at a mens Big ampTall store  The hours are easy commision is alright and to be honest the customers are generally friendly and awesome  It helps that a lot of them dont have anywhere else to shop Unfortunantly the store isnt as eventul as my past retail jobs  Its just selling clothes and shoes  But Ive gotten a few funny stories that Ill share over time here And with the holidays coming up im sure Ill have plenty more  Welll for your pleasure hopefully I present Boy Are My Feet SoreWARNING GROSSSo recently I began working in a mens store for Big amp Tall sizes  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there  Only store that carries a size   I am too small for the clothes despite being  and slightly overweight  And if Im being honest  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight  lbs this year alone  Now dont get me wrong SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot set it slightly closer to the proper position let it heal and repeat But it never set  correct keeping him from being able to run or exercise or even stand for long periods of time  Its guys like him I feel for  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it Most customers however are just plain old fat guys  I dont want to sound mean or fat shame  But its just poor lifestyle choices and such  I was there  I was lbs shy of  last new years  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices  I dont have as much sympathy for these guys  And that brings us to our story todayIts a sunny fall day  Its midweek and pretty dead  Im in my suit fixing clothes putzing around pretty much just pretending to work  I hear the door chime and in walks an older couple  Probably late s very early s  The lady was using a walker to move around and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her  They seemed like a nice enough couple but as you know those are the ones who always turn into assholesI introduced myself asked how I could help them that day  The man gruffly replied shoes  I brought them to the shoe department  Now my store is small and there is only one small bench to sit on and its in the shoe department  Naturally this oaf takes the seat leaving his frail wife to stand  I could tell she was having difficulty being particularly petire and frail so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband  She thanked me because manners  The man charming fellow that he was just said can you get me some shoes now  It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex gf in a dick sucking contestI offered several suggestions as the gentleman didnt seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted  The man complained that most of our shoes dont even fit him I expressed sympathy as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store  The man looked me up and down and sneered Well you just have big feet I have a health condition that causes this so consider yourself lucky  Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet  And thats when the real horror of this story starts  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals  His feet are hugely swollen and covered in open sores  This guy has diabetes and its eating away at his foot  Sadly its fairly common where I work  What came next however is notI hand him the shoes and take a step back giving him some space to put the shoes on look at them in the mirror see how they feel etc  NOPE  He looks at me like an idiot and says Well I cant put them on myself  I cant bend that far  Put them on for me   Now I am no fan of feet even on a good day  Sure if Im dating someone and they want a footrub and their feet are clean then ill oblige  But other than that I just want nothing to do with that area of the body  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open oozing sores  DBB Sir I just cant do that Im sorryMan  You need to help me  Im a customer and I need serviceDBB There is no way I am doing that sir  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg Its unsanitary for both me and YOU to have me do thatMan Oh just wash your hands after itll be fineHow this man survived  or so years with logic like that will forever amaze me  DBB Absolutely not  Man I want the manger  Ill have your ass for discrimination and harrassmentDBB  I am the manager  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow  If you want corporates phone number Ill give it with my name gladly  The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really  I essentially told him that I wasnt going to touch his feet and if he didnt like the service he could leave Wife is trying to keep the peace  Its not very effective  Husband used Rage  Its inneffective against DBB  Besides my DEF is to high  Anyways i wish there was some more to this  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt  I did hear from corporate the next day though  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in but once I explained about the sores I receieve a Yea that happens all the time Dont worry about it  Sorry if its not very exciting  Im sure Ill have some good ones coming up  Hope you all are surviving

ScaldingSoup,5,6,1rha57,26,So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store  This store didnt pay commission but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance  My sales performance was VERY good  I got more hours a week than most people  During the holiday season we had a lot of seasonal employees as any big retail store normally does  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us  This was not the problem  Her hair was bleached blonde and growing out showing obvious roots and styled in a feathered fashion  She did not know how to wear makeup and what she wore did not flatter her  In this store our dress code was all black   She wore skirts with no stockings but with slouch socks and yeah that was a hot mess  People began to call her the missing link as in to the s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the s but grey now  Reading this you may think that I judged her based on this or have some animosity for people older than me  I do not but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important  Black Friday rolls around and she wears her normal dress of skirt slouch socks and whatnot  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle  She begins waving panties in the air helicopter style like a stripper chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it I want her out  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her  Everywhere she walked she jingledSome time during her short career with the lingerie store she found my phone number on the schedule  I guess they werent giving her enough hours because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine  Weirdest person I ever worked with hands down she takes the cake,Lingerie Store  weirdest employee ever,32,talesFromRetail,top_day

adelajoy,0,1,1ri8kg,22,I spent two years working at a big warehousestyle grocery store I worked mostly as a cashier but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a weekMost of the crappy moments have all blurred together but there are a few particular moments that stick outI realize this isnt the craziest story on here but I will probably never forget this lady Backstory Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag the customer would get it for free up to  The mistake happened because the price tag didnt get changed or was misplaced If they spotted a problem we would go look If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price we gave it to them and changed the tag If the tag was for a different item they didnt get anything I was working the customer service desk and a lady stormed up I had several customers on the go at the moment but it was pretty clear she needed help right away As soon as I could I asked what I could help her with She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner her receipt and a price tag Lets call her Crazy Customer CC for shortCC I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner but it was the wrong price You guys are trying to charge me too muchMe Okay can I see your receiptCC Hands me the receipt I tried to tell the cashier but she didnt believe meMe I checked who her cashier was and it was one of our longtime girls She knew the policy There was no way she didnt believe the customer Okay so the price came up  Ill just send a pricechecker out to see what the tag saidCC Oh I grabbed the price tag already She hands me the price tag This lady is pretty worked up  Im not sure if she just wants to get out of the store or if shes trying to pull one on meA policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf If a customer brings it to you whos to say they didnt take it off the shelf last week and save it They also could have found it in the wrong place somewhere that the stock employees wouldnt have checked to fix the tag As with most stores Ive been to store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies and then see if you can help them anyways No matter the problemIt study the tag and inform her of the policy that the tag would have to be on the shelf I start to let her know I can contact a manager but she snatches the tag back and interrupts meCC Well if thats your policy Ill just put it back on the shelf I was trying to save you some goddamn work but I guess if you guys want to work extra Ill just go put it backShe took off before I could say anything I was just standing at the desk aghast I didnt even know what to say The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind You know the kind that isnt afraid to yell a little handles the worst customers and isnt phased when people call her names Lets call her Jane When the woman was gone I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story She said Okay When she comes back let me know who she is Ill handle herAs soon as I saw the customer coming back I hissed Jane Jane Jane White hat Thats her I then ducked behind the display at customer service and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone I could hear her yelling at Jane I dont know what the verdict was Any other manager and the customer would have gotten the item for free but its hard to say with JaneI remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name I hushed them and told them I was hiding I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those Her Thats the one I was talking to She told me this And drag me back into itIve never hid from a customer before or since Oh Fun fact The price tag she was holding said  a  difference from what she paid and the tag was dated for the week before which means it wasnt the current price Not to say it wasnt still on the shelf but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in especially with how worked up she wasThank goodness for thickskinned supervisors who can handle being yelled at,I guess if you guys want to work extra Ill just go put it back,23,talesFromRetail,top_day
Dannythegirl,5,5,1rh77t,8,I dont know if this is the right place to post this but I needed to share Long time lurker of this subreddit On my phone sorry for wall I am a customer in this story but former multiyear serviceretail employeeToday I was grocery shopping with my two very little children Not a huge chain store but prominent in my state for supporting local foods Many locations I got in line to check out after an eventful and frustrating trip around the store with the kids There was an elderly man checking out ahead of me He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting The cashier was probably  spacey but very sweet woman When it was old guys turn to check out I overheard their conversation at the register and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store The man had some trouble checking out He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused Eventually she explained that he didnt have to keep swiping his card and that his transaction was complete In the mean time she was scanning my items The cashier chatted up a storm with me too Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them I was getting a little impatient at this point because my  and  year old were ready to get the hell out of there but I listened to her stories with patience She was kind tooWhen she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine but it was asking for a signature when I hadnt scanned my card yet Me there must be a mistake I havent slid my card through but its already asking for a signatureCashier no you did you must have forgot looks at screen you swiped your America expressMe No I dont have an Amex see Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me upCashier uh oh that must have been what happenedShe looked panicked but printed the receipt and said Ill just do this AND SIGNED THE RECEIPTCashier Hell be okay he can be so spacey Dont even worry about itShe at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok and that I could wait for a manger She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids I asked her are you sure I feel uncomfortable She told me not to worry and to go ahead and leave And I did I think her career might have ended todayTLDR Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries cashier eventually realized but didnt give a fuck to fix it I got free groceries EDITUPDATE I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post I was in fact horrified I know the groceries werent free I just did not pay for them In my car I wrote down the time my total  and what I thought the mans total was before me  and the name of the cashier I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed  I was planning on calling when I got home and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at nightThis morning I called and spoke with a manager giving him all of my information I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back I will update again when I hear from him,I think her career might have ended today,13,talesFromRetail,top_day

Scott,0,3,1riony,13,Ive met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino This guy takes the cake as the most fuckedup unpleasant guy thats ever darkened our doorstep Well call him Dick because he is oneTo begin with Dick is in the casino for a fuckedup reason Hes dying of cancer or some other terminal disease He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children Of course mathematics says its not going to happen so hes squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing  per spin on a slot machine I wouldnt judge him so harshly for that if he wasnt a colossal asshole Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen See if you win say  and you had  in credit when you hit it when the attendant clears the jackpot your  will still be left on the machine People sometimes forget or dont know this and will leave the money on the machine and walk away so after clearing it most of us will say You still have  left on the machine Of course when I mention this to Dick he flies into a rage screaming I CAN SEE THAT GOD I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after thatI dont put up with that sort of BSthough I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didnt realize who it was And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots He would usually destroy the copy of the WG tax forms we would give him I guess thinking since hes dying he wont need to worry about paying taxes though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department at leastAll of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week At this point Dicks managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else This coupled with the fact that hes losing heavily pisses him off Management gets called over to a machine in my section Im generally pretty curious about these things so I head over there The machines touchscreen retail price quoted to me by a tech as  or so is totally shattered The machine still has  on itwith an inoperable touchscreen theres no way to cash that out on this machine Theres a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing Said the guy was losing got pissed punched the screen threw a piece of paper down and stormed off One of the managers that showed up picks up the paperIts a tornup WG with Dicks name address and social security number on it A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in And of course the whole incident is caught on tapeWe dont know what happened to Dick after that Apparently it became the responsibility of the casinos assistant general manager and she isnt talking Were all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up though,The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail,top_day
GlowingBall,2,3,1rioer,15,These are my Tales of Retail Loss PreventionPart Three  Citizen Snips Aka  The Pants AquaticAs a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before  I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer one of the Big   I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV closed circuit television or security cameras  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly WTF that I have to share  This story opens up with me doing just as I said above  watching people on CCTV  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets are few and far between  I as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring  the phone is going off  Now the phone going off is common place  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off we knowit goes off for us as well to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm we also knowwe see you standing at the door  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesnt call us often  the meat department  The guy on the other end a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is just browsing for over ten minutes  This strikes me as rather odd  Who just hangs out around the meat department  I quickly devise a plan for the situation  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do  The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition  he was going to steal  Oh shit here we go  I declared only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank  Now if you arent familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies  a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another  Kids love to sit there and watch themNo wayis he really going to I whispered as I watched on in awe  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have  After a moment of fishing around he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants  The guy whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidbergs shuffle  All he was missing was yelping out Woop woop woop woop loudly as he went  Needless to say he wasnt too hard to stop  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants  He didnt fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing  After all it is kind of hard to argue that you arent stealing when you have a large lobster shaped bulge in your pantsBonus icing on top of the cake I usually ask the person why they are stealing  It usually wont change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kidsHis kids have some expensive tastes,Loss Prevention Tales Pt   Citizen Snips,18,talesFromRetail,top_day

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,48,1rh8hc,200,I have got to say after working  years in retail parents should be responsible for their childrens actions I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses but I never blame the kids I usually dont even blame the parents because kids are kids but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth I blame the parents that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes reminding customers to keep their little shits in line So when a customer like the one I had comes in I usually inform my manager who will be called Jared of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance A middleaged couple stumbles into the store with their  year old son They head off to furniture but their son makes a beeline to toys I immediately call Jared and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible Before the kid makes it to toys he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers After  complaints Jared stops the kid and drags him to his parents who dont give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off The kid bolts towards toys and stars ripping toys down off the shelf The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom Once in there he places them on the floor and proceeds to urinate on them Jared walks in on him finishing up and drags the kid back to his parents leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him Jared tells the parents what he did and that they have to clean up the mess This switches the parents into rage mode They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this And he will be punished severely when they get home Jared tells them calmly I am punishing you not your child You guys made no effort to control him and even brushed me off after the first incident You guys will clean up every mess he has made and then you can leave You are no longer welcomed here They start yelling profanities at him and their kid saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldnt have to put up with this After they cleaned up they left empty handed Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation It is the second worst customers I have ever had even if I didnt directly deal with them The worst by far has to be a couple out of towners That is for another day though Thank you all for reading this and tell me about your nightmare parentschildren in your store,Parents not their kids should be punished,248,talesFromRetail,top_day

adelajoy,15,15,1rg29x,73,I spent two years working at a big warehousestyle grocery store I worked mostly as a cashier but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a weekMost of the crappy moments have all blurred together but there are a few particular moments that stick outThis grocery store is the only one in the area that doesnt bag your groceries for you Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down away from the till This speeds orders up requires less staff saves money and drops prices People occasionally complain about it but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them theyre welcome to  The store isnt exactly famous for customer service but I think the prices make up for thisI was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time This meant that my belts would often get full I had ways to deal with this I knew how fast people packed I knew how soon a belt would clear I was really good at my job One day the lines were insanely long I was working really fast everyone was buying a lot I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts so I squeezed the smaller order down a little watched for a moment and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him I started scanning the next order and smiled at the customers  a man and his very pregnant wifeThe wife snapped at me Can you just waitExcuse meCan you wait I dont want you to crowd out that other guyI looked and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries I stopped scanning anyways and maybe glared at the lady I dont really like it when other people tell me how to do my jobEventually he was packed and gone so I started scanning again While I had been waiting I had lined all of their canned goods up I can scan cans super fast if theyre all really close I started scanning the canned goods grabbing a can tossing it to my other hand and setting it on the other belt Except that this woman had walked around The belt she got was behind me and was standing behind me trying to bag the cans as I scanned them Im sorry but Im not actually looking where the cans go I know the space and I need to watch the computer screen not my hands Well she kept trying to grab the one Id just set down which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can I wasnt by any means throwing the cans but I was moving quickly and she was in my space so she was getting hit I didnt actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband So I slowed down apologized and moved on to her other groceriesShe then had a bag of apples She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it and tied it shut I have to weigh each type of fruit separately so I opened the bag weighed the first apple set it aside I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away I weighed the second apple and set it aside He grabbed that one too When I weighed the third my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut but the other two apples were gone I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately he was welcome toThe couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies One of the bags had been ripped all the open right down the middle and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt I considered not telling them because I was mad but I took a deep breath rounded up all of the stray perogies put them in a plastic bag and informed the lady I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag She snippily replied Yes as if I should have just known Some people dont bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line so I always ask Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept goingWhen I finally finished They bought a lot of stuff the husband paid while the wife stormed over to customer service I watched as she talked to my supervisor and eventually a store manager I was getting pretty nervous Oh also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question I was pretty angry by the time they leftAfter they were completely done my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer serviceShe said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me Apparently the conversation went something like thisPregnant Lady I want to complain about the cashier on till Nice Supervisor Till  Do you mean till  I was on   one of my quicktoanger coworkers was on PL No I mean NS Like the girl with brown hair not the blondePL getting frustrated YesNS So what did adelajoy doPL She was rude and short with meNS Adelajoy Are you surePL Yes She also threw canned goods at me ripped open a bag of perogies scattered them everywhere and scattered all of my apples too She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them aroundA store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint which means it probably went in my employee file The lady was calmed down and left and that was the end of it Typically the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints and make sure they wont happen again The fact that I didnt means either the manager simply didnt believe the woman or wasnt concerned because it was my first and only The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened I told her my side and she just laughed it off I admitted to being short and snippy but the rest was just ludicrous I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open considering I told her about them got a new bag and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies Also why would I take the time to do that when I was clearly rushed with everything elseI get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones and tend to be angry shorttempered whatnot but I think theres a line Also the fact that her husband didnt stop her stand up for me or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me offTldr Crazyhormones pregnant lady complained about me but the supervisor didnt believe her,In my spare time I like to rip open your groceries and scatter them,88,talesFromRetail,top_day

life and just having to suffer for it Most customers however are just plain old fat guys  I dont want to sound mean or fat shame  But its just poor lifestyle choices and such  I was there  I was lbs shy of  last new years  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices  I dont have as much sympathy for these guys  And that brings us to our story todayIts a sunny fall day  Its midweek and pretty dead  Im in my suit fixing clothes putzing around pretty much just pretending to work  I hear the door chime and in walks an older couple  Probably late s very early s  The lady was using a walker to move around and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her  They seemed like a nice enough couple but as you know those are the ones who always turn into assholesI introduced myself asked how I could help them that day  The man gruffly replied shoes  I brought them to the shoe department  Now my store is small and there is only one small bench to sit on and its in the shoe department  Naturally this oaf takes the seat leaving his frail wife to stand  I could tell she was having difficulty being particularly petire and frail so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband  She thanked me because manners  The man charming fellow that he was just said can you get me some shoes now  It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex gf in a dick sucking contestI offered several suggestions as the gentleman didnt seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted  The man complained that most of our shoes dont even fit him I expressed sympathy as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store  The man looked me up and down and sneered Well you just have big feet I have a health condition that causes this so consider yourself lucky  Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet  And thats when the real horror of this story starts  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals  His feet are hugely swollen and covered in open sores  This guy has diabetes and its eating away at his foot  Sadly its fairly common where I work  What came next however is notI hand him the shoes and take a step back giving him some space to put the shoes on look at them in the mirror see how they feel etc  NOPE  He looks at me like an idiot and says Well I cant put them on myself  I cant bend that far  Put them on for me   Now I am no fan of feet even on a good day  Sure if Im dating someone and they want a footrub and their feet are clean then ill oblige  But other than that I just want nothing to do with that area of the body  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open oozing sores  DBB Sir I just cant do that Im sorryMan  You need to help me  Im a customer and I need serviceDBB There is no way I am doing that sir  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg Its unsanitary for both me and YOU to have me do thatMan Oh just wash your hands after itll be fineHow this man survived  or so years with logic like that will forever amaze me  DBB Absolutely not  Man I want the manger  Ill have your ass for discrimination and harrassmentDBB  I am the manager  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow  If you want corporates phone number Ill give it with my name gladly  The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really  I essentially told him that I wasnt going to touch his feet and if he didnt like the service he could leave Wife is trying to keep the peace  Its not very effective  Husband used Rage  Its inneffective against DBB  Besides my DEF is to high  Anyways i wish there was some more to this  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt  I did hear from corporate the next day though  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in but once I explained about the sores I receieve a Yea that happens all the time Dont worry about it  Sorry if its not very exciting  Im sure Ill have some good ones coming up  Hope you all are surviving

GlowingBall,2,2,1rioer,16,These are my Tales of Retail Loss PreventionPart Three  Citizen Snips Aka  The Pants AquaticAs a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before  I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer one of the Big   I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV closed circuit television or security cameras  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly WTF that I have to share  This story opens up with me doing just as I said above  watching people on CCTV  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets are few and far between  I as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring  the phone is going off  Now the phone going off is common place  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off we knowit goes off for us as well to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm we also knowwe see you standing at the door  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesnt call us often  the meat department  The guy on the other end a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is just browsing for over ten minutes  This strikes me as rather odd  Who just hangs out around the meat department  I quickly devise a plan for the situation  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do  The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition  he was going to steal  Oh shit here we go  I declared only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank  Now if you arent familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies  a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another  Kids love to sit there and watch themNo wayis he really going to I whispered as I watched on in awe  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have  After a moment of fishing around he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants  The guy whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidbergs shuffle  All he was missing was yelping out Woop woop woop woop loudly as he went  Needless to say he wasnt too hard to stop  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants  He didnt fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing  After all it is kind of hard to argue that you arent stealing when you have a large lobster shaped bulge in your pantsBonus icing on top of the cake I usually ask the person why they are stealing  It usually wont change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kidsHis kids have some expensive tastes,Loss Prevention Tales Pt   Citizen Snips,18,talesFromRetail,top_day

HawaiianNoHam,4,8,1rhi3l,0,I generally enjoy the stories I hear in TFR but Ive come across a few that read like the shower fantasies of disgruntled workers So a humble request If its fiction put a tag in Fiction is good fiction is healthy fiction is what makes us love Clerks Dogma and Catching Fire Its what makes uramblesofftopic my favorite novelty accountBut hearing the restaurant robbery scene from Pulp Fiction told as truth just ruins the story for me Maybe just a story tag to let us know youre improving your imaginative skillsTheres no rule against fiction in this subreddit I checked so this is just a personal request Thanks,META Fiction is a buzzkill,5,talesFromRetail,top_day
