YourFederalOverlord,52,215,1rg4z6,814,When I was in middle school many years ago I had a Digital Arts teacher whos job it was to teach us about computers and how to use them correctly  She did not do that at all instead opting to give us the same typing routines several times over and call it a class  She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year this being back in   She attempted to get tickets but the website was overloaded so instead she did the logical thing and forced her classes to get them for her telling us all to reload the page until it came back online so that she could get her tickets  Failure to comply would mean no credit for the day as well as a black mark on our record  I wasnt pleased by this so I having figured out her administrators password a few days earlier she had it on a sticky note on her desk like a chump surreptitiously logged into the system and added the tickets page to the list of blocked websites before changing her password to  logging out and feigning shock at the sudden block to the page  It took her almost a week to figure out how to unblock the page though the school did figure out the password pretty quickly and she never did end up going to the World Series  God Im horrible    ,No tickets for you,1029,pettyrevenge,top_day

LovesEwoks,72,67,1ri9iq,385,I have a recipe that my now deceased grandmother had always used for a potato dish Over the years I perfected this recipe experimenting with ingredients and seasonings creating a nearly perfect dish its always a hit at parties dinners and gatheringsAfter I was married I brought this potato dish to one of my spouses family gatherings People raved and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering  I am happy to oblige since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together The potato dish quickly becomes known as LovesEwoks Potatoes well my actual name not screen name Although I always refer to them as my grandmothers potatoesOver the next few years I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday mostly by request I share this recipe many times with my spouses family every aunt uncle cousin and sibling who asks I even give some tips for best resultsA week before Thanksgiving my sisterinlaw calls me explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her inlaws house and asks for specifics on the recipe the exact brands of products I use where I purchased the pan etc I go into great detail giving her step by step instructions for perfect resultsA few days later my motherinlaw calls me asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering Oh I thought I would bring the potatoes She informs me that my sisterinlaw Kelly is bringing potatoes and I should bring something else This is not a problem for me since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmotherWe gather for Thanksgiving and in walks Kelly with her potato dish She removes the cover and its funny because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring I had just assumed she was going to bring something else Nope exact same recipe exact same pan She walks around telling everyone you MUST try Kellys potatoes At first I thought this might have been a joke so I let it go this is not the first time she has acted very jealous and did things for attention In the past she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skillsChristmas gathering same situation I decide to ignore it and let her have Kellys potatoes  just not worth dealing with her I had brought along a dessert again people raved and requested I bring it again at Easter thanks grandma It seems I might have a new signature dish My sisterinlaw calls me a few days before Easter asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas can you believe it I give her the recipe except this time I leave out a very small but critically important ingredient Easter gathering I bring my the dessert as requested by the host Just as I suspected in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty until she said everyone must try this I found the recipe on pinterest Needless to say they were terribleSteal my grandmas recipes and call them your own Hope you like recipes that are missing an ingredient,You followed the recipe and it still tastes different How strange,452,pettyrevenge,top_day

squirrelboy,7,15,1rhb3g,22,I live in a pretty scummy college house with  other guys It isnt nice but when it is clean it can almost feel like homeUnfortunately one of my roommates lets call him LB for Lazy Bum as his name suggests is incredibly lazy He doesnt accept any responsibility for the mess he contributes to the houseAmong many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen Hey somebodys got to do the dishes Theyre all HIS I told him flat out but he refused to do themI usually use my own dishes I have  plate  spoon  fork and  bowl I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I dont need a knife or cup I wash each as soon as I am done eating I cant stand dirty dishesSo for the petty revenge muwhahahaha I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart I totally looked like a serial killer I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched I could tell he didnt like this at all but he couldnt say anything because he knew they were all hisUnfortunately this didnt stop him from doing it again After one of my other roommates washed all of LBs dishes he began to fill the sink againTonight it shall end I used my plastic bin amp bleach trick again but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car I had to drive on the interstate to get to work and on my way I rolled down the window at mph It didnt matter that it was  degrees F I took the bowl threw it out the window and watched it shatter into a thousand pieces That was one of the most satisfying things I have seen I will continue doing this until he has no dishes to fill the sink withTldr My lazy roommate fills the sink with dishes so I throw them out the window of my car at highway speeds,Fill the sink with dirty dishes Not any more,37,pettyrevenge,top_day
