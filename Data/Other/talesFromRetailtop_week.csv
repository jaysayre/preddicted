metamaxwell,386,386,1r14xk,1111,So I may cry I was  minutes into typing this post up when a power surge hit and every thing at work went down including the computer and now I have to type this again That in itself may become another postDisclaimer Standard stuff First time post Massive wall of text etcBackground I work at a small privately owned retro game store You name it I have something for itNow this tale takes place a few days after GTA  came out You see on this slow day at work I was killing time doing what I usually do playing SNES games on one of our displays On the rare occasion when a customer would come in Id pause my game greet them and offer whatever help I could provide then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store Now it had been an hour or so since I had last had anyone in the store so I was itching to sell something when Mom and Kid came in I jumped up and gave them my spiel and they assured me they were fine and were just looking Well a few minutes go by when Kid and Mom come up to me with you guessed it GTA  in hand Kid has that look of pure bliss on his face The one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his  and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun Except there is one thing between him and that future A fell and powerful guardian That would be meI should take this time to mention that for the most part I dont like telling people they cant buy something It is sad not only because Im missing out on a sale but Im also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you Your card was declined You have to be  or older to buy this etc are phrases I dislike Except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world For you the entitled the bratty the liars the assholes the pricks the scammers the schemers etc To you I find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fatteningBack to the story So whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a M rated game I am required by law to ask for an ID or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen Now most parents fall into one of two general categories The I dont care I just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money type and the Im actually have an idea about what is going on here and Im totally cool with it now take my money type Those are the ones that just say yes and having done my duty and covering my ass legally I move on and make the sale Not Mom No when I tell her about the M rating she actually stops and ASKS ME WHY ITS M RATED My heart stopped I heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when Mario picks up a coin This honestly never happens Ive worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed Kids heart drops at this But you can still see hope in his eyes hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming Dudebe cool NOPEI like my job and I like to think I do it well Im paid to play and talk about games from the Atari on up to the PS and Xbox One afterall So when someone asks me about a game Im going to tell you EVERY THING about it And thats just what Mom gets First blow Language Moms approval doesnt take any visible damage Kid is optimisitc and reassures Mom he is mature enough to handle itQuick second punch Drugs and alcohol I think I saw a grimacebut Mom recovers quickly Kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like Wormtongue in LoTRIm getting serious now Violence Finally a crack in the armor Mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure Kid REALLLY wants this game and can handle it Kid puts on his most mature look I swear if he had a tux monocle and top hat he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion He does he can he could pay the damn mortgage right now hes that matureYoure doing well in keeping the situation favorable Kid but I have a secret weapon Nudity Yep as some of you know GTA  didnt get the partial nudity rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob Nope Now this is what Kid feared was coming and hoped I either didnt know or wasnt going to share it but I did Critical hit TKO Mom was out She refused to get it and told Kid he wasnt going anywhere near that game until he was old enough I thought that was the end of it but damn Kid was quick on his feet He played the Friends already have it card followed quickly by dad will be okay with it call himSo she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him meanwhile Im left in the store getting the most venomhatespiterage filled look Ive seen Seriously I think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me Not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff Oh no I mean slow and painful years of torture kind Well Mom comes back in and is on the fence again Apparently Dad wasnt against it but she still was Im given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what I told her and I do and Mom gets the phone back This time she stays in the store and I must have convinced Dad because this time she hangs up and tells Kid he is not getting the game Reddit let me tell you I have seen some tantrums explosions complete personality turn arounds etc in my time but DAMN Kid takes the cake All illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book He screams he threatens he cries he begs every thing I would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly  minutes so Ill just give you my three favorite parts because I can remember those nearly verbatim Favorite  Kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage Why is this hilarious Because while doing all this he is telling Mom that he is mature enough to handle the game and that the nudity isnt even a main part of it and he wont look at it and he doesnt have to do it etc Except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission So yeah Also the tantrum technique Not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for somethingFavorite  The xxx has it so screw you Ill just play it there Now kudos to Mom she handled this like a pro Her response You wont when I call every one of your friends parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game Im also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playingFavorite  This one was just stupid which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious Kid yells at Mom telling her he doesnt need her and hell just come back and buy the game in a few days himself Mom not fazed or even looking at me asks me if he could buy it without her To help her get her point across I ask if he is  she assures me he isnt and I tell them that without an ID proving he is  or older no one can legally sell him that gameThe night ends with her dragging his bawling snot dripping raging ass out of my store apologizing profusely for his antics and before they get out of earshot I can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments hes going to recieve after his behavior Reddit I love moments like that It had it all Drama laughter lies betrayal threats crying bargaining and a parent actually acting like a parent Oh and Kid was about  by the way Be honest you all thought he was  didnt you Ive got  years of tales piled up if you want moreTldr You guys are cheatingfine Kid pitches Mom refuses to catch,How I made a Kid cry or Tales from a

NotACEO,180,222,1rdpxf,907,Heres a relatively short tale today folksIve posted here a few times before and it should bear mentioning that Im a bank teller and have been for  years  My story takes me back to when I first started working as a TellerI had gone through the mandatory day supervised portion of my training and apparently passed with flying colors and was shortly given my own drawer and station within the bank  I was technically under the  day Probationary stage but for all intents and purposes I was a fullfledged employee  Two weeks go by and Im steadily getting more and more comfortable  Any mistakes I made were small and easy fixes until I made a rather large mistake and very nearly shat my pantsA customer walks in hands me his  payroll check and says hed like to deposit it into his account  All right no problem heres your receipt have a nice day  He leaves and thats that  Or so I thought  About  minutes later my supervisor walks up with a piece of paper and says Hey NotACEO did you help this guy a few minutes agoWhen I acknowledge that I did in fact help him with this deposit my supervisor calmly tells me to access this guys account and to tell him if I noticed anything off  So I didand immediately noticed something wrong  Theres a small portion of our teller screens that tells us if there is any activity in that account for the current dayI can see if hes been to the grocery store a gas station or if hes made any deposits  Sitting in the Deposit section iswait for ita deposit made  minutes ago for the nice little sum of   With my teller signature on itRead that sentence above again for me would youI deposited one hundred million dollars into this guys account when it only should have been  dollarsNoticing what I did makes my heart rate skyrocket and the words Ohshitohshitohshit start to fly about in my mind  Im currently trying to think of various ways that I can commit suicide when my dear old teller supervisor starts laughing at me  He affectionately calls me an idiot and carefully walks me through in deleting the transaction and replacing it with the correct amount which I had been completely unaware that we could do up until that pointTurns out I had entered the customers ACCOUNT number in the DOLLAR section which it automatically assumed was the amount deposited  Management thought it was hilarious and had initially meant to make me sweat bullets for a while before telling me how easy it was to fix but apparently I looked like I was legitimately about to have a heart attack so they took pity on meOops,Oh manIm gonna get fired arent I An Amusing Screwup on My Part,1129,talesFromRetail,top_week

diinomunster,71,106,1rcku1,393,Hello my lovelies I had a wonderful pa shift Friday into Saturday at my lovely gas stationCStore Im a softy who just cant say no This offense happened around am Now my gas station is in a really dumb place Were in the main Highway of our city which is why were a  store but were in an upper middle class neighborhood right by the middle and high school I dont see much traffic between midnight and four am That is until some shitty little dive bar called Shotz opened up somewhere behind us Somewhere because theres a huge parking lot behind us that situates a Kmart a pizza Hut a burger restaurant a funeral home yeah idk either and then the bar is somewhere in that mess So anyway between  amp  I get a nice hour of drunks Our local police force is always really nice They know that its either me  lbs female or J scrawny but seriously awesome little white guy working alone I work the weekends so I get the worst drunk traffic The officer who has our district has taken to sitting in the high school parking lot across the street during this hour with their headlights trained on our store I seriously give these guys so much free coffee The usual weekend officer stopped in and introduced his ride along that he had fresh out of the Academy Super nice guy Gave them coffee and a bag of donuts I was about to toss we get them fresh every day so they arent dried out if they were bagged and thanked them when they said theyd be keeping an eye out for me Around ish they had nabbed a drunk driver yay team and I was watching them do the field check stuff from across the street Now a quick inside to give you an idea of our store layout Im on my phone but will make a crappy picture in paint later and post it in an edit The cashier area is right smack in the middle of the store When you walk in theres the newspaper stand and the back counter area to your right coffee to your left and if you go waaaay left our bathrooms are down a little hall You have to walk around to your right following the counters to leave through the exit door This is so you cant sneak out behind us and steal something Queue am I have a college guy vomiting in the bathroom and a super nice guy whos browsing our snack food quietly In comes this super drunk middle aged black male He starts hanging on the newspaper stand and trying to climb over the back counter wall its about  feet high He will be Drunk Guy DG DG Hey How much for a cab to Menomininity I assumed menominee which is a city maybe twenty minutes from us Me Im not sure We can call a cab and ask Do you have a certain cab company you like to use DG just look some numbers up for me on the Internet Me I dont have the Internet here I have a phone book though you can borrow Please note this was NOT the answer he was looking for DG NIGGA FUCK YOUR PHONE BOOK Yeah Okay He proceeded to grab my newspaper stand and throw it behind him into the coffee counter and started storming off towards the bathrooms On his way he took out the fruit stand the magazine rack and the little employee break table in the hallway Drunk college kid comes tearing out of the bathroom That black guy grabbed me by the jacket pulled me out of the stall then ripped your toilet paper dispenser off the wall and threw it at me Uhh What The nice guy has been quietly picking up all the scattered fruit despite me telling him he didnt have to because I have to throw it all away anyway insists hell stay until this guy leaves Me Yeah I dont have the time for this Im just calling the police I get on the phone with none emergency explain my situation and ask if officer X can send his ride along over just to help keep this guy in control until another officer can come in Not even a minute later RideAlong is jogging across the street as officer X is piling the drunk driver in his back seat and I guess radioing the location for another officer DG comes out of the bathroom all sheepish and apologetic And then he sees the officer DG AW THE FUCK YOU YOU DIRTY ASS SKANK WHORE BITCHthe officer calmly cuffs DG who surprisingly didnt fight I sell nice guy some candy and put his coffee on my nightly expense College kid dipped out at some point I think he was underaged A second officer shows up and runs the drunk guys info as Im talking to RideAlong for my statement Turns out DG has a warrant out on him in North Carolina for skipping out on parole His friends apparently got tired of his drunk ass and left him at the bar Apparently Shotz has been doing last call at  like normal but then locking their restrooms

Tufty,32,58,1rdse5,291,This is a story from long long ago that I am copying from another website that I posted it to before discovering Reddit I thought you all might enjoy itThis happened a while ago but it just popped into my head so Im gonna do my best to remember itI used to work nights on the checkout of a  hour supermarket Now in this particular store there were certain things that you couldnt do on the checkout without a managers key and a code generally anything that would change the total by more than  including voiding items would require you to call a managerSince we worked nights they gave the key and the code to  women who worked on the cigarette kiosk because they had worked there for a long time there was always at least one of them working and they didnt want us bothering the on duty night manager every time there was any mistake All worked fine normallyUntil the day that neither of these women were in Did the management organise anyone else who had a code to be in the area Did they buggeryThere were  of us working that night and the other  were quite new on the department We did our best but I was the first to go down A customer had read the price on a baby stroller wrong and wanted it voided I put a call out for the on duty manager then apologised to the people in my line and explained that it might take a couple of minutes The line wasnt very long because it was getting quite late There was a little grumbling but everyone seemed fairly understanding minutes pass I put out another call for the manager to come down URGENTLY I advise everyone to start going through the other  tills I am starting to get worried but we still have  tills running so its not the end of the world The lines get longerThen one of the other girls accidentally scans something through twice It happens the scanners sometimes just glitch The item cost more than  and bam  checkouts are locked down I direct people through the lone surviving till The poor girl on there was clearly struggling but there was nothing else to be done I get hold of a store phone and call the manager directly No answer I call again Nothing I put another call out over the speakers Apologise to all customersThen it happens The last till goes down Another double scan The line is  people deep And this is at midnight when its odd to have more than  customer at a time I try to call the manager again Nada I call a team leader explain the problem and beg him to find me a manager any manager I turn to the ever increasing group of customers and do my best to explain whats going on I am practically on my knees begging them for forgiveness Some fo them have been waiting for  minutes I break from the script and try to explain as a human being that there isnt anything I could do I wish there was something anything I could do We cant open any other tills They are all shut down and even if I had the key to turn them on all of our log ins are locked into these tillsFinally someone saunters to the tills They arent a manager They had been sent down by the on duty manager because he had heard that we had too many customers and needed another checkout operator Im getting frantic I send her back to find the managerTime passes People have been waiting for over half an hour now and you can imagine what that looks like Thankfully none of the customers are directing their anger at us but they are all very very angryEventually the manager turns up All good right NopeHe takes one look at the scene And walks away The customers see my face Now they know what the manager looks likeThere is more of the same Frantic phone calls announcements over the speakers Ten minutes that feel like an eternity later the manager calmy walks back into sight and immediately gets collared by the crowd The only good thing that came out of this moment was when several customers took time out of their ranting to defend me it seems my pleas for forgiveness workedThe manager is barely listening to the poor people He keeps interrupting them trying to push blame off of himself This was the first he had heard of the situation Luckily all of the customers had seen me doing everything possible to get hold of him The manager eventually rolls his eyes and wanders off to the office to pick up the keysA full  minutes after the last till went down we finally got the code and unlocked the tills Did the manager apologise to the customers Nope Did he offer them anything to make up for the wait Nope Did he apologise to us working on the checkouts for putting us through all that Take a guessAs I rang through the customers I did everything in my meager power to make it up to them It wasnt much but I would accept any coupon they had even if they werent for our store I would accidentally mistype the reduction codes to give them more money off If something wouldnt scan Id just pretend I hadnt noticed and give it to them I knew it would mess up the inventory and probably get me in trouble but I just didnt care at this point When we cleared the line I sent the other  girls off for a break and told them to take an extra few minutes while they were at it When they were gone and I was sure I was alone I spent a minute or two hiding under the till whimpering ,Cashiers Nightmare,349,talesFromRetail,top_week

cart duty I enjoyed it Id much rather be outside and moving around than inside and lashed to a checkstandBut the parking lot is perilous I learned this from three different perspectives As a bag boy I could clearly see the damage caused by errant carts Later in life at the financial company I would hear clients tell stories of epic accidents in lots and see the resulting figures for the damage average damage in the lot used to be  with the most frequent cause being backing Lastly as a driver my first accident happened when a driver backed right into my car as I was driving along minding my own business But it happens Thats why we have insuranceHere are a few stories from the lotHIT AND RUN Nice warm San Diego night A smattering of carts on the lot Not many customers insideEnter a large Cadillac its a land yacht Its being driven by a senior citizen and she falls squarely into the QTip category Small white and sporting a moderate seniorfrizz of puffy white hairShe should not be driving anything The Caddy might protect her but its a lethal weapon to anyone elseThe driver rolls past me and anglesin to a good spot near the entrance to the store But she fails to hit the breaks and manages to smash into another car She backsup slightly and rips the number off of a relatively new HondaShe pauses looks around and stars backing again Damn shes going to run I have noting to write with so I try and memorize the plate Sadly I dont get a very good look She bolts out of the lot and disappears forever It was not captured by the security cameras And I never see her or the Caddy again BummerTELEPATHIC CART DESTRUCTIONA universal truth to retail is that the less you are paid the more likely it is that you will be blamed for things that had absolutely nothing to do with youIn this case I was in the back of the lot gathering carts Unseen to me a customer leaves a cart between spaces and nowhere near a corral A few minutes later this cart succumbs to gravity and starts rollingIt rolls right into the door of a customer who just happened to arrive at her car at that specific moment A nice dent is delivered and a couple scratches tops it off FantasticHey you She yells I had not seen the accident and was nowhere near her So I dont register that shes talking to meHey cart guy She yells This time I see her So I walk over to her carDo you ned help unloading I askNo I want to know why you dented my carIm sorryYou dented my car You left a cart out and it hit my car What are you going to do about itI was working on the other side of the lot I havent been in this area for a whileShe grabs the cart and pushes it toward me You left this out and it rolled into my car Who is going to pay for the damageUgh Ill take you to our manager He can probably help you outI escort

have to be more careful when doing carts You just cost the store moneyI wasnt anywhere near the car and I was not the person who left the cart thereShe says you didHow Im not telepathic I could not have caused the damage and I could not have prevented it The only thing I did wrong was doing my job I happened to be out there but It was not meLook Be careful I dont want this happening againI left

Legionofclowns,54,68,1rcc3t,257,First time posting on TFR but I felt like my story needed to join all the great ones Ive been reading on here Its long so be forewarned So its  and I am working at an electronics store with my pretty blue shirt and khakis I started here right before holiday season and had a couple months under my belt working in the DVDCDVideo Games area and had become one of the goto guys The manager and I had a game plan for black Friday we had a map drawn with how we were gonna move customers through the store and everythinghopefully The only hitch in this plan came from Nintendo for this was the year of the Wii Now before this i had worked with the public Had worked at the movie theater fast food etc but this was my first real retail job I had almost no experience with Black Friday and had only heard stories from friends and things I had watched on the newsDay comes and of course Im there at open I pull into the neighboring parking lot where we had to park on this day and what do I see A line that stretches from the door goes around the store comes back to the front doors and proceeds to stretch across the parking lot to the local office supply store I think no big deal we got this We start handing out the tickets before opening for the big items like cheap TVs and of course the  Wiis we managed to have And within  minutes everything is handed out and of course there is some yelling about who didnt get what and the standard bickering Not worried we have a cop outside keeping order So doors open and everybody comes in orderly but hurriedly and our plan is actually working customers are actually moving the way we want so I start to think maybe this whole black Friday thing is overblown NOPE Towards our car install bay where we had put the ticketed items I hear shouts of THEY HAVE EM and I HAD IT FIRST BITCH  Going into oh shit mode I briskly jog flat out run to the bay and witness about  soccer moms in track suits and jackets piling through the doorway pushing the LP guarding the stash out of the way and snatching Wiis like they were made of gold and endangered diamond kittens while throwing haymakers at anything else that was in the way I mean seriously how many times do you get to see a middleclass housewife uppercut another like something from Street Fighter  Apparently one of them had see the Wiis through the window and started informing others that we had Wiis but we were hoarding them for employees At this point I have to make a decisiondo I A Stand back and watch and possibly take photos or B  Stop a possible murder I go with B and start using my outside voice and arms to try and break up the mob and get the door closed behind them with the help of my helpless LP I get into the bay and WHOOMP Im out Dont remember anything about what happened but after viewing the tape and listening to the LP I apparently was knocked on the head with a Wii by a Martha Stewart looking woman who proceeded to dissappear behind the others and back out to the floor Yep I was knocked out by a mediocre gaming system At this point in the tape you start seeing people dropping and crying When I first saw it I thought they were all upset at what had happened to me but then you see the police officer break through the lines spraying his OC at anything not wearing a uniform The LP and him managed to clear the bay and pull the door closed and locked and then check to make sure Im alright SPOILER I didnt die More cops show up and procede to lock down the store as the LP and first officer manage to get me awake and up and walk me to the break room and give me some water and make sure I know what day it was and if I knew my name Im humorous most of the time so I said Garfield thats how they knew I was ok I end up going to the hospital in the police car to get checked out and other than a nasty gash still have the scar Im good in fact Im ready to go back to work Turns out my manager felt really really bad about what had happened and so he gave me the rest of the day off with sick leave and even came by my houseguest afterwards to check on me and show me the tape from the cameras  The only thing that chaps my ass about the whole thing was that the woman who decided I needed to die so her kids could fake bowl got away Ive never had another Black Friday like this and this upcoming one will be my th although Im with a different company now since the electronics retailer decided that Amazoncom wasnt a competitor damn restructuringtldr A housewife knocks me out with a future doorstop and I hallucinate that Im Edward James Olmos on a jetski Edit just wanted to add that this was the only year things got bad Every other time has been a cake walk a huge cakewalk with too many people ,The Tale Of The Housewife Beatdown Brawl,325,talesFromRetail,top_week

LIVESINCANADA,108,73,1rbn62,246,So I used to work for a large department store in the frontend cash and customer service mainly At our location we had  cash registers  of which were express  items or less and the other  were regular belts We also had  selfcheckout machines that were watched over by  cashier at a time This particular day I was the one who got to watch over them Now I dont remember what time of year it was or even what time of day it was but I do remember that it was very busy We had every single register open and we still had lines of  people at each register When Im watching the selfcheckouts Im watching a screen that shows me what each customer has entered in order to make sure that the pack of toilet paper they placed under their cart actually gets scanned I also have to help people out when they have coupons as  of the time the machine doesnt recognize them as well as any and all questions about their purchasespricespayment methods So basically Im busy running around the whole timeSo this day while Im watching the selfcheckouts two women who were next in the seemingly neverending line come to one of the machines nearest to me One of the women is pregnant and the other looks like an older women I found out it was the pregnant womens mother Nothing note worthy happens with them until theyre at their last item It was a heavier item at the bottom of their cart The older women waves at me and asks if I could lift the heavy item for them as the daughter is pregnant and she has some illness I think she said cancer Now they choose to come to a selfcheckout machine A machine where you are supposed to check yourself out They didnt think to wait in one of the  other lines where youd have a dedicated cashier whod be happy to lift and scan all your large and heavy items for you No they decided to come to the self checkouts and get the cashier who had to watchhelp  customers simultaneously to lift and scan their items So all that went through my head but what came out of my mouth was Sure no problem and I started walking towards them they were  feet away from me I take not more than  steps before the daughter says Oh its alright mom Ive got this and then she bends down and picks up the heavy item herself The mom notices that I didnt match Usain Bolts world record speeds while walking towards them and says to me What awful service you have forcing a pregnant woman to lift ltitem namegt by herselfI just shrug it off and inform them that in the future if theyd like more hands on service that going to one of the nonselfcheckout registers would probably be better The two women finish paying and as they walk by me on their way out the mom drops this doozy on meI guess some peoples mothers just didnt raise them rightWhat I dont know what she expected me to do maybe scream at her daughter and push her out of the way as she attempted to lift the large item I knew with that statement she was just trying to provoke me so I ignored her Its been years since thats occurred and its still the experience from retail that I remember best,Self checkouts are more trouble than theyre worth,319,talesFromRetail,top_week

dirteater,12,58,1rcbas,238,I work as a night manager at a grocery store  I work from  pm to  am and am the highest authority in the store at night because everyone in upper management goes homeMost of the clerks and cashiers are high school students and I am not much older than them  They tend to think that Im one of them so they dont have to listen to what I say even though I am always polite and charming when I ask them to perform specific tasks  Three of these kids are the embodiment of Satan himself  They never work hard partly because they were never respected by other managers they swear in front of customers throw shit across aisles sexually harass the female workers etc  I absolutely dreaded the nights I worked with them because I knew nothing would get done and I would be promptly yelled at the next day because of thisAnyway about a week ago they were all caught by the bookkeeper for some pretty bad stuff  They would steal VISA gift cards use manager numbers to override the difference on the register so it balanced and they also stole booze pizza and many other things  This supposedly went on for a couple months and the three of them had their own little operation  They ended up stealing  worth of gift cards  They are all being charged with felony theft and one of them is facing ten years as he has a long rap sheet and is being charged as an adultI hope they learn their lesson,Three employees get owned,296,talesFromRetail,top_week

arsci,56,36,1ren2b,214,All of the talk of black Friday brought up some good memories one of which involves two kids and a rather large gun safe Its kind of a long one but hopefully you all enjoy itA little background I work for a large national farm and ranch supply chain that sells a large variety of items including gun safes This particular story takes place the day after black friday of last year We have several models of these gun safes on the sales floor for customers to see with the largest at the time being an Canon Armory gun safe This thing was MASSIVE compared to the rest of our stock Our store only ever had  of them they never had an official SKUwe had to ring them under the generic merchandise SKU we had them for over a year and after we sold out we never saw them again Now all the safes are electronic keypad and locked by default from the manufacturer but they all ship with the same combination  Most people know this from either asking us to see inside the safes or by just guessing It was no secret and we encourage people to take a good lookIt was the evening and we were working on getting the store cleaned up after a very hectic day Not very many customers were left in the store and things were winding down I was working on restocking the feed when I saw the assistant manager walk by and he looked PISSED And not just end of black friday pissed but someone done fucked up pissed so I went to casually investigate only to find him talking to this giant safe Literally ear to the door asking if it was doing alright Maybe not to the safe but to the person stuck INSIDE the safe Uh Oh Things start running through my headwhy didnt he just unlock it HOW did a person get locked in it Then he pulls me asideAssistant Manager We have a situationMe A situationAM Yes a kid just locked his brother in the gunMe Soo why dont we unlock itAM It wont unlock I think the battery died but I replaced it and its still not workingMe How did he end up locked in itAM His brother apparently Hes over hiding in the feed racks last I saw Not sure where the parents are they havent made an appearance yetI went over and tried it myself and sure as crapits locked And this kid is FREAKING out for obvious reasons We tried a couple other batteries with no luck and even tried swapping the keypad out with the one from the other gun with no luck The parents FINALLY realized their kids were MIA and started asking around and very quickly we determined the kid in the safe was theirs We had taken out the power access port from the pack and passed the kid a flashlight so he could calm down a little and after swapping the keypads out and a fourth set of batteries we called in for backup Assistant Manager called the police while another employee called the safe company to see if there was another way into the safeAfter about half an hour had gone by and the fire department was about ready to cut the back off of it to get the kid out we find out from the safe manufacturer that there is a  minute lockout on the keypadif the battery dies or is removed you cant touch it for  minutes after putting the battery back in So after  long agonizing minutes of listening to this hag of a woman yell at us for not taking enough precautions the safe OPENED And this  year old kid I repeat FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID comes bolting out of this safe straight into his mothers arms and both of them are sitting of the floor breaking down in tears The police and fire department left pretty quick after that but after the woman and her kid calmed down she UNLOADED on us Complaining about precautions safety how we need to be more responsible and how corporate needs to handle things differently Eventually we stopped herAM Maam your kid walked up to the safe entered in the combination himself that he got FROM YOU and opened the safe Your other child WILLINGLY stepped into the safe and at the exact moment he did the battery died At this point the brother closed and locked the door And its our fault for not taking enough precautionsEventually the woman and her kids left No policies changed except when we give out the combination we use her children as an example of what not to do Gives us all a good chuckle Every couple months she calls and identifies her self as the person whose kid got locked in the safe Usually shes prying to know if weve changed our policies we havent then asks for a discount on whatever she seems to be in need of which she doesnt get Oddly enough its been another year and weve had no incidents of kids locking their siblings in safes Heres to surviving another Black Friday,Two kids and the gun safe,250,talesFromRetail,top_week

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,48,1rh8hc,199,I have got to say after working  years in retail parents should be responsible for their childrens actions I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses but I never blame the kids I usually dont even blame the parents because kids are kids but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth I blame the parents that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes reminding customers to keep their little shits in line So when a customer like the one I had comes in I usually inform my manager who will be called Jared of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance A middleaged couple stumbles into the store with their  year old son They head off to furniture but their son makes a beeline to toys I immediately call Jared and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible Before the kid makes it to toys he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers After  complaints Jared stops the kid and drags him to his parents who dont give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off The kid bolts towards toys and stars ripping toys down off the shelf The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom Once in there he places them on the floor and proceeds to urinate on them Jared walks in on him finishing up and drags the kid back to his parents leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him Jared tells the parents what he did and that they have to clean up the mess This switches the parents into rage mode They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this And he will be punished severely when they get home Jared tells them calmly I am punishing you not your child You guys made no effort to control him and even brushed me off after the first incident You guys will clean up every mess he has made and then you can leave You are no longer welcomed here They start yelling profanities at him and their kid saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldnt have to put up with this After they cleaned up they left empty handed Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation It is the second worst customers I have ever had even if I didnt directly deal with them The worst by far has to be a couple out of towners That is for another day though Thank you all for reading this and tell me about your nightmare parentschildren in your store,Parents not their kids should be punished,247,talesFromRetail,top_week
prickelypear,23,27,1rf2t9,187,Ive lurked for a while and decided to share one of my experiences that I can rememberI used to work in a big name retail store in a college town we usually got a lot of college kids due to this obviously and they were generally pretty laid back customers But of course we got older customers as wellOne night I had a woman with her college aged son come through my line It was close to the beginning of a new semester and she was clearly buying him items to put in his dorm or apartment so he would be set for the school semester to come One of items was a basket it looked like wicker but I dont remember what it was exactly Either way when I rang it up it came up full price  and the woman stopped meWoman Thats supposed to be on sale why is it ringing up full priceMe Im not sure Ill get one of the girls from that department to come up and shell know whats going onWhile I ring the operator to get me one of the hard lines girls on the phone or to my till I can hear the woman going on about a Clearance aisle which this store doesnt have we would put little tags buy the price tag on the shelf that stated it was on sale and for how much and how this is so aggravating Finally one of the girls walks up and the woman explains to her that the basket was on the Clearance aisle and its ringing up full price and she knows it wasnt placed there by another customer because there were many of them there The girl from hard lines informs the woman we dont have a Clearance Aisle but she knows where the baskets are and she will go lookWhile we are waiting for the other girl to come back the lanes are backing up Other employees from the floor are coming up to open new tills and help with the load and everyone is displacing from my lane to others The other girl comes back and explains to the woman that the item is not on sale the sale tag was for the baskets next to this one its full price and walks off Woman to me Well he needs the basket for his clothesMe Okay and I start to place it in the bagging areaWoman No Im not paying that price for it I want it for the Clearance price You had it on the Clearance Aisle I want it for Clearance price I dont remember what she was saying the Clearance price was but it was far below the actual price Usually if its less than  we were told just give it to them and even sometimes if its  on something worth at least  But I believe she was saying it was supposed to be Me Maam we dont have a Clearance aisle the basket is full price and I dont have a way to lower it in my systemWoman Thats bullshit if you have it on the Clearance Aisle I should get the Clearance price and you can adjust the priceMe This store doesnt have a Clearance Aisle We have items on sale and they are marked to reflect that but this basket isnt one of themWoman No That basket was on the Clearance Aisle Everything on the shelf around that basket was on sale That one is too Im getting that basket but I am not buying  for it Where are the managers This is bullshit Im not dealing with you anymoreSo with the womans son looking more and more embarrassed by his mother as this goes I call up my manager explain the situation

TennisAndBeer,4,41,1r63y6,167,So I work at a grocery store that everyone from the customers to the managers hate yet everyone goes to because the food is so much cheaper than other stores As a result the store parking lot and even surrounding roads are always filled and busyAt this store I do everything from cashiering to maintenance to retrieving carts A few years ago one kid got hit by a car and broke a few bones so now everyone has to wear orange visibility vestscoats when they go outside which I thought was stupid when I started It didnt take me long to learn and Ive been nearly hit pretty much every time I go outside mostly by suburban soccer moms in minivans and SUVs simultaneously backing out of their space talking on their phone and drinking coffee I swear theyre aiming for me However the closest Ive come to getting hit was by a woman who was a manager of a different department She left work jumped in her car and backed up quickly almost running me a customer walking out of the store and the customers son who couldnt have been more than  The customer keeps walking but I recognized the woman I stood in front of her car and proceeded to give her a lecture about how she should know better she works at the store full time and knows how busy the lot is I wasnt exactly polite but I wasnt unnecessarily rude I stuck to the related issues When I saw her the next day at work I was a bit nervous technically shes in another department but shes been there like  years so Im sure she could have me fired However she was actually very mature about the whole thing She apologized again and thanked me for the warning saying she had gotten too comfortable with the lot and hadnt realized it ,Lectured a manager almost ran a small child and me over and got thanked for it,208,talesFromRetail,top_week
meguriau,19,28,1r5sy8,165,Hi TFR Im back My thesis has been officially submitted defended had an existential crisis and have recovered from all the irregulat sleeping patterns and physiological symptoms associated with caffeine excess Its been a long time but here is another instalment of Tales from a Hat Boutique httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailsearchqmeguriauamprestrictsronampsortnewamptall This one has been in the works for a little while for a number of reasons  Im afraid of long walls of text and procrastinate and  I wasnt sure if it was clear enough  I should probably mention that I simplified the title of this series for simplicity but the brand also releases a line of bags for its springsummer SS and autumnwinter AW collections As such I will refer to the store as HB for hat and bag storeBackgroundTwo years ago I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals The majority of the customers Ive had have been pleasant however there have been interesting characters and even a few nasty pieces of work discontent customers that have come by This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this timeStoryTodays story describes the customer who left her mark on our generous reservation guideline and jaded my view of customers in retail Most large designer stores have a limit to the number of days you can keep an item on hold As a small store catering towards a large overseas market we were much more flexible and allowed customers to reserve an item for several months before their arrival in Australia sometimes up to a year without regular contact from the store The length of time was purely due to the fact that not all of the collection is available overseas and the slightly lower prices after taking the tax refund system into account which made shopping at our store more appealingThe extended reservation period was also available to locals Yes they could keep an item on hold for months as long as they let us know in advance eg I am on holiday and wont be back for a month or I live interstate but will be visiting in two months time For others we typically allowed them a reserve period of up to a month without any calls however the time period was dependent on the popularity of an item This guide worked simply because  the exact details of the reservation system are unknown to customers which gives us a lot of leeway on how to implement it and   locals for the past  years in addition to having common sense never left an item for longer than one week at most and answeredreturned their calls when we tried to confirm the reserve status As I alluded to but didnt really explain explicitly in previous stories summer at a hat boutique is the busiest season of the year To give you the scale of how frantic it can be sometimes the three months of summer alone can generate up to a third of the revenue for the year Now the head office of this brand is not known for making clever decisions with regard to production Even though we as staff members of the flagship store put more consideration in what wider range of items would be popular next season and request stock accordingly the preferences of the larger department stores skew what management puts into production Due to managements lack of foresight many of our popular products run out of stock before the season ends which tends to lead to much customer dramaThis story comes to you from the calm after the storm of one summer afternoon The end of the season was nigh and we had hit a record number of sales The boss had gone home and the only sound to disrupt the peace was the persistent ring of the phone behind the desk Slouching in the chair bracing myself for another demanding customer I was surprised to be greeted by a friendly voice We will dub the lady behind this voice DF for deceptively friendlyM Good afternoon HB store Meguriau speakingDF Oh hello Im looking to keep something reserved for a friend Would you have it in stock Its called B in the Natural colour from your SS collection M We do have one of those in stock When were you next able to come byDF Ill be in on the weekendM That sounds perfect If I could just take down your name and contact details well see you thenThis particular backpack was a  masterpiece Its craftsmanship gave off a casual yet stylish vibe and it caught the attention of every woman who came by the store The product only remained on shelves for three days at most before it found its way to a new home It was fantastic that it sold well however my manager had not been able to gauge the level of interest people would have in the item and nor did department stores As a result there were only three more B bags left over in the world at this point in time Despite the high demand for the item the weekend was only two days away so we didnt give it much more thought before reserving two other bags remaining at the warehouse The following weekend had come and gone with no sign of DF My manger figured we could hold it out for another week before deciding what to do Perhaps she was sick busy with work lost her phone In any case I left her a message offering to hold it for an extra weekAnother weekend another message and again no DF This time we let her know in no uncertain terms that this item was going back on display and to give us a call if she was still interested in this item We figured that if she called we could put the item back on hold and if not we could still have a new one brought in on the next delivery date A few days later the bag found its way into the possession of a lovely Japanese lady and DF was still not to be found It couldnt have been minutes after the transaction when the sensor sounded marking the arrival of a smartly dressed middle age woman Bright smile spreading from ear to ear it soon became apparent this customer was DFM Hi there Is there anything I can help you withDF I called in to reserve B bag for a friend Could I take a lookM Im sorry unfortunately we have taken this item off hold The warehouse shows up as having two more left in stock so we will be sure to have this item available for you by next week at the latest DF Thats preposterous It was on hold I wanted to see the dimensionsI proceeded to exhaust all possible ways of explaining to her that we did not have any others in store at the moment apart from telling her that I was not Hogwarts trained and could not simply conjure a replica bag for her to examineM Im afraid thats the most I can do for you at this point in time Well again give you a call when the bag arrives and if you could phone us before coming in that would be fantasticAll in all she appeared to back down and with an expression visibly forced DF mumbled something under her breath and sauntered out of the storeFrom that point on it felt as though DF was engaging in some form of petty revenge The same nonresponsive pattern ensued even after the bag had arrived and on hold This time the manager was determined to keep the bag until DF arrived Days extended into weeks and almost months until the manager had had enough She was by no means an impatient person however in this time the other B bag had already made its way into the hands of another customer so this bag was the last one available in the world and was spending its days hiding away in a cupboard The manager had reached breaking pointManager I CANT BELIEVE THE NERVE OF THIS WOMAN I RUN A BUSINESS NOT A STORAGE CENTRE IF YOU CANT GET A  DEPOSIT FROM HER PUT IT BACK ON DISPLAY SHE DOESNT DESERVE THE BAGAfter she calmed down she asked me to phone DF and let her know that we would keep the bag up until the weekend at the latest and if she would like an extension to please contact usOf course we had no such luck It was now Monday and had been no sign of DF Almost an hour after opening a customer phoned in from Japan for the B bag and it had now been packaged and ready to be posted Shortly after the sensor sounded It  was DF and mildly frustrated does not even begin to describe the response when I told her we were completely out of stock She was absolutely belligerentDF THE BAG IS SOLD OUT SOLD OUT HOW DARE YOU M Im terribly sorry but we had informed you that we would only extend the reservation period if youd left us a messaDF MY HUSBAND WAS HOSPITALISED YESTERDAY SO I COULDNT CALL M Im sorry to hear of your husbands illDF YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO SELL IT I ALREADY BLOODY OWN IT Unable to refer her elsewhere the rest of the morning was spent attempting to placate DF as she drove away potential customers and attracted a small gawking crowd Lets just say that animal taming was not a skill set I invested many points into On my own with no manager to back me up I soon realised that nothing I could do would calm her down and ultimately gave up letting her rage and rant Once she left she left for good and I have never crossed paths with her sinceFollowing this incident a new policy was set in place immediately Overseas customers are still be able to place extended holds on items regardless of their popularity however now it is not automatically true for locals Customers that dont need to cross a state line to get to the store can only keep an item on hold for a week however they were required to check in with us if they are unable to come by Of course there are a few exceptions to the rule but I guess thats retail Extra information for

xVarekai,86,35,1r3e2x,163,This story is a little different as its not about a particular customer but instead about one of the most uncomfortable working experiences Ive had with a manager  Ive worked on and off for a certain body carehome fragrance store shilling overpriced lotion to the masses and as such Ive been in several stores depending on where I lived at the time and the financial state I was in  My first and only other post can be found hereThats called stealing httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsjfthatscalledstealingand while I probably have other stories its been a while since I had to deal with that environment but Ill post any juicy ones I recallSo about this store manager  I lived in a small town in the bible belt for some time and while I hope this doesnt offend anyone I will say that I am an atheist but wasnt exactly out about it as Id experienced some nasty behavior in the past for simply saying I dont go to church  My store manager on the other hand was very active in her church and wasnt shy about talking about her faith  She seemed to assume that we were all christians of one form or another but I dont think that this is something that should be talked about in a place of business  Ive worked with people of all faiths and if youre a decent person I really dont care one way or the other  In fact Id prefer it not come up at all as this can lead to problemslike it did in this situationSo it was really more a culmination of comments and assertions than an actual confrontation for a while with me quietly holding my tongue and going about my job as best I could  I was in a difficult spot at the time stressed in private life and pretty depressed about my lack of direction even though I was actually able to save money for the first time  I had taken on a minor management role that turned out to be quite a bit more than I had expected  Some of you can probably relateAnyway Im struggling to master the many tasks and expectations of my position I was promoted into lower management and actually moved an hour and a half to take it so the disappointment was a bit stronger than if it had been within my previous home store and I can tell that my manager who we shall call Cindy from here on out is wanting badly to get me to church  Little things like Well have you made any friends at church and You should find a nice church to go to youll meet more people and feel better when I confided that my personal life was a bit difficult  I know Cindy meant well but there was no way I could really open up to her  Plus she wasnt exactly the model person she seemed to think she was pitting employees against each other and having her church friends spy on the store when she took a rare day off  Im not sure why she delighted so much in the little gossipy things she did but the store was small and her influence made some pretty big waves at timesOne day I was about to close up the store stooped to pick up some trash off the floor and came up wrong under the sink overhang giving myself a pretty solid concussion  My SO took me to the hospital after I called HR to report the incident where we stayed for  hours to be seen  I got a note that said I needed to be off for a few days until my symptoms cleared up and Cindy didnt like that  She sent an email to a comanager that I was pretty good friends with about how she didnt want me taking advantage of the situation  Lady I had a concussion and I didnt do it on purpose  That was pretty much the beginning of the endCindy started laying it on thick such as at management meetings where we talked about personal experiences looking pointedly at me when she said that faith is the most important thing in her life and she doesnt know where shed be without it  She even did this little stunt where she gradually filled a glass with objects of varying size saying If you dont leave room for faith then your bottle is never full  Fullon evangelical which again I dont care what you do in your own time but this is not appropriate for workFinally I was able to quit and started making plans with my SO to move back to my home state for a fresh start  She and I sat down in the food court for a coaching session and she started talking about how this job wasnt really for me and I agreed with her saying that I was going to be turning in my two weeks  She seemed annoyed that I was already making plans  I thought that was it and then before we went back to the store she looks at me intensely and asks xVarekai do you have a bibleAlright  Ive had enoughI said No I dont  And I dont think thats an appropriate question for a place of businessShe looked as if Id slapped her and maybe she felt that way too  I dont like to be confrontational or make people feel bad but enough was enough  I never once said anything to her when she was preaching at work I took it quietly and let her looks of disdain and irritation wash over me  And its not just religionanything that could be controversial like politics or views about abortion should not be discussed at work in my opinion  Its distracting causes problems and can make good people make poor choices in their desire to defend themselvesAnyway she was stonecold frosty to me for the duration of the two weeks and I was glad to be gone  Some of you may say well you should have gone to HR with that  And yes I probably should have  I suppose it was the general environment and knowing that it probably would have only gotten worse if I had said anything that kept me quiet and she has a lot of influence in that community  So I took it until I had a way out and didnt look backI dont know if everyone will understand the impact of that one question to someone who is firmly without faith but it was jarring and inappropriate  I only hope she learned something from the experience and hasnt done that to anyone else,The bible story,198,talesFromRetail,top_week

spotty,18,28,1r43bb,149,Hi allI just discovered this sub I run my own DVDGame store and have dozens of stories I think you will enjoy so when I get time I will add more  It was a typical Wednesday afternoon we had gotten through the lunch time rush and were tidying the shelves and generally preparing for the after school onslaught that would come in a few hours timeA rather unremarkable gentleman came into the store and started browsing our movies for sale Since it was quite time I wandered over and enquired as to whether he was after anything in particular The person in question replied with a grunt which I took to mean No I am fine thanks so I let him continue on while me and a staff member just went about doing whateverFast Forward around an hour later The gentleman was still walking around our store and while we do have loads of things to look at circa  movies a customer being around that long gives us an automatic red flag We are in a fairly low socio economic part of town and quite often a customer that hangs around a ridiculous amount of time can be a indication they are waiting for the coast to be clean to steal stuff Naturally we start to keep a subtle eye on him but he does not appear to be doing anything too suspicious so we let him be and keep our distance after all some people just love browsing our selection of rarepre owned moviesFast Forward another half hour or soOur strange visitor has been carrying around a movie for around  minutes and he is now approaching the counter I feel a sense of relief It is always nice when your gut is wrong about someone Unfortunately it wasnt to be He comes up to my register and the following conversation happensME Scans Hi sir that will be CUST Nah you owe me ME Im sorry sirCUST I bought that movie  months ago and it doesnt work and I want a refundME Sir I just saw you pick that movie up from the display stand Also it still has the stores security lock on itCUSTNah not that copy I bought another one and it doesnt work and I want my money backME Ok Sir if you bring the movie and your receipt bacCUST I lost my receiptMEAt this stage just wanting him gone Ok just bring the movie back and I will give you a refundCUST Give me the money now and Ill bring it back laterME That is not how the process worCUST GIVE ME MY FUCKING REFUND OR ILL TAKE YOU OUTSIDE AND CUT YOUR THROAT CAt this point I pull my personal alarm which all my staff have attached to there cloths and he goes running out the door I had already given one of the staff a signal to go down the back and watch the cameras and get ready to call the cops when it become clear he was not right and she proceeds to do thatHe jumps into a waiting car that pulls out and proceeds to run into the back of the car in front of it before taking off Unfortunately I wasnt quick enough to get the rego tags  The police came and took a report but I never heard back from them or the customer again I can only hope he got his copy of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic to workEDIT TLDR  Dude wanted us to give him a refund for something he didnt have Went psycho and rammed a car  ,The tale of the ridiculous refund,177,talesFromRetail,top_week
Foliagus,31,31,1r761t,147,Hey guys long time reader first time poster etcI work for a lovely little retail store north of the border we sell drugs makeup and of course the fun things electronicsI just had a customer today that made me walk away for the first time and I thought that maybe youd appreciate what I did and maybe you could learn how to deal with this kindve thing  So Angry Lady comes in AL about five pm asking if we pricematch  From the way she was asking she obviously knew we did indeed pricematch other competitors and Id definitely seen her in the store before  Me Absolutely miss did you want me to see if I have something in stock for youAL Yes your Samsung  smart tv Its on for  at Lamewad other store on the other side of townMe Ok well Ill just pull it up on our website here and print off the price for you one secondNow our computers are running a windows so old well I guess Im not funny enough for some comparive humour  Our computers are old and clunky and take long periods of time inbetween inputs just to decide if they like the way you clicked somethingAs were loading through the Lamewad website they list no television fitting the criteria  This is after five minutes of Oh my god I went through this last time you guys are terrible I show her the other Samsung  the nonsmart version going for  on their website and she angrily just says no before insisting I open Lamewads flyerI gladly open the flyer finding indeed the same television without smart advertised for   I point this out again I get a No before AL points above the tv at a different model An LG and says THAT tv  That ones smartWell I point out that the television is listed at  and that we dont actually carry LGThis puts her into a silent anger and she just turns and walks away  I as mandated by my company say Have a nice evening before forgetting about the whole thingCUE many hours later about  pm when we get called to go outside  Now when this happens its because our LP Loss Prevention Security Officer has pursued somebody out of the store and were to go outside and just stand there for visual support  Getting outside after everybody I find LP on top of a girl screaming and yelling to her friend telling her friend to take her stuff while LP yells not to let her take it and sure enough one of our staff goes and grabs the little pink box from the girls purse and holds onto it for LP  Now after some minutes weve got a large van coming  LP is in the middle of our little road but he cant move this girl shes flailing and screaming not letting him cuff her Anyway Large Van drives right up to about  feet away from about  employees all standing in full white shirt and tie and honks her horn repeatedly  Our manager proceeds to hold up her hand asking the van to wait or to just turn left and go around  Who gets out of the van but AL  GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER YOU ASSHOLE ARE YOU TRYING TO RAPE HER  SOMEBODY STOP HER YOU employeesAt this our manager tells everybody else but her and LP to go inside the police are now audible coming in a very fast way  We all do and sure enough coming in  seconds after myself is ALI found the ad now you HAVE to price matchShe indeed whips out a printed ad from a competitor and I start processing the paperwork  During this I notice our inventory is out one so I dont actually have a boxed unit for sale I let her know this and she does that LOVELY derisive chuckle Man you guys really have no idea what youre doing the last time you couldnt find my tv eitherTo this I apologize let her know thats unfortunate but that Id be happy to get a tv in within a few days after purchase So at this point as Im walking away grabbing more paperwork I ask Awesome Coworker AC if shes able to intercede  Im starting to get hot under the collar and I want to distance myselfAC replies that shed be happy to so as we both walk back to AL I hear AL talking to another customer in our store Oh god you shouldve seen it he had his hands all over her it was brutal  God I dont know if Ill shop her again their security seems so violent etc etcI shrug it off but it stings a bit  Our LP is a contracted service theyre not a part of our company and theyre some of the nicest guys Ive ever met  The one in particular is a little  guy hes new and hes got a lisp  Now because they dont work for our company this means weve never had to worry about them reporting us to managers or such so any strictly noncorporate actions go over easy  Nice guys I play video games with quite a few of themAnyway so at the till just as Im clearing everything for AC miss AL turns to me and stares me down as she says I hope you feel safe here and I hope the police watch the video on your cameras your LP was completely outve line and violentI was done now  I didnt respond  AC saw and she immediately said Oh Foliagus would you like to go speak with COMPUTERS EMPLOYEE he said he wanted to see youI nod say Enjoy your evening miss and walk awayI hid until she was gone and I was commended for the calm manner I showed in the face of what I found out is a disreputable repeating customer  Thank god for my coworkers she was just poking me over and over againAnyway so I find out later the girl outside  Crack dealer  The little pink box  Full of crack and needles  She was so crazy because she was desperately trying to get her friend to pick up the evidence before the cops arrivedThanks for listening TFR you guys keep me saneTLDR  I singlehandidly rescued a hostage victim from a man strung out on compressed air before selling  dollars of merchandise at  margin

MrDoctorSmartyPants,24,21,1rep4z,141,A little backstory I worked for a large and generic yet popular apparel retail store for a a little while right when I was getting out of high school I was rarely on the floor as a sales rep because I generally spent my day in the stock room going through endless stacks of shipment boxes however my managers loved the idea of me being on the floor because I am so outgoing and generally enjoy peopleto be quite honest I really enjoyed my time at this storeAll my managers were great it was in a very upscale shopping center so generally the customers were great and everyone I worked with was very cool I literally never had ANY problems with anyone that I worked withI guess it was kind of a utopian retail job  Now a little more background about my particular job responsibilitiesI was the stock room manager I was the person that met the truck at the back door at am every tuesday thursday and saturday  I was the one that printed off the delivery summary from the computer every night before the shipmentI knew how many boxes were coming I was the one responsible for counting each one of the boxes to make sure I got no more or no less than what was on the shipment invoice and I was the one responsible for processing all the shipment  In a nutshell I knew the stock room backwards and forwards knew what we had back there and what we didnt have because I unpacked it organized it and set up carts for employees on the floor to distribute in between helping customers There were rare occasions when  I would emerge victorious from the depths of the stock room having everything processed and put away and I would help out on the register or I would go find things in the stock room for associates on the floor and on occasion I would just help customers with whatever they neededThis particular day I was working the cash registers and a woman comes in who I had seen many times  She was a really nice lady and she even knew me by name because she had enjoyed our interaction on a previous trip to the store and had asked my name to brag to managers about me  A little about our return policyWith a receipt and tags on the clothes there was no time frame for returns  You can buy something put it in a closet for ten years decide you dont want it and bring it back  No problem  If you dont have a receipt and the tags are still on the clothes you can always return themthings stay in the system basically indefinitelybut if you dont have the receipt we scan the bar code and whatever comes up is what you get  If it says  bucks on the tag but comes up  cents you get  cents back  who knows what reduction stickers youve peeled off the tag  So all this being said here is my actual storyand I only remember this because in almost a year this is literally the only negative experience I ever had at this jobNice lady NL comes up to my register with a pair of bright red skinny jeans and drops them down on the counterNL Hi MrDoctorSmartyPants  How are you  I havent seen you the last few times Ive been in hereMe  It has been a while Im doing pretty gooddo you want to return these pants  Do you have your receiptNL I sure dont but Ive never taken the tags off of these as you can see so I can still return them rightMe Yep you sure can but unfortunately if you dont have your receipt I can only give you back what they ring up as and Im sure you bought these a while back because Ive never seen these in this store It should be noted the tag said  bucks for these particular pantsNL  Ok that is fine Ive dealt with that beforebut the tag says  dollars and just because I dont have my receipt doesnt mean I should be penalized and lose money on my purchaseMe I know you come here all the time but without a receipt we have no way to prove that you actually paid this amount for these pants we place stickers to denote sale prices over the original prices all the time and they are easily removed to look like they were never thereand to be honest with you in the time that Ive worked here since the store opened I have never seen these pants did you purchase them at another locationNL  Yes but that doesnt matter because I paid  for them like a year and a half ago and Ive never worn thembut lets just return them and see what I can get back for themMe ok lets seeat this point I scan the item and it comes up no shit at  Ok it says NL WHAT Thats robbery That CANT be rightMe Im afraid thats the best I can do for you I explained our policy and you said you understood  Ive returned things without a receipt for you beforeif I could give you more I wouldbut I cant and I dont have any of these pants in the store to verify a current price other than what the computer reads  NL Well this is absolutely unacceptable  You probably have some in the back that you can check for price so you can see how much these cost meI know the policy but this is a little differenti paid a lot for these pantsthis should be an exception  I want to see a managerMe Maam I am the stock manager I know everything in this entire store and I have never seen these pants beforeIm sure there are none in the back and I wish there was something I could do for you but I cant  Honestly this return policy is rooted in loss prevention and instances like this are the exact reason this policy existsNL Cant you just go look to make sure  Me Sure Ill do that for you  at this point i go in the back and out the back door for  minutes and smoke a cigarette and come back  Nope  We dont have any  what the computer shows is the best I can doNL NO I WANT TO SEE THE STORE MANAGER LESLIE WHERE IS SHEMe She isnt here today maamIm the only manager in the storeNL  Well call herMe I dont have her home number and Im not going to disturb her on a sunday over a cut and dry return policy issue  Im not making you return the pants Im not forcing you to take this moneyyou can keep the pantsNL  This is so stupidI cant believe youre treating me like this I come in here all the time You should make exceptions  Just give me my money and Ill be on my wayI dont want these stupid pantsMe Ok Maamhere you go   Im really sorry for your inconvenience have a nice dayNL  Yeah you ruined this nice day Wait until I talk to your managerI actually saw this lady a couple days later and my store manager and I were chatting in the middle of the store about somethingthe lady walked up and said hello was cordial and never so much as mentioned the incident from a few days prior  Sorry if this is so long it wasnt even that badit just stuck out in my mindTLDR Woman accepted return policy except for when it was going to lose her money and in that instance thought she deserved special treatment EVEN THOUGH she previously said whatever was fine,Woman understands store return policy refuses to believe it should apply to her in this one particular instance,162,talesFromRetail,top_week
prettehkitteh,24,32,1rcsdq,138,Wall of Text coming tis the season and Im feeling inspired by all these insane posts about people losing their shit over things they dont need I worked in retail for five years off and on as a grocery store cashier so I never really experienced Black Friday  except one year when I got a temp job at a major toy store on the side I started my new job two days before this day of reckoning For some reason the managers thought it prudent to stick the new girl on the front line when the store opened at am I had barely gotten a chance to get familiar with the store layout and we had special areas where the really populardiscounted toys were set up the day before so I pretty much had no idea where anything wasWe didnt get the typical zombies clawing at the windows phenomenon but people were lined up and a few even knocked on the doors because it was snowing outside and they really wanted to get in early I watched with a giant knot in my stomach as my manager unlocked the doors and people nabbed carts and ran inside I was immediately flooded with shouted questionsWHERE ARE THE TICKLE ME ELMOSWHERE IS THE HOMOSAPIEN ROBOT I NEED IT FOR MY SONI NEED A VIDEOGAME WHERE IS YOUR ELECTRONICS SECTIONI did my best to stutter answers out as people didnt even stop moving for me to answer I quickly picked up on where Tickle Me Elmos TMEs from now on were because everyone wanted one I could not believe how many people wanted one I stayed up toward the entrance because I knew if I went into the main sales floor I would get eaten alive and after the initial rush for the first two hours people started being a little more polite though there was still a lot of running and shouting going on That was when crazy beard came inCB was a grungy exconfederatelooking older man with a bandana tied around his head and a big scruffy grey beard all over his face He marched straight up to me and levelly demanded I need a TME Me Of course sir if you follow this aisle to the back and make a right they are in a special display in the middle of the aisle you cant miss themCB Are you sure there are any leftMe I havent been back there in a little while so unfortunately I dont know Im sorryHe waved a hand at me and scurried off I thought that was the end of it A minute later he scurried back visibly a lot more agitatedCB There were no TMEsMe Im sorry sir we did have some this morCB How could you not have any TMEs You must have more in the back I need oneI knew we had put out almost everything we had the night before  there was no backstock I tried to explain this to CB as he started shakingCB I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULDNT POSSIBLY HAVE ANY MORE TMEsMe fishing for anything to get this guy off my back IIm sorry sir theres not much I can do If you had gotten here earlier big mistakeCB IT DOESNT MATTER WHEN I GET HERE YOURE A FUCKING TOY STORE HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE TMES I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO A MANAGERThose magic words I was shaking now I dont handle anger very well and was relieved to get some help I ran to a phone a few feet away and called for help over the intercom CB followed me and lowered his voice to keep grumbling to me about his worldending problem but he seemed to calm down a little now that he knew he had gotten up a rung on the ladder We waited I knew a manager might be a little longer because they were also amidst the throng of shoppers so I tried not to panic and made some small talk with CBFive minutes passed I saw CB getting more impatient so I called again over the intercom trying a joke about how the managers were probably up to their necks with customers CB wasnt amused so I just kept standing there shuffling my feet I couldnt leave the guy so I did my best to answer the couple questions that came my way while I was doing nothing Another five minutes passedCB What the fuck is taking him so longMe I dont know Im so sorry I can go look for a manager if you wantCB Youre staying RIGHT HERE until he shows up I know a cop out when I hear oneMe Im not trying to abandon you sir I want to helpCB You need to get your manager here RIGHT NOW DO YOU HEAR MEI was on the verge of crying at this point I picked up the phone for a third time trembling trying to take a breath so I didnt start crying over the intercom  when the lead manager Tim finally showed up out of breath from hurrying up front so quickly CB immediately looked a lot less threatening compared to Tim who was  built like a linebacker with tattoos on his arms and a long braided black beard Tim who had a heart of gold and cared about his employees asked ME what the problem was which pissed off CB but he looked scared shitlessMe Were out of TMEs and he really would like oneCB Thats RIGHT I have a problem with the fact thatTim Just a moment sir Prettehkitteh thank you you can go back to the frontI scampered away as quickly as possible as Tim started to explain that if we didnt have TMEs we didnt have TMEs I watched as CBs anger overcame his cowardice and he raised his voice a little to be rebutted or cut off each time with Tims best gentle giant voice Within two minutes Tim smiled and pointed out the door CB yelled one last unintelligible word and stormed out Tim came over to me gave me a big hug and told me to go take a breather in the back room The rest of that shift was a piece of cake comparatively and when I left that day I knew the store layout like the back of my hand TLDR Fuck Tickle Me Elmos,My first Black Friday and first TFR post  Tickle Me Elmos,170,talesFromRetail,top_week

littlewoolie,8,29,1r6hc9,129,I used to supervise a charity shop on Saturdays and the store manager N instituted a ban on mobile phones in the shopThis was due to an incident involving a very lovely lady Awho used to volunteer at the shop and an entitled customer ECA was running the register that day while N was sorting and pricing stockEC is talking on the phone in the shop and approaches A at the counter with a bundle of clothing and crockery why people cant keep clothes neat while shopping Ill never knowOur shop neatly folds clothing and wraps crockery in newspaper before placing the items in a bag A does this for ECA Your total purchase is xxDuring this whole process EC has been talking nonstop on the phone about various bullshitEC Be quiet Im on the phoneA remains silent and in the meantime more customers are starting to approach the counter standing behind EC waiting for her to finish talking Everyone else starts to look annoyed at ECAfter about  minutes EC finally stops talking to the random person on the phoneA Your total is xxEC You shouldnt interrupt people when theyre on the phoneA Im sorry but I have other people waiting behind you Some of them could be in a hurryEC loudly It doesnt matter about them I was here firstN overhears from the back room comes to the counter and tells A to assist the other customers as she will handle this personN Excuse me you are being extremely rude to A and I will not tolerate it if you cannot behave you need to leave the shopEC I was in the middle of an important phone call and A interrupted meN Then perhaps do not come in here if you need to make a phone calland thus began the ban on customers using mobile phones in our shop There were only  caveats if you had a genuine emergency or if it was a call related to a purchaseIt was heavily enforced to the point that the regular customers would become scared of their phones ringing in the shop apologise and run outside in shameNewer customers took some getting used to the idea and occasionally some would get pissed off and complainTo me it was relief to know that I didnt have to worry about hearing teenagers yelling at their parents parents yelling at their kids finding out more than I ever wanted to about teenage hookups in a religiously associated charity shop no less and actually being able to enjoy the stores music we got to pick our own radio stationCDs to listen to,Mobile Phone policy,158,talesFromRetail,top_week

SuzyGreenburg,10,11,1re89p,110,When I was bar tending one evening a guy that I knew by name only came in  He stumbled up to the bar and ordered his drink a martini of some kind I think  As I grabbed a shaker to get to work on it he began saying that I was being too slow and if I couldnt figure out what to do he would come back there and do it for me  I ignored him and finished the drink  As I handed it back he looked at it told me anybody could make a martini and slapped  cent on the counter  THEN he left the bar to go back into the restaurant that is attached turned back around and said I think I tipped you to fn much  I can make my own gd martini next time  Enjoy your minimum wage  Okay  This all occurred in the matter of two minutes it took to make the drink and the only thing Id said the entire time was What would you like to drink  The other customers were astounded at his rudeness but I brushed it off just another night at the bar rightFast forward an hour or so and I go down to meet my husband at another bar on the property that stays open after the hotel bar closes  Who should be there but the jerk from before  When he spots my husband he comes directly over and starts chatting him up because theyd known each other as kids and were friendly  When my husband introduced me to this guy it was like I was talking to a completely different person  He was all compliments and can I by you a drink and its so nice to meet you lets get a table together  Clearly this guy did not recognize me from before  I stood there looking at his stupid face trying to remain calm but the more I thought about it the angrier I became  When Im in service mode Im worthy of ridicule and rudeness but as my husbands wife Im someone he wants to be friends with  I decided I couldnt let it pass  By the end of my tirade my husband was holding me back jerk off had spilled his drink on himself and was profusely apologizing while trying to blend into the wall  He left shortly thereafter and called my husband the next day to apologize sober  Ugh  Still makes me angry but I hope at least he is hesitant to treat others this way now  My only regret is that I couldnt handle him in a classier way but oh well  He deserved what he got,I hope this belongs here my own experience with people in service being treated like crap,121,talesFromRetail,top_week

MysticSpiral,23,26,1rb12d,99,This is a story of a horrible client a weak manager and a poor associate me caught amidst it all It was a dark night in late spring The shorts are being unpacked and the air is fresh and new hope blooms I love my job and my customers at this store this is before I was promoted and moved to a different location are generally exceptionally awesome Even the bad ones arent really THAT bad and only minor annoyances Now this night we were slow and it was just about closing time so the MOD manager on duty and I were cleaning up around the store Our bliss is soon interrupted by a dark haired demon disguised as a human being   For whatever reason Demon Bitch bypasses the MOD and heads straight for me and I feel a chill roll down my spine I know somehow that this is going to be bad DB I bought this dress the other day whips out cotton dress and I went to put it on a button is missing from the back Can I exchange itMe Hoping this is easier than I first thought Of course lets see if we still have another in the same sizeExtra small petiteWe did not Me Im sorry it doesnt look like we have another in the same color and size We can exchange it for a different color or I can refund you back your money for it no problemDB No I want to wear THIS oneMe I can look it up and see if another store has it if you want We can put it on hold for however long you want and you are welcome to exchange it there We can try to place an order for it as well through the computer but if there is a low inventory theres no guarantee you will get t unfortunately The inventory is about  hours behind and often the numbers are lower than what is shownDB No That is unacceptable I want this one Cant you just sew a new button on itMe Unfortunately we dont have spare buttons but I can sew the button loop to the other side so it doesnt look off balance if you like Mind you the button is TINY About half the size of a dime Its really not that big of an issueNow this where things start to go downhill DB What will you do with the dress if I return it  Honesty to me  is the best policy but had I known how this was going to go down I probably would have just lied to this personMe Most likely we will write a damage tag for it and it will get removed from the inventory and shipped outDB Then rip a button off another dress and sew it to this oneI am VERY taken aback by this  She wants meto destroy No way Just No Me Maam Im sorry I cannot destroy company propertyDB WHAT You just SAID that this one would get sent out if I returned it what is the difference between this one and that one getting sent outMe Well that dress is now YOURS since you bought it You can do with it what you will and if you return it then it becomes the property of the company again  meaning that we will adhere to company policy and not put a damaged item on the floor The other dress on the rack is still company property and I will not willfully destroy company propertyDB I RAN A BUSINESS FOR TEN YEARS YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE THE CUSTOMER HAPPY RIP A BUTTON OFF THAT DRESS AND SEW IT ONTO MINE THIS INSTANTMe I am not going to destroy company property You can return the dress or I can find one at another store Those are your options I am not risking my job by destroying company propertyDB THAT IS BULL SHIT YOU WILL NOT LOSE YOUR JOB OVER MAKING THE CUSTOMER HAPPY I RAN A BUSINESS I KNOW I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGERMe Alright MOD who has been listening the whole time this client would like to speak with youThe MOD comes over and I walk away continue to tidy up the store and do my job Then I see the MOD take the clients dress And the dress on the floor Im thinking that she CANT POSSIBLY be doing what I thinkYes the MOD ripped a button off a dress from the floor and sewed it back on to DBs dress Something or other had brought me to the desk a few moments later while the MOD was wrapping up sewing the new button on During the entire time DB wont stop going on and on about how she ran a business and knows that you do whatever it takes to make a customer happy etc etc etc  She then turns to me again and tells me Losing your job over making a customer happy That is SUCH bullshit I dont know of ANY company that would fire you for making a customer HAPPYI dont give her a response because at this point I am infuriated that the MOD would give into this horrible excuse for a human being and if I do respond it will be nasty DB eventually leaves and the MOD comes overMOD MysticSpiral Im sorry that I went over your head and did that I just could tell that it would escalate further and I didnt want a scene I REALLY loved that MOD she was like another mom to me but I absolutely could not respond to her I dont think I said a word for the rest of the evening The whole thing boils my blood even now So the lesson here is that if you scream and cry and rant and rave you can get someone to destroy company property just so you dont have to

Sapphires,19,22,1r8o2i,95,I work the jewelry counter at a department store  Were a standalone store and more low end than some of the other department stores at the mall across town  We dont actually sell that much fine jewelry  I spend most of my shift straightening clothes and helping in layaway   We wear radios and the jewelry counter is near the service desk so they just call me up when I have a customerOkay so the other night Im closing  I hadnt actually been there more than  minutes when I get my first jerky jewelry customer  An old lady is standing at the counter holding a ziplock bag with an old looking watch in it  The watch has a leather band that looks like its just disintegrated and fallen off of the watchMy first thought is that she wants to pick out a new watch band to math the old one as closely as possible  I can do that  I am prepared to start showing them to herNope  She asks if I can put a band on the watchWe cant  We dont do any jewelry repairs in the store  We dont have the tools or the training or the coverage   Were low end and our jewelry counter is almost an afterthought and definitely not one of our most oftshopped areasI personally would be down to try doing it technically I know how but were not allowed  Its a liability issue  And I can see why  If an employee were to try and then fuck up and break the item the company would have to really kiss the customers ass in order to dissuade any legal actionSo I explain to the woman that we sell bands but cant install them  She is not actually very jerky and goes on her wayNEXT  Id say this was about  minutes later  I get called to the jewelry counter again  This time there are two customers waiting  An older woman and a middle aged man  Theyre not together so I kind of look from one to the other to try to figure out who was first  The man indicates for me to help the woman firstMe  Hi what can I do for you   Woman  I need my watch battery changed   Me  Oh Im sorry  We cant do that here   Woman  sour face You cant do that   Me  We dont have any tools to take the watch apart and we dont install watch batteries or repair jewelry at this store   Woman  Since when  You used to   Ah the dreaded you used to  My particular store asbestos and all no seriously we have a notice in our back room about how the floor tiles are made of asbestos so dont go snorting them or anything is forty years old  The company has had its ups and downs and changed in all kinds of ways over the years  You cant expect a store to stay the same forever  I dont know when my store stopped changing watch batteries but I know that it was some time before I started working there Me  We havent done it since Ive been working here   Woman  Well where am I supposed to go   Me  Youd probably have to go to a jewelry store  I dont know if big box superstore that we all love to hate does it anymore either    Woman  You cant change my battery and you cant even tell me where I can get it done other than a jewelry store    Me  Im so sorry   Woman  You spend  on a watch and it runs down after a year  What am I supposed to do just buy a new one every yearI attempt to repeat that a jewelry store would be more than happy to fix her watch  Woman is not listening she mutters that this is ridiculous and leaves  I turn to help the man  He has our weekly sales ad and is looking for a particular ring shown in it  I start looking through the diamond ring case which is particularly full right now and cannot spot it anywhere  Hmm  I start to explain that sometimes not every store getssells every item shown in the ad since the same ad is released across the whole country but I keep looking for the ringAnd then I see my daytime jewelry coworker who has already ended her shift and is on her way out the door  I flag her down and ask if we have that ringwhere it is  Bad news  They only sent us one and she already sold it earlier that day  AND its not even orderable because it was discontinued hence why it was on sale  Man is not amused and turns to leaveThe rest of my night goes fairly uneventfully  Until almost the end  I happen to be going by the counter when I spotted a couple around my age late s looking at the clearance jewelry case  So I stop and ask if theyd like to look at somethingMan  Actually I need to get a battery put in my watch  he holds up a small tin presumably containing his watch    Me  Oh we cant actually install watch batteries here  We dont have any tools to do so    Man  But do you sell batteries   Me  Yes they have some at the electronics counter  But we cant install them for you    Man  Okay thanks  And then they went off toward electronics and I went back to what I was doing  About ten minutes later the guy running electronics gets on the radio and asks if we have a screwdriver or something at the jewelry counter to get the back off of a watchI felt like screaming  I just told that guy that we couldnt do it  Fortunately my manager gets on the radio and says No we dont  And we cant install watch batteries hereBut apparently this guy was adamant about not leaving the store until he got his watch battery installed  I sat and quietly fumed while my manager and the electronics guy went back and forth talking about screwdrivers for a good  minutes  My manager asked the woman at the service desk if there are any small screwdrivers up there  There werent  And finally everybody relented and electronics guy basically told the guy the only way he was going to get a screwdriver out of us if he went to the hardware section and bought oneTLDR  No we DO NOT install watch batteries here  And when I tell you that we do not have the tools to do so dont go ask the guy at electronics,Do you have a screwdriver  Tales from the jewelry

dogfacegremlin,6,17,1r5qvo,93,BackgroundAnother post on here about shoplifting brought a flood of memories from when I used to work at a big box retail store I worked my way through college and have some very fond memories but some very crazy ones as well This is one of my favoritesI never worked Loss Prevention but was always called up during times of potential thefts The reason being is that contact had to be made with the perp from the time of the incident to the time they left the store  of the time Story timeIt was a few months after being hired I was called on a code blue potential theft I loved these so I rush up front and assume the position around the LP area with the camera I see a gentleman standing by the CD rack looking over the merchandise He looks shifty looks around puts his back to the camera and in a very swift moment turns right to the camera lifts up his shirt and deposits a CD into his pants In full view of the camera He does the same action another  times and proceeds to the exitAs expected we stop him and ask him to come into the LP office He doesnt argue or put up a fight just goes directly to the room with his head held low We ask him to remove the CDs and he does no problems From the beginning of the process I noticed that I knew him We went to HS together not a bright guy and we didnt hang in the same circles but we each saw each other in the halls He finally looks at me closely and it hits him that he knows me He verifies that I am that I am Dogfacegremlin and I say yes Then he asks very candidly if we got him good I smile say yes and show him the video Hes dumbfounded that hes basically showing the camera his theft and remarks that he shouldve done it the other way I laugh it offA few years later same numb nuts went to jail for robbing a bank Asked a buddy for ride to the bank came back to the car crazy asking him to drive Driver noped that idea and just sat there till the cops cameSmarty pants got busted for several other bank robberies because he left the bank bags from previous robberies in his roomTLDR  Caught a guy from my HS stealing asked me if we got him good showed him his theft video Year later same dude busted robbing a bank,Dumbest Thief Ever,110,talesFromRetail,top_week
KroipyBill,11,39,1rhynu,125,After writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterdayhttpredditrfj it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager When I first started working for this place I came in clean shaven and patchy hair I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business and it wasnt until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through It was a relief to embrace it and feel like I looked decent again There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however In fact in my previous stories Ive quoted him several times in our conversations since he was my favorite manager to talk to and the biggest goof ball there He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasnt ready for it Me Dude Im taller than you So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie you will not succeed Manager Well seewellseeAt that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy At least he left it at just contemplating One day we were pretty busy It was preholiday postblack Friday days Im sure you all know the type Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted I was describing the hardware specs how it works with their Apple products etc During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale However I made a massive mistakeI sat down Yes I slipped up big time My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question Employee Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find some bullcrap item that he knew the answer toMe Yeah sure Remember theyre ehahhAHHRight then my manager walks up to me with his pen and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head while it was dragged across my chrome dome My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine I made a weird breathing noise like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head Kind of like EAHH EAHH EAHH Thats the best I can do textually They were quiet sharp noisesHe walked off cackling like the joker I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face He lost his crap and just laughed Because of this I sold him more attachments but thats beside the point Over the radioMe The person who drew on my head You know who you are Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion Im a pretty tall dude so for those who were in eye sight I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person Much laughter followed including my managerManager You said I would never get you Me Well bucket head youre lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me Manager My strike is now complete Me Its a good thing I dont just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face Im glad you feel all militaristic about your approach Manager Ohthis would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play I never got him back And he has since left the store after I left Despite us still being good friends hes still a bucket head ,My Mangers obsession with my baldness Tales from the Large Electronics Store,164,talesFromRetail,top_week
thompsontoonsart,16,15,1r9l9k,95,Customer walks up to me just as Im about to go on my late afternoon lunch break She says shes there to pick up an order for X person name Well call her Fuddle Duddle and it should be a couple of bedskirts She received a call that the order was in Seems clear cut like any other order we have shipped to the store from our warehouse I go to our holds area to find the ordertheres no bedskirts on hold and no orders under the name the customer gave me I walk back onto the selling floor to speak with the customer Maam you said your name is Fuddle Duddle I dont see any orders out back with that name attachedWell no My name is Sue Fuddle is my friend Im in the area so she asked me to pick up her order for herThe next half hour spirals into this confusing mess of misinformation that five other associates attempted to clear up Sue came to the store with Fuddle a couple weeks ago and made a few largeish purchases Sue said Fuddle was pretty sure shed paid for the order being shipped to the store and it just needed to be picked up I look through our log book listing paid for pickup orders and there was no listing of Fuddles name in the book I inform Sue that the order may have only been transferred into the store but not paid for if this was the case our policy is that unpaid hold items are put onto the selling floor after hrs Sue said Fuddle had paid for the bedskirts I tried looking up Ms Duddles customer information in our register and through our catalog system and I found no purchase records at all Well that cant be right Sue said We were here in the store We bought several hundred dollars worth of stuff We were here for hours You must have a record I informed her that their purchases would be in our records but they wouldnt be logged under their names unless we created customer profiles for them Since their names didnt come up in our profile search I figured theyd opted out of having a profile created Sue decides to call Fuddle and confirm the information Sue hands me the phone after a few minutes so I can speak directly with Fuddle I inquire what style bedskirt it was that shed ordered for pick up and she said she couldnt really describe it She could tell me where she found the bedskirt in the store but the one she ordered was the correct size she needed that wasnt available in store at the time Supposedly it was a plain tailored style and she had a receipt for the item at home but she wasnt at home that very moment so she couldnt give me the information on the receipt She insisted she paid for the bedskirt because she had a receipt but her friend had also received a call to pick up her order which she said is a queen sized dust ruffle in white or maybe it was two twins She couldnt even remember what she ordered I described a couple of the styles to her and she suggested our diamond quilted style seemed most likely I asked if her order could have been logged under anyone elses name and she said no but her neighbor Pierce was supposed to pick it up So we had a third person involved in this order I took down Fuddles phone number and the number for her neighbor Pierce who was originally called and notified about the order and I told her wed give her a call once we sort the issue outSue is getting somewhat impatient now because she was there solely to pick up Fuddles order Fuddle lives out of state but owns a second house here in Maine which is where the bedskirt is supposed to go Sue looks at me saying So if you eventually find this bedskirt youll have to mail it to us for free right I dont want to drive another  miles to come pick it up and you already called Pierce to say it was here and somehow its not I told her that we would figure out some way to get the items to the customer if she did indeed already pay for them Sue and her patiently waiting husband decide to leaveMeanwhile my coworker pieces all the mashed up information together and tracks down the receipt for Fuddles original purchase which has a queen sized bedskirt on it She bought the bedskirt and one matching sham in store and they left with her What could she have possibly ordered We went back to the holds area There was a white queen coverlet and one matching sham on hold in the same style as the bedskirt she already purchased under Fuddles neighbor Pierces name and contact phone number and it was unpaid for I run out the door hoping Sue and her husband hadnt pulled out of the parking lot yet They were gone My coworker gets on the phone and calls the neighbor asking if they can contact Sue before she gets too far away from the store Were just hoping things will work out so we dont have to ship this to the customer because the customer clearly gave us all the wrong information The neighbor does get a hold of Sue she comes back and purchases the coverlet and sham for her friendTL Woman comes in to pick up supposedly paid for bedskirt for her friend Lady picking up the order gets annoyed with us because we cant track down the order thats supposed to be in store The actual order wasnt a bedskirt it wasnt paid for and the contact person listed on the order was neither the friend nor the original customer ,Customer doesnt remember what she ordered,110,talesFromRetail,top_week

kemmer,37,22,1rbkuk,93,Summer after I graduated high school I worked at a deli in a casino Ive worked at several other retail jobs since then and the casino job is easily the worst Ive ever had The main reason is that customers were all either drunk or had just lost a bunch of money and they took out that anger and frustration on us Some storiesOrientationEveryone that was starting work in the casino that week no matter the job or department took part in the same orientation It basically consisted of an HR lady telling us how great the company was while we filled out tax forms but it ended in a tour of the whole property We saw the high roller suites the ballrooms all the restaurants etc While touring the steakhouse the most expensive restaurant the manager came out to show us the super expensive liquors they had available He pulled out a bottle of one I dont remember what it was now probably Cristal or something like that and told us how lucky we were to see it up close because none of us would ever be able to afford it Its been  years since I had that job and the memory of that STILL pisses me off I was  years old that dude had no way of knowing what I would do with my life or how much money I would make Not to mention not everyone there were retail workers there were some that were working in management or in administrative jobs like accounting Its been a life goal of mine since then to go back to that restaurant and order all the highest priced items on the menu Just for my own satisfication you know I should have known then this job was gonna suckCountingIm not gonna front Im pretty bad at math Im fairly intellegent otherwise graduated college with a  GPA but Ive just never been able to wrap my head around numbers One day I rang a guy up for a sandwich and drink The order was something like  He handed me  I punched it into the register and was all ready to give him  cents back when he suddenly gave me a quarter I hesistated for a second while I tried to manually calculate what the change would be now It honesly couldnt have been more than  seconds that I hesitated but in that time he started screaming literally screaming at me about how stupid I was and how shitty my education must have been But he couldnt stop there oh no he had to call his wife over so he could point out to her how stupid the employees at this place were Can you believe it How can they hire people this dumb I had figured out his change in the meantime handed it to him turned around and sobbed over the chili The guy walked away shaking his head at me in disgustSuicideMy most memorable day working at the casino and the day I praised God that I was lucky enough to go to college and not have to work there forever This place was essentially like Disneyland in that there was a whole underground world for the employees We had our own stores our own bank our own cafeteria etc To get to the employee cafeteria from the deli we had to walk around the back of the building under a covered walkway type thing The parking garage was right outside the deli doors One day I was walking back to work after my break when I noticed a commotion happening on the ground in the front of the parking garage I looked over and noticed a huge wetspot on the ground mixed with blood and other unidentifiable fluids I couldnt tell what was going on but I was late getting back from break so I just went back into the deli Found out later that an employee in another department had committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the parking garage They had already removed the body but I got to see the remnants The image of that will forever stick in my brainThose are my best stories but that doesnt even touch the mean as nails cook that got hit by a car the Jamaicans that stole from me and that were essentially being used as indentured servants by the company or the chef that I secretly discovered had two families neither knew of the other I got my revenge on that place by stealing cookies all the time Those cookies were damn goodTLDR Casinos are possibly the worst places on earth,Why I cried over chili and other tales from the casino,115,talesFromRetail,top_week

ExcerptMusic,18,14,1rahbf,89, I work for a major cell phone retailer and frequently deal with technical issues Most of the time I love to help people figure out their phone so that they can get the most out of it However there are always certain individuals that blame their devices for their own faults Feel free to comment with similar issues as an employee or customer including silly things that were accidentally done that messed up a phoneKeep in mind the following text is currently in my head unless in quotes I am being as nice as possible on the outsideI had a customer come into the store that had a few problems with his phone I knew it wasnt going to be fun to figure out because he had on the fuck you face and looked to be in the ignorant with technology age range He presented me with  problems My alarm doesnt alert me in the morning and I need it for work The outside keys dont lock so the phone turns the speaker on The battery runs out when I unplug it at nightHe then followed by I bought this phone  days ago and want to return it and Ive been with this company for  years Advice to anyone that plans on throwing the Ive been shopping here for X amount of years This company doesnt care about you personally they just dont This isnt some mom amp pop shop that is hanging on simply by your individual business This is a multiBILLION dollar company They care even less if you were an asshole to them for those  years because I guarantee this isnt your first time complaining  So you bought the phone  days ago Sorry you cant return it There is a  day return policy on phones company wide This does not change unless there was an issue with ordering or computer date errors which doesnt happen We could also get the manufacturer to replace it if there is actually a problem with it There was no problem with the phone so there is  nothing I can do to get this guy a new phone So I check it out and explain to him what is going on The alarm First off his alarm was off He said it is because he turns it off on the weekends and on Monday it doesnt work I told him you need to turn it on or only set it for weekdaysI did this for him He kept saying that the phone was broken and the alarm would go off  minutes after it was supposed to I tested the alarm feature about  times No issues If it happened every time like he said I would have seen it at least once Even after telling him that the alarm was off he kept telling me it was the phone that had the problem and it was doing it automatically No It wasnt Next issue The outside keys wouldnt lock Ok This is a flip phone so there are volume keys and speaker phone keys He also has a horizontal belt carrier He tells me when he pushes the phone up in its holster while someone is calling him he pushes the buttons and that his old phone didnt do that I tell him that there is no way to turn off the buttons while someone is calling You can turn them off while no one is calling but not during a call After talking more with him I figured out why his old phone didnt have that issue He used to have a vertical belt clip and never pressed the buttons when he took out his phone Next issue The battery runs out at night This one is just stupid He told me that when he fully charges his phone at night he unplugs it and leaves it open The phone also has the screen timeout disabled So at night he unplugs the phone at  leaves it open fully lit and goes to bed Then in the morning he is mad that it is almost dead He must sleep with the lights on or something I dont know I set a screen timeout and told him to just leave it plugged in even though that slowly discharges battery over months and years A problem with battery capacity in  years isnt going to be his most pressing issue and it will prevent a lot of manufacturer return claims because the phone dies at night Now that ive fixed his issues he says that he will try it out but he doesnt expect it to work because it was the phone  Sorry guy it wasnt the phone It was user error through and through Dont blame technology for your mishaps Technology isnt some black magic  of operating a phone is common sense and an ability to read If the alarm says OFF then the alarm is off Its that simple  As much as I hate these people I like to see their reactions even when I fix their issues Its almost always negative with no thanks while stomping out the door I just have to roll my eyes and wait for that awesome customer that listens to experienced advice and recognizes their errors while laughing about it Seriously those are the best customers everTLDR User error accounts for most errors,Dont blame technology if you dont know how to use it,103,talesFromRetail,top_week
LossPreventionSucks,24,23,1rfcsa,83,This is my first time posting here but Ill just warn you this can get a bit winded  Ive yet to be able to REALLY rant about this guy as my manager mentioned I should keep quiet about the whole ordealNow I work for a popular gaming store chain  Im sure you can guess which one  Ive heard the horror stories however Ive had an amazing experience working there up until I met our Loss Prevention ManagerTo start the day off I had to open  I went in about  minutes earlier than usual because we had a heavy load from the night before thanks to the XBox One launch  I wanted to clean everything up before customers started piling in  I already told my manager I was just going to leave earlier in the day so we didnt go over hours and he was totally fine with that  Anyway  minutes after walking through the door a group of people start banging on the door relentlessly yelling IM HERE LET ME IN  I ignore them for the first  minutes I mean gates are down and they are banging on the door exactly where our hours are posted and its almost  hours before open  I walk up to them and inform them we open at   The man quickly snaps Bullshit We were told by StoreManager that you opened early today for the system release  So I texted my manager and sure enough he said Absolutely not  If theyre picking a system up let them in though  I asked if they were picking a system up and he responded with No I want to return this stuff holding up at least  worth of XBox games and a system  I told him he would have to wait as my computers are still down  He finally agreed and left only to call every  minutes or so and ask if we were open yet For the next hour and a half  Now because this guy was so persistent I decided to leave the safe cracked open so we didnt have to wait for the  minute timer to go up  I figured hed come back right away  That was my first mistake  He never did come back and due to us being so busy and me being the only one there I forgot that the safe was cracked just a tiny bitOn to the second half I was there alone all morning  I had several people asking for systems which require me to go through a locked door through a hallway and into another locked door to get to  I have to do this for each system whether or not  people in line are waiting for a system  This gives  minutes of time each time I have to get a system where there is absolutely no employees covering the store  So what did I do  I propped the first door open  Mistake number twoAfter a bit my parttimer came in   minutes after opening I repeat we were open for  whole minutes at this point  of which I had spent alone with nearly  customers in the store picking up systems In walks our Loss Prevention guy  I didnt know he was Loss Prevention though No He instantly walks in starts yelling at my parttimer about the door and she directs him to me as she had just gotten there  Still no introduction the following commencedFatLossPreventionMan  Why the hell is the back door openMe  Can I help youFatLP  IS YOUR SAFE OPEN  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING remember theres multiple people in the store at this point several in lineMe oh fuck   stutter stutterYeah there was an incident this morning where I had a return but he never showed up  I also needed to add change to the registerFatLP You cant do this  Are you the managerMe No may I ask who you areFatLP beaming Im Dave  Im here to audit and help with customersMe  Okay  Yeah I messed up  Its been a hectic morningAfter this exchange he continued to point out every thing that was wrong in our store  Mind you Im not the manager  Im not even assistant manager  Im a store worker who gets paid  cents more than minimum wage with manager duties  He continued to attack my coworker and I about controllers being live on the floor hanging on pegs  feet in the air saying someone could jump up and knock them off to steal them I wanted so badly to ask him to show me how  He then answered phones with just Hi this is Dave  No greeting nothing Just Dave  Then he proceeded to hang up on the people when he didnt know the answer These people then called back so they could complain to meAt this point he had yelled at my coworker and I loomed over us and degraded us so badly that I was near tears  He walked around the store talking to our DM about how pathetic this was and how incompetent the work is that he is seeing  Several customers had come up expressing their concern for my coworker and I  The best part was when I was actually shedding tears and helping a customer while Dave looked on giving no personal space  The customer asks Are you okay and Dave butts in Shes fine Do you want the GPG  I said nothing I was beaten and I couldnt do anything  The entire two hour period this man was there he told me about  different things that I had done that was a terminable offense  I was afraid if I said anything more that I would be done And I need this job  Anyway Theres a lot more about working at this game retailer that I could share mostly from corporate but this is by far the worst experience Ive ever hadTLDR  Shitty customers banging on the door  I screw up Loss prevention

adelajoy,15,14,1rg29x,73,I spent two years working at a big warehousestyle grocery store I worked mostly as a cashier but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a weekMost of the crappy moments have all blurred together but there are a few particular moments that stick outThis grocery store is the only one in the area that doesnt bag your groceries for you Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down away from the till This speeds orders up requires less staff saves money and drops prices People occasionally complain about it but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them theyre welcome to  The store isnt exactly famous for customer service but I think the prices make up for thisI was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time This meant that my belts would often get full I had ways to deal with this I knew how fast people packed I knew how soon a belt would clear I was really good at my job One day the lines were insanely long I was working really fast everyone was buying a lot I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts so I squeezed the smaller order down a little watched for a moment and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him I started scanning the next order and smiled at the customers  a man and his very pregnant wifeThe wife snapped at me Can you just waitExcuse meCan you wait I dont want you to crowd out that other guyI looked and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries I stopped scanning anyways and maybe glared at the lady I dont really like it when other people tell me how to do my jobEventually he was packed and gone so I started scanning again While I had been waiting I had lined all of their canned goods up I can scan cans super fast if theyre all really close I started scanning the canned goods grabbing a can tossing it to my other hand and setting it on the other belt Except that this woman had walked around The belt she got was behind me and was standing behind me trying to bag the cans as I scanned them Im sorry but Im not actually looking where the cans go I know the space and I need to watch the computer screen not my hands Well she kept trying to grab the one Id just set down which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can I wasnt by any means throwing the cans but I was moving quickly and she was in my space so she was getting hit I didnt actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband So I slowed down apologized and moved on to her other groceriesShe then had a bag of apples She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it and tied it shut I have to weigh each type of fruit separately so I opened the bag weighed the first apple set it aside I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away I weighed the second apple and set it aside He grabbed that one too When I weighed the third my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut but the other two apples were gone I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately he was welcome toThe couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies One of the bags had been ripped all the open right down the middle and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt I considered not telling them because I was mad but I took a deep breath rounded up all of the stray perogies put them in a plastic bag and informed the lady I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag She snippily replied Yes as if I should have just known Some people dont bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line so I always ask Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept goingWhen I finally finished They bought a lot of stuff the husband paid while the wife stormed over to customer service I watched as she talked to my supervisor and eventually a store manager I was getting pretty nervous Oh also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question I was pretty angry by the time they leftAfter they were completely done my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer serviceShe said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me Apparently the conversation went something like thisPregnant Lady I want to complain about the cashier on till Nice Supervisor Till  Do you mean till  I was on   one of my quicktoanger coworkers was on PL No I mean NS Like the girl with brown hair not the blondePL getting frustrated YesNS So what did adelajoy doPL She was rude and short with meNS Adelajoy Are you surePL Yes She also threw canned goods at me ripped open a bag of perogies scattered them everywhere and scattered all of my apples too She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them aroundA store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint which means it probably went in my employee file The lady was calmed down and left and that was the end of it Typically the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints and make sure they wont happen again The fact that I didnt means either the manager simply didnt believe the woman or wasnt concerned because it was my first and only The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened I told her my side and she just laughed it off I admitted to being short and snippy but the rest was just ludicrous I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open considering I told her about them got a new bag and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies Also why would I take the time to do that when I was clearly rushed with everything elseI get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones and tend to be angry shorttempered whatnot but I think theres a line Also the fact that her husband didnt stop her stand up for me or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me offTldr Crazyhormones pregnant lady complained about me but the supervisor didnt believe her,In my spare time I like to rip open your groceries and scatter them,87,talesFromRetail,top_week

shadowmanwkp,12,20,1r1q8g,59,Preface I work at a Dutch chain store where we sell a variety of things food furniture curtains cutlery and a lot more Were most wellknown for selling stuff from abroad and selling it at a reasonable price Payout may be a bit above minimum wage but my colleagues are awesome and my manager is a really great guyBeing in the Netherlands theres one thing that is even bigger than Christmas Sinterklaas If youre not in the know Sinterklaas is about the same as Christmas but with the bishop of Myra st Nicholas coming all the way from Spain to the Netherlands supported by his personal army of black petes Last saturday it was the great inception because old saint Nick would come into my town with his steam boat This being one of the biggest events in town of the year and us being in front of the square where saint Nick will be coming you can imagine that it is very busy at our store when it happensOnto the story at hand Our manager warned us before we got started that the amount of thefts is increasing these days There were about a dozen of armbands stolen from our store the other day leaving only the cartons Because we have no detection gates stealing is easy but we barely if ever have any thefts unless it is holiday season This warning stuck with me the whole day and it was a good thing it didOut of our three registers we had two open near the end of the morning we were still anticipating saint Nicks arrival in town but that would turn out to be the end of the day Just to be sure that we had enough registers open I was near the registers so I could keep an eye on the amount of customers in queue and man the third register if needed In comes the group of five tenyearolds racing past our registers and jumping onto the candy which is just before me already making me suspicious because usually people will ask us whether or not it is ok to come in through the wrong side I keep an eye on them as they enthusiastically discuss what they will buy Nearly instantly a customer waiting in line says that they probably are stealing now Im on high alert As one of them goes past the registers I see him with his hand in his pocket Immediately as he brushes past me I ask him Me Do you have anything in your pocketHe immediately removes his hand from his pocket and begins sticking them up in the airPocket kid No I dont Search me all you want I dont have anythingWell thats a response that shows a lot of guilt and makes you suspicious all the more However we dont search customers so I let him off the hook Just when I finished with pocket kid from the corner of my eye one of the kiddos has a pack of chewing gum in his hand Just as I turn fully around it is vanishedI get angry really angry even if youre young that doesnt mean that shoplifting isnt a crime so I raise my voice a little and say You there I know youve got chewing gum in your pocket so dont forget to pay for itThe kid is flabbergasted and I am on my way for my lunch break we are very strict with them on busy days I see my boss on the way and I quickly inform him about the situation He tells me he will keep an eye on the situationDuring lunch break I review my own actions towards those kids maybe theyre going to step up to their parents Maybe my boss didnt like the way I handled the situation Anyways I wanted to talk to my boss because I was doubting myself I got my grub and the lunch break end At this point there are more people in the store so we open up all the registers to be able to service all customers Along the way I inform my boss that I want to talk to him It wasnt very busy but its better to be safe than sorry so I keep working at the register I help some customers and generally have a blast workingSuddenly two girls come up to my register just barely tall enough for me to see them over the counter They are being very sweet and ask me if they could ask how much a key chain costs With a genuine smile I tell them that it will set them back around  Its a bit steep for them so they tell me they want to ask their father to pay for them I offer them to let me hang on to it so they can simply walk up to the register and pay for it when they get back they happily obligeI get on with my work and it gets a bit busier so I didnt see the girls nor their dad It takes an hour or two before one of the girls comes back with their motherMe Hello how may I help youMom Hello my daughter had interest in a key chainMe Ah yes she was here earlier and asked about the price I believe its this oneI show the key chain and the girl confirms its the oneJust when the mother wants to pull out the money she suddenly stopsMother Whats that in your pocketGirl NothingMother Come on show me whats itThe girl pulls out an I lt beer key chainMother Where did you get this fromGirl From somebodyI am a bit doubtful so I ask the mother if I could check it I dont recognize it because we sell dozens of the bloody things so I flip it over to see if I recognize the markings Lo and behold they were identical to the key chain I held onto for the girlMe Madam the markings are the same as the key chain from our storeMy boss passes by and he says in a very polite way I would never be able to pull offBoss Madam it is from our storeUsually parents do not keep their cool if they catch their kid stealing after all you taught them not to do it and they still do This woman however kept her cool and pulled it off in styleMom Now be honest with me where did you get this from  Girl From somebody in the store  Mom No thats not true we know that you got it from the store Did you take it without permissionThe girl keeps totally silent obviously embarrassed by the whole ordeal The mom waits a little bit to see if her daughter will form a response but nothing She respectfully asks her daughterMom Would you like to apologize to the mister in front of you  Girl   Mom Come on apologize  Girl Im sorry  Me Apology acceptedI feel like a moron asking this but still its an honest questionMe Madam do you still want to buy they key chain despite all this  Mother No it was a present for her because she was behaving well However because she did this I wont buy it for her  Me Thats ok I wish you a nice day anyways  Mother A good day to you as wellThe day turned out to be mediocre saint Nick came and went and we didnt have as many customers as we hoped But I didnt forget to make a talk with my boss so when we only needed two registers open I asked a colleague to man the register in my place and I asked my boss if I could talk with him in the back I make him some coffee and we begin to talkMe Well I hope you know why I wanted to talk  Boss Yeah I do  Me Well I wasnt really certain if I responded the right way towards those kids this morning Im a bit afraid that their parents might come back because I didnt really follow protocol  Boss No not at all You did the right thing Although what youve said might have been a bit direct you did overhear from the customers that those kids might have stolen something And that thing with the girl was also handled well you did great todayWell that was a load off my chestTLDR Even little kids can turn out to be shoplifters and my boss is a kickass,Shoplifting it starts as early as ten years,79,talesFromRetail,top_week

KDR,9,11,1ra3wz,55,Im reasonably new to this subreddit and reddit in general but because I have spent the bulk of my working life in retail and can relate to most of these stories I find myself drawn here I felt it was only fair to share one of my stories This one in particular is inspired by uunmined most recent storyQuick back story I moved to the city earlier in the year after finishing high school After a string of lousy or temporary jobs I get hired as an electronics associate at an overwhelmingly large retail chainOur story begins on my first day of work Which happened to coincide with my birthday    I step on to the floor following way too close to my manager because I have absolutely no idea what to do or where to go At this point Ive just resigned that this day is gonna be terrible no matter what happens After all spending your birthday at your first day as a retail slave isnt exactly a dream come true He sets me up changing all the tags for the new DVD releases with another coworker lets call him Bas to make sure I dont screw it up At the time the department wasnt terribly large at least not as big as it is now so to make up for that fact the shelves were quite tall As far as I was concerned the department didnt exist past the DVD racks and B and myself were the only employees in the department As soon as Im starting to get comfortable and feel like I know what Im doing I hear a female voice behind me So this is the new guy huhI turn to see where the words are coming from and Im completely blindsided by what stands before me She is the girl Ive been searching my entire life for and I didnt even know it She stands eye level with me about  if it matters with long blonde hair that comes down to her shoulder blades Her eyes are a deep green color that I could lose myself in to the point that I cant look in to them for too long in fear Ill never find my way back out I can smell a faint sweetness when shes near almost like vanilla which I find out later is from her body wash In short she is every thing I have ever wanted and all I will ever wantB finally breaks the silence which seems to go on for an eternity but was probably only  seconds Yea his names    whats your name againIn that instant I suddenly forget what people have been calling me my entire life to the point where I have to sneak a look at my name tag to remember Its    umm    KDRShe cracks a smile and almost starts to giggle Thats an interesting name where you named after Insert ActorAround the time she stops speaking I finally remember how words work Honestly Im not sure I never thought enough to askHeh well I guess Ill see you around thenI wave bye to her as she disappears around the corner I can still smell vanilla and shes all I can think about for the rest of my shiftWe continued to work together but never really had any extended conversation except for having to ask her where things were for customers or what set of keys opened what cases Based on what I had heard from my coworkers she wasnt a very pleasant person to be around and the word bitch was used a few times It wasnt until a full month after our initial encounter that we finally got to spend some time togetherOur manager had given her the task of reorganizing the wall of printer ink It was essentially a  foot tall  foot wide section of madness She was to pick one person to help her with this and it was expected to take a few days I find out the day she starts working on it that Im the one that gets to help from our manager As we were walking over he leans over to me as half whispers I know this isnt gonna be a fun project and she isnt always the most friendly person but at least she isnt bad to look at I force a laugh and crack a smile but something tells me Im gonna enjoy the hell out of this projectDuring this time we talk    a lot About everything from interests and hobbies to our coworkers where we grew up and everything in between As it would happen most of our interests coincide She reads comics as well shes into computers albeit not quite to the extent I am but this is hardly a deal breaker and we actually grew up only  miles from each other but in different school districtsAfter that week of work I had decided she was going to be the woman I would spend the rest of my life with It would seem she had decided the same because she started inviting me over after work to hang out with her and a few friends Eventually she stopped inviting the friends And from there things ran their course This story took place over  years ago Im very happy to say that I havent changed my mind about spending the rest of my days with her and she hasnt either I guess what Im trying to say is yes retail is awful The customers are almost always unbelievably rude or amazingly stupid and the pay is never enough to make up for it Were on the cusp of one of the worst times to be a retail employee but sometimes things work out in ways you would never expect and change your life foreverTLDR  I met the girl of my dreams on my first day as a retail slave,Retail isnt always terrible,66,talesFromRetail,top_week
Stachahof,5,13,1r0j3k,50,This is my first time posting here but Ive been lurking for quite a while  I work in a used media store thats privately owned by a nice guy and for the most part I love it  I get great discounts I have plenty of regular customers who I like and the entire atmosphere is pretty casual and laid back since there is no bigbad corporate to answer toThen there are the drawbacks  Threats and cursing from customers who dont like their cashtrade offers and just overall rude people  We also cater to lowincome people because our prices are so low the majority of our stock costs no more than  and while I dont want to generalize a lot of them arent the most desirable type of personThis particular story happened about a month ago  The couple in question is fairly regular though I havent seen much of them since this happened but Ive never liked them much  Theyre usually pretty loud and dismissive  This particular day they brought back a movie that apparently hadnt worked  They just wanted to exchange it for a different movie  No problem my coworker scanned their receipt and credited them  and they went to shopping  When they were finished they brought a stack of movies up to the counter for me to ring out  As I took them the man kept one and told me he didnt have to pay for that one because hed brought another back  Well call him Dumb FuckMe No problem sir I just need to scan it to take it out of the computer systemDF But I dont have to pay for itMe You wont sir  I just need to scan itReluctantly he hands me the DVD and I scan it with the rest of their movies  I apply their discount and their total ends up being  for five movies  The man pays and I think its finished when he turns to his wife and says to her not to me She charged me for that movieImmediately Im irritated that hes talking about me as though Im not there but I bite my tongue and explain to him that hed only paid for four movies  He ignores me and continues to tell his wife that Ive overcharged him  I pick up his movies which I havent bagged yet and stack them on top of each other adding the cost of them as I go      Then I took off the top movie the one hed gotten for free and set it aside    You only paid for four movies sir I smileDF I cant believe she fucking charged me for that movie when I had a refundI really have to fight back my anger at this pointMe Would you like me to go through the math again for you sirA miracle he finally addresses meDF I dont need anyone to do math for me Im real good at mathHe complains for a couple more minutes but eventually he takes his movies and leaves still convinced that he overpaid for them  I just sat down right there on the floor behind the counter and asked my coworker to please watch the floor for a minute  He couldnt stop laughing,She charged me,63,talesFromRetail,top_week

unmined,7,14,1r28n5,49,Tales from unmineds Crazy TowngtNOTE series title change since Im rotating stories from a couple different places now Comment if you have title suggestionsTaco Shops parcel delivery finance and computer geekdom Where will we go today  Today is boxes Shall we beginIve written a couple times before about my stretch with the largest parcel delivery serviceMy job was to sort packages that went to a group of six different ZIP code in San Diego Occasionally a box would show up that did not belong in my area Sometimes its because of a mistake farther down the line or it could be a bad address street does not belong in ZIP code or it could be a major fuckup caused by someone believing an address or ZIP belonged to me when it did notThis is about a major fuck upAt the beginning of the shift the unloaders people who emptied out the massive silver trailers and the presorters people who divided the unloaded boxes on to nine belts  one of which went to me were under the impression that a large mailorder company was now in my area It was not But that didnt stop them from sending a couple hundred misrouted boxes my wayWhen I would get a misrouted box I would toss it on to a return belt near my feet if it was small enough If it was too large or if the belt near my feel got backed up the box had to go to one of six guys in my area This pissed them off when it happened because they had to touch something that did not belong to them technical note this company is absolutely insane with logistics they preach the art of touching something a few times as possibleI did my best to distribute the load as fairly as possible So as the crap came in I rotated the victim Everyone except BadassPonytail was understandingBadassPonytail started yelling insults after each misrouted box reached him Over the course of the first two hours I got called asshole faggot fucker mother fucker pussy pansy goddamn piece of shit mongoloid surprised at this one since it required knowing what it meant blind inbred etc LoudlyThe environment was pretty permissive of this type of banter It was a dirty shitty environment and there was absolutely no decorum This may have changed over the years but in this era there was zero censorshipPermissive or not personal or not I had enough It wasnt my fault and there was zero I could do about it So I gave everyone else a break and started sending  of the misrouted load to BadassPonytail I mean if Im going to get abused I might as well give him a reasonBox after box went to him He very quickly got backed up since he couldnt handle is regular workload on top of the crap His anger started boil He was getting truly and sincerely angry The verbal assault gained volume and he started calling out for a supervisor A supervisor did arrive and wrongly assumed I was still evenly distributing the crap So he told BadassPonytail to stop being a babyAt the hour three mark he exploded He began throwing boxes at me from about  feet away I shut my belt down turned around and played wide receiver He threw I caught then stuck the box back on his belt After a couple minutes of this I was grinning like an idiot and started flipping his off after each catchYoure gonna die motherfuckerBadassPonytail jumped up to his own conveyor belt and began to rush me He is both larger and stronger than I am and I knew that if there was any actual violence I would likely get thrashed So I grabbed the heaviest box I could find and held it up like a shieldHe charged into me and I thrust the box into his chest causing him to lose balance Instead if hitting me he had to right himself or hed fall about three feet onto a steel grateAfter stumbling his mind cleared One more fucking misroute and Im going to kill you after workFuck you you retarded piece of shit Youre gonna get everything for the rest of the day unless you close your fucking mouth As for after work just try Ill fucking flatten you and strangle you with your ponytailNow I said a lot of stuff working here It was very typical of me to speak of my physical abilities in terms that far exceeded reality I mean if I saw him waiting for me Id run to my car like a frightened gazelle and never look back I hate fighting and had managed to avoid it since middle schoolBut it worked and he backed down Look hand the stuff out fairly and well be cool But you keep fucking with me and well have a problemI punctuated the encounter with another middle finger salute but went back to being fair again No asses were kicked that dayI sincerely hope the culture has improved at San Diego Sunrise Looking back I laugh and cringe at how awful the environment was Everywhere else Ive working in life both of us would have been fired on the spot And we would deserve itThanks for

ArQuesta,27,20,1r3xmk,49,Hello again fellow retail slaves Ive posted a few times before but mostly about my time before college when I worked at a Stop for Gamers Not today I meant to go get some reading done this evening but the sky is absolutely pissing rain right now and Im carless at the moment so I decided to tell you about a recent storyI just got done with my Bachelors this summer I know I should have escaped the abyss that is retail but Im stuck at home saving up money to move to the DC area at the moment while also filling out grad school applications as well as working on big job applications Im in a stupid spot and I need money so I started working at a big name coffee shop which is a threeminute walk from home ScoreFor the most part the job is fine no real horrible people to be found The ones that are entitled dicks who deign not to make eye contact usually end up tipping so its fine with me if they like being pricks They just spent  on a fcking drink Anywho Last week I encountered something absolutely amazing in its oddness I was working the drivethru window which at night meant I was taking orders and money and passing drinks and whatnot During a rush theres two of us as peoples drinks go from normal to downright stupidcomplicated But alas theres always a button for itA nice shiney k car pulls up my last customer in a long line rush She seems nice and as her drink is still being made we chitchat Now for some background I have the worst baby face I mean its great that I look young but depending on the person my  years looks like  I dont wear makeup drink or smoke so I am lacking any prewrinkles and Im chubby so I have the dumbest looking baby cheeks Its fine though as I get to surprise people with my age and that amuses me greatly For this conversation Ill use BAC for the lady and Me as meBAC Oh are you still in school right nowMe Actually I just finished Im working here to help pay for grad school applications and get on my feetBAC Oh what did you major inMe EastAsian studies chuckles Its kind of useless around hereBAC Would you say that you could talk about your major confidentlyMe at this point wondering if she works for the nearby college or needs a strangely specific tutor Oh yeah I can talk for days about culture history politics language etc for daysBAC Have you ever read the bibleMe shitshitshitshit here it comes Well a bit when I was youngerBAC with smug confidence and a gleam in her eyes When I was in college my psychology professor told us about the world in two boxes one where God existed and one where he doesnt Sure if youre in the box where he isnt there fine but what if youre in the other one Is it really that harmful to believeNow at this point my supervisor was standing behind me counting drawers and had tuned out the conversation as she told me afterwards I kept hoping my body language and the amount of time we were at the window would get her to help me but alas I was trappedMe remembering hearing that analogy used to argue the other point of view but deciding not to argue at work Well as a kid my dad let me try out every religion and Ive built myself up with the best morals and ideas from all of them If I had to subscribe to anythingBAC Some people are really fake you know They pretend to be deep but they lack in the most important area suddenly angry I know a lot of fake people and they arent people you should call friendsMe the fukThis was the most annoying partBAC suddenly remembering that she in the middle of preaching What are you going to do after youre done with schoolMe I dunno work for the governmentBAC And thenMe Take care of my parents and familyBAC And thenMe Travel or work abroadBAC And thenMe Ive thought about adoptingBAC And thenMe Live my life happilyBAC What about after lifeMe Theres nothingBAC legitimately surprised And youre okay with thatMe Well yeah were not immortal You live to the best of your ability until you dieBAC changing tactics When I used to work in retail I was a great salesperson really friendly but it was fake People are fake Then I read the bible Theres something there if you read it youll understandMe Maybe one day Ill read it but its notBAC Well you know everyone has problems rightMe Of courseBAC surprised for some reason that Ive agreed with her Well how do you deal with problemsMe Sometimes slowly sometimes not at all I try to sit down and think about things and to talk to people You can either sit down and let them destroy you or try to get up again Some people cant cope and need medications but I know a lot of people who deal with things on their ownBAC My husband used to be addicted to money sex and drugsThis is about where my patience absolutely ended my face started to crack a grin Im not an arrogant person but I write I read I study constantly Im an intelligent person and I wasnt going to allow her to outwit or speak me but I was also trying to be unfailingly politeMe corners of my mouth twitching Oh yeahBAC conspiratorially He used to be the biggest drug dealer in my home townMe holding in my amusement badly ReallyBAC Now hes the best husband utterly faithful and he read the bible Hes spiritual now thats proof You have toAnd then like God himself saying Jesus lady shut up the drivethru dinged and my supervisor started our spiel I said goodbye to the dear Born Again Christian and turned away from the window As I walked away my face flushed bright red and my eyes teared up from all my held back emotions My coworkers started laughing and asking what had happened I was a little mortified I mean here was this lady with a car worth more than my fouryear education lecturing a girl lol who she thought was in the middle of college  working minimum wage at a coffee place after dropping thousands on a what she thought excellent education If she only worked retail than dear drugdealing hubby must have paid for that right At what point did she have the right to say that I wasnt spiritual Im very spiritual and I have my own views of spirituality At what point did she have the right to say that to not read the bible was to be a fake human being who was obsessed with drugs money and sex Not only that did she really initiate a conversation geared towards the nonreligious simply because I told her I was educated Plus she didnt tip that poor drivethru girl who had to listen to her for fifteen minutes What a tool SeriouslyTLDR Educated women are obviously atheists Srsly,The DriveThru Window Assault,69,talesFromRetail,top_week

DrunkenBlackBelt,7,9,1rhw8z,58,Im back bitches  About  months ago I got a second job working part time at a mens Big ampTall store  The hours are easy commision is alright and to be honest the customers are generally friendly and awesome  It helps that a lot of them dont have anywhere else to shop Unfortunantly the store isnt as eventul as my past retail jobs  Its just selling clothes and shoes  But Ive gotten a few funny stories that Ill share over time here And with the holidays coming up im sure Ill have plenty more  Welll for your pleasure hopefully I present Boy Are My Feet SoreWARNING GROSSSo recently I began working in a mens store for Big amp Tall sizes  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there  Only store that carries a size   I am too small for the clothes despite being  and slightly overweight  And if Im being honest  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight  lbs this year alone  Now dont get me wrong SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot set it slightly closer to the proper position let it heal and repeat But it never set  correct keeping him from being able to run or exercise or even stand for long periods of time  Its guys like him I feel for  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it Most customers however are just plain old fat guys  I dont want to sound mean or fat shame  But its just poor lifestyle choices and such  I was there  I was lbs shy of  last new years  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices  I dont have as much sympathy for these guys  And that brings us to our story todayIts a sunny fall day  Its midweek and pretty dead  Im in my suit fixing clothes putzing around pretty much just pretending to work  I hear the door chime and in walks an older couple  Probably late s very early s  The lady was using a walker to move around and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her  They seemed like a nice enough couple but as you know those are the ones who always turn into assholesI introduced myself asked how I could help them that day  The man gruffly replied shoes  I brought them to the shoe department  Now my store is small and there is only one small bench to sit on and its in the shoe department  Naturally this oaf takes the seat leaving his frail wife to stand  I could tell she was having difficulty being particularly petire and frail so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband  She thanked me because manners  The man charming fellow that he was just said can you get me some shoes now  It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex gf in a dick sucking contestI offered several suggestions as the gentleman didnt seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted  The man complained that most of our shoes dont even fit him I expressed sympathy as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store  The man looked me up and down and sneered Well you just have big feet I have a health condition that causes this so consider yourself lucky  Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet  And thats when the real horror of this story starts  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals  His feet are hugely swollen and covered in open sores  This guy has diabetes and its eating away at his foot  Sadly its fairly common where I work  What came next however is notI hand him the shoes and take a step back giving him some space to put the shoes on look at them in the mirror see how they feel etc  NOPE  He looks at me like an idiot and says Well I cant put them on myself  I cant bend that far  Put them on for me   Now I am no fan of feet even on a good day  Sure if Im dating someone and they want a footrub and their feet are clean then ill oblige  But other than that I just want nothing to do with that area of the body  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open oozing sores  DBB Sir I just cant do that Im sorryMan  You need to help me  Im a customer and I need serviceDBB There is no way I am doing that sir  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg Its unsanitary for both me and YOU to have me do thatMan Oh just wash your hands after itll be fineHow this man survived  or so years with logic like that will forever amaze me  DBB Absolutely not  Man I want the manger  Ill have your ass for discrimination and harrassmentDBB  I am the manager  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow  If you want corporates phone number Ill give it with my name gladly  The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really  I essentially told him that I wasnt going to touch his feet and if he didnt like the service he could leave Wife is trying to keep the peace  Its not very effective  Husband used Rage  Its inneffective against DBB  Besides my DEF is to high  Anyways i wish there was some more to this  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt  I did hear from corporate the next day though  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in but once I explained about the sores I receieve a Yea that happens all the time Dont worry about it  Sorry if its not very exciting  Im sure Ill have some good ones coming up  Hope you all are surviving

owners can get a loan for an item or get paid the least amount the shop workers can get away with for the items before they resell them We take the items in and once they sell we get a commission off the sale and the original owners get a check in the mail once a month We sell both in store and on eBay  spacer  spacer  This little old lady walks into the shop one afternoon looking for furniture for her daughter She had just moved into a new apartment and she has nothing to put in it I smile thinking thats very nice of the lady to come in with the intention of getting things for her daughter

something like thisOld Lady How much for the TVMe OL Okay Ill probably take it Does it come with a remote  spacer  spacerMy boss who was processing item drop offs overheard and said there wasnt one

me she planed on getting the TV and the remote but she had no idea how it worked and asked me about it I anticipated this question when my boss mentioned the remote so rather than try to explain to her how to use the remote on the TV I told her Id be right back and to feel free to look around more  spacer  spacer  I noted the brand of the TV cant remember what it was and went to my laptop with the remote I look up the instructions for that specific remote since it didnt have any with it and also looked up the codes for the TV I wrote everything down on a piece of paper and then went over exactly what she had to do with the remote to get the TV working with it I figured showing her rather than just telling would be better The whole process took about  minutes including the other questions she had about stuff in the store She was very grateful and purchased the TV remote and a wall plaque  spacer  spacer  The next trick was getting the TV into her car This wasnt a flat screen It was one of those TVs that liked big butts and it cannot lie It was also very heavy So while she was pulling her car up front my boss and I were trying to figure out how we were getting the behemoth from the back of the store to the front and into her car Silly him doesnt have a dolly so Im looking for something with wheels on it while he takes measurements I look outside and see this tiny station wagon right up front and my heart drops just a little Im worried it wont fit but he is unfazed He works with the lady to pull down seats and clear space Turns out it was going to be a tight fit but my boss was just fine with holding it for her in the store since she had paid for it for a week or two until she could get someone with a bigger car to help her with the TV He sends me out with a sticky note to get her name and number since she didnt want to come back inside  spacer  spacer  OL So now whatMe Ill just get your name and number and well put a SOLD sticker on the TV until you can come pick it upOL Okay but what about my moneyMe Huh Thinking uh ohOL Can I get my money back I dont know if Ill have someone who can take it out of my car for me when I get homeMe Well we certainly will hold the TV for you until youre ready to pick it up since youve already paid for it We wont be able to hold it for your otherwise Its worth noting here that she originally asked if she could put a deposit down to hold the TV But as it was only  and my boss had been burned by this more than once before on higher ticket items he doesnt allow deposits for items anymoreOL I know but Im worried about getting it out of my car Can I just get my money backMe Oh boy Im sorry but youll have to come back in and talk with my boss about this  spacer  spacer  The shop has a no returns policy My boss sometimes makes exceptions for some electronics when a customer worries if itll work or not but hes otherwise firm against returns This is due to the nature of the business Someone pays for a consigned item we send a sale check out to the consignor then that person decides to try to return it afterward isnt exactly good for business Either way I couldnt give it to her so she came back inside and gave him the same story He said almost the exact same things as I did but she was adamant yet still nice about it so he gave her the return for the TV and the remote She didnt ask for a return on the plaque and he later told me he wouldnt have anyway She thanks us and leaves   spacer  spacer  We were both more than slightly frustrated and irritated at the whole situation At the very least we didnt have to move the TV Its still sitting in the shop looking for a home Poor thingspacer  spacerTLDR Self conscious TV develops disorder after not fitting in an old ladys car All it plays is the Food Network nowThanks for reading,I know I spent a lot of your time but can I get a return Tales from a Consignment Shop,45,talesFromRetail,top_week

meguriau,19,14,1refgz,33,Hi TFR Todays Tales from a Hat Boutique httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailsearchqmeguriauamprestrictsronampsortnewamptall story is brought to you directly from where the magic happens I was really happy with myself but dont have any coworkers to share the moment with Here goes   BackgroundTwo years ago I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals The majority of the customers Ive had have been pleasant however there have been interesting characters and even a few nasty pieces of work discontent customers that have come by This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this timeStoryThe weather this morning had been rather unremarkable for a spring day overcast with intermittant bouts of sun or rain As a store specialising in hats this does have an detrimental impact on the frequency of local customers On quiet days like these I typically wind up gardening this term is not a euphemism for indulging in cannabinoids behind the desk but rather a routine that consists of spraying the hats with water to reshape them and trimming any stray fibres poking out of the weave It can be mindless and therapeutic at first but only at first Every time you think that hairy hat is as smooth as it will ever be flipping it over reveals another fibre reaching out like that kids in class who knows everything that everyone likes to dislike As a completionist the process invokes feelings of frustration rage and selfpity After this ordeal I often hide behind the counter to take an extended tea break This place is fantastic for a sneaky snack because it faces the entrance is quite elevated so that people cant peer over easily and I can emerge from behind as gracefully as a meerkat when the sensor goes off if need beOne bite into a delicious banana muffin baked by my mother the sensor by the door went off I forcefully swallowed the mouthful with a swig of water emerged from behind the counter to be greeted by an elderly couple poking their heads into the store from the entrance and examining our wares Lets call the man DHS for designer hat snob DHS and wife it so seemed had decided that actually entering the store was too mainstream and clearly blocking the entrance was a great option Pet peeve  Maybe a minute or two had passed when DHS had a revelation He decided to bellow from the entrance to convey his disappointmentHB EXCUSE ME YOU ONLY HAVE LADIES HATSThe brand does stock mens hats In fact there is a display window showcasing the more popular mens styles which he had clearly missed In some ways it is understandable as fedoras are worn by a lot of women lately Unfortunately this question gets asked of me a few times every shift even though there are pictures from photoshoots of manly male models wearing similar hats in the backdrop some of them topless for good measure Pet peeve M We do stock mens hats Theyre just up the back near the counter and to your rightThis appeared to pique his interest Without so much a thank you DHS and wife scuttled over to the mens section Pet peeve  I aimed a friendly smile in their direction to counter the feeling of frustration growing insideDHS rams the nearest ivorywhite  panama hat on his headDHS Its too smallM The mens panamas are sized and do also with internal adjustment so if yoDHS gruntI continued to give him the best smile I could muster Pet peeve DHS flips the swing tickets over to look at the price and flips outDHS Ridiculous This is more expensive than a Borsalino For those of you that are unaware Borsalino is a Italianmade designer hat brandHe stared at me expectantly as though the distasteful look on his face could conjure a discount To be completely honest I know nothing about Borsalino apart from a few basic shapes they carry but of course I wasnt going to let my ignorance be known Knowing I wouldnt get a sale from him anyway I decided to not dignify him with a response and froze my face in a customer service smile Without anything to argue against the pair let out indignant huffs and made their way back to the entrance I sat back down and took a huge bite out of my muffin it tasted like victory I felt like a Magicarp that had finally recognised its shortcomings and slash those that have been laughing at me in the face Later during the day I decided to google the Borsalino online boutique to look at similar hats My findings were interesting For his statement to be true there were two possiblities Yes the hat was more expensive than some similar shaped Borsalino hats However the hat he was referring to was a papier hat  or about AUD  basically a pseudo panama hat made of rice paper and not toquilla palm The panama hats Borsalino sold were in the  range AUD  Currency conversion means nothing to him and therefore   AUD Extra information for anyone interestedHandy tips for finding a suitable hat

ToniCipriani,11,7,1r6mbw,30,This isnt so much a tale as it is something Ive been curious to hear some other opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of chain vs independent I work for a small independent cornerliquor store but the owner and his brothers have a few other small grocery stores and liquor shops in the areaI have worked for retail chains too namely a major electronic retailer in the US and a major drug store chain  Some pros Ive been noticing are that working for an independent storeMuch more laid back on certain things have to look presentable but otherwise I can wear what I please Certain customers who the owner has known for awhile have tabs when they are short on moneySmaller obviously so alot less customers in the store at once which makes it alot less stressful I tend to find the atmosphere more pleasant I try my best to go above and beyond but its more of a social and friendly vibe with workers and customers Dont have to worry about things like returns etcI  get to know customers on a more personal basis since alot of the same people frequent the shop I get paid in cash weekly instead of a check every two weeksA few cons Ive picked up onThe owner is a bit cheap when it comes to certain things like a leak in the back cooler which his solution for is a bucket  which needs to be emptied every  days pretty muchNo benefits like health coverage or anythingNo holidays off only  people work in the store other than the manager and owner so the hours are pretty set in stoneRealistically speaking I probably have alot less job security  I have a  really positive relationship with both the manager and owner and feel Im well liked but I ever made a huge mistake that made them really upset or even if they decided they wanted to cut down on people working for them I very well could get let go instantly My work doesnt have things like write ups its what the owner wants at the end of the day This is hypothetical since I get along well with everyone at the shop but if I was having a problem with someone else working there especially those who have been working there longer than I have Id probably have to either ignore it or leave people close to the owner are essentially untouchable Id imagine Most retail chains if they are under good management would likely try to take some sort of action for conflict mediation I would hope ,Pros and cons for working in a small local business over a retail chain,37,talesFromRetail,top_week

ixiduffixi,4,3,1r5xvj,24,So I was reading through another users lot stories today and was reminded of one of my own In my teenage years my first job was working for the blue vest mafia My job description was something along the lines of Customer Service Specialist which amounted to cart pusher cashier stockman and basic maintenance Eventually I also took up duties as an overnight unloader This tale involves one of those nights When I worked on unloading my shift started at  pm We would unloaded trucks piece by piece and any pallets of merchandise was left on the truck to be unloaded later and moved to an attached warehouse The typical protocol was to have one unloader use a pallet lift to move the merch to the outside dock where it would be taken by the Forktruck driver and driven around the building to the warehouse There another employee would be waiting with another pallet lift to move them inside The reason for this is the warehouse entrance was also on the store entrances sidewalk This meant that during these times one or two parking spots would be blocked off using upturned shopping carts so that the forktruck could reach the warehouse door This most commonly took place during store hours Not all of them are hrs Any way on to the storyOne day I had the responsibility of moving the pallets off of the truck and on to the back dock This had been going smoothly for the better part of an hour Then the forktruck didnt return I stood waiting at the back dock for almost half an hour and eventually decided to go see if there was any help needed in the warehouse When I got around I found the forktruck parked in the middle of the lot with no driver in sight I went to the warehouse entrance and found a crushed shopping cart lying on its side in one of the unused parking spots we had marked off The warehouse was locked and no one was around so I went back inside to find where everyone had gone I found my direct manager and my coworker standing at the front desk with the store manager and a very angry customer They had apparently been talking for quite some time because by the time I got there the conversation was already ending and the manager escorted the customer to the back office When I asked what happened my coworker got very very upset To the point of cursing in the middle of the checkout area What had happened was that the customer had intentionally ran through the shopping cart blockade while my coworker was there trying to wave him down The customer had driven into the cart so hard it had actually thrown it up over the sidewalk and through the warehouse entrance Then he started claiming that it was our faults and the company was going to pay for it I found out later that they had and we had to change the unloading policies to only operate the forktruck after store hoursBONUS STORYAnother tale of the blue vest mafia One night I entered the restroom and saw a young man slowly washing his hands in the sink giggling while his friend was in the stall also giggling I took my time using the restroom waiting them out which eventually worked While I waited I heard packages being ripped open and plastic being shoved into something After they left I entered the stall and found open packages for cold remedies sinus medication and dvds I called the store manager and he looked on the security cameras The kids took off in a dead sprint as soon as they left the bathroom and didnt stop until they were well outside We called the police and the officer stated that he actually knew one of the kids ,A Lot Of Stories Today,27,talesFromRetail,top_week

Greenwallets,10,6,1r52ex,15,Hey guys So I left my big box retailer and jumped ship to a really optimistic retail marketing company Said marketing company operates a department on behalf of my previous retailer which means both companies are working along side each other in a VERY small space The issues were experiencing largely stem from employees at the store being incredibly hostile towards my new employer being there Theyre most upset by me leaving my part time job at the store to work full time benefits base pay  commission as the assistant manager for this new employer  This went through the store like wildfire the past two weeks and Ive had associatesmanagers come up to me asking me why I chose to leave the retailer In a tone that makes it feel as though I have betrayed them in some way I know its jealousy from the associates but its affecting our relationship with the retailer Theres a very distinct Us vs Them mentality that has sprung up amongst the associates which likely stems for the limitations that the retailer has placed on us We are unable to unlock electronic display cases or cash anyone out who isnt buying a cellular device or related accessory Specifically there is one associate who has made rude comments about my managers and I in our vicinity in addition to physically trying to walk through me I should mention she did this when I worked there as well she hates everyone and gets a away with a lot because her entire family works there Did I mention shes Im wondering if anyone has dealt with a toxic work environment and how you went about rectifying the situation I should say that my manager isnt likely to do anything because she lacks the confidence in this type of leadership role Shes also struggling to maintain the peace between our company and the retailer Shes too much of a sweetheart Im a cynical realist when it comes to this store,Meta how do you deal with a toxic work environment,21,talesFromRetail,top_week

BreakfastWithReddit,13,18,1rcwf1,12,This is my first post here and as you can read my flair I work fast food parttime and Ive been working here for the past  months While this story may not be about my boss or any customers I just want to share with you how my coworker well call here Sarah to protect her identity has irritated me so much since I started working hereSo here I am an  yearold male working at a restaurant tonight and for this month I have to work the drivethru by using the headset to take orders making drinks and making desserts sometimes all at the same time My hands can get pretty tied up easily once there is a reasonable line of cars lined up Sometimes my manager swings by to help make desserts when he sees that I am making drinks and taking orders at the same timeMeanwhile Sarah is working the window only transacting the money credit cards etc and handing our customers their food Quite obviously I have a bigger job than her and as a human I can make mistakes or be slow at times but its only to provide the same excellent service to each customer I talk to on the headset For example I might miss the chance to make the earlier customers drinks while I am taking the previous customers order For a few seconds of making the drinks delivering them and apologizing for the wait customers are usually very understanding since I expressed excellent customer service when I talked to them via headset they sometimes compliment me on my customer service and I am very grateful that they compliment me and understand when they see I am busy with another customer on the headsetNow insert Sarah into the equation and she stresses me out when I try to do my job If the food was already delivered to the customer at the window and theyre waiting on me to make their drinks I would most likely have another customer giving their order to me on the headset While I am talking to the customer on the headset and I am trying to switch glances from the drink that could overflow and back at the POS where I record the customers order It can be hard at times for me because I really dont want to screw up the drink by letting the soda tea or lemonade overflow or make the liquid too high and when I would punch in the buttons the liquid would spill out of the top This kind of stuff happens frequently and apparently Sarah hates when I make mistakes like thisShe will tell me through a strained voice that I needed to make the drinks much faster and she has been doing this to me all the time but I really want to tell her that maybe I dont want the drink to overflow or maybe that I dont want to make the wrong drink and waste the cup or maybe that I dont want to keep asking the customer what they last said because I couldnt hear what they said when she pretty much shouts at me It makes the customer and I irritated when I have to ask himher again what they recently ordered and I really had enough of her annoyed toneThere were times when I would be taking an order and she would stress on me and I would make a mistake on the customer Im taking an order from When this happens the customers would complain that their order is wrong when it was read back to them for confirmation Sarah would have to ask for a managers card to change the order at the window and then she would deathstare me as if I stepped on her iPhone I really cant say what I feel against her because Im working on the headset which is on  of the time and the customers at the window can hear everything I say and I really wouldnt want to say anything I could regret It just makes me mad because Im doing all of these jobs where one mistake can happen here and there while she only stands there doing her window job and yelling at me when I cant finish a drink for a few seconds She doesnt even help me finish my drinks which would be nice but she only stands there with her claw of a right hand waiting for a cup to snatch She always takes the cup right out of my hand even when its not done so fast that it seems she is more pissed than I am at her It makes me so mad that she doesnt even lend a hand and she just stands there being so ignorant of me while I work  jobs and her job only takes  secondsIm really trying to do my job here and I really try to do everything I can to treat all of our customers with the same quality respect everyone else deserves Before she started bitching at me I tried to interact with her while were on breaks but she mindlessly stares at her phone while wolfing down a chicken sandwich while I try to talk to her She only gave a few quick and blunt words to me and she was obviously disinterested in the interactions so I stopped seeing that I cant break the wall that is her selfishnessThis post is probably very long for you guys and this is more of a rant about Sarah but here is the part that youve probably been waiting for I just wanted to give more background information and context to my situationIt was  pm tonight and my shift was going to end at  pm and there were quite a few customers waiting in line to have their orders taken I had to make a quick largesize Diet Dr Pepper for a customer waiting at the window and one person was telling me to put American cheese bacon lettuce tomato wheat bun and extra pickles on a regular chicken sandwich which had me pressing a lot of buttons At this point it seemed that Sarah had enough of my dawdling and she finally decided to help me finish the drink which was still fizzing at the top I wanted to make sure the customer didnt get cheated for an underfilled large drink and I didnt want it to spill at the same time but after she took my hand to hold it under the Diet Dr Pepper nozzle and tried to shove a lid on the sucker she pulled her hand back too fast and the soda spilled all over my uniform She quickly looked away and went back to her post acting as if it never happened and she left my sticky self in a state of complete rage I wanted to shout profanities kick and scream at her but I quickly suppressed my extreme anger because the customer was still sitting in her car in complete shock of what happened My manager quickly came over and he immediately assumed it was my accident and he told me to clean up in the restroom I was shaking in rage and the cold wet feeling of soda when I cleaned myself up My shift ended when I exited the restroom I immediately clocked out in anger and embarrassment and drove home still smelling of Dr Pepper and my hands stuck to my wheelTLDR Sarah my coworker has some kind of a bad grudge against me

Endrealis,3,4,1rged9,13,I think its okay to post here I work at a recycling center which is a bit different than retail but I deal with the same stuff A little back story I actually PAY customers for metal We are private and can choose what prices we pay for what material etc We do not have any pricing criteria The only thing we have to deal with really is the law which is one of the more annoying things People who steal metal makes it tough for the honest guys who recycleI get several customers who come in every day or several times a week were open  days a week  to   of these customers are never ready We require valid ID for every transaction and though I remember a good amount of peoples names some I dont Those that know I ask for ID every time never had it ready While theyre standing in line why wouldnt they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line Or sign the receipt which is also required by law I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME Its very frustrating I go through the same thing every day and they never learn I also get several customers who dont even speak English which is also frustrating How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you dont speak my language Most of them when I ask for ID just nod their heads What are you nodding too I asked for something I didnt ask you to agree with meSorry for the rant,Annoying everyday customers,17,talesFromRetail,top_week

adelajoy,0,1,1ri8kg,22,I spent two years working at a big warehousestyle grocery store I worked mostly as a cashier but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a weekMost of the crappy moments have all blurred together but there are a few particular moments that stick outI realize this isnt the craziest story on here but I will probably never forget this lady Backstory Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag the customer would get it for free up to  The mistake happened because the price tag didnt get changed or was misplaced If they spotted a problem we would go look If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price we gave it to them and changed the tag If the tag was for a different item they didnt get anything I was working the customer service desk and a lady stormed up I had several customers on the go at the moment but it was pretty clear she needed help right away As soon as I could I asked what I could help her with She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner her receipt and a price tag Lets call her Crazy Customer CC for shortCC I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner but it was the wrong price You guys are trying to charge me too muchMe Okay can I see your receiptCC Hands me the receipt I tried to tell the cashier but she didnt believe meMe I checked who her cashier was and it was one of our longtime girls She knew the policy There was no way she didnt believe the customer Okay so the price came up  Ill just send a pricechecker out to see what the tag saidCC Oh I grabbed the price tag already She hands me the price tag This lady is pretty worked up  Im not sure if she just wants to get out of the store or if shes trying to pull one on meA policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf If a customer brings it to you whos to say they didnt take it off the shelf last week and save it They also could have found it in the wrong place somewhere that the stock employees wouldnt have checked to fix the tag As with most stores Ive been to store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies and then see if you can help them anyways No matter the problemIt study the tag and inform her of the policy that the tag would have to be on the shelf I start to let her know I can contact a manager but she snatches the tag back and interrupts meCC Well if thats your policy Ill just put it back on the shelf I was trying to save you some goddamn work but I guess if you guys want to work extra Ill just go put it backShe took off before I could say anything I was just standing at the desk aghast I didnt even know what to say The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind You know the kind that isnt afraid to yell a little handles the worst customers and isnt phased when people call her names Lets call her Jane When the woman was gone I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story She said Okay When she comes back let me know who she is Ill handle herAs soon as I saw the customer coming back I hissed Jane Jane Jane White hat Thats her I then ducked behind the display at customer service and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone I could hear her yelling at Jane I dont know what the verdict was Any other manager and the customer would have gotten the item for free but its hard to say with JaneI remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name I hushed them and told them I was hiding I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those Her Thats the one I was talking to She told me this And drag me back into itIve never hid from a customer before or since Oh Fun fact The price tag she was holding said  a  difference from what she paid and the tag was dated for the week before which means it wasnt the current price Not to say it wasnt still on the shelf but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in especially with how worked up she wasThank goodness for thickskinned supervisors who can handle being yelled at,I guess if you guys want to work extra Ill just go put it back,23,talesFromRetail,top_week

GlowingBall,2,2,1rioer,16,These are my Tales of Retail Loss PreventionPart Three  Citizen Snips Aka  The Pants AquaticAs a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before  I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer one of the Big   I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV closed circuit television or security cameras  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly WTF that I have to share  This story opens up with me doing just as I said above  watching people on CCTV  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets are few and far between  I as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring  the phone is going off  Now the phone going off is common place  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off we knowit goes off for us as well to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm we also knowwe see you standing at the door  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesnt call us often  the meat department  The guy on the other end a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is just browsing for over ten minutes  This strikes me as rather odd  Who just hangs out around the meat department  I quickly devise a plan for the situation  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do  The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition  he was going to steal  Oh shit here we go  I declared only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank  Now if you arent familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies  a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another  Kids love to sit there and watch themNo wayis he really going to I whispered as I watched on in awe  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have  After a moment of fishing around he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants  The guy whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidbergs shuffle  All he was missing was yelping out Woop woop woop woop loudly as he went  Needless to say he wasnt too hard to stop  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants  He didnt fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing  After all it is kind of hard to argue that you arent stealing when you have a large lobster shaped bulge in your pantsBonus icing on top of the cake I usually ask the person why they are stealing  It usually wont change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kidsHis kids have some expensive tastes,Loss Prevention Tales Pt   Citizen Snips,18,talesFromRetail,top_week

metamaxwell,386,383,1r14xk,1115,So I may cry I was  minutes into typing this post up when a power surge hit and every thing at work went down including the computer and now I have to type this again That in itself may become another postDisclaimer Standard stuff First time post Massive wall of text etcBackground I work at a small privately owned retro game store You name it I have something for itNow this tale takes place a few days after GTA  came out You see on this slow day at work I was killing time doing what I usually do playing SNES games on one of our displays On the rare occasion when a customer would come in Id pause my game greet them and offer whatever help I could provide then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store Now it had been an hour or so since I had last had anyone in the store so I was itching to sell something when Mom and Kid came in I jumped up and gave them my spiel and they assured me they were fine and were just looking Well a few minutes go by when Kid and Mom come up to me with you guessed it GTA  in hand Kid has that look of pure bliss on his face The one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his  and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun Except there is one thing between him and that future A fell and powerful guardian That would be meI should take this time to mention that for the most part I dont like telling people they cant buy something It is sad not only because Im missing out on a sale but Im also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you Your card was declined You have to be  or older to buy this etc are phrases I dislike Except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world For you the entitled the bratty the liars the assholes the pricks the scammers the schemers etc To you I find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fatteningBack to the story So whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a M rated game I am required by law to ask for an ID or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen Now most parents fall into one of two general categories The I dont care I just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money type and the Im actually have an idea about what is going on here and Im totally cool with it now take my money type Those are the ones that just say yes and having done my duty and covering my ass legally I move on and make the sale Not Mom No when I tell her about the M rating she actually stops and ASKS ME WHY ITS M RATED My heart stopped I heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when Mario picks up a coin This honestly never happens Ive worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed Kids heart drops at this But you can still see hope in his eyes hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming Dudebe cool NOPEI like my job and I like to think I do it well Im paid to play and talk about games from the Atari on up to the PS and Xbox One afterall So when someone asks me about a game Im going to tell you EVERY THING about it And thats just what Mom gets First blow Language Moms approval doesnt take any visible damage Kid is optimisitc and reassures Mom he is mature enough to handle itQuick second punch Drugs and alcohol I think I saw a grimacebut Mom recovers quickly Kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like Wormtongue in LoTRIm getting serious now Violence Finally a crack in the armor Mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure Kid REALLLY wants this game and can handle it Kid puts on his most mature look I swear if he had a tux monocle and top hat he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion He does he can he could pay the damn mortgage right now hes that matureYoure doing well in keeping the situation favorable Kid but I have a secret weapon Nudity Yep as some of you know GTA  didnt get the partial nudity rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob Nope Now this is what Kid feared was coming and hoped I either didnt know or wasnt going to share it but I did Critical hit TKO Mom was out She refused to get it and told Kid he wasnt going anywhere near that game until he was old enough I thought that was the end of it but damn Kid was quick on his feet He played the Friends already have it card followed quickly by dad will be okay with it call himSo she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him meanwhile Im left in the store getting the most venomhatespiterage filled look Ive seen Seriously I think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me Not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff Oh no I mean slow and painful years of torture kind Well Mom comes back in and is on the fence again Apparently Dad wasnt against it but she still was Im given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what I told her and I do and Mom gets the phone back This time she stays in the store and I must have convinced Dad because this time she hangs up and tells Kid he is not getting the game Reddit let me tell you I have seen some tantrums explosions complete personality turn arounds etc in my time but DAMN Kid takes the cake All illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book He screams he threatens he cries he begs every thing I would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly  minutes so Ill just give you my three favorite parts because I can remember those nearly verbatim Favorite  Kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage Why is this hilarious Because while doing all this he is telling Mom that he is mature enough to handle the game and that the nudity isnt even a main part of it and he wont look at it and he doesnt have to do it etc Except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission So yeah Also the tantrum technique Not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for somethingFavorite  The xxx has it so screw you Ill just play it there Now kudos to Mom she handled this like a pro Her response You wont when I call every one of your friends parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game Im also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playingFavorite  This one was just stupid which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious Kid yells at Mom telling her he doesnt need her and hell just come back and buy the game in a few days himself Mom not fazed or even looking at me asks me if he could buy it without her To help her get her point across I ask if he is  she assures me he isnt and I tell them that without an ID proving he is  or older no one can legally sell him that gameThe night ends with her dragging his bawling snot dripping raging ass out of my store apologizing profusely for his antics and before they get out of earshot I can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments hes going to recieve after his behavior Reddit I love moments like that It had it all Drama laughter lies betrayal threats crying bargaining and a parent actually acting like a parent Oh and Kid was about  by the way Be honest you all thought he was  didnt you Ive got  years of tales piled up if you want moreTldr You guys are cheatingfine Kid pitches Mom refuses to catch,How I made a Kid cry or Tales from a

across the street Now a quick inside to give you an idea of our store layout Im on my phone but will make a crappy picture in paint later and post it in an edit The cashier area is right smack in the middle of the store When you walk in theres the newspaper stand and the back counter area to your right coffee to your left and if you go waaaay left our bathrooms are down a little hall You have to walk around to your right following the counters to leave through the exit door This is so you cant sneak out behind us and steal something Queue am I have a college guy vomiting in the bathroom and a super nice guy whos browsing our snack food quietly In comes this super drunk middle aged black male He starts hanging on the newspaper stand and trying to climb over the back counter wall its about  feet high He will be Drunk Guy DG DG Hey How much for a cab to Menomininity I assumed menominee which is a city maybe twenty minutes from us Me Im not sure We can call a cab and ask Do you have a certain cab company you like to use DG just look some numbers up for me on the Internet Me I dont have the Internet here I have a phone book though you can borrow Please note this was NOT the answer he was looking for DG NIGGA FUCK YOUR PHONE BOOK Yeah Okay He proceeded to grab my newspaper stand and throw it behind him into the coffee counter and started storming off towards the bathrooms On his way he took out the fruit stand the magazine rack and the little employee break table in the hallway Drunk college kid comes tearing out of the bathroom That black guy grabbed me by the jacket pulled me out of the stall then ripped your toilet paper dispenser off the wall and threw it at me Uhh What The nice guy has been quietly picking up all the scattered fruit despite me telling him he didnt have to because I have to throw it all away anyway insists hell stay until this guy leaves Me Yeah I dont have the time for this Im just calling the police I get on the phone with none emergency explain my situation and ask if officer X can send his ride along over just to help keep this guy in control until another officer can come in Not even a minute later RideAlong is jogging across the street as officer X is piling the drunk driver in his back seat and I guess radioing the location for another officer DG comes out of the bathroom all sheepish and apologetic And then he sees the officer DG AW THE FUCK YOU YOU DIRTY ASS SKANK WHORE BITCHthe officer calmly cuffs DG who surprisingly didnt fight I sell nice guy some candy and put his coffee on my nightly expense College kid dipped out at some point I think he was underaged A second officer shows up and runs the drunk guys info as Im talking to RideAlong for my statement Turns out DG has a warrant out on him in North Carolina for skipping out on parole His friends apparently got tired of his drunk ass and left him at the bar Apparently Shotz has been doing last call at  like normal but then locking their restrooms so drunks cant hang out in there and they can clean them and leave faster They also havent been letting the drunk patrons use their phone For both things they explain that there is a gas station open about a block away with bathrooms and a phone Yeah Screw them DG got hauled off I burned a copy of the security footage for the officer and clean everything up The DM lives down the road so he stopped in for his deer hunting coffee and snacks and was pretty livid when I explained the situation I guess he knows the owner of the bar and gave him a call about his bartenders I thankfully had last night and tonight off so Ill see next weekend if our drunk flow is any better Well its bed time Sorry for the sleepy rambling Good night TFREDIT Heres that layout I promised look at my awesome gas

Tufty,32,59,1rdse5,289,This is a story from long long ago that I am copying from another website that I posted it to before discovering Reddit I thought you all might enjoy itThis happened a while ago but it just popped into my head so Im gonna do my best to remember itI used to work nights on the checkout of a  hour supermarket Now in this particular store there were certain things that you couldnt do on the checkout without a managers key and a code generally anything that would change the total by more than  including voiding items would require you to call a managerSince we worked nights they gave the key and the code to  women who worked on the cigarette kiosk because they had worked there for a long time there was always at least one of them working and they didnt want us bothering the on duty night manager every time there was any mistake All worked fine normallyUntil the day that neither of these women were in Did the management organise anyone else who had a code to be in the area Did they buggeryThere were  of us working that night and the other  were quite new on the department We did our best but I was the first to go down A customer had read the price on a baby stroller wrong and wanted it voided I put a call out for the on duty manager then apologised to the people in my line and explained that it might take a couple of minutes The line wasnt very long because it was getting quite late There was a little grumbling but everyone seemed fairly understanding minutes pass I put out another call for the manager to come down URGENTLY I advise everyone to start going through the other  tills I am starting to get worried but we still have  tills running so its not the end of the world The lines get longerThen one of the other girls accidentally scans something through twice It happens the scanners sometimes just glitch The item cost more than  and bam  checkouts are locked down I direct people through the lone surviving till The poor girl on there was clearly struggling but there was nothing else to be done I get hold of a store phone and call the manager directly No answer I call again Nothing I put another call out over the speakers Apologise to all customersThen it happens The last till goes down Another double scan The line is  people deep And this is at midnight when its odd to have more than  customer at a time I try to call the manager again Nada I call a team leader explain the problem and beg him to find me a manager any manager I turn to the ever increasing group of customers and do my best to explain whats going on I am practically on my knees begging them for forgiveness Some fo them have been waiting for  minutes I break from the script and try to explain as a human being that there isnt anything I could do I wish there was something anything I could do We cant open any other tills They are all shut down and even if I had the key to turn them on all of our log ins are locked into these tillsFinally someone saunters to the tills They arent a manager They had been sent down by the on duty manager because he had heard that we had too many customers and needed another checkout operator Im getting frantic I send her back to find the managerTime passes People have been waiting for over half an hour now and you can imagine what that looks like Thankfully none of the customers are directing their anger at us but they are all very very angryEventually the manager turns up All good right NopeHe takes one look at the scene And walks away The customers see my face Now they know what the manager looks likeThere is more of the same Frantic phone calls announcements over the speakers Ten minutes that feel like an eternity later the manager calmy walks back into sight and immediately gets collared by the crowd The only good thing that came out of this moment was when several customers took time out of their ranting to defend me it seems my pleas for forgiveness workedThe manager is barely listening to the poor people He keeps interrupting them trying to push blame off of himself This was the first he had heard of the situation Luckily all of the customers had seen me doing everything possible to get hold of him The manager eventually rolls his eyes and wanders off to the office to pick up the keysA full  minutes after the last till went down we finally got the code and unlocked the tills Did the manager apologise to the customers Nope Did he offer them anything to make up for the wait Nope Did he apologise to us working on the checkouts for putting us through all that Take a guessAs I rang through the customers I did everything in my meager power to make it up to them It wasnt much but I would accept any coupon they had even if they werent for our store I would accidentally mistype the reduction codes to give them more money off If something wouldnt scan Id just pretend I hadnt noticed and give it to them I knew it would mess up the inventory and probably get me in trouble but I just didnt care at this point When we cleared the line I sent the other  girls off for a break and told them to take an extra few minutes while they were at it When they were gone and I was sure I was alone I spent a minute or two hiding under the till whimpering ,Cashiers Nightmare,348,talesFromRetail,top_week

cart duty I enjoyed it Id much rather be outside and moving around than inside and lashed to a checkstandBut the parking lot is perilous I learned this from three different perspectives As a bag boy I could clearly see the damage caused by errant carts Later in life at the financial company I would hear clients tell stories of epic accidents in lots and see the resulting figures for the damage average damage in the lot used to be  with the most frequent cause being backing Lastly as a driver my first accident happened when a driver backed right into my car as I was driving along minding my own business But it happens Thats why we have insuranceHere are a few stories from the lotHIT AND RUN Nice warm San Diego night A smattering of carts on the lot Not many customers insideEnter a large Cadillac its a land yacht Its being driven by a senior citizen and she falls squarely into the QTip category Small white and sporting a moderate seniorfrizz of puffy white hairShe should not be driving anything The Caddy might protect her but its a lethal weapon to anyone elseThe driver rolls past me and anglesin to a good spot near the entrance to the store But she fails to hit the breaks and manages to smash into another car She backsup slightly and rips the number off of a relatively new HondaShe pauses looks around and stars backing again Damn shes going to run I have noting to write with so I try and memorize the plate Sadly I dont get a very good look She bolts out of the lot and disappears forever It was not captured by the security cameras And I never see her or the Caddy again BummerTELEPATHIC CART DESTRUCTIONA universal truth to retail is that the less you are paid the more likely it is that you will be blamed for things that had absolutely nothing to do with youIn this case I was in the back of the lot gathering carts Unseen to me a customer leaves a cart between spaces and nowhere near a corral A few minutes later this cart succumbs to gravity and starts rollingIt rolls right into the door of a customer who just happened to arrive at her car at that specific moment A nice dent is delivered and a couple scratches tops it off FantasticHey you She yells I had not seen the accident and was nowhere near her So I dont register that shes talking to meHey cart guy She yells This time I see her So I walk over to her carDo you ned help unloading I askNo I want to know why you dented my carIm sorryYou dented my car You left a cart out and it hit my car What are you going to do about itI was working on the other side of the lot I havent been in this area for a whileShe grabs the cart and pushes it toward me You left this out and it rolled into my car Who is going to pay for the damageUgh Ill take you to our manager He can probably help you outI escort the injured part into the store and introduce her to the manager Then I go back out and finish the job The woman emerged after a while and drove offBack inside the store I get called to the officeYou have to be more careful when doing carts You just cost the store moneyI wasnt anywhere near the car and I was not the person who left the cart thereShe says you didHow Im not telepathic I could not have caused the damage and I could not have prevented it The only thing I did wrong was doing my job I happened to be out there but It was not meLook Be careful I dont want this happening againI left without saying anything else I was both angry and a bit sad Angry at the false accusation and fallout and sad that people behave like this and it could affect my livelihoodYUPPIE PORSCHE COUPLE AND

themonkeyone,39,52,1r7frc,260,So I am not sure if this belong is this sub or not but I feel the need to include it  This incident recalls the moment I finally decided to quit my old job and find a new oneSo here is the set up  I have worked as a maintenance associate which is just a fancy word for janitor  for this large retail store for  years now  I completely hate my job it makes me miserable the people I work with annoy me the managers dont care about me as an employee and the customers hate me since I am keeping them from using the bathroom while I try to clean them twice during my shift  Now most people just ignore my sign telling them to not use the restroom while it is being cleaned and there is a second restroom in the back  It is annoying but oh well  However on this day it was a much different type of customerThis happened on a Tuesday  I remember this because Tuesdays that quarter were when I had to go straight from my college classes to work  School that day had already annoyed me and left me in a bad mood and work was not helping  I start my day with the usual routine cleaning the restrooms  Now this day like most others someone decides to ignore my signs and come in anyways  However this guy is different then most guys as the entire time he is ranting about how unfair it is that I am trying to keep him from using the bathroom how much I suck how stupid I am ect ect all while he is using the toilet  I try to ignore it it comes with the job after all  He finally finishes and I go to clean the stall he was using only to hear him remark now you have a real mess to clean up  I llok into the stall to see that this guy has wiped his feces all over the toilet seat  he continues to mock me about it while he washes his hands and I just stand there in disbelief which start turning into rage  Like the title says  I was very sorely tempted to beat this guy over the head with my mop handle  It passed quickly however I just stood in the bathroom for a good  minutes trying to figure out why I just did not walk out at that very moment  After that day I started looking for a new job  Which I found and am much happier at for the most part  Sure I still have stupid customers and stupid coworkers but I am doing something I love so it is worth it,The one time I almost assaulted a customer,312,talesFromRetail,top_week
Legionofclowns,54,69,1rcc3t,255,First time posting on TFR but I felt like my story needed to join all the great ones Ive been reading on here Its long so be forewarned So its  and I am working at an electronics store with my pretty blue shirt and khakis I started here right before holiday season and had a couple months under my belt working in the DVDCDVideo Games area and had become one of the goto guys The manager and I had a game plan for black Friday we had a map drawn with how we were gonna move customers through the store and everythinghopefully The only hitch in this plan came from Nintendo for this was the year of the Wii Now before this i had worked with the public Had worked at the movie theater fast food etc but this was my first real retail job I had almost no experience with Black Friday and had only heard stories from friends and things I had watched on the newsDay comes and of course Im there at open I pull into the neighboring parking lot where we had to park on this day and what do I see A line that stretches from the door goes around the store comes back to the front doors and proceeds to stretch across the parking lot to the local office supply store I think no big deal we got this We start handing out the tickets before opening for the big items like cheap TVs and of course the  Wiis we managed to have And within  minutes everything is handed out and of course there is some yelling about who didnt get what and the standard bickering Not worried we have a cop outside keeping order So doors open and everybody comes in orderly but hurriedly and our plan is actually working customers are actually moving the way we want so I start to think maybe this whole black Friday thing is overblown NOPE Towards our car install bay where we had put the ticketed items I hear shouts of THEY HAVE EM and I HAD IT FIRST BITCH  Going into oh shit mode I briskly jog flat out run to the bay and witness about  soccer moms in track suits and jackets piling through the doorway pushing the LP guarding the stash out of the way and snatching Wiis like they were made of gold and endangered diamond kittens while throwing haymakers at anything else that was in the way I mean seriously how many times do you get to see a middleclass housewife uppercut another like something from Street Fighter  Apparently one of them had see the Wiis through the window and started informing others that we had Wiis but we were hoarding them for employees At this point I have to make a decisiondo I A Stand back and watch and possibly take photos or B  Stop a possible murder I go with B and start using my outside voice and arms to try and break up the mob and get the door closed behind them with the help of my helpless LP I get into the bay and WHOOMP Im out Dont remember anything about what happened but after viewing the tape and listening to the LP I apparently was knocked on the head with a Wii by a Martha Stewart looking woman who proceeded to dissappear behind the others and back out to the floor Yep I was knocked out by a mediocre gaming system At this point in the tape you start seeing people dropping and crying When I first saw it I thought they were all upset at what had happened to me but then you see the police officer break through the lines spraying his OC at anything not wearing a uniform The LP and him managed to clear the bay and pull the door closed and locked and then check to make sure Im alright SPOILER I didnt die More cops show up and procede to lock down the store as the LP and first officer manage to get me awake and up and walk me to the break room and give me some water and make sure I know what day it was and if I knew my name Im humorous most of the time so I said Garfield thats how they knew I was ok I end up going to the hospital in the police car to get checked out and other than a nasty gash still have the scar Im good in fact Im ready to go back to work Turns out my manager felt really really bad about what had happened and so he gave me the rest of the day off with sick leave and even came by my houseguest afterwards to check on me and show me the tape from the cameras  The only thing that chaps my ass about the whole thing was that the woman who decided I needed to die so her kids could fake bowl got away Ive never had another Black Friday like this and this upcoming one will be my th although Im with a different company now since the electronics retailer decided that Amazoncom wasnt a competitor damn restructuringtldr A housewife knocks me out with a future doorstop and I hallucinate that Im Edward James Olmos on a jetski Edit just wanted to add that this was the only year things got bad Every other time has been a cake walk a huge cakewalk with too many people ,The Tale Of The Housewife Beatdown Brawl,324,talesFromRetail,top_week

LIVESINCANADA,108,72,1rbn62,243,So I used to work for a large department store in the frontend cash and customer service mainly At our location we had  cash registers  of which were express  items or less and the other  were regular belts We also had  selfcheckout machines that were watched over by  cashier at a time This particular day I was the one who got to watch over them Now I dont remember what time of year it was or even what time of day it was but I do remember that it was very busy We had every single register open and we still had lines of  people at each register When Im watching the selfcheckouts Im watching a screen that shows me what each customer has entered in order to make sure that the pack of toilet paper they placed under their cart actually gets scanned I also have to help people out when they have coupons as  of the time the machine doesnt recognize them as well as any and all questions about their purchasespricespayment methods So basically Im busy running around the whole timeSo this day while Im watching the selfcheckouts two women who were next in the seemingly neverending line come to one of the machines nearest to me One of the women is pregnant and the other looks like an older women I found out it was the pregnant womens mother Nothing note worthy happens with them until theyre at their last item It was a heavier item at the bottom of their cart The older women waves at me and asks if I could lift the heavy item for them as the daughter is pregnant and she has some illness I think she said cancer Now they choose to come to a selfcheckout machine A machine where you are supposed to check yourself out They didnt think to wait in one of the  other lines where youd have a dedicated cashier whod be happy to lift and scan all your large and heavy items for you No they decided to come to the self checkouts and get the cashier who had to watchhelp  customers simultaneously to lift and scan their items So all that went through my head but what came out of my mouth was Sure no problem and I started walking towards them they were  feet away from me I take not more than  steps before the daughter says Oh its alright mom Ive got this and then she bends down and picks up the heavy item herself The mom notices that I didnt match Usain Bolts world record speeds while walking towards them and says to me What awful service you have forcing a pregnant woman to lift ltitem namegt by herselfI just shrug it off and inform them that in the future if theyd like more hands on service that going to one of the nonselfcheckout registers would probably be better The two women finish paying and as they walk by me on their way out the mom drops this doozy on meI guess some peoples mothers just didnt raise them rightWhat I dont know what she expected me to do maybe scream at her daughter and push her out of the way as she attempted to lift the large item I knew with that statement she was just trying to provoke me so I ignored her Its been years since thats occurred and its still the experience from retail that I remember best,Self checkouts are more trouble than theyre worth,315,talesFromRetail,top_week

arsci,56,35,1ren2b,217,All of the talk of black Friday brought up some good memories one of which involves two kids and a rather large gun safe Its kind of a long one but hopefully you all enjoy itA little background I work for a large national farm and ranch supply chain that sells a large variety of items including gun safes This particular story takes place the day after black friday of last year We have several models of these gun safes on the sales floor for customers to see with the largest at the time being an Canon Armory gun safe This thing was MASSIVE compared to the rest of our stock Our store only ever had  of them they never had an official SKUwe had to ring them under the generic merchandise SKU we had them for over a year and after we sold out we never saw them again Now all the safes are electronic keypad and locked by default from the manufacturer but they all ship with the same combination  Most people know this from either asking us to see inside the safes or by just guessing It was no secret and we encourage people to take a good lookIt was the evening and we were working on getting the store cleaned up after a very hectic day Not very many customers were left in the store and things were winding down I was working on restocking the feed when I saw the assistant manager walk by and he looked PISSED And not just end of black friday pissed but someone done fucked up pissed so I went to casually investigate only to find him talking to this giant safe Literally ear to the door asking if it was doing alright Maybe not to the safe but to the person stuck INSIDE the safe Uh Oh Things start running through my headwhy didnt he just unlock it HOW did a person get locked in it Then he pulls me asideAssistant Manager We have a situationMe A situationAM Yes a kid just locked his brother in the gunMe Soo why dont we unlock itAM It wont unlock I think the battery died but I replaced it and its still not workingMe How did he end up locked in itAM His brother apparently Hes over hiding in the feed racks last I saw Not sure where the parents are they havent made an appearance yetI went over and tried it myself and sure as crapits locked And this kid is FREAKING out for obvious reasons We tried a couple other batteries with no luck and even tried swapping the keypad out with the one from the other gun with no luck The parents FINALLY realized their kids were MIA and started asking around and very quickly we determined the kid in the safe was theirs We had taken out the power access port from the pack and passed the kid a flashlight so he could calm down a little and after swapping the keypads out and a fourth set of batteries we called in for backup Assistant Manager called the police while another employee called the safe company to see if there was another way into the safeAfter about half an hour had gone by and the fire department was about ready to cut the back off of it to get the kid out we find out from the safe manufacturer that there is a  minute lockout on the keypadif the battery dies or is removed you cant touch it for  minutes after putting the battery back in So after  long agonizing minutes of listening to this hag of a woman yell at us for not taking enough precautions the safe OPENED And this  year old kid I repeat FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID comes bolting out of this safe straight into his mothers arms and both of them are sitting of the floor breaking down in tears The police and fire department left pretty quick after that but after the woman and her kid calmed down she UNLOADED on us Complaining about precautions safety how we need to be more responsible and how corporate needs to handle things differently Eventually we stopped herAM Maam your kid walked up to the safe entered in the combination himself that he got FROM YOU and opened the safe Your other child WILLINGLY stepped into the safe and at the exact moment he did the battery died At this point the brother closed and locked the door And its our fault for not taking enough precautionsEventually the woman and her kids left No policies changed except when we give out the combination we use her children as an example of what not to do Gives us all a good chuckle Every couple months she calls and identifies her self as the person whose kid got locked in the safe Usually shes prying to know if weve changed our policies we havent then asks for a discount on whatever she seems to be in need of which she doesnt get Oddly enough its been another year and weve had no incidents of kids locking their siblings in safes Heres to surviving another Black Friday,Two kids and the gun safe,252,talesFromRetail,top_week

TennisAndBeer,4,37,1r63y6,168,So I work at a grocery store that everyone from the customers to the managers hate yet everyone goes to because the food is so much cheaper than other stores As a result the store parking lot and even surrounding roads are always filled and busyAt this store I do everything from cashiering to maintenance to retrieving carts A few years ago one kid got hit by a car and broke a few bones so now everyone has to wear orange visibility vestscoats when they go outside which I thought was stupid when I started It didnt take me long to learn and Ive been nearly hit pretty much every time I go outside mostly by suburban soccer moms in minivans and SUVs simultaneously backing out of their space talking on their phone and drinking coffee I swear theyre aiming for me However the closest Ive come to getting hit was by a woman who was a manager of a different department She left work jumped in her car and backed up quickly almost running me a customer walking out of the store and the customers son who couldnt have been more than  The customer keeps walking but I recognized the woman I stood in front of her car and proceeded to give her a lecture about how she should know better she works at the store full time and knows how busy the lot is I wasnt exactly polite but I wasnt unnecessarily rude I stuck to the related issues When I saw her the next day at work I was a bit nervous technically shes in another department but shes been there like  years so Im sure she could have me fired However she was actually very mature about the whole thing She apologized again and thanked me for the warning saying she had gotten too comfortable with the lot and hadnt realized it ,Lectured a manager almost ran a small child and me over and got thanked for it,205,talesFromRetail,top_week
meguriau,19,26,1r5sy8,170,Hi TFR Im back My thesis has been officially submitted defended had an existential crisis and have recovered from all the irregulat sleeping patterns and physiological symptoms associated with caffeine excess Its been a long time but here is another instalment of Tales from a Hat Boutique httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailsearchqmeguriauamprestrictsronampsortnewamptall This one has been in the works for a little while for a number of reasons  Im afraid of long walls of text and procrastinate and  I wasnt sure if it was clear enough  I should probably mention that I simplified the title of this series for simplicity but the brand also releases a line of bags for its springsummer SS and autumnwinter AW collections As such I will refer to the store as HB for hat and bag storeBackgroundTwo years ago I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals The majority of the customers Ive had have been pleasant however there have been interesting characters and even a few nasty pieces of work discontent customers that have come by This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this timeStoryTodays story describes the customer who left her mark on our generous reservation guideline and jaded my view of customers in retail Most large designer stores have a limit to the number of days you can keep an item on hold As a small store catering towards a large overseas market we were much more flexible and allowed customers to reserve an item for several months before their arrival in Australia sometimes up to a year without regular contact from the store The length of time was purely due to the fact that not all of the collection is available overseas and the slightly lower prices after taking the tax refund system into account which made shopping at our store more appealingThe extended reservation period was also available to locals Yes they could keep an item on hold for months as long as they let us know in advance eg I am on holiday and wont be back for a month or I live interstate but will be visiting in two months time For others we typically allowed them a reserve period of up to a month without any calls however the time period was dependent on the popularity of an item This guide worked simply because  the exact details of the reservation system are unknown to customers which gives us a lot of leeway on how to implement it and   locals for the past  years in addition to having common sense never left an item for longer than one week at most and answeredreturned their calls when we tried to confirm the reserve status As I alluded to but didnt really explain explicitly in previous stories summer at a hat boutique is the busiest season of the year To give you the scale of how frantic it can be sometimes the three months of summer alone can generate up to a third of the revenue for the year Now the head office of this brand is not known for making clever decisions with regard to production Even though we as staff members of the flagship store put more consideration in what wider range of items would be popular next season and request stock accordingly the preferences of the larger department stores skew what management puts into production Due to managements lack of foresight many of our popular products run out of stock before the season ends which tends to lead to much customer dramaThis story comes to you from the calm after the storm of one summer afternoon The end of the season was nigh and we had hit a record number of sales The boss had gone home and the only sound to disrupt the peace was the persistent ring of the phone behind the desk Slouching in the chair bracing myself for another demanding customer I was surprised to be greeted by a friendly voice We will dub the lady behind this voice DF for deceptively friendlyM Good afternoon HB store Meguriau speakingDF Oh hello Im looking to keep something reserved for a friend Would you have it in stock Its called B in the Natural colour from your SS collection M We do have one of those in stock When were you next able to come byDF Ill be in on the weekendM That sounds perfect If I could just take down your name and contact details well see you thenThis particular backpack was a  masterpiece Its craftsmanship gave off a casual yet stylish vibe and it caught the attention of every woman who came by the store The product only remained on shelves for three days at most before it found its way to a new home It was fantastic that it sold well however my manager had not been able to gauge the level of interest people would have in the item and nor did department stores As a result there were only three more B bags left over in the world at this point in time Despite the high demand for the item the weekend was only two days away so we didnt give it much more thought before reserving two other bags remaining at the warehouse The following weekend had come and gone with no sign of DF My manger figured we could hold it out for another week before deciding what to do Perhaps she was sick busy with work lost her phone In any case I left her a message offering to hold it for an extra weekAnother weekend another message and again no DF This time we let her know in no uncertain terms that this item was going back on display and to give us a call if she was still interested in this item We figured that if she called we could put the item back on hold and if not we could still have a new one brought in on the next delivery date A few days later the bag found its way into the possession of a lovely Japanese lady and DF was still not to be found It couldnt have been minutes after the transaction when the sensor sounded marking the arrival of a smartly dressed middle age woman Bright smile spreading from ear to ear it soon became apparent this customer was DFM Hi there Is there anything I can help you withDF I called in to reserve B bag for a friend Could I take a lookM Im sorry unfortunately we have taken this item off hold The warehouse shows up as having two more left in stock so we will be sure to have this item available for you by next week at the latest DF Thats preposterous It was on hold I wanted to see the dimensionsI proceeded to exhaust all possible ways of explaining to her that we did not have any others in store at the moment apart from telling her that I was not Hogwarts trained and could not simply conjure a replica bag for her to examineM Im afraid thats the most I can do for you at this point in time Well again give you a call when the bag arrives and if you could phone us before coming in that would be fantasticAll in all she appeared to back down and with an expression visibly forced DF mumbled something under her breath and sauntered out of the storeFrom that point on it felt as though DF was engaging in some form of petty revenge The same nonresponsive pattern ensued even after the bag had arrived and on hold This time the manager was determined to keep the bag until DF arrived Days extended into weeks and almost months until the manager had had enough She was by no means an impatient person however in this time the other B bag had already made its way into the hands of another customer so this bag was the last one available in the world and was spending its days hiding away in a cupboard The manager had reached breaking pointManager I CANT BELIEVE THE NERVE OF THIS WOMAN I RUN A BUSINESS NOT A STORAGE CENTRE IF YOU CANT GET A  DEPOSIT FROM HER PUT IT BACK ON DISPLAY SHE DOESNT DESERVE THE BAGAfter she calmed down she asked me to phone DF and let her know that we would keep the bag up until the weekend at the latest and if she would like an extension to please contact usOf course we had no such luck It was now Monday and had been no sign of DF Almost an hour after opening a customer phoned in from Japan for the B bag and it had now been packaged and ready to be posted Shortly after the sensor sounded It  was DF and mildly frustrated does not even begin to describe the response when I told her we were completely out of stock She was absolutely belligerentDF THE BAG IS SOLD OUT SOLD OUT HOW DARE YOU M Im terribly sorry but we had informed you that we would only extend the reservation period if youd left us a messaDF MY HUSBAND WAS HOSPITALISED YESTERDAY SO I COULDNT CALL M Im sorry to hear of your husbands illDF YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO SELL IT I ALREADY BLOODY OWN IT Unable to refer her elsewhere the rest of the morning was spent attempting to placate DF as she drove away potential customers and attracted a small gawking crowd Lets just say that animal taming was not a skill set I invested many points into On my own with no manager to back me up I soon realised that nothing I could do would calm her down and ultimately gave up letting her rage and rant Once she left she left for good and I have never crossed paths with her sinceFollowing this incident a new policy was set in place immediately Overseas customers are still be able to place extended holds on items regardless of their popularity however now it is not automatically true for locals Customers that dont need to cross a state line to get to the store can only keep an item on hold for a week however they were required to check in with us if they are unable to come by Of course there are a few exceptions to the rule but I guess thats retail Extra information for

xVarekai,86,35,1r3e2x,162,This story is a little different as its not about a particular customer but instead about one of the most uncomfortable working experiences Ive had with a manager  Ive worked on and off for a certain body carehome fragrance store shilling overpriced lotion to the masses and as such Ive been in several stores depending on where I lived at the time and the financial state I was in  My first and only other post can be found hereThats called stealing httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsjfthatscalledstealingand while I probably have other stories its been a while since I had to deal with that environment but Ill post any juicy ones I recallSo about this store manager  I lived in a small town in the bible belt for some time and while I hope this doesnt offend anyone I will say that I am an atheist but wasnt exactly out about it as Id experienced some nasty behavior in the past for simply saying I dont go to church  My store manager on the other hand was very active in her church and wasnt shy about talking about her faith  She seemed to assume that we were all christians of one form or another but I dont think that this is something that should be talked about in a place of business  Ive worked with people of all faiths and if youre a decent person I really dont care one way or the other  In fact Id prefer it not come up at all as this can lead to problemslike it did in this situationSo it was really more a culmination of comments and assertions than an actual confrontation for a while with me quietly holding my tongue and going about my job as best I could  I was in a difficult spot at the time stressed in private life and pretty depressed about my lack of direction even though I was actually able to save money for the first time  I had taken on a minor management role that turned out to be quite a bit more than I had expected  Some of you can probably relateAnyway Im struggling to master the many tasks and expectations of my position I was promoted into lower management and actually moved an hour and a half to take it so the disappointment was a bit stronger than if it had been within my previous home store and I can tell that my manager who we shall call Cindy from here on out is wanting badly to get me to church  Little things like Well have you made any friends at church and You should find a nice church to go to youll meet more people and feel better when I confided that my personal life was a bit difficult  I know Cindy meant well but there was no way I could really open up to her  Plus she wasnt exactly the model person she seemed to think she was pitting employees against each other and having her church friends spy on the store when she took a rare day off  Im not sure why she delighted so much in the little gossipy things she did but the store was small and her influence made some pretty big waves at timesOne day I was about to close up the store stooped to pick up some trash off the floor and came up wrong under the sink overhang giving myself a pretty solid concussion  My SO took me to the hospital after I called HR to report the incident where we stayed for  hours to be seen  I got a note that said I needed to be off for a few days until my symptoms cleared up and Cindy didnt like that  She sent an email to a comanager that I was pretty good friends with about how she didnt want me taking advantage of the situation  Lady I had a concussion and I didnt do it on purpose  That was pretty much the beginning of the endCindy started laying it on thick such as at management meetings where we talked about personal experiences looking pointedly at me when she said that faith is the most important thing in her life and she doesnt know where shed be without it  She even did this little stunt where she gradually filled a glass with objects of varying size saying If you dont leave room for faith then your bottle is never full  Fullon evangelical which again I dont care what you do in your own time but this is not appropriate for workFinally I was able to quit and started making plans with my SO to move back to my home state for a fresh start  She and I sat down in the food court for a coaching session and she started talking about how this job wasnt really for me and I agreed with her saying that I was going to be turning in my two weeks  She seemed annoyed that I was already making plans  I thought that was it and then before we went back to the store she looks at me intensely and asks xVarekai do you have a bibleAlright  Ive had enoughI said No I dont  And I dont think thats an appropriate question for a place of businessShe looked as if Id slapped her and maybe she felt that way too  I dont like to be confrontational or make people feel bad but enough was enough  I never once said anything to her when she was preaching at work I took it quietly and let her looks of disdain and irritation wash over me  And its not just religionanything that could be controversial like politics or views about abortion should not be discussed at work in my opinion  Its distracting causes problems and can make good people make poor choices in their desire to defend themselvesAnyway she was stonecold frosty to me for the duration of the two weeks and I was glad to be gone  Some of you may say well you should have gone to HR with that  And yes I probably should have  I suppose it was the general environment and knowing that it probably would have only gotten worse if I had said anything that kept me quiet and she has a lot of influence in that community  So I took it until I had a way out and didnt look backI dont know if everyone will understand the impact of that one question to someone who is firmly without faith but it was jarring and inappropriate  I only hope she learned something from the experience and hasnt done that to anyone else,The bible story,197,talesFromRetail,top_week

spotty,18,28,1r43bb,147,Hi allI just discovered this sub I run my own DVDGame store and have dozens of stories I think you will enjoy so when I get time I will add more  It was a typical Wednesday afternoon we had gotten through the lunch time rush and were tidying the shelves and generally preparing for the after school onslaught that would come in a few hours timeA rather unremarkable gentleman came into the store and started browsing our movies for sale Since it was quite time I wandered over and enquired as to whether he was after anything in particular The person in question replied with a grunt which I took to mean No I am fine thanks so I let him continue on while me and a staff member just went about doing whateverFast Forward around an hour later The gentleman was still walking around our store and while we do have loads of things to look at circa  movies a customer being around that long gives us an automatic red flag We are in a fairly low socio economic part of town and quite often a customer that hangs around a ridiculous amount of time can be a indication they are waiting for the coast to be clean to steal stuff Naturally we start to keep a subtle eye on him but he does not appear to be doing anything too suspicious so we let him be and keep our distance after all some people just love browsing our selection of rarepre owned moviesFast Forward another half hour or soOur strange visitor has been carrying around a movie for around  minutes and he is now approaching the counter I feel a sense of relief It is always nice when your gut is wrong about someone Unfortunately it wasnt to be He comes up to my register and the following conversation happensME Scans Hi sir that will be CUST Nah you owe me ME Im sorry sirCUST I bought that movie  months ago and it doesnt work and I want a refundME Sir I just saw you pick that movie up from the display stand Also it still has the stores security lock on itCUSTNah not that copy I bought another one and it doesnt work and I want my money backME Ok Sir if you bring the movie and your receipt bacCUST I lost my receiptMEAt this stage just wanting him gone Ok just bring the movie back and I will give you a refundCUST Give me the money now and Ill bring it back laterME That is not how the process worCUST GIVE ME MY FUCKING REFUND OR ILL TAKE YOU OUTSIDE AND CUT YOUR THROAT CAt this point I pull my personal alarm which all my staff have attached to there cloths and he goes running out the door I had already given one of the staff a signal to go down the back and watch the cameras and get ready to call the cops when it become clear he was not right and she proceeds to do thatHe jumps into a waiting car that pulls out and proceeds to run into the back of the car in front of it before taking off Unfortunately I wasnt quick enough to get the rego tags  The police came and took a report but I never heard back from them or the customer again I can only hope he got his copy of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic to workEDIT TLDR  Dude wanted us to give him a refund for something he didnt have Went psycho and rammed a car  ,The tale of the ridiculous refund,175,talesFromRetail,top_week
Foliagus,31,31,1r761t,145,Hey guys long time reader first time poster etcI work for a lovely little retail store north of the border we sell drugs makeup and of course the fun things electronicsI just had a customer today that made me walk away for the first time and I thought that maybe youd appreciate what I did and maybe you could learn how to deal with this kindve thing  So Angry Lady comes in AL about five pm asking if we pricematch  From the way she was asking she obviously knew we did indeed pricematch other competitors and Id definitely seen her in the store before  Me Absolutely miss did you want me to see if I have something in stock for youAL Yes your Samsung  smart tv Its on for  at Lamewad other store on the other side of townMe Ok well Ill just pull it up on our website here and print off the price for you one secondNow our computers are running a windows so old well I guess Im not funny enough for some comparive humour  Our computers are old and clunky and take long periods of time inbetween inputs just to decide if they like the way you clicked somethingAs were loading through the Lamewad website they list no television fitting the criteria  This is after five minutes of Oh my god I went through this last time you guys are terrible I show her the other Samsung  the nonsmart version going for  on their website and she angrily just says no before insisting I open Lamewads flyerI gladly open the flyer finding indeed the same television without smart advertised for   I point this out again I get a No before AL points above the tv at a different model An LG and says THAT tv  That ones smartWell I point out that the television is listed at  and that we dont actually carry LGThis puts her into a silent anger and she just turns and walks away  I as mandated by my company say Have a nice evening before forgetting about the whole thingCUE many hours later about  pm when we get called to go outside  Now when this happens its because our LP Loss Prevention Security Officer has pursued somebody out of the store and were to go outside and just stand there for visual support  Getting outside after everybody I find LP on top of a girl screaming and yelling to her friend telling her friend to take her stuff while LP yells not to let her take it and sure enough one of our staff goes and grabs the little pink box from the girls purse and holds onto it for LP  Now after some minutes weve got a large van coming  LP is in the middle of our little road but he cant move this girl shes flailing and screaming not letting him cuff her Anyway Large Van drives right up to about  feet away from about  employees all standing in full white shirt and tie and honks her horn repeatedly  Our manager proceeds to hold up her hand asking the van to wait or to just turn left and go around  Who gets out of the van but AL  GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER YOU ASSHOLE ARE YOU TRYING TO RAPE HER  SOMEBODY STOP HER YOU employeesAt this our manager tells everybody else but her and LP to go inside the police are now audible coming in a very fast way  We all do and sure enough coming in  seconds after myself is ALI found the ad now you HAVE to price matchShe indeed whips out a printed ad from a competitor and I start processing the paperwork  During this I notice our inventory is out one so I dont actually have a boxed unit for sale I let her know this and she does that LOVELY derisive chuckle Man you guys really have no idea what youre doing the last time you couldnt find my tv eitherTo this I apologize let her know thats unfortunate but that Id be happy to get a tv in within a few days after purchase So at this point as Im walking away grabbing more paperwork I ask Awesome Coworker AC if shes able to intercede  Im starting to get hot under the collar and I want to distance myselfAC replies that shed be happy to so as we both walk back to AL I hear AL talking to another customer in our store Oh god you shouldve seen it he had his hands all over her it was brutal  God I dont know if Ill shop her again their security seems so violent etc etcI shrug it off but it stings a bit  Our LP is a contracted service theyre not a part of our company and theyre some of the nicest guys Ive ever met  The one in particular is a little  guy hes new and hes got a lisp  Now because they dont work for our company this means weve never had to worry about them reporting us to managers or such so any strictly noncorporate actions go over easy  Nice guys I play video games with quite a few of themAnyway so at the till just as Im clearing everything for AC miss AL turns to me and stares me down as she says I hope you feel safe here and I hope the police watch the video on your cameras your LP was completely outve line and violentI was done now  I didnt respond  AC saw and she immediately said Oh Foliagus would you like to go speak with COMPUTERS EMPLOYEE he said he wanted to see youI nod say Enjoy your evening miss and walk awayI hid until she was gone and I was commended for the calm manner I showed in the face of what I found out is a disreputable repeating customer  Thank god for my coworkers she was just poking me over and over againAnyway so I find out later the girl outside  Crack dealer  The little pink box  Full of crack and needles  She was so crazy because she was desperately trying to get her friend to pick up the evidence before the cops arrivedThanks for listening TFR you guys keep me saneTLDR  I singlehandidly rescued a hostage victim from a man strung out on compressed air before selling  dollars of merchandise at  margin

MrDoctorSmartyPants,24,19,1rep4z,145,A little backstory I worked for a large and generic yet popular apparel retail store for a a little while right when I was getting out of high school I was rarely on the floor as a sales rep because I generally spent my day in the stock room going through endless stacks of shipment boxes however my managers loved the idea of me being on the floor because I am so outgoing and generally enjoy peopleto be quite honest I really enjoyed my time at this storeAll my managers were great it was in a very upscale shopping center so generally the customers were great and everyone I worked with was very cool I literally never had ANY problems with anyone that I worked withI guess it was kind of a utopian retail job  Now a little more background about my particular job responsibilitiesI was the stock room manager I was the person that met the truck at the back door at am every tuesday thursday and saturday  I was the one that printed off the delivery summary from the computer every night before the shipmentI knew how many boxes were coming I was the one responsible for counting each one of the boxes to make sure I got no more or no less than what was on the shipment invoice and I was the one responsible for processing all the shipment  In a nutshell I knew the stock room backwards and forwards knew what we had back there and what we didnt have because I unpacked it organized it and set up carts for employees on the floor to distribute in between helping customers There were rare occasions when  I would emerge victorious from the depths of the stock room having everything processed and put away and I would help out on the register or I would go find things in the stock room for associates on the floor and on occasion I would just help customers with whatever they neededThis particular day I was working the cash registers and a woman comes in who I had seen many times  She was a really nice lady and she even knew me by name because she had enjoyed our interaction on a previous trip to the store and had asked my name to brag to managers about me  A little about our return policyWith a receipt and tags on the clothes there was no time frame for returns  You can buy something put it in a closet for ten years decide you dont want it and bring it back  No problem  If you dont have a receipt and the tags are still on the clothes you can always return themthings stay in the system basically indefinitelybut if you dont have the receipt we scan the bar code and whatever comes up is what you get  If it says  bucks on the tag but comes up  cents you get  cents back  who knows what reduction stickers youve peeled off the tag  So all this being said here is my actual storyand I only remember this because in almost a year this is literally the only negative experience I ever had at this jobNice lady NL comes up to my register with a pair of bright red skinny jeans and drops them down on the counterNL Hi MrDoctorSmartyPants  How are you  I havent seen you the last few times Ive been in hereMe  It has been a while Im doing pretty gooddo you want to return these pants  Do you have your receiptNL I sure dont but Ive never taken the tags off of these as you can see so I can still return them rightMe Yep you sure can but unfortunately if you dont have your receipt I can only give you back what they ring up as and Im sure you bought these a while back because Ive never seen these in this store It should be noted the tag said  bucks for these particular pantsNL  Ok that is fine Ive dealt with that beforebut the tag says  dollars and just because I dont have my receipt doesnt mean I should be penalized and lose money on my purchaseMe I know you come here all the time but without a receipt we have no way to prove that you actually paid this amount for these pants we place stickers to denote sale prices over the original prices all the time and they are easily removed to look like they were never thereand to be honest with you in the time that Ive worked here since the store opened I have never seen these pants did you purchase them at another locationNL  Yes but that doesnt matter because I paid  for them like a year and a half ago and Ive never worn thembut lets just return them and see what I can get back for themMe ok lets seeat this point I scan the item and it comes up no shit at  Ok it says NL WHAT Thats robbery That CANT be rightMe Im afraid thats the best I can do for you I explained our policy and you said you understood  Ive returned things without a receipt for you beforeif I could give you more I wouldbut I cant and I dont have any of these pants in the store to verify a current price other than what the computer reads  NL Well this is absolutely unacceptable  You probably have some in the back that you can check for price so you can see how much these cost meI know the policy but this is a little differenti paid a lot for these pantsthis should be an exception  I want to see a managerMe Maam I am the stock manager I know everything in this entire store and I have never seen these pants beforeIm sure there are none in the back and I wish there was something I could do for you but I cant  Honestly this return policy is rooted in loss prevention and instances like this are the exact reason this policy existsNL Cant you just go look to make sure  Me Sure Ill do that for you  at this point i go in the back and out the back door for  minutes and smoke a cigarette and come back  Nope  We dont have any  what the computer shows is the best I can doNL NO I WANT TO SEE THE STORE MANAGER LESLIE WHERE IS SHEMe She isnt here today maamIm the only manager in the storeNL  Well call herMe I dont have her home number and Im not going to disturb her on a sunday over a cut and dry return policy issue  Im not making you return the pants Im not forcing you to take this moneyyou can keep the pantsNL  This is so stupidI cant believe youre treating me like this I come in here all the time You should make exceptions  Just give me my money and Ill be on my wayI dont want these stupid pantsMe Ok Maamhere you go   Im really sorry for your inconvenience have a nice dayNL  Yeah you ruined this nice day Wait until I talk to your managerI actually saw this lady a couple days later and my store manager and I were chatting in the middle of the store about somethingthe lady walked up and said hello was cordial and never so much as mentioned the incident from a few days prior  Sorry if this is so long it wasnt even that badit just stuck out in my mindTLDR Woman accepted return policy except for when it was going to lose her money and in that instance thought she deserved special treatment EVEN THOUGH she previously said whatever was fine,Woman understands store return policy refuses to believe it should apply to her in this one particular instance,164,talesFromRetail,top_week
prettehkitteh,24,30,1rcsdq,140,Wall of Text coming tis the season and Im feeling inspired by all these insane posts about people losing their shit over things they dont need I worked in retail for five years off and on as a grocery store cashier so I never really experienced Black Friday  except one year when I got a temp job at a major toy store on the side I started my new job two days before this day of reckoning For some reason the managers thought it prudent to stick the new girl on the front line when the store opened at am I had barely gotten a chance to get familiar with the store layout and we had special areas where the really populardiscounted toys were set up the day before so I pretty much had no idea where anything wasWe didnt get the typical zombies clawing at the windows phenomenon but people were lined up and a few even knocked on the doors because it was snowing outside and they really wanted to get in early I watched with a giant knot in my stomach as my manager unlocked the doors and people nabbed carts and ran inside I was immediately flooded with shouted questionsWHERE ARE THE TICKLE ME ELMOSWHERE IS THE HOMOSAPIEN ROBOT I NEED IT FOR MY SONI NEED A VIDEOGAME WHERE IS YOUR ELECTRONICS SECTIONI did my best to stutter answers out as people didnt even stop moving for me to answer I quickly picked up on where Tickle Me Elmos TMEs from now on were because everyone wanted one I could not believe how many people wanted one I stayed up toward the entrance because I knew if I went into the main sales floor I would get eaten alive and after the initial rush for the first two hours people started being a little more polite though there was still a lot of running and shouting going on That was when crazy beard came inCB was a grungy exconfederatelooking older man with a bandana tied around his head and a big scruffy grey beard all over his face He marched straight up to me and levelly demanded I need a TME Me Of course sir if you follow this aisle to the back and make a right they are in a special display in the middle of the aisle you cant miss themCB Are you sure there are any leftMe I havent been back there in a little while so unfortunately I dont know Im sorryHe waved a hand at me and scurried off I thought that was the end of it A minute later he scurried back visibly a lot more agitatedCB There were no TMEsMe Im sorry sir we did have some this morCB How could you not have any TMEs You must have more in the back I need oneI knew we had put out almost everything we had the night before  there was no backstock I tried to explain this to CB as he started shakingCB I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULDNT POSSIBLY HAVE ANY MORE TMEsMe fishing for anything to get this guy off my back IIm sorry sir theres not much I can do If you had gotten here earlier big mistakeCB IT DOESNT MATTER WHEN I GET HERE YOURE A FUCKING TOY STORE HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE TMES I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO A MANAGERThose magic words I was shaking now I dont handle anger very well and was relieved to get some help I ran to a phone a few feet away and called for help over the intercom CB followed me and lowered his voice to keep grumbling to me about his worldending problem but he seemed to calm down a little now that he knew he had gotten up a rung on the ladder We waited I knew a manager might be a little longer because they were also amidst the throng of shoppers so I tried not to panic and made some small talk with CBFive minutes passed I saw CB getting more impatient so I called again over the intercom trying a joke about how the managers were probably up to their necks with customers CB wasnt amused so I just kept standing there shuffling my feet I couldnt leave the guy so I did my best to answer the couple questions that came my way while I was doing nothing Another five minutes passedCB What the fuck is taking him so longMe I dont know Im so sorry I can go look for a manager if you wantCB Youre staying RIGHT HERE until he shows up I know a cop out when I hear oneMe Im not trying to abandon you sir I want to helpCB You need to get your manager here RIGHT NOW DO YOU HEAR MEI was on the verge of crying at this point I picked up the phone for a third time trembling trying to take a breath so I didnt start crying over the intercom  when the lead manager Tim finally showed up out of breath from hurrying up front so quickly CB immediately looked a lot less threatening compared to Tim who was  built like a linebacker with tattoos on his arms and a long braided black beard Tim who had a heart of gold and cared about his employees asked ME what the problem was which pissed off CB but he looked scared shitlessMe Were out of TMEs and he really would like oneCB Thats RIGHT I have a problem with the fact thatTim Just a moment sir Prettehkitteh thank you you can go back to the frontI scampered away as quickly as possible as Tim started to explain that if we didnt have TMEs we didnt have TMEs I watched as CBs anger overcame his cowardice and he raised his voice a little to be rebutted or cut off each time with Tims best gentle giant voice Within two minutes Tim smiled and pointed out the door CB yelled one last unintelligible word and stormed out Tim came over to me gave me a big hug and told me to go take a breather in the back room The rest of that shift was a piece of cake comparatively and when I left that day I knew the store layout like the back of my hand TLDR Fuck Tickle Me Elmos,My first Black Friday and first TFR post  Tickle Me Elmos,170,talesFromRetail,top_week

were unforced and natural Very few awkward silences Not at all what I expectedIn the dark of the movie theater I reached out and held her hand She gladly took it and leaned into my shoulder Thankfully

SuzyGreenburg,10,12,1re89p,109,When I was bar tending one evening a guy that I knew by name only came in  He stumbled up to the bar and ordered his drink a martini of some kind I think  As I grabbed a shaker to get to work on it he began saying that I was being too slow and if I couldnt figure out what to do he would come back there and do it for me  I ignored him and finished the drink  As I handed it back he looked at it told me anybody could make a martini and slapped  cent on the counter  THEN he left the bar to go back into the restaurant that is attached turned back around and said I think I tipped you to fn much  I can make my own gd martini next time  Enjoy your minimum wage  Okay  This all occurred in the matter of two minutes it took to make the drink and the only thing Id said the entire time was What would you like to drink  The other customers were astounded at his rudeness but I brushed it off just another night at the bar rightFast forward an hour or so and I go down to meet my husband at another bar on the property that stays open after the hotel bar closes  Who should be there but the jerk from before  When he spots my husband he comes directly over and starts chatting him up because theyd known each other as kids and were friendly  When my husband introduced me to this guy it was like I was talking to a completely different person  He was all compliments and can I by you a drink and its so nice to meet you lets get a table together  Clearly this guy did not recognize me from before  I stood there looking at his stupid face trying to remain calm but the more I thought about it the angrier I became  When Im in service mode Im worthy of ridicule and rudeness but as my husbands wife Im someone he wants to be friends with  I decided I couldnt let it pass  By the end of my tirade my husband was holding me back jerk off had spilled his drink on himself and was profusely apologizing while trying to blend into the wall  He left shortly thereafter and called my husband the next day to apologize sober  Ugh  Still makes me angry but I hope at least he is hesitant to treat others this way now  My only regret is that I couldnt handle him in a classier way but oh well  He deserved what he got,I hope this belongs here my own experience with people in service being treated like crap,121,talesFromRetail,top_week

MysticSpiral,23,29,1rb12d,96,This is a story of a horrible client a weak manager and a poor associate me caught amidst it all It was a dark night in late spring The shorts are being unpacked and the air is fresh and new hope blooms I love my job and my customers at this store this is before I was promoted and moved to a different location are generally exceptionally awesome Even the bad ones arent really THAT bad and only minor annoyances Now this night we were slow and it was just about closing time so the MOD manager on duty and I were cleaning up around the store Our bliss is soon interrupted by a dark haired demon disguised as a human being   For whatever reason Demon Bitch bypasses the MOD and heads straight for me and I feel a chill roll down my spine I know somehow that this is going to be bad DB I bought this dress the other day whips out cotton dress and I went to put it on a button is missing from the back Can I exchange itMe Hoping this is easier than I first thought Of course lets see if we still have another in the same sizeExtra small petiteWe did not Me Im sorry it doesnt look like we have another in the same color and size We can exchange it for a different color or I can refund you back your money for it no problemDB No I want to wear THIS oneMe I can look it up and see if another store has it if you want We can put it on hold for however long you want and you are welcome to exchange it there We can try to place an order for it as well through the computer but if there is a low inventory theres no guarantee you will get t unfortunately The inventory is about  hours behind and often the numbers are lower than what is shownDB No That is unacceptable I want this one Cant you just sew a new button on itMe Unfortunately we dont have spare buttons but I can sew the button loop to the other side so it doesnt look off balance if you like Mind you the button is TINY About half the size of a dime Its really not that big of an issueNow this where things start to go downhill DB What will you do with the dress if I return it  Honesty to me  is the best policy but had I known how this was going to go down I probably would have just lied to this personMe Most likely we will write a damage tag for it and it will get removed from the inventory and shipped outDB Then rip a button off another dress and sew it to this oneI am VERY taken aback by this  She wants meto destroy No way Just No Me Maam Im sorry I cannot destroy company propertyDB WHAT You just SAID that this one would get sent out if I returned it what is the difference between this one and that one getting sent outMe Well that dress is now YOURS since you bought it You can do with it what you will and if you return it then it becomes the property of the company again  meaning that we will adhere to company policy and not put a damaged item on the floor The other dress on the rack is still company property and I will not willfully destroy company propertyDB I RAN A BUSINESS FOR TEN YEARS YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE THE CUSTOMER HAPPY RIP A BUTTON OFF THAT DRESS AND SEW IT ONTO MINE THIS INSTANTMe I am not going to destroy company property You can return the dress or I can find one at another store Those are your options I am not risking my job by destroying company propertyDB THAT IS BULL SHIT YOU WILL NOT LOSE YOUR JOB OVER MAKING THE CUSTOMER HAPPY I RAN A BUSINESS I KNOW I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGERMe Alright MOD who has been listening the whole time this client would like to speak with youThe MOD comes over and I walk away continue to tidy up the store and do my job Then I see the MOD take the clients dress And the dress on the floor Im thinking that she CANT POSSIBLY be doing what I thinkYes the MOD ripped a button off a dress from the floor and sewed it back on to DBs dress Something or other had brought me to the desk a few moments later while the MOD was wrapping up sewing the new button on During the entire time DB wont stop going on and on about how she ran a business and knows that you do whatever it takes to make a customer happy etc etc etc  She then turns to me again and tells me Losing your job over making a customer happy That is SUCH bullshit I dont know of ANY company that would fire you for making a customer HAPPYI dont give her a response because at this point I am infuriated that the MOD would give into this horrible excuse for a human being and if I do respond it will be nasty DB eventually leaves and the MOD comes overMOD MysticSpiral Im sorry that I went over your head and did that I just could tell that it would escalate further and I didnt want a scene I REALLY loved that MOD she was like another mom to me but I absolutely could not respond to her I dont think I said a word for the rest of the evening The whole thing boils my blood even now So the lesson here is that if you scream and cry and rant and rave you can get someone to destroy company property just so you dont have to

Sapphires,19,19,1r8o2i,96,I work the jewelry counter at a department store  Were a standalone store and more low end than some of the other department stores at the mall across town  We dont actually sell that much fine jewelry  I spend most of my shift straightening clothes and helping in layaway   We wear radios and the jewelry counter is near the service desk so they just call me up when I have a customerOkay so the other night Im closing  I hadnt actually been there more than  minutes when I get my first jerky jewelry customer  An old lady is standing at the counter holding a ziplock bag with an old looking watch in it  The watch has a leather band that looks like its just disintegrated and fallen off of the watchMy first thought is that she wants to pick out a new watch band to math the old one as closely as possible  I can do that  I am prepared to start showing them to herNope  She asks if I can put a band on the watchWe cant  We dont do any jewelry repairs in the store  We dont have the tools or the training or the coverage   Were low end and our jewelry counter is almost an afterthought and definitely not one of our most oftshopped areasI personally would be down to try doing it technically I know how but were not allowed  Its a liability issue  And I can see why  If an employee were to try and then fuck up and break the item the company would have to really kiss the customers ass in order to dissuade any legal actionSo I explain to the woman that we sell bands but cant install them  She is not actually very jerky and goes on her wayNEXT  Id say this was about  minutes later  I get called to the jewelry counter again  This time there are two customers waiting  An older woman and a middle aged man  Theyre not together so I kind of look from one to the other to try to figure out who was first  The man indicates for me to help the woman firstMe  Hi what can I do for you   Woman  I need my watch battery changed   Me  Oh Im sorry  We cant do that here   Woman  sour face You cant do that   Me  We dont have any tools to take the watch apart and we dont install watch batteries or repair jewelry at this store   Woman  Since when  You used to   Ah the dreaded you used to  My particular store asbestos and all no seriously we have a notice in our back room about how the floor tiles are made of asbestos so dont go snorting them or anything is forty years old  The company has had its ups and downs and changed in all kinds of ways over the years  You cant expect a store to stay the same forever  I dont know when my store stopped changing watch batteries but I know that it was some time before I started working there Me  We havent done it since Ive been working here   Woman  Well where am I supposed to go   Me  Youd probably have to go to a jewelry store  I dont know if big box superstore that we all love to hate does it anymore either    Woman  You cant change my battery and you cant even tell me where I can get it done other than a jewelry store    Me  Im so sorry   Woman  You spend  on a watch and it runs down after a year  What am I supposed to do just buy a new one every yearI attempt to repeat that a jewelry store would be more than happy to fix her watch  Woman is not listening she mutters that this is ridiculous and leaves  I turn to help the man  He has our weekly sales ad and is looking for a particular ring shown in it  I start looking through the diamond ring case which is particularly full right now and cannot spot it anywhere  Hmm  I start to explain that sometimes not every store getssells every item shown in the ad since the same ad is released across the whole country but I keep looking for the ringAnd then I see my daytime jewelry coworker who has already ended her shift and is on her way out the door  I flag her down and ask if we have that ringwhere it is  Bad news  They only sent us one and she already sold it earlier that day  AND its not even orderable because it was discontinued hence why it was on sale  Man is not amused and turns to leaveThe rest of my night goes fairly uneventfully  Until almost the end  I happen to be going by the counter when I spotted a couple around my age late s looking at the clearance jewelry case  So I stop and ask if theyd like to look at somethingMan  Actually I need to get a battery put in my watch  he holds up a small tin presumably containing his watch    Me  Oh we cant actually install watch batteries here  We dont have any tools to do so    Man  But do you sell batteries   Me  Yes they have some at the electronics counter  But we cant install them for you    Man  Okay thanks  And then they went off toward electronics and I went back to what I was doing  About ten minutes later the guy running electronics gets on the radio and asks if we have a screwdriver or something at the jewelry counter to get the back off of a watchI felt like screaming  I just told that guy that we couldnt do it  Fortunately my manager gets on the radio and says No we dont  And we cant install watch batteries hereBut apparently this guy was adamant about not leaving the store until he got his watch battery installed  I sat and quietly fumed while my manager and the electronics guy went back and forth talking about screwdrivers for a good  minutes  My manager asked the woman at the service desk if there are any small screwdrivers up there  There werent  And finally everybody relented and electronics guy basically told the guy the only way he was going to get a screwdriver out of us if he went to the hardware section and bought oneTLDR  No we DO NOT install watch batteries here  And when I tell you that we do not have the tools to do so dont go ask the guy at electronics,Do you have a screwdriver  Tales from the jewelry

dogfacegremlin,6,14,1r5qvo,97,BackgroundAnother post on here about shoplifting brought a flood of memories from when I used to work at a big box retail store I worked my way through college and have some very fond memories but some very crazy ones as well This is one of my favoritesI never worked Loss Prevention but was always called up during times of potential thefts The reason being is that contact had to be made with the perp from the time of the incident to the time they left the store  of the time Story timeIt was a few months after being hired I was called on a code blue potential theft I loved these so I rush up front and assume the position around the LP area with the camera I see a gentleman standing by the CD rack looking over the merchandise He looks shifty looks around puts his back to the camera and in a very swift moment turns right to the camera lifts up his shirt and deposits a CD into his pants In full view of the camera He does the same action another  times and proceeds to the exitAs expected we stop him and ask him to come into the LP office He doesnt argue or put up a fight just goes directly to the room with his head held low We ask him to remove the CDs and he does no problems From the beginning of the process I noticed that I knew him We went to HS together not a bright guy and we didnt hang in the same circles but we each saw each other in the halls He finally looks at me closely and it hits him that he knows me He verifies that I am that I am Dogfacegremlin and I say yes Then he asks very candidly if we got him good I smile say yes and show him the video Hes dumbfounded that hes basically showing the camera his theft and remarks that he shouldve done it the other way I laugh it offA few years later same numb nuts went to jail for robbing a bank Asked a buddy for ride to the bank came back to the car crazy asking him to drive Driver noped that idea and just sat there till the cops cameSmarty pants got busted for several other bank robberies because he left the bank bags from previous robberies in his roomTLDR  Caught a guy from my HS stealing asked me if we got him good showed him his theft video Year later same dude busted robbing a bank,Dumbest Thief Ever,111,talesFromRetail,top_week
KroipyBill,11,41,1rhynu,124,After writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterdayhttpredditrfj it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager When I first started working for this place I came in clean shaven and patchy hair I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business and it wasnt until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through It was a relief to embrace it and feel like I looked decent again There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however In fact in my previous stories Ive quoted him several times in our conversations since he was my favorite manager to talk to and the biggest goof ball there He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasnt ready for it Me Dude Im taller than you So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie you will not succeed Manager Well seewellseeAt that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy At least he left it at just contemplating One day we were pretty busy It was preholiday postblack Friday days Im sure you all know the type Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted I was describing the hardware specs how it works with their Apple products etc During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale However I made a massive mistakeI sat down Yes I slipped up big time My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question Employee Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find some bullcrap item that he knew the answer toMe Yeah sure Remember theyre ehahhAHHRight then my manager walks up to me with his pen and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head while it was dragged across my chrome dome My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine I made a weird breathing noise like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head Kind of like EAHH EAHH EAHH Thats the best I can do textually They were quiet sharp noisesHe walked off cackling like the joker I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face He lost his crap and just laughed Because of this I sold him more attachments but thats beside the point Over the radioMe The person who drew on my head You know who you are Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion Im a pretty tall dude so for those who were in eye sight I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person Much laughter followed including my managerManager You said I would never get you Me Well bucket head youre lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me Manager My strike is now complete Me Its a good thing I dont just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face Im glad you feel all militaristic about your approach Manager Ohthis would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play I never got him back And he has since left the store after I left Despite us still being good friends hes still a bucket head ,My Mangers obsession with my baldness Tales from the Large Electronics Store,165,talesFromRetail,top_week
thompsontoonsart,16,15,1r9l9k,98,Customer walks up to me just as Im about to go on my late afternoon lunch break She says shes there to pick up an order for X person name Well call her Fuddle Duddle and it should be a couple of bedskirts She received a call that the order was in Seems clear cut like any other order we have shipped to the store from our warehouse I go to our holds area to find the ordertheres no bedskirts on hold and no orders under the name the customer gave me I walk back onto the selling floor to speak with the customer Maam you said your name is Fuddle Duddle I dont see any orders out back with that name attachedWell no My name is Sue Fuddle is my friend Im in the area so she asked me to pick up her order for herThe next half hour spirals into this confusing mess of misinformation that five other associates attempted to clear up Sue came to the store with Fuddle a couple weeks ago and made a few largeish purchases Sue said Fuddle was pretty sure shed paid for the order being shipped to the store and it just needed to be picked up I look through our log book listing paid for pickup orders and there was no listing of Fuddles name in the book I inform Sue that the order may have only been transferred into the store but not paid for if this was the case our policy is that unpaid hold items are put onto the selling floor after hrs Sue said Fuddle had paid for the bedskirts I tried looking up Ms Duddles customer information in our register and through our catalog system and I found no purchase records at all Well that cant be right Sue said We were here in the store We bought several hundred dollars worth of stuff We were here for hours You must have a record I informed her that their purchases would be in our records but they wouldnt be logged under their names unless we created customer profiles for them Since their names didnt come up in our profile search I figured theyd opted out of having a profile created Sue decides to call Fuddle and confirm the information Sue hands me the phone after a few minutes so I can speak directly with Fuddle I inquire what style bedskirt it was that shed ordered for pick up and she said she couldnt really describe it She could tell me where she found the bedskirt in the store but the one she ordered was the correct size she needed that wasnt available in store at the time Supposedly it was a plain tailored style and she had a receipt for the item at home but she wasnt at home that very moment so she couldnt give me the information on the receipt She insisted she paid for the bedskirt because she had a receipt but her friend had also received a call to pick up her order which she said is a queen sized dust ruffle in white or maybe it was two twins She couldnt even remember what she ordered I described a couple of the styles to her and she suggested our diamond quilted style seemed most likely I asked if her order could have been logged under anyone elses name and she said no but her neighbor Pierce was supposed to pick it up So we had a third person involved in this order I took down Fuddles phone number and the number for her neighbor Pierce who was originally called and notified about the order and I told her wed give her a call once we sort the issue outSue is getting somewhat impatient now because she was there solely to pick up Fuddles order Fuddle lives out of state but owns a second house here in Maine which is where the bedskirt is supposed to go Sue looks at me saying So if you eventually find this bedskirt youll have to mail it to us for free right I dont want to drive another  miles to come pick it up and you already called Pierce to say it was here and somehow its not I told her that we would figure out some way to get the items to the customer if she did indeed already pay for them Sue and her patiently waiting husband decide to leaveMeanwhile my coworker pieces all the mashed up information together and tracks down the receipt for Fuddles original purchase which has a queen sized bedskirt on it She bought the bedskirt and one matching sham in store and they left with her What could she have possibly ordered We went back to the holds area There was a white queen coverlet and one matching sham on hold in the same style as the bedskirt she already purchased under Fuddles neighbor Pierces name and contact phone number and it was unpaid for I run out the door hoping Sue and her husband hadnt pulled out of the parking lot yet They were gone My coworker gets on the phone and calls the neighbor asking if they can contact Sue before she gets too far away from the store Were just hoping things will work out so we dont have to ship this to the customer because the customer clearly gave us all the wrong information The neighbor does get a hold of Sue she comes back and purchases the coverlet and sham for her friendTL Woman comes in to pick up supposedly paid for bedskirt for her friend Lady picking up the order gets annoyed with us because we cant track down the order thats supposed to be in store The actual order wasnt a bedskirt it wasnt paid for and the contact person listed on the order was neither the friend nor the original customer ,Customer doesnt remember what she ordered,113,talesFromRetail,top_week

kemmer,37,23,1rbkuk,92,Summer after I graduated high school I worked at a deli in a casino Ive worked at several other retail jobs since then and the casino job is easily the worst Ive ever had The main reason is that customers were all either drunk or had just lost a bunch of money and they took out that anger and frustration on us Some storiesOrientationEveryone that was starting work in the casino that week no matter the job or department took part in the same orientation It basically consisted of an HR lady telling us how great the company was while we filled out tax forms but it ended in a tour of the whole property We saw the high roller suites the ballrooms all the restaurants etc While touring the steakhouse the most expensive restaurant the manager came out to show us the super expensive liquors they had available He pulled out a bottle of one I dont remember what it was now probably Cristal or something like that and told us how lucky we were to see it up close because none of us would ever be able to afford it Its been  years since I had that job and the memory of that STILL pisses me off I was  years old that dude had no way of knowing what I would do with my life or how much money I would make Not to mention not everyone there were retail workers there were some that were working in management or in administrative jobs like accounting Its been a life goal of mine since then to go back to that restaurant and order all the highest priced items on the menu Just for my own satisfication you know I should have known then this job was gonna suckCountingIm not gonna front Im pretty bad at math Im fairly intellegent otherwise graduated college with a  GPA but Ive just never been able to wrap my head around numbers One day I rang a guy up for a sandwich and drink The order was something like  He handed me  I punched it into the register and was all ready to give him  cents back when he suddenly gave me a quarter I hesistated for a second while I tried to manually calculate what the change would be now It honesly couldnt have been more than  seconds that I hesitated but in that time he started screaming literally screaming at me about how stupid I was and how shitty my education must have been But he couldnt stop there oh no he had to call his wife over so he could point out to her how stupid the employees at this place were Can you believe it How can they hire people this dumb I had figured out his change in the meantime handed it to him turned around and sobbed over the chili The guy walked away shaking his head at me in disgustSuicideMy most memorable day working at the casino and the day I praised God that I was lucky enough to go to college and not have to work there forever This place was essentially like Disneyland in that there was a whole underground world for the employees We had our own stores our own bank our own cafeteria etc To get to the employee cafeteria from the deli we had to walk around the back of the building under a covered walkway type thing The parking garage was right outside the deli doors One day I was walking back to work after my break when I noticed a commotion happening on the ground in the front of the parking garage I looked over and noticed a huge wetspot on the ground mixed with blood and other unidentifiable fluids I couldnt tell what was going on but I was late getting back from break so I just went back into the deli Found out later that an employee in another department had committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the parking garage They had already removed the body but I got to see the remnants The image of that will forever stick in my brainThose are my best stories but that doesnt even touch the mean as nails cook that got hit by a car the Jamaicans that stole from me and that were essentially being used as indentured servants by the company or the chef that I secretly discovered had two families neither knew of the other I got my revenge on that place by stealing cookies all the time Those cookies were damn goodTLDR Casinos are possibly the worst places on earth,Why I cried over chili and other tales from the casino,115,talesFromRetail,top_week

ExcerptMusic,18,13,1rahbf,87, I work for a major cell phone retailer and frequently deal with technical issues Most of the time I love to help people figure out their phone so that they can get the most out of it However there are always certain individuals that blame their devices for their own faults Feel free to comment with similar issues as an employee or customer including silly things that were accidentally done that messed up a phoneKeep in mind the following text is currently in my head unless in quotes I am being as nice as possible on the outsideI had a customer come into the store that had a few problems with his phone I knew it wasnt going to be fun to figure out because he had on the fuck you face and looked to be in the ignorant with technology age range He presented me with  problems My alarm doesnt alert me in the morning and I need it for work The outside keys dont lock so the phone turns the speaker on The battery runs out when I unplug it at nightHe then followed by I bought this phone  days ago and want to return it and Ive been with this company for  years Advice to anyone that plans on throwing the Ive been shopping here for X amount of years This company doesnt care about you personally they just dont This isnt some mom amp pop shop that is hanging on simply by your individual business This is a multiBILLION dollar company They care even less if you were an asshole to them for those  years because I guarantee this isnt your first time complaining  So you bought the phone  days ago Sorry you cant return it There is a  day return policy on phones company wide This does not change unless there was an issue with ordering or computer date errors which doesnt happen We could also get the manufacturer to replace it if there is actually a problem with it There was no problem with the phone so there is  nothing I can do to get this guy a new phone So I check it out and explain to him what is going on The alarm First off his alarm was off He said it is because he turns it off on the weekends and on Monday it doesnt work I told him you need to turn it on or only set it for weekdaysI did this for him He kept saying that the phone was broken and the alarm would go off  minutes after it was supposed to I tested the alarm feature about  times No issues If it happened every time like he said I would have seen it at least once Even after telling him that the alarm was off he kept telling me it was the phone that had the problem and it was doing it automatically No It wasnt Next issue The outside keys wouldnt lock Ok This is a flip phone so there are volume keys and speaker phone keys He also has a horizontal belt carrier He tells me when he pushes the phone up in its holster while someone is calling him he pushes the buttons and that his old phone didnt do that I tell him that there is no way to turn off the buttons while someone is calling You can turn them off while no one is calling but not during a call After talking more with him I figured out why his old phone didnt have that issue He used to have a vertical belt clip and never pressed the buttons when he took out his phone Next issue The battery runs out at night This one is just stupid He told me that when he fully charges his phone at night he unplugs it and leaves it open The phone also has the screen timeout disabled So at night he unplugs the phone at  leaves it open fully lit and goes to bed Then in the morning he is mad that it is almost dead He must sleep with the lights on or something I dont know I set a screen timeout and told him to just leave it plugged in even though that slowly discharges battery over months and years A problem with battery capacity in  years isnt going to be his most pressing issue and it will prevent a lot of manufacturer return claims because the phone dies at night Now that ive fixed his issues he says that he will try it out but he doesnt expect it to work because it was the phone  Sorry guy it wasnt the phone It was user error through and through Dont blame technology for your mishaps Technology isnt some black magic  of operating a phone is common sense and an ability to read If the alarm says OFF then the alarm is off Its that simple  As much as I hate these people I like to see their reactions even when I fix their issues Its almost always negative with no thanks while stomping out the door I just have to roll my eyes and wait for that awesome customer that listens to experienced advice and recognizes their errors while laughing about it Seriously those are the best customers everTLDR User error accounts for most errors,Dont blame technology if you dont know how to use it,100,talesFromRetail,top_week
LossPreventionSucks,24,21,1rfcsa,85,This is my first time posting here but Ill just warn you this can get a bit winded  Ive yet to be able to REALLY rant about this guy as my manager mentioned I should keep quiet about the whole ordealNow I work for a popular gaming store chain  Im sure you can guess which one  Ive heard the horror stories however Ive had an amazing experience working there up until I met our Loss Prevention ManagerTo start the day off I had to open  I went in about  minutes earlier than usual because we had a heavy load from the night before thanks to the XBox One launch  I wanted to clean everything up before customers started piling in  I already told my manager I was just going to leave earlier in the day so we didnt go over hours and he was totally fine with that  Anyway  minutes after walking through the door a group of people start banging on the door relentlessly yelling IM HERE LET ME IN  I ignore them for the first  minutes I mean gates are down and they are banging on the door exactly where our hours are posted and its almost  hours before open  I walk up to them and inform them we open at   The man quickly snaps Bullshit We were told by StoreManager that you opened early today for the system release  So I texted my manager and sure enough he said Absolutely not  If theyre picking a system up let them in though  I asked if they were picking a system up and he responded with No I want to return this stuff holding up at least  worth of XBox games and a system  I told him he would have to wait as my computers are still down  He finally agreed and left only to call every  minutes or so and ask if we were open yet For the next hour and a half  Now because this guy was so persistent I decided to leave the safe cracked open so we didnt have to wait for the  minute timer to go up  I figured hed come back right away  That was my first mistake  He never did come back and due to us being so busy and me being the only one there I forgot that the safe was cracked just a tiny bitOn to the second half I was there alone all morning  I had several people asking for systems which require me to go through a locked door through a hallway and into another locked door to get to  I have to do this for each system whether or not  people in line are waiting for a system  This gives  minutes of time each time I have to get a system where there is absolutely no employees covering the store  So what did I do  I propped the first door open  Mistake number twoAfter a bit my parttimer came in   minutes after opening I repeat we were open for  whole minutes at this point  of which I had spent alone with nearly  customers in the store picking up systems In walks our Loss Prevention guy  I didnt know he was Loss Prevention though No He instantly walks in starts yelling at my parttimer about the door and she directs him to me as she had just gotten there  Still no introduction the following commencedFatLossPreventionMan  Why the hell is the back door openMe  Can I help youFatLP  IS YOUR SAFE OPEN  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING remember theres multiple people in the store at this point several in lineMe oh fuck   stutter stutterYeah there was an incident this morning where I had a return but he never showed up  I also needed to add change to the registerFatLP You cant do this  Are you the managerMe No may I ask who you areFatLP beaming Im Dave  Im here to audit and help with customersMe  Okay  Yeah I messed up  Its been a hectic morningAfter this exchange he continued to point out every thing that was wrong in our store  Mind you Im not the manager  Im not even assistant manager  Im a store worker who gets paid  cents more than minimum wage with manager duties  He continued to attack my coworker and I about controllers being live on the floor hanging on pegs  feet in the air saying someone could jump up and knock them off to steal them I wanted so badly to ask him to show me how  He then answered phones with just Hi this is Dave  No greeting nothing Just Dave  Then he proceeded to hang up on the people when he didnt know the answer These people then called back so they could complain to meAt this point he had yelled at my coworker and I loomed over us and degraded us so badly that I was near tears  He walked around the store talking to our DM about how pathetic this was and how incompetent the work is that he is seeing  Several customers had come up expressing their concern for my coworker and I  The best part was when I was actually shedding tears and helping a customer while Dave looked on giving no personal space  The customer asks Are you okay and Dave butts in Shes fine Do you want the GPG  I said nothing I was beaten and I couldnt do anything  The entire two hour period this man was there he told me about  different things that I had done that was a terminable offense  I was afraid if I said anything more that I would be done And I need this job  Anyway Theres a lot more about working at this game retailer that I could share mostly from corporate but this is by far the worst experience Ive ever hadTLDR  Shitty customers banging on the door  I screw up Loss prevention

shadowmanwkp,12,18,1r1q8g,63,Preface I work at a Dutch chain store where we sell a variety of things food furniture curtains cutlery and a lot more Were most wellknown for selling stuff from abroad and selling it at a reasonable price Payout may be a bit above minimum wage but my colleagues are awesome and my manager is a really great guyBeing in the Netherlands theres one thing that is even bigger than Christmas Sinterklaas If youre not in the know Sinterklaas is about the same as Christmas but with the bishop of Myra st Nicholas coming all the way from Spain to the Netherlands supported by his personal army of black petes Last saturday it was the great inception because old saint Nick would come into my town with his steam boat This being one of the biggest events in town of the year and us being in front of the square where saint Nick will be coming you can imagine that it is very busy at our store when it happensOnto the story at hand Our manager warned us before we got started that the amount of thefts is increasing these days There were about a dozen of armbands stolen from our store the other day leaving only the cartons Because we have no detection gates stealing is easy but we barely if ever have any thefts unless it is holiday season This warning stuck with me the whole day and it was a good thing it didOut of our three registers we had two open near the end of the morning we were still anticipating saint Nicks arrival in town but that would turn out to be the end of the day Just to be sure that we had enough registers open I was near the registers so I could keep an eye on the amount of customers in queue and man the third register if needed In comes the group of five tenyearolds racing past our registers and jumping onto the candy which is just before me already making me suspicious because usually people will ask us whether or not it is ok to come in through the wrong side I keep an eye on them as they enthusiastically discuss what they will buy Nearly instantly a customer waiting in line says that they probably are stealing now Im on high alert As one of them goes past the registers I see him with his hand in his pocket Immediately as he brushes past me I ask him Me Do you have anything in your pocketHe immediately removes his hand from his pocket and begins sticking them up in the airPocket kid No I dont Search me all you want I dont have anythingWell thats a response that shows a lot of guilt and makes you suspicious all the more However we dont search customers so I let him off the hook Just when I finished with pocket kid from the corner of my eye one of the kiddos has a pack of chewing gum in his hand Just as I turn fully around it is vanishedI get angry really angry even if youre young that doesnt mean that shoplifting isnt a crime so I raise my voice a little and say You there I know youve got chewing gum in your pocket so dont forget to pay for itThe kid is flabbergasted and I am on my way for my lunch break we are very strict with them on busy days I see my boss on the way and I quickly inform him about the situation He tells me he will keep an eye on the situationDuring lunch break I review my own actions towards those kids maybe theyre going to step up to their parents Maybe my boss didnt like the way I handled the situation Anyways I wanted to talk to my boss because I was doubting myself I got my grub and the lunch break end At this point there are more people in the store so we open up all the registers to be able to service all customers Along the way I inform my boss that I want to talk to him It wasnt very busy but its better to be safe than sorry so I keep working at the register I help some customers and generally have a blast workingSuddenly two girls come up to my register just barely tall enough for me to see them over the counter They are being very sweet and ask me if they could ask how much a key chain costs With a genuine smile I tell them that it will set them back around  Its a bit steep for them so they tell me they want to ask their father to pay for them I offer them to let me hang on to it so they can simply walk up to the register and pay for it when they get back they happily obligeI get on with my work and it gets a bit busier so I didnt see the girls nor their dad It takes an hour or two before one of the girls comes back with their motherMe Hello how may I help youMom Hello my daughter had interest in a key chainMe Ah yes she was here earlier and asked about the price I believe its this oneI show the key chain and the girl confirms its the oneJust when the mother wants to pull out the money she suddenly stopsMother Whats that in your pocketGirl NothingMother Come on show me whats itThe girl pulls out an I lt beer key chainMother Where did you get this fromGirl From somebodyI am a bit doubtful so I ask the mother if I could check it I dont recognize it because we sell dozens of the bloody things so I flip it over to see if I recognize the markings Lo and behold they were identical to the key chain I held onto for the girlMe Madam the markings are the same as the key chain from our storeMy boss passes by and he says in a very polite way I would never be able to pull offBoss Madam it is from our storeUsually parents do not keep their cool if they catch their kid stealing after all you taught them not to do it and they still do This woman however kept her cool and pulled it off in styleMom Now be honest with me where did you get this from  Girl From somebody in the store  Mom No thats not true we know that you got it from the store Did you take it without permissionThe girl keeps totally silent obviously embarrassed by the whole ordeal The mom waits a little bit to see if her daughter will form a response but nothing She respectfully asks her daughterMom Would you like to apologize to the mister in front of you  Girl   Mom Come on apologize  Girl Im sorry  Me Apology acceptedI feel like a moron asking this but still its an honest questionMe Madam do you still want to buy they key chain despite all this  Mother No it was a present for her because she was behaving well However because she did this I wont buy it for her  Me Thats ok I wish you a nice day anyways  Mother A good day to you as wellThe day turned out to be mediocre saint Nick came and went and we didnt have as many customers as we hoped But I didnt forget to make a talk with my boss so when we only needed two registers open I asked a colleague to man the register in my place and I asked my boss if I could talk with him in the back I make him some coffee and we begin to talkMe Well I hope you know why I wanted to talk  Boss Yeah I do  Me Well I wasnt really certain if I responded the right way towards those kids this morning Im a bit afraid that their parents might come back because I didnt really follow protocol  Boss No not at all You did the right thing Although what youve said might have been a bit direct you did overhear from the customers that those kids might have stolen something And that thing with the girl was also handled well you did great todayWell that was a load off my chestTLDR Even little kids can turn out to be shoplifters and my boss is a kickass,Shoplifting it starts as early as ten years,81,talesFromRetail,top_week
