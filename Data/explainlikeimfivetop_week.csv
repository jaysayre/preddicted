Also, there's a hot post in /r/funny that might be sending a lot of people to seek more information on the whole conflict between England and Ireland so I think it'd be nice to put it in simple terms.

That being said, I'm an American and I really have no clue what's up with the Atlantic Archipelago, although I would like to since my ancestors are Irish, Scottish, English, and Welsh. ELI5.

**EDIT:** /u/kittensandcardigans gave me a really good explanation over Skype and your comments were really useful too. I'll sum up what I think it all means based on all your explanations:

England first occupied Ireland in the 1600's. Since then there's been a ton of conflict between mostly Catholic nationalists who feel that Ireland should be controlled solely by the Irish and mostly protestant unionists who are in favor of the union between Ireland and England. The IRA originally fought for nationalist ideals against England's soldiers. In 1920 an act was passed that split the country into Northern Ireland, mostly protestant unionists, and the Republic of Ireland, mostly Catholic nationalists. At this point the IRA sort of mellowed out and other groups formed from it, like the Real IRA and the Provisional IRA. These groups still fight for Irish independence against the Ulster Volunteer Force, UVF for short, and other unionist paramilitary organizations. The Troubles were a period of increased fighting in the 70's following Bloody Sunday in 1972. Bloody Sunday occurred when a group of Catholics who were peacefully protesting for their civil-rights in Derry, a city in mainly protestant Northern Ireland, under the watch of British soldiers were massacred. Much like the Boston Massacre here in the states, shots were fired and the soldiers got a bit trigger happy and killed 26 of the protestors.

I don't even really know how to ask this without answering my own question. What actually stops a foreign country from invading and taking over a Neutral country? I've been doing a little research on what makes a country, such as Sweden, neutral during a conflict and came across this:

&gt; As long as the country is officially recognized as neutral, no country can legally form plans to invade it or use it as a base of operations.

Here's what I would be thinking if I was the General of whatever army and wanted to go in and take the Swedes' stuff: Who cares? ""Legally"" we can't invade, but what's going to happen? The U.N. is going to sanction me? 

For example, in WWII Germany invaded Denmark and Norway (both Neutral), so the Allies decided to invade and occupy Iceland (also Neutral) to better defend the Atlantic against the Nazis. From what I've come across, there were no repercussions for either side. The Allies did pay for anything they ""broke"" in Iceland, but that's far from any real consequence. If Germany had been successful on the Eastern Front and beaten Russia and Finland, they likely would have gone after Sweden (another Neutral country). Switzerland most likely only avoided invasion by the Nazis in WWII because the Swiss bankers would willingly help Nazi officers hide and store money in their country. 

Hopefully someone can enlighten me because I don't see any real reason to leave a Neutral country alone during the next world war.",ELI5: Does anything actually stop a foreign army from invading a 'Neutral' country?,55

Using Europe as an example, you can see in multiple countries, prostitution is legal, but brothels aren't.
Wouldn't brothels provide a safer and more easily government regulated environment for prostitutes to work in? I feel as if street-walking (for lack of a better word to describe it) is much more dangerous and could lead to prostitutes being kidnapped/robbed/murdered, etc. I could understand if the government wished not to regulate brothels and they could be private institutions, but it makes no sense to me that the act of prostitution would be legal, but providing safe, regulated environments for prostitutes wouldn't be.
