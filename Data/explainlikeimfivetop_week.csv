anonymous123421,80,moderator,62,1rb061,,66,"Many subreddits, especially large ones with predominantly self-post content, employ reddit's comment score hiding feature. Basically, it allows moderators to determine a fixed amount of time for the upvote counts of comments to be hidden after they are posted. The posts will still be sorted in the method that you choose (top, best, controversial, etc.), only you will not be able to see the score right away. It is not a CSS trick, so disabling CSS or using a mobile client will not allow you to see the score.

Before we decide to implement this feature, we want to know if you guys would like it. The mods are not all in favor of it, so your feedback will be very valuable. Arguments for are that it will mitigate brigading-- the best posts will still rise, but people will be less likely to mass-downvote and more likely to vote how they think they should, not how everyone else already has. Arguments against are that it is less transparent, it's inconvenient, and it's a departure from standard redditing.

But it wouldn't last more than an hour, tops. **[We have created a very quick poll (click here)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oGMIPHPLzexbtnhfdC2P4-ohzZ5NHxGxUbw9AtcQa1M/viewform)** where you can vote on whether or not you'd like it, and if you vote yes, how long you would like it. We encourage you to vote and speak your mind in the comments!

I've been driving more at night in the rain recently and its a phenomenon I've only just noticed but it baffles me.

So that makes sense, I suppose. In synchronous communication, every exchange between client and server happens in order, and the next one doesn't happen until one is completed. Right?

There are countless instances where a company is found to be at fault with the public and is legally asked/obligated to change (even though this measure in Switzerland didn't pass), but it seems that very little actually happens or comes about.

Why don't companies just admit they did something wrong and change their practices to serve people better?  Is the purpose of these laws/regulations/fines for the sake of posterity or appearance or appeasement, or is there something more to them that actually impacts change?  If not, what would impact meaningful change in the business practices of corporations?

Thanks!

In fact in all the mathematical work left by Fermat there is only one proof. Fermat proves that the area of a right triangle cannot be a square. Clearly this means that a rational triangle cannot be a rational square. In symbols, there do not exist integers x, y, z with
x2 + y2 = z2 such that xy/2 is a square. From this it is easy to deduce the n = 4 case of Fermat's theorem.

It is worth noting that at this stage it remained to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for odd primes n only. For if there were integers x, y, z with xn + yn = zn then if n = pq,

(xq)p + (yq)p = (zq)p.
