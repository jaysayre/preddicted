methamphetabean,0,1,1r94rl,1,"Just a rant.

I work at an artist's market where we sell screen printed baby clothes and T-shirts. When we print our shirts, we buy wholesale of a certain color and print about 50 shirts with the same color ink on that bunch of same colored shirts. Pretty basic concept.

Everyday somebody will ask me if we have the shirt they like in a different color or with different ink.

I don't understand why people ask me this, because if I had that color I would obviously have it out so people can buy it. I never think to ask that whenever I am at a store. It is one of the most irritating questions because people don't recognize how much labor goes into the hand printed shirts, yet they like to go to these kinds of markets so that they can feel unique and artsy...",I don't have this t-shirt in any other color than the one you are looking at.,2
nigga_fuckyocouch,1,1,1r94ai,2,"I’ve been working at a family-owned restaurant/ deli for the past few months as a counter girl (my first real “service industry job”). I fill to-go orders, run the register, take deliveries, etc.

I met Bitchface McHooker-Tits on my second or third day of the job. She seemed nice enough on one level, but as I eyed her tattooed, drugstore-hair-dye, at-home-pierced, Hot-Topic-esque vistage, I sensed that we would likely be at odds.

I first learned of Bitchface’s chronic social flakiness, then her undependability on the job, then her lying and drug use.

Background:

Bitchface claimed to be 28 years old--apparently a claim she’s been holding onto for a few years now. She claimed to be married--er, or getting married. She has kids. Wait, step-kids. Two of them. She was a lesbian, but has a husband--wait, I meant boyfriend, actually...they’re getting married in May, so fiance?

She really, really wants to have a baby but is too overweight--so says the doctor (doesn’t look **that** fat to me). She can’t carry a baby and has miscarried multiple times--including twice in one month, apparently, which might make sense since she once claimed to be having her period both the week before and the week after I had mine. She has told multiple customers she is **currently** pregnant (well, yes, she looks it) and one brought her a diaper cake (a tiered cake-shaped creation composed of unused baby diapers and ribbons), which she has left sitting in a storage closet at the store.

Maybe Bitchface claims to be undergoing multiple monthly assaults from the those dirty red communists because it gives her an excuse to disappear to the bathroom multiple times per day where she presumably snorts pills (evidenced by bloodshot, watering eyes and a fucked up expression upon exiting).

---

I will begin by describing the moment I lost all confidence in Bitchface.

I had heard that Bitchface was notoriously unreliable from comments by former and current employees, so I knew she was a flake. Her habitual lateness to work (20+ minutes was normal, 40+ minutes has happened a few times) added to the validity of aforementioned comments. A co-worker held a small dinner and I had a had a get-together of my own and BF flaked out on both.

No big deal about missing my shindig (a drop-in, BYOB), but I got to enjoy the thrill of hearing her dramatic discovery of an impromptu sleepover of her step-sons (?) and neighborhood children as she rushed home from work to prepare to away to my galla. (“I look out and nine little boys were jumping on our trampoline.”)

But whatevs, I used to work with criminals. Your lies are irrelevant to me.

The moment I became pissed, however, and disregarded this bitch was a few weeks into my training….

I’d worked a few days a week up until then and was starting to catch onto things but was still largely clueless. She was a “manager,” supposed to be charged with “training” me.

We’re getting along fine. I mention that I am super hungry (light breakfast that day). She talks about her weight problem.

Two customers come to the counter. I take one. I presume she was helping another customer because she heads off to the back of the store.

I’m helping my customer at the deli. Customer asks for an item I don’t know how to prepare. (What knife do I use? Oh, shit. ~newbie panic~)

I beg for the customer’s mercy, head off to back of store to find BF. As I scurry back there, see another customer has queued up.

Fuck, fuck, fuck.

I look downstairs, jog around--no BF.

I open the backdoor and there’s BF sitting with Kyle (a cook). BF’s smoking a cigarette and Kyle’s rolling a joint.

Look at BF like: ffuuuuuuucccckkkkkkk yyyoooooouuuuuuu.

I ask her my question. She gives me a shitty answer. I turn on my heel and go back to the front.

I finish helping my customer, help customer #2, start on #3 when comes up to take #4 who had appeared during my earlier search for BF.

Customers disperse.

“Hey,” said BF trying to make amends,”didn’t you want to go eat something.”

“No,” I said,” I don’t need food.”

Or a favor from you.",Bitchface McHooker-Tits: Intro,3
Jasonresno,2,2,1r8zpa,14,"After 5 years of slaving away at a job in retail (working my way up to management) while I studied and completed school I finally got to put my two week notice in. Some background info on where I work: We sell supplies that can be utilized for illegal purpose (hydroponic gardening supplies) and as such I have to deal with a few very particular types of customer:

1) The burnout - The guy who has no idea how to do anything but googled ""How to grow weed"" and stumbled to my store. 1000 inane questions that he''ll never let you finish before asking another one. The experience with this type of customer culminates with him asking where the nearest Taco Bell is.

2) The paranoid grower - The guy that thinks there is a cop hiding behind every shelf. Won't come in to the store if there are police nearby. Wears sunglasses, extra hoodies, parks behind the store, and will only purchase things if I agree to load it out our back exit.

3) The hippie - My favorite. They know what they're talking about and as long as you aren't prone to headaches via tyedye-pretty decent. Smelly. But decent.

4)The Caller - My least favorite. They never show their faces in the store. They never purchase anything. But they always call my store to ask us to troubleshoot their problems. These can range from 2 minute calls to 60 minute calls. We are instructed to help them no matter what. This is where our story begins.

So it's my last day of work and I've been relaxing and laughing with everybody. The phone rings.

Me (M), Customer (C).

M: Hello, this is XXXX. How can I help you?

C: Yeah. I see this product online. It's a XXX. Do you have one.

-It's not something we carry, exactly. I do have alternatives.

M: No, I'm sorry sir. We don't carry that line of products. I do have a---

C: You don't? What?

M: No, sir, we don't work with that company--

C: Seriously? You don't?

M: No, but I do have an alternative and --

C: Listen, kid, I've been buying from you guys for years. And every year you have less and less in your store. Why are you even open if you don't have what I want?

-I'm taken aback and instantly angry. I've gotten to the point where I don't react well to rude customers on the phone.

M: Due to a number of economic reasons we've focused more on products that are already popular in our market and tightening our shelves. It helps small companies like us stay competitive.

C: Really. Really? So you're telling me you just sell garbage?

-I pause in disbelief and just wait. The man is silent too.

M: Is there anything else I can help you with?

-Instantly angry he responds.

C: Apparently not since all you sell is trash. Really can you even

-And then I'm pretty much seeing red and I interrupt him. Sarcasm so thick I almost choked on it.

M: Yep. You're right sir. All we sell at my store is garbage. Nothing useful, just trash. Thanks for calling and please don't call back.

And then I hung up. Went over to my manager, explained what happened, and that was that. My boss didn't care. I'm done there. Feels good.","""So you guys pretty much only sell garbage now, right?"" or how I happily chewed out a customer on my last day of work.",16
Sapphires13,5,5,1r8o2i,26,"I work the jewelry counter at a department store.  We're a stand-alone store, and more 'low end' than some of the other department stores at the mall across town.  We don't actually sell *that much* fine jewelry.  I spend most of my shift straightening clothes and helping in layaway.   We wear radios, and the jewelry counter is near the service desk, so they just call me up when I have a customer.

Okay, so the other night, I'm closing.  I hadn't actually been there more than 10 minutes, when I get my first jerky jewelry customer.  An old lady is standing at the counter holding a ziplock bag with an old looking watch in it.  The watch has a leather band that looks like it's just disintegrated and fallen off of the watch.

My first thought is that she wants to pick out a new watch band to math the old one as closely as possible.  I can do that!  I am prepared to start showing them to her.

Nope.  She asks if I can put a band *on* the watch.

We can't.  We don't do any jewelry repairs in the store.  We don't have the tools, or the training, or the coverage.   We're 'low end', and our jewelry counter is almost an afterthought, and definitely not one of our most oft-shopped areas.

I personally would be down to *try* doing it (technically, I know how), but we're not allowed.  It's a liability issue.  And I can see why.  If an employee were to try, and then fuck up and break the item, the company would have to really kiss the customer's ass in order to dissuade any legal action.

So I explain to the woman that we sell bands, but can't install them.  She is not actually very jerky, and goes on her way.

NEXT.  I'd say this was about 20 minutes later.  I get called to the jewelry counter again.  This time there are two customers waiting.  An older woman, and a middle aged man.  They're not together, so I kind of look from one to the other to try to figure out who was first.  The man indicates for me to help the woman first.

Me:  ""Hi, what can I do for you?""  
Woman:  ""I need my watch battery changed.""  
Me:  ""Oh, I'm sorry.  We can't do that here.""  
Woman:  [sour face] ""You can't do that?""  
Me:  ""We don't have any tools to take the watch apart, and we don't install watch batteries or repair jewelry at this store.""  
Woman:  ""Since when?!  You used to!""  

Ah, the dreaded ""you used to"".  My particular store (asbestos and all, no seriously, we have a notice in our back room about how the floor tiles are made of asbestos, so don't go snorting them or anything) is forty years old.  The company has had its ups and downs, and changed in all kinds of ways over the years.  You can't expect a store to stay the same forever.  I don't know when my store *stopped* changing watch batteries but I know that it was some time before I started working there. 

Me:  ""We haven't done it since I've been working here.""
Woman:  ""Well where am I supposed to go?""
Me:  ""You'd probably have to go to a jewelry store.  I don't know if [big box superstore that we all love to hate] does it anymore either.""  
Woman:  ""You can't change my battery and you can't even tell me where I can get it done other than a jewelry store.""  
Me:  ""I'm so sorry.""
Woman:  ""You spend $30 on a watch and it runs down after a year.  What am I supposed to do, just buy a new one every year?""

I attempt to repeat that a jewelry store would be more than happy to fix her watch.  Woman is not listening, she mutters that ""this is ridiculous"" and leaves.  I turn to help the man.  

He has our weekly sales ad and is looking for a particular ring shown in it.  I start looking through the diamond ring case (which is particularly full right now), and cannot spot it anywhere.  Hmm.  I start to explain that sometimes not every store gets/sells every item shown in the ad, since the same ad is released across the whole country, but I keep looking for the ring.

And then I see my daytime jewelry coworker, who has already ended her shift, and is on her way out the door.  I flag her down and ask if we have that ring/where it is.  Bad news.  They only sent us one, and she already sold it earlier that day.  AND it's not even orderable, because it was discontinued (hence why it was on sale).  Man is not amused, and turns to leave.

The rest of my night goes fairly uneventfully.  Until almost the end.  I happen to be going by the counter, when I spotted a couple around my age (late 20s) looking at the clearance jewelry case.  So I stop and ask if they'd like to look at something.

Man:  ""Actually, I need to get a battery put in my watch.""  [he holds up a small tin, presumably containing his watch]  
Me:  ""Oh, we can't actually install watch batteries here.  We don't have any tools to do so.""  
Man:  ""But do you sell batteries?""  
Me:  ""Yes, they have some at the electronics counter.  But we can't install them for you.""  
Man:  ""Okay, thanks.""  

And then they went off toward electronics, and I went back to what I was doing.  About ten minutes later, the guy running electronics gets on the radio and asks if we have a screwdriver or something at the jewelry counter, to get the back off of a watch.

I felt like screaming.  I *just* told that guy that we couldn't do it.  Fortunately, my manager gets on the radio and says ""No, we don't.  And we can't install watch batteries here.""

But apparently this guy was adamant about not leaving the store until he got his watch battery installed.  I sat and quietly fumed while my manager and the electronics guy went back and forth talking about screwdrivers for a good 10-15 minutes.  My manager asked the woman at the service desk if there are any small screwdrivers up there.  There weren't.  And finally everybody relented and electronics guy basically told the guy the only way he was going to get a screwdriver out of us if he went to the hardware section and bought one.

**TL;DR:  No, we DO NOT install watch batteries here.  And when I tell you that we do not have the tools to do so, don't go ask the guy at electronics.**","""Do you have a screwdriver?"" - Tales from the jewelry counter.",31
phantommusic,0,5,1r8l8x,23,"So I've posted on this sub before, about when I worked at a cajun restaurant,  but this fine tale hails from my days at an accessory shop at my local mall.

At this store,  there are TONS of tiny little items (earrings, bracelets ect.) That tend to go missing pretty often, but its to be expected, as the store is so small and under staffed there is no way to keep it from happening. You know those mirrors of the ceiling that some people (idiots) think are hat mirrors? Nope. Shoplifting mirrors. And on this day I may have seen the funniest attempt at shoplifting ever. This pair of kids walk in, one looks 15, the other maybe 11, and they browse for a bit while the older one eats an ice cream cone. Well, manager and I are standing at the register and I happen to look up into one of the mirrors and see this girl hiding earrings in her ICE CREAM. I poke my manager and we can barely hold in our laughter as we call mall security. Of course when she gets caught she pretends to not speak english and begins to SCARF down that ice cream!!  He stops her, calls her mom, who comes in SCREAMING at her (in perfect english) and makes her spit out those earrings. We only got 3 out of 4 back. She can keep the last one.

TL; DR: girl hides jewelry in ice cream, becomes human earring dispenser a week later.",That looks like some yummy ice cream!,28
Fixer_,3,3,1r8gem,45,"**Background:**I work at a popular electronics/appliance store as a Computer &amp; Tablets Sales Consultant. I love my job. However, we get our fair share of nasty customers! 

Yesterday, I approached a man and did my normal greeting. Asked him how he was doing, if he had any questions on the tablets, ect. He asked me about some of the tablets and I showed him our selection. I found out the tablet would be for his wife, whose birthday is ""tomorrow"". 

*Oh boy...*  I thought.

The Nook HD+ Tablet caught his eye because of it's relatively low price ($149) for the size of the tablet. I explained to him the pros and cons of buying a Nook, but he didn't seem interested. I inquired about his wife's smartphone, and learned she had an LG android phone. I reccomended a full Android based tablet so she could easily get used to the system and carry over all of her apps. The guy basically ignored me and said ""no, I want this.""

Me: ""Alright sir, let me go make sure I have one of these in stock, as far as I know we only have a couple of the 32 GB models left, which are about $30 dollars more. In the mean time you can look at a few of the cases, ect.""

He said something along the lines of ""Well you BETTER have it! Otherwise you can give me the display.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, these display tablets are demo models, and do not have the full functionality of the real ones.""

At this point he just gave me a really bizarre/ confused look. 

I head to the lock up cages and to my expectations, we are out of the 16 GB model. But, being the incredible employee that I am, I go above and beyond to check the stock of local stores. 

None. 

Every store on this side of the state is out. I check to see if we can order it in from one of our various ordering/ reserving systems. 

Negative. The item is deleted, which means we won't be getting any more in. 

I return to the man with the bad news, and offer to show him some of the other, comparable tablets or to get him the 32GB model. He becomes aggressive instantly.

""If you don't have any why is it out on display! I want this one! I need it for my wife.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, but we just recently sold out of them and are waiting on a vendor to take the display down, besides, we still have the 32GB model. ""

Man: ""Well you better give me the 32 for this price! I'm not paying any extra!""

At this point i offer to go get my supervisor, and the man accepts. I call my supervisor up the front and give him the rundown. At this point I don't interact with the customer again. Apparently, my supervisor went up to him and restated everything I said. He (Being the awesome supervisor he is) refused to give the man the item for the cheaper price, saying ""Sir, it's mid November, we cannot possibly keep stock of everything that we have on display.

According to my Sup, the man said nothing but ""I'll be back."" and walked out of the store. 

I'm not sure when he will be back, but I hope he isn't as big of an asshole next time!","""I'll be back!""",48

My knee-jerk reaction whenever I see one of those is to fawn over the baby inside it, so I automatically say, ""oh how cute is that little ba--"", stopping myself mid sentence, because as she got closer, I noticed that the baby had fur. ""M'am, is that... Your dog?"" I asked, because we aren't allowed to have pets in the store, although I am not sure that rule applies when the dog is in a baby carrier.

Cosmic_Hitchhiker,86,72,1r82al,399,"So, as you may know, thanksgiving is next week Thursday. In traditional style many people are buying their frozen turkeys in hopes that they will thaw by next tursday and of course, stores have begun handing out coupons that will alter the price/pound for said turkeys.

unmined,22,42,1r807f,89,"&gt;*NOTE: series title change*, since I'm rotating stories from a couple different places now. Comment if you have title suggestions.


Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

- - -

**Today is groceries (two days in a row!); Shall we begin?**

Imagine unmined at age 16.  Wow, is that kid awkward and insecure.  He wants desperately to be cool. He’s got a job now, and a total piece of shit car; even a little walking-around money after his few meager bills are paid …

Enough third person. Barf. But yes, life is starting to come together a little bit. The only thing missing is a girlfriend. Finding one has been difficult. On the few occasions I managed to work up the courage to ask a girl on a date, I was rejected. And do you know what is NOT helping? My work uniform. Black slacks, white button-up, red apron, and a black clip-on bow tie. I look like a butler than go dressed in the dark, so he accidentally took his kid’s church bow tie and his wife’s apron.

It is the day before my junior year of high school starts (grade 11) and I’m bagging groceries. It’s Labor Day, so I’m constantly confronted with happy people buying food for cook-outs and beer for, well, cook outs. I desperately do not want to be here.

A small order begins its crawl down the belt toward me (side note, I believe there is a correlation between the number of feet of conveyor belts at any location and their effect on wages). Anyhow, I start loading up bags, when I hear my name.

“Hey, are you unmined?”

I look up and see that a customer is talking to me. She’s my age. Pretty. Really long brown straight hair. Deep brown eyes that seemed a touch larger than life, like a westerner depicted in anime. Not tall, but note short. And she gave off just the slightest scent of coconut, undoubted from an earlier application of sunblock.

“Yeah?” Smooth. The first time someone my age has every started a conversation with me at the store, and “yeah” is all I can manage.

“I’m Elizabeth. I go to school with a couple of your friends at [other high school in the area].”

“That’s cool.” I have no idea who she is talking about, but I learn later it was a good friend I’ve known since elementary school.
“You working all day today?”

“Yeah. It kinda sucks since we go back tomorrow.”

“Bummer. We’re having a pool party. You could have come.”

Now I’m really depressed. Pool party with cute girl who voluntarily talks to me, and I’m here. I get wrapped up with another irritation that I forget I’m totally scared of talking to girls.

“I wish I could. I hope you’re having a good time.”

“It’s good. My parent are there, but they are staying out of the way.”

“Well, maybe we can do something next week.” Oh shit, did that just come out of my mouth? Not only to cute stranger girl, but in front of my fellow employees who may or may not be listening?

“Totally. You have a pen?”

Yes. Yes I do. I pluck one from my pocket and hand it to her. I’m both elated, and suspicious. This does not happen to me. Ever. Murphy’s Law looms in my mind, so I half-expect to be stabbed in the next with the pen.

Instead, she writes her name on number on a paper bag and hands it to me.

“Call me. We’ll set something up.”

“Great, thanks!”

“See you later!” She takes her bags and leaves the store.

I sneak back to the break room and sit for a few minutes. I want to hyperventilate. My mind resolves to thinking it’s all going to lead to disappointment.

My name is called over the PA in an obvious attempt to get me back to work. So I head to the front of the store and bag away.

It takes me two days to build-up the courage to call her. She agrees to dinner and a movie on Friday. I get someone at work to cover my shift. I’m feeling more-and-more like this is going to happen.

That Friday may have been the slowest day to arrive in my life. But the evening rolls around, and I get ready for the date. I’m so nervous that I sneak a half of Xanax from my mom’s stash (don’t do drugs kids). It takes the edge off, so I head out to pick up my date.

When she answers the door, she’s just a pretty as I remember her.

Our conversations over the course of these evening are a blur. Yet they were unforced and natural. Very few awkward silences. Not at all what I expected.

In the dark of the movie theater, I reached out and held her hand. She gladly took it and leaned into my shoulder. Thankfully, the movie still had an hour to go, because I would not have been able to stand at that moment.

When I pulled up to her house at the end of the evening, she said “I’m bummed. This went by took quickly.”

“It has,” I said.

My heart was hammering. I could barely hear over the racket it was making in my chest. The rest of my body felt like I was being propelled into her.

On instinct, I reached out and stroked her hair. I pulled her in and kissed her.

My first kiss.

Over the next two years, Elizabeth would play various parts in my life. First girlfriend. First homecoming date, first break-up, first reconciliation. Another break-up or two. Even the first friend I saw drive off to college in another state.

Elizabeth is now long gone. I think back on her with equal parts of affection and sadness. But I will never regret the time we had together.

So, TFR … next week is Thanksgiving here in America. I thought I’d give the day an homage by noting that even shit jobs can sometimes bring a small measure of joy, even if it’s indirect. Bagging groceries brought me Elizabeth. She in turn opened up a world I never had access to. The job is gone, and so is the girl, but both their good and bad are part of who I am now.

Have a great weekend!

I’ll get back to wild lobsters and shit-bombed restrooms next week.","”Bag Boy Encounters Beauty on Checkstand 2” or, Will unmined Grow a Pair and Ask a Girl Out on a Date? - Tales from unmined's Crazy Town",131
AAEmmerson,64,64,1r7jes,485,"Okay so I used to work in a little coffee and sandwich shop in a British airport. It was past security clearance, so only those flying could attend. When I got the job I thought i'd be dealing with lots of happy people going on holiday. Boy was I wrong.

The story that really sticks in mind though is that we used to serve ""bacon mezzaluna's"" Which is a weird half moon flat bread a bit like a taco shape. They were about £4 ($6.50) but that's because they were good quality, and you were a captured audience with no where else to go. 

So one day a guy came up, and he asked me to grill 4 of these sandwiches, he's tall, like really tall. So I do him the 4 and start plating them on his tray he's waiting for. So 3 in he picks one up and goes ""errr what's this inside"" - I reply ""it's a sunblushed tomato sauce sir"" trying to be as polite as possible ""Well you didn't tell me it had that in I don't want these anymore"" I apologise and take them off his tray, but I do point to at least 3 signs with descriptions of exactly what they are.

At this point I've put them on the back counter ready to be binned as we can't serve them again, and I ring up his order -  and put the sandwiches in bin. Just as he sees me do that, he goes ""actually you know what I will have three"", so inwardly sighing I cook him another 3 off.  

Get them all plated ring them up, he then decides ""actually I only want two"" so I can't take it off the order without my manager, so I shout for him, he's this little Indian dude, quiet as a mouse, and only 5ft 3 and explain to him the problem. Turns out he'd been listening in the whole time, when the customer starts getting shirty about the time it's taken my manager lets rip

""Do you know how many of these sandwiches you have now wasted, you are ridiculous, and you shouldn't be rude to my staff, new policy, you ether pay for ALL 7 sandwiches, or you leave my cafe"" 

With this the guy looks fairly shocked, but starts shouting back, and starts causing a commotion, so everyone in the airport is looking at him. When the guy finally calls my boss a ""fucking useless piece of shit"" without breaking stride my manger jumps over the counter, and marches straight over to the security team. 

The guy is still hollering and screaming at my manager from the spot when the security team arrives and literally drag him out of the secure area with his poor family in tow and have him thrown off his flight. No idea where he was going - but was never so proud of my manager at that point. All for a bacon sandwich.

themonkeyone,33,40,1r7frc,213,"So, I am not sure if this belong is this sub or not, but I feel the need to include it.  This incident recalls the moment I finally decided to quit my old job, and find a new one.

So here is the set up.  I have worked as a maintenance associate (which is just a fancy word for janitor)  for this large retail store for 2 years now.  I completely hate my job, it makes me miserable, the people I work with annoy me, the managers don't care about me as an employee, and the customers hate me, since I am keeping them from using the bathroom while I try to clean them twice during my shift.  Now most people just ignore my sign telling them to not use the restroom while it is being cleaned, and there is a second restroom in the back.  It is annoying, but oh well.  However, on this day, it was a much different type of customer.

This happened on a Tuesday.  I remember this because Tuesdays that quarter were when I had to go straight from my college classes to work.  School that day had already annoyed me, and left me in a bad mood, and work was not helping.  I start my day with the usual routine, cleaning the restrooms.  Now this day, like most others, someone decides to ignore my signs, and come in anyways.  However, this guy is different then most guys, as the entire time he is ranting about how unfair it is that I am trying to keep him from using the bathroom, how much I suck, how stupid I am, ect. ect. all while he is using the toilet.  I try to ignore it, it comes with the job after all.  He finally finishes, and I go to clean the stall he was using, only to hear him remark, ""now you have a real mess to clean up""  I llok into the stall to see that this guy has wiped his feces all over the toilet seat.  he continues to mock me about it while he washes his hands, and I just stand there, in disbelief, which start turning into rage.  Like the title says.  I was very sorely tempted to beat this guy over the head with my mop handle.  It passed quickly, however, I just stood in the bathroom for a good 5-10 minutes trying to figure out why I just did not walk out at that very moment.  

After that day, I started looking for a new job.  Which I found, and am much happier at for the most part.  Sure, I still have stupid customers, and stupid coworkers, but I am doing something I love, so it is worth it.

I've also been thinking about the random acts of yada yada stuff...

So, I want to ask: In my everyday interactions with the checkout people, what can I do to make their day a little brighter?

* What can I say that will make their day?
* How can I be friendly without seeming strange?

And, when doing this, 
* What if they're busy - how can I avoid just holding up the queue?
* How should I react when the salesperson seems to be just on autopilot?

In summary, I'll repeat again: what can I do to make their day a little brighter?

kwinbot,83,186,1r7923,868,"Little backstory first: I was in a car accident in august, and even after insurance and taking care of everything, the woman driving the car I hit still bothers me. Unfortunately, she lives in the town that I work in, because I work in one of the highest traffic and demographic malls in my state.

SO. The first time she showed up was when I was working two jobs at the mall, so I spent a lot of time there. I was in the back stocking shoes, when my manager comes back and says a customer is asking for me out front. Mind you, I never told this woman where I worked so I definitely didn't expect her to show up. So I walk out onto the floor and it's crazy bitch. I'll call her C.B. for short

CB: You said you would pay cash to get my car fixed

Kwinbot: Uh. I don't really think this is the pla...

CB: I don't care! I'm here, and this needs figured out.

Kwinbot: Well give me your insurance number blahblahblah and we're done

So she leaves and I call insurance and everything was...you know...done.

Until she gets my cell phone number from my job. Which shouldn't have happened. But it did.

And she kept talking to my managers. And calling my phone. So I got a no-contact order and a restraining order on her for harassment.

So she decides to show up at my OTHER job, where I am a manager. We pierce ears, and the station is at the front, so I spend a lot of my time by the window. It's a busy sunday, when I see CB walking by. She sees me, and enters the store. I finish the ear piercing, and am walking around helping customers when my associate calls me to the register.

CB: I want you to pay for my stuff.

Kwinbot: I can't do that ma'am, and you can't be here unless YOU are making a purchase.

CB: This is a public place, I can do whatever I want.

Kwinbot: Ma'am, if you don't leave me and my associates alone, we'll call security.

CB then proceeds to throw a FIT, yelling, threatening to call corporate, threatening to wreck into my car, (after getting hers repaired from the aforementioned accident,) and all kinds of nonsense.

So I call security to find out CB has been banned from the ENTIRE MALL on multiple occasions, and she's arrested for trespassing and violating a restraining order.

Foliagus,25,26,1r761t,113,"Hey guys, long time reader, first time poster, etc.

I work for a lovely little retail store north of the border, we sell drugs, make-up, and of course, the fun things: electronics.

I just had a customer today that made me walk away for the first time, and I thought that maybe you'd appreciate what I did, and maybe you could learn how to deal with this kind've thing.  

So Angry Lady comes in (AL), about five pm, asking if we price-match.  From the way she was asking, she obviously knew we did indeed price-match other competitors, and I'd definitely seen her in the store before.  

Me: Absolutely miss, did you want me to see if I have something in stock for you?

AL: Yes, your Samsung 32 smart tv, It's on for 328 at *Lamewad other store on the other side of town*.

Me: Ok, well I'll just pull it up on our website here, and print off the price for you, one second.

Now, our computers are running a windows so old, well, I guess I'm not funny enough for some comparive humour.  Our computers are old, and clunky, and take long periods of time in-between inputs, just to decide if they like the way you clicked something.

As we're loading through the Lamewad website, they list no television fitting the criteria.  This is after five minutes of ""Oh my god, I went through this last time, you guys are terrible.""

 I show her the other Samsung 32, the non-smart version going for 328 on their website, and she angrily just says ""no"", before insisting I open Lamewad's flyer.

I gladly open the flyer, finding indeed, the same television, without smart, advertised for 328.  I point this out, again, I get a ""No!"", before AL points above the tv, at a different model, (An LG), and says ""THAT tv.  That one's smart""

Well, I point out that the television is listed at 348, and that we don't actually carry LG.

This puts her into a silent anger, and she just turns and walks away.  I, as mandated by my company, say ""Have a nice evening!"", before forgetting about the whole thing...


CUE many hours later, about 9 pm, when we get called to go outside.  Now, when this happens, it's because our LP (Loss Prevention Security Officer) has pursued somebody out of the store, and we're to go outside and just stand there, for visual support.  

Getting outside after everybody, I find LP on top of a girl screaming and yelling to her friend, telling her friend to take her stuff, while LP yells not to let her take it, and sure enough, one of our staff goes and grabs the little pink box from the girl's purse, and holds onto it for LP.  Now, after some minutes, we've got a large van coming.  

LP is in the middle of our little road, but he can't move this girl, she's flailing and screaming, not letting him cuff her. Anyway, Large Van drives right up to about 5 feet away, from about 12 employees all standing in full white shirt and tie, and honks her horn repeatedly.  Our manager proceeds to hold up her hand, asking the van to wait, or to just turn left and go around.  

Who gets out of the van but AL.  ""GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER, YOU ASSHOLE, ARE YOU TRYING TO RAPE HER?  SOMEBODY STOP HER, YOU ***employees***!!""

At this, our manager tells everybody else but her and LP to go inside, the police are now audible, coming in a very fast way.  

We all do, and sure enough, coming in 30 seconds after myself, is AL.

""I found the ad, now you HAVE to price match.""

She indeed whips out a printed ad from a competitor, and I start processing the paperwork.  During this, I notice our inventory is out one, so I don't actually have a boxed unit for sale. 

I let her know this, and she does that LOVELY derisive chuckle: ""Man, you guys really have no idea what you're doing, the last time you couldn't find my tv either.""

To this, I apologize, let her know that's unfortunate, but that I'd be happy to get a tv in, within a few days, after purchase. 

So, at this point, as I'm walking away, grabbing more paperwork, I ask Awesome Coworker (AC) if she's able to intercede.  I'm starting to get hot under the collar, and I want to distance myself.

AC replies that she'd be happy to, so as we both walk back to AL, I hear AL talking to another customer in our store: ""Oh god, you should've seen it, he had his hands all over her, it was brutal.  God, I don't know if I'll shop her again, their security seems so violent, etc. etc.""

I shrug it off, but it stings a bit.  Our LP is a contracted service, they're not a part of our company, and they're some of the nicest guys I've ever met.  The one in particular is a little 5'6 guy, he's new, and he's got a lisp.  Now, because they don't work for our company, this means we've never had to worry about them reporting us to managers or such, so any strictly ""non-corporate"" actions go over easy.  Nice guys, I play video games with quite a few of them.

Anyway, so at the till, just as I'm clearing everything for AC, miss AL turns to me, and stares me down as she says ""I hope you feel safe here, and I hope the police watch the video on your cameras, your LP was completely out've line and violent.""

I was done now.  I didn't respond.  AC saw, and she immediately said ""Oh Foliagus, would you like to go speak with COMPUTERS EMPLOYEE, he said he wanted to see you""

I nod, say ""Enjoy your evening, miss"", and walk away.


I hid until she was gone, and I was commended for the calm manner I showed in the face of what I found out is a disreputable, repeating customer.  Thank god for my coworkers, she was just poking me, over and over again.

Anyway, so I find out later, the girl outside?  Crack dealer.  The little pink box?  Full of crack and needles.  She was so crazy because she was desperately trying to get her friend to pick up the evidence before the cops arrived.

genericname11,27,35,1r72se,239,"I work at a supermarket that has an electronics department, toys, cosmetics, food, etc. On this particular day I am walking from the front of the store to the back along one of the main aisles, which runs parallel to the toy department. I see a lady standing at the end of one of the toy aisles, just staring like she's expecting someone. So whatever, not my department, but I'm in a good mood so I go over and proceed to see if she needs anything.



**Me:**  ""Did you need help with anything?""

**Lady:**  ""Yeah I have a question about the Leapfrogs.""



She takes me over to them and starts asking questions about if the older cartridges work with the newer system. I have no idea, and continually tell her it's not my department and I'll go grab someone that knows. She ignores this and keeps rambling on. Finally I grab one of the boxes and look at the back.


**Me:**  ""Well from the back it looks like the newer system only works with the newer cartridges, not the older ones.""

**Customer:**  ""So and so told me the new one works with ALL the cartridges. Are you telling me she was WRONG?""



Not wanting to conflict with whatever this lady was told, I again told her I would get someone from the toy department to help her, and she obliged. I told her to wait there and I would call them. I went and grabbed a store phone and called the guy in the toy department a lady needed help in the Leapfrog aisle and starting heading back to the back.

As I'm about half way down the main aisle, I run into the lady again in a different department.



**Me:**  ""I called my coworker and he said he'd meet you in the Leapfrog aisle""

**Lady:**  ""Oh.. I walked away...""



We go back to the aisle to find another customer looking at the toys. She indicates to the lady that my coworker had come looking for her and left when he couldn't find her.



**Me:**  ""No problem, I'll just call him back.""

**Lady:**  ""No, don't bother. I guess I'm not important."" And she walks off.



Lesson? If someone is supposed to come help you, don't freaking walk away so they can't find you.

partinobodycular,14,6,1r701h,33,"I'm an assistant manager at a shoe store with a free rewards program. You get 10 points for every dollar you spend, and every 1500 points gets you a $10 off certificate. One of my associates, A, had just signed up a customer who was leaving the country the next day and I guess wanted to take shoes for everyone back home. The customer ended up spending about $800. Normally, the points are added to the account when we close the registers at the end of the day, and it can take a couple of weeks to actually see your certificate. But since this girl was leaving, I did some quick math and gave her $50 off. After she left, I pulled A aside to show her how to fill out a points adjustment form so we could email customer service and say, ""Hey, we already honored a bunch of these points, so you can deduct them."" A is fairly new - I think she started in September? She was kind of a slow learner but is pretty good now. Most of the time.

Part of the form is to explain how many points need to be added/deducted, and why, so I asked out loud how many points would get you $50 off. I could have figured it out in my head, but hey, ~~this was a teaching moment~~ I was lazy and wanted to see if A could figure it out so I wouldn't have to. Turns out, she didn't know how many points it takes to get a certificate. Okay... this is kind of Rewards 101. I ask a few more questions to see what she *does* know. Turns out, she also doesn't know details about how points are earned. This is really basic stuff. Any customer could ask her these questions at any time. So I give her a quick rundown, and then toss an easy one her way.

""How many dollars do you have to spend to get 1500 points?"" She doesn't know. I'm getting frustrated, so I grab some paper and write it down, thinking that'll help her see how simple it is. 10 points per dollar, how many dollars for 1500 points? All you have to do is divide 1500 by 10, but A can't do it. She's starting to get a blank look, and I realize I need to back off; I believe she has the capability to solve this question, but she's shutting down. I feed her the numbers she absolutely needs to know, and let her go.

A few minutes later, it's time for A's fifteen, so I look around to see where she's gone to. I don't see her on the floor. I'm starting to get a bad feeling. I ask her friend, C, if she knows where A is, and C says she's in the bathroom. Something about the way she says it makes me think this is not a call of nature. I started worrying that I had been too harsh, and that A was now crying in the bathroom. I'd never made an associate cry before. I watch for A to come back out onto the floor, and the longer I wait, the worse I'm feeling. Finally I see her come out, and she looks composed. I wait a minute to give her some space - I don't want to pounce on her the minute she comes back out - and then head over to see if she's okay and tell her to go on her fifteen. She says she's already gone, so I guess she decided to take advantage of her break to settle down. Fair enough, though I would have given her time to calm down before taking her break. She mentions that she felt too much pressure, and then says that B, the main cashier, had laughed at her. This is kind of unsurprising, B is one of our biggest troublemakers. I have plenty of other stories to tell about B, but I'll save them for another night.

albinosquirel,24,20,1r6unw,131,"Disclaimer: The following post will probably be disgusting.

Today at work, my coworker alerted me to a problem in the men's bathroom. I had already cleaned it so I sighed and asked him what was wrong.

Someone had taken a dump and left it in the toilet bowl. The men's room smelled horrible.  

I went to investigate.

""Why wouldn't they flush?"" I asked myself, sighing.

Hindsight is 20/20 and I have determined that the guilty party had probably, in fact flushed.  

My brave coworker and I marched to the bathroom.  
I held my nostrils closed and flushed.
Nothing.

It won't budge.

My coworker tried flushing.

Nothing.  

I ran from the room, gagging.

The poop was the consistency of glue. It wasn't going anywhere.
It had plans of sticking around for a long, long time.

My coworker suggested pouring bleach on it to facilitate the flushing process.

I ran for the cleaning supplies.

In the meantime my coworker decided to record a video on his phone showing the flushing process and lack of progress.

He said he was going to upload it on youtube.
He was going to title it ""It won't go down.""

I poured a fuckton of bleach on the offending turd.
It started to disintegrate into a million pieces of stinky disgusting turd.  I repeated the bleach pouring and flushing remedy to no avail.  Maybe, I thought, maybe I'll let it set for a while so the bleach can really soak in there.

I made a sign. Out of order. Please use women's restroom.
Sorry!  I taped it to the door.

Did I mention I sprayed a ton of air freshener??

I think we should like, poke it with a stick, I told my coworker.

That's disgusting, he replied. 

Yes, yes it is, I thought.

Somehow I've gotta clean this thing.

I googled ""poop won't flush"" but did not come up with a cure-all solution.  I started looking for something to poke the poo with.  Eventually after half a gallon of bleach and 20 flushes the poop finally SLID down the hole.
It left the hugest shitstained bowl I've ever seen.

So I do internet sales, hense the throw-away, as I like keeping a fairly professional front when using my business name. Plus even despite a situation like this, I hate hurting peoples feelings. Whether they ""deserve"" it or not is up to you, but I simply don't want to insult people. However someone has made me so angry that I simply need to vent to you all. This sub has been my favorite for a veryyy long time, and hopefully some of you will be able to relate with dealing with morons like this.

So as I said, I do internet sales. I make things and sell them online, occasionally, I hire on help if they're particularly good at mimicking my style of what I do (it gets stuff done faster, and why not? )

A.N. applies to work for me during the holiday season. I looked at his portfolio and it was just... well. to put it bluntly - awful. Imagine those people who draw stick people and post them EVERYWHERE, and then get mad at whoever tries to give them helpful advice on how to grow into a better artist. Now add this to someone who clearly has just learned how to use a sewing machine. Yep. It was that bad.  

Now, as I said before, I HATE hurting people's feelings... So I let A.N. down as softly as possible, explaining that I was looking for someone who had a certain style to their work and his just wasn't what I was looking for. 
A.N. didn't like my response, and continued to blow up my inbox for the past two weeks (TWO. WEEKS.) demanding why I didn't hire him on, how it is silly to not hire him, and saying it didn't matter in the long wrong, X person would hire him anyway but still WHY DIDNT YOU HIRE ME?! 

I don't know what it is about the internet that makes people think acting this way is appropriate, however I continued to keep my cool and just explain to him that I looked for a very distinct style for my goods, and that he simply didn't portray it in his portfolio. 

A.N. DEFINITELY didn't like that response. ""I can change!"" he even said in one email. Saying he would re-create my art for a while to ""get the hang of my style"" 

Oh. Hell. No. 

I was to the point of writing, deleting, re-writing, re-deleting emails because this guy just would NOT get the hint - that I was not at all interested in having him work for me. Plus his ""recreating my art"" did not give him cookie points. As a matter of fact, it made me not want to hire him all the more. Imagine someone tracing your art just to ""get your style"", that's how I felt about it. Never mind his completely unprofessional personality he'd been showing me since his non-hiring. 

I continuesly, for two weeks, told him thank you for your time, but I just don't think he and I are a great fit for working together, and if he liked X-persons work, I gave him all the luck in the world working for them. 

Then, on Monday, he started getting very cruel toward me. 

You know neggers? The people who will put someone down just to try to date them? Yeah. He started pulling things like that.

""You're just jealous of any artist who might be better than yours!"" He spouted. ""You would  have been LUCKY to  have someone like me. Too bad you fucked that up!"" 
More emails entailing how stupid I was for not hiring him, to how fat and ugly I was (what this has to do with my art, I'll never know.), to how much better all these other artists are so he'll go work for them... 

Readers, I tried my hardest to be patient with him. I never demeaned his work, I never called him names, I simply stated why I wouldn't be hiring him this season and went about my way. But then when he started blatantly harassing me, I had had enough. 

I told him that I would be blocking him, and please never contact me for work ever again. I also told him I'd be forwarding our conversation to the fellow artists I know who hire on assistants during busy season. 

His response then was ""LOL, stop over-reacting. God I was just joking.""

Toni-Cipriani,9,3,1r6mbw,28,"This isn't so much a tale as it is something I've been curious to hear some other opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of chain vs independent 

I work for a small independent corner/liquor store but the owner and his brothers have a few other small grocery stores and liquor shops in the area.

I have worked for retail chains too, namely a major electronic retailer in the US and a major drug store chain.  

Some pros I've been noticing are that working for an independent store:

-Much more laid back on certain things, have to look presentable but otherwise I can wear what I please. Certain customers who the owner has known for awhile have ""tabs"" when they are short on money

-Smaller obviously so alot less customers in the store at once which makes it alot less stressful. 

-I tend to find the atmosphere more pleasant I try my best to go above and beyond, but it's more of a social and friendly vibe with workers and customers. Don't have to worry about things like returns, etc

-I  get to know customers on a more personal basis since alot of the same people frequent the shop. 

-I get paid in cash weekly instead of a check every two weeks.


A few cons I've picked up on:




-The owner is a bit cheap when it comes to certain things like a leak in the back cooler which his solution for is a bucket  which needs to be emptied every 2 days pretty much

-No benefits like health coverage or anything

-No holidays off, only 4 people work in the store other than the manager and owner so the hours are pretty set in stone.

-Realistically speaking I probably have alot less job security,  I have a  really positive relationship with both the manager and owner and feel I'm well liked but I ever made a huge mistake that made them really upset or even if they decided they wanted to cut down on people working for them I very well could get let go instantly. 

My work doesn't have things like ""write ups"" it's what the owner wants at the end of the day. 

-This is hypothetical since I get along well with everyone at the shop, but if I was having a problem with someone else working there especially those who have been working there longer than I have. I'd probably have to either ignore it or leave, people close to the owner are essentially untouchable I'd imagine.

 Most retail chains if they are under good management would likely try to take some sort of action for conflict mediation I would hope. ",Pros and cons for working in a small local business over a retail chain?,31

There’s a symphony of light, the color blue, and the beeping of checkout scanners ablaze. In its midst, there’s me-and this very ornery customer. Welcome to the front end of ***-mart. 

The trouble starts when she announces she’s purchasing medicines for her church. She looks about eighteen, so I have to card her for the Nyquil. That was a fun conversation.

She wants to pay with a check. Nobody ever pays with a check anymore. So I have her fill it out and by some miracle, find the correct feed slot.

I call for help-I put the check wrong side up. I apologize.  I hear the customer swear.

I give her the receipt and she stomps off, complaining that I didn’t double bag her stuff. I’m behind now, so I practically scream a greeting/apology at the next customer. 

“Do you want this in a separate bag?” I ask, and point to the whole, dripping, chicken.

 No response. Nice. I just do it anyway. 

I finish scanning the items, press “Total” and look up at the customer, asking for their payment.

He’s blind. He has those glasses and a white cane. Holy sh*t.

“Sometimes you’ve got to appreciate the small things,” she says by way of apology.

N overhears from the back room, comes to the counter and tells A to assist the other customers as she will handle this person.

N: Excuse me, you are being extremely rude to A and I will not tolerate it, if you cannot behave, you need to leave the shop.

EC: I was in the middle of an important phone call and A interrupted me!

N: Then perhaps do not come in here if you need to make a phone call.

and thus began the ban on customers using mobile phones in our shop. There were only 2 caveats: if you had a genuine emergency or if it was a call related to a purchase.

It was heavily enforced to the point that the regular customers would become scared of their phones ringing in the shop, apologise and run outside in shame.

Newer customers took some getting used to the idea and occasionally, some would get pissed off and complain.

At this store, I do everything from cashiering to maintenance to retrieving carts. A few years ago, one kid got hit by a car and broke a few bones, so now everyone has to wear orange visibility vests/coats when they go outside, which I thought was stupid when I started. 

It didn't take me long to learn, and I've been nearly hit pretty much every time I go outside, mostly by suburban soccer moms in minivans and SUVs simultaneously backing out of their space, talking on their phone, and drinking coffee. I swear they're aiming for me. However, the closest I've come to getting hit was by a woman who was a manager of a different department. 

She left work, jumped in her car, and backed up quickly almost running me, a customer walking out of the store, and the customer's son who couldn't have been more than 6. The customer keeps walking, but I recognized the woman. I stood in front of her car and proceeded to give her a lecture about how she should know better, she works at the store full time and knows how busy the lot is. I wasn't exactly polite, but I wasn't unnecessarily rude, I stuck to the related issues. 

When I saw her the next day at work I was a bit nervous, technically she's in another department, but she's been there like 20 years so I'm sure she could have me fired. However, she was actually very mature about the whole thing. She apologized again and thanked me for the warning, saying she had gotten too comfortable with the lot and hadn't realized it.

biohzrd451,11,8,1r61h1,55,"Hello there first time poster long time reader. This is going back to the summer of 2001 when I was pulling a stint in a Mom and Pop pizza joint in a small town.

There were many interesting customers but none stand out more than Wing guy. See wing guy would call everyday and you can probably guess order wings... not just a dozen wings... no he would order 3 dozen wings, and the kicker is they all had to be drumsticks and he would sit in the lobby and count every single one of them to make sure he had 3 dozen.

This probably went on for about a week, and finally my manager Mr. Dan (Imagine a really overweight Elvis Presley) told me we couldn't let him have just drumsticks anymore. Like clockwork he called in his order.

WG: Yeah I would like to order 3 doz Wings all Drum Sticks please.

Me: Sorry sir I am only allowed to give you the normal mix of wings.

WG: But I have always gotten them before, why can't I now?

Me: Sir other people enjoy them as well, only so many come in a bag, if I give them all to you there wont be any left for anyone else.

WG: Fine whatever.

Now you would think that was the end of it... oh no I wouldn't be posting on here if it ended there. So WG shows up about 45 mins later pays for his order and I hand him his 3 boxes of wings, which he opened began counting and them screamed about how I only put a few drum sticks in his box. I mean the dude threw a full on temper tantrum and slung his boxes across the counter making a huge mess.

Mr Dan having witnessed the tantrum tells the guy he has to leave or he would be made to leave (I should note he was holding the pizza cutter) WG finally comes to his senses and leaves... leaving me a huge mess but also a doz wings that escaped unscathed... sweet.

ixiduffixi,4,2,1r5xvj,18,"So I was reading through another user's lot stories today and was reminded of one of my own. 

In my teenage years, my first job was working for the ""blue vest mafia."" My job description was something along the lines of ""Customer Service Specialist,"" which amounted to cart pusher, cashier, stockman, and basic maintenance. Eventually I also took up duties as an overnight unloader. This tale involves one of those nights. 

When I worked on unloading my shift started at 3 p.m. We would unloaded trucks piece by piece and any pallets of merchandise was left on the truck to be unloaded later and moved to an attached warehouse. The typical protocol was to have one unloader use a pallet lift to move the merch to the outside dock where it would be taken by the Forktruck driver, and driven around the building to the warehouse. There another employee would be waiting with another pallet lift to move them inside. The reason for this is the warehouse entrance was also on the store entrance's sidewalk. This meant that during these times one or two parking spots would be blocked off using upturned shopping carts so that the forktruck could reach the warehouse door. This most commonly took place during store hours. (Not all of them are 24hrs.) Any way on to the story.

One day I had the responsibility of moving the pallets off of the truck and on to the back dock. This had been going smoothly for the better part of an hour. Then the forktruck didn't return. I stood waiting at the back dock for almost half an hour and eventually decided to go see if there was any help needed in the warehouse. When I got around I found the forktruck parked in the middle of the lot with no driver in sight. I went to the warehouse entrance and found a crushed shopping cart lying on its side in one of the unused parking spots we had marked off. The warehouse was locked and no one was around so I went back inside to find where everyone had gone. I found my direct manager and my coworker standing at the front desk with the store manager and a very angry customer. They had apparently been talking for quite some time, because by the time I got there the conversation was already ending and the manager escorted the customer to the back office. When I asked what happened, my coworker got very, very upset. To the point of cursing in the middle of the checkout area. 

What had happened was that the customer had intentionally ran through the shopping cart blockade while my coworker was there trying to wave him down. The customer had driven into the cart so hard it had actually thrown it up over the sidewalk and through the warehouse entrance. Then he started claiming that it was our faults and the company was going to pay for it. I found out later that they had and we had to change the unloading policies to only operate the forktruck after store hours.

**BONUS STORY**

Another tale of the blue vest mafia. 

One night I entered the restroom and saw a young man slowly washing his hands in the sink, giggling, while his friend was in the stall also giggling. I took my time using the restroom, waiting them out, which eventually worked. While I waited I heard packages being ripped open and plastic being shoved into something. 

After they left I entered the stall and found open packages for cold remedies, sinus medication, and dvds. I called the store manager and he looked on the security cameras. The kids took off in a dead sprint as soon as they left the bathroom and didn't stop until they were well outside. We called the police and the officer stated that he actually knew one of the kids.

blackaurora,18,45,1r5trc,255,"This isn't about an unhappy customer, or a lazy coworker, or a bad manager. This is a story about pure, unadulterated, stupid. You might think I'm making this up, or exaggerating, but any of you fellow retail workers will know better.

Two customers (presumably boyfriend and girlfriend) show up and start looking at a specific service of prepaid phones. They look at the one for $30, and then ask me where the one for $20 is. That's strike one. The $20 phone is the one immediately next to the $30 one.

I turn my back to answer someone else's question, and find them yanking at the phone. ""It's stuck!"" No, it's locked. Let me get it off for you. Strike two.

Then they ask if it comes with any minutes. I tell them, nope, you need to buy a card with it. I get distracted by another customer, and they come up to me with a $10 card from a different prepaid company. They don't look the same at all. Totally different colors, and all the cards are clearly labelled as whatever service they're for. Strike three. You're out. But they kept batting anyway, and it only gets worse.

They ask me where the $10 card for the service is. I tell them there's not one, and the smallest card is $20. They say they have a $25 gift card, so that'll have to wait. So I check out just the phone, and they pay. They ask how much they have left on the card, I tell them it'll be on the receipt I handed them. They walk away, and I think I'm done. But a few minutes later, they're back.

They want to buy the card now. I assume they have more money, so I go with it. I slide the gift card, it applies the remaining $3 plus change, and I wait for them to pay the difference. ""What? We have to pay more? It says there's still like $21 on the gift card."" No, you moron. That's the amount you paid, not the amount you have left. How on earth did you think that you can somehow afford a $20 phone and a $20 card with just a $25 gift card? Strike four.

I explain this in a much nicer way, and they go on their way again. But it's not over yet. They come back and say that the card set off the security alarms at the exit and it won't activate the phone. Are you serious? You never paid for the card. Of course it's not working. Strike five.

Then they decide to return the phone. I would have questioned them about why, but I was convinced by now that there was absolutely nothing but air in their heads. I process the return, and ask for the gift card back so I can add it back. They can't find it, so I just put it on a new gift card. I give it to them, and they ask why there's only $21 on the card and not $25. Strike six. You're out again. I'm mentally banging my head against a table at this point. I explain four different ways that the rest of the money is still on the other gift card. Finally they leave for good. I hope.

meguriau,17,22,1r5sy8,150,"Hi TFR, I’m back! My thesis has been officially submitted, defended, had an existential crisis and have recovered from all the irregulat sleeping patterns and physiological symptoms associated with caffeine excess. It’s been a long time but here is another instalment of [""Tales from a Hat Boutique""]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=meguriau&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). This one has been in the works for a little while for a number of reasons. (1) I'm afraid of long walls of text and procrastinate and (2) I wasn't sure if it was clear enough. 

 I should probably mention that I simplified the title of this series for simplicity but the brand also releases a line of bags for its spring-summer (SS) and autumn-winter (AW) collections. As such, I will refer to the store as HB for hat and bag store.

**Background**

Two years ago, I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store. Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock, the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals. The majority of the customers I've had have been pleasant, however, there have been interesting characters and even a few ~~nasty pieces of work~~ discontent customers that have come by. This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this time.

**Story**

Today's story describes the customer who left her mark on our generous reservation guideline and jaded my view of customers in retail. 

Most large designer stores have a limit to the number of days you can keep an item on hold. As a small store catering towards a large overseas market, we were much more flexible and allowed customers to reserve an item for several months before their arrival in Australia (sometimes up to a year) without regular contact from the store. The length of time was purely due to the fact that not all of the collection is available overseas and the (slightly) lower prices after taking the tax refund system into account which made shopping at our store more appealing.

The extended reservation period was also available to locals. Yes, they could keep an item on hold for months as long as they let us know in advance e.g. ""I am on holiday and won't be back for a month"" or ""I live interstate but will be visiting in two months time"". For others, we typically allowed them a reserve period of up to a month without any calls, however, the time period was dependent on the popularity of an item. This guide worked simply because (1) the exact details of the reservation system are unknown to customers which gives us a lot of leeway on how to implement it and (2)  locals for the past 17 years, in addition to having common sense, never left an item for longer than one week, at most, and answered/returned their calls when we tried to confirm the reserve status. 

As I alluded to (but didn't really explain explicitly) in previous stories, summer at a hat boutique is the busiest season of the year. To give you the scale of how frantic it can be, sometimes the three months of summer alone can generate up to a third of the revenue for the year. Now, the head office of this brand is not known for making clever decisions with regard to production. Even though we, as staff members of the flagship store, put more consideration in what wider range of items would be popular next season and request stock accordingly, the preferences of the larger department stores skew what management puts into production. Due to management's lack of foresight, many of our popular products run out of stock before the season ends which tends to lead to much customer drama.

This story comes to you from the calm after the storm of one summer afternoon. The end of the season was nigh and we had hit a record number of sales. The boss had gone home and the only sound to disrupt the peace was the persistent ring of the phone behind the desk. Slouching in the chair, bracing myself for another demanding customer, I was surprised to be greeted by a friendly voice. We will dub the lady behind this voice DF for deceptively friendly.

**M:** Good afternoon, HB store. Meguriau speaking.

**DF:** Oh hello! I'm looking to keep something reserved for a friend. Would you have it in stock? It's called B in the Natural colour from your SS12 collection."" 

**M:** We do have one of those in stock. When were you next able to come by?

**DF:** I'll be in on the weekend.

**M:** That sounds perfect. If I could just take down your name and contact details, we'll see you then!

This particular backpack was a $450 masterpiece. Its craftsmanship gave off a casual yet stylish vibe and it caught the attention of every woman who came by the store. The product only remained on shelves for three days at most before it found its way to a new home. It was fantastic that it sold well, however, my manager had not been able to gauge the level of interest people would have in the item and nor did department stores. As a result, there were only three more B bags left over in the world at this point in time. Despite the high demand for the item, the weekend was only two days away so we didn't give it much more thought before reserving two other bags remaining at the warehouse. 

The following weekend had come and gone with no sign of DF. My manger figured we could hold it out for another week before deciding what to do. Perhaps she was sick, busy with work, lost her phone? In any case, I left her a message offering to hold it for an extra week.

Another weekend, another message and, again, no DF. This time we let her know in no uncertain terms that this item was going back on display and to give us a call if she was still interested in this item. We figured that if she called, we could put the item back on hold and, if not, we could still have a new one brought in on the next delivery date. A few days later, the bag found its way into the possession of a lovely Japanese lady and DF was still not to be found. It couldn’t have been minutes after the transaction when the sensor sounded, marking the arrival of a smartly dressed, middle age woman. Bright smile spreading from ear to ear, it soon became apparent this customer was DF.

**M:** Hi there. Is there anything I can help you with?

**DF:** I called in to reserve B bag for a friend. Could I take a look?

**M:** I’m sorry, unfortunately we have taken this item off hold. The warehouse shows up as having two more left in stock so we will be sure to have this item available for you by next week at the latest. 

**DF:** That’s preposterous! It was on hold! I wanted to see the dimensions!

I proceeded to exhaust all possible ways of explaining to her that we did not have any others in store at the moment, apart from telling her that I was not Hogwarts trained and could not simply conjure a replica bag for her to examine.

**M:** I’m afraid that’s the most I can do for you at this point in time. We’ll again give you a call when the bag arrives and if you could phone us before coming in, that would be fantastic.

All in all, she appeared to back down and, with an expression visibly forced, DF mumbled something under her breath and sauntered out of the store.

From that point on, it felt as though DF was engaging in some form of petty revenge. The same nonresponsive pattern ensued even after the bag had arrived and on hold. This time, the manager was determined to keep the bag until DF arrived. Days extended into weeks and (almost) months until the manager had had enough. She was by no means an impatient person, however, in this time, the other B bag had already made its way into the hands of another customer so this bag was the last one available in the world and was spending its days hiding away in a cupboard. The manager had reached breaking point.

**Manager:** I CAN’T BELIEVE THE NERVE OF THIS WOMAN. I RUN A BUSINESS NOT A STORAGE CENTRE. IF YOU CAN’T GET A 50% DEPOSIT FROM HER, PUT IT BACK ON DISPLAY. SHE DOESN’T DESERVE THE BAG.

After she calmed down, she asked me to phone DF and let her know that we would keep the bag up until the weekend at the latest and if she would like an extension, to please contact us.

Of course, we had no such luck. It was now Monday and had been no sign of DF. Almost an hour after opening, a customer phoned in from Japan for the B bag and it had now been packaged and ready to be posted. Shortly after, the sensor sounded. It  was DF and mildly frustrated does not even begin to describe the response when I told her we were completely out of stock. She was absolutely belligerent.

**DF:** THE BAG IS SOLD OUT? SOLD OUT?! HOW DARE YOU! 

**M:** I’m terribly sorry but we had informed you that we would only extend the reservation period if you’d left us a messa-

**DF:** MY HUSBAND WAS HOSPITALISED YESTERDAY SO I COULDN’T CALL. 

**M:** I’m sorry to hear of your husband’s ill-

**DF:** YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO SELL IT. I ALREADY BLOODY OWN IT. 

Unable to refer her elsewhere, the rest of the morning was spent attempting to placate DF as she drove away potential customers and attracted a small gawking crowd. Let’s just say that animal taming was not a skill set I invested many points into. On my own with no manager to back me up, I soon realised that nothing I could do would calm her down and ultimately gave up, letting her rage and rant. Once she left, she left for good and I have never crossed paths with her since.

Following this incident, a new policy was set in place immediately. Overseas customers are still be able to place extended holds on items, regardless of their popularity, however, now it is not automatically true for locals. Customers that don’t need to cross a state line to get to the store can only keep an item on hold for a week, however, they were required to check in with us if they are unable to come by. Of course, there are a few exceptions to the rule but I guess that’s retail!

Another post on here about shoplifting brought a flood of memories from when I used to work at a big box retail store. I worked my way through college and have some very fond memories but some very crazy ones as well. This is one of my favorites.

I never worked Loss Prevention, but was always called up during times of potential thefts. The reason being is that contact had to be made with the perp from the time of the incident to the time they left the store 100% of the time. 

***Story time*****
It was a few months after being hired, I was called on a code ""blue"" (potential theft). I loved these so I rush up front and assume the position around the LP area with the camera. I see a gentleman standing by the CD rack looking over the merchandise. He looks shifty looks around puts his back to the camera and in a very swift moment turns right to the camera, lifts up his shirt, and deposits a CD into his pants. In full view of the camera! He does the same action another 4-5 times and proceeds to the exit.

As expected, we stop him and ask him to come into the LP office. He doesn't argue or put up a fight just goes directly to the room with his head held low. We ask him to remove the CD's and he does, no problems. 

From the beginning of the process, I noticed that I knew him. We went to HS together, not a bright guy and we didn't hang in the same circles but we each saw each other in the halls. 

He finally looks at me closely and it hits him that he knows me. He verifies that I am that I am Dogfacegremlin and I say yes. Then he asks very candidly if we got him ""good."" I smile say yes and show him the video. He's dumbfounded that he's basically showing the camera his theft and remarks that he should've done it the other way. I laugh it off.

A few years later, same numb nuts went to jail for robbing a bank. Asked a buddy for ride to the bank, came back to the car crazy asking him to drive. Driver noped that idea and just sat there till the cops came.

Smarty pants got busted for several other bank robberies because he left the bank bags from previous robberies in his room.

At this point she's getting impatient. She follows me to the PC. I enter the movie name in and surprise, surprise nothing comes up. We don't even carry said movie.

 ""I'm looking on my PC and I see we don't even carry the movie. Perhaps it's under a different name?""

""no, It's called X, exactly X my daughter worked on the film. The ad said it would be released exclusive to this store today. Can you go look in back?"" At this point she's on the verge of tears. I offer to go look.

But every once in a while, it's very condescending. An example of this is when there were a couple of guys sitting at the bar when I went up to make a drink. There was no more ice in the sink, so I lifted up one of the ice buckets (that are rather big) that we keep nearby and poured them into the sink to then make said drink.

She looks at the different kinds of that treat we have for a minute or two, then turns to me. ""I can't tell what flavor this is, can you come over here and smell of it to see if you can tell?""

At this point I just kind of looked at her. I mean, we're a popular pet store chain so we have to know quite a bit about what we sell, but really? You want me to try to identify the damn treat by *smell*? What do I look like, a bloodhound?

All I could say was, ""No, I can't ma'am. They'll smell about the same, they're DOG TREATS.""

""... Are you sure?""
""*Yes.*""

She went on about her business, and tried to complain when she thought the flavor she picked wasn't on sale even though all the others were. The sale tag had been kind of pushed under the shelf and was not immediately visible like the others, once I showed it to her she finally paid and left.

I've been asked some weird things before, but this one definitely took the cake (it even beat out the lady who called and asked if we could trim her gerbil's claws).

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

**Today is groceries; Shall we begin?** (props to /u/Frenchington for sharing his lot story earlier today)

The parking lot. My coworkers hated getting cart duty. I enjoyed it. I’d much rather be outside and moving around, than inside and lashed to a checkstand.

But the parking lot is perilous. I learned this from three different perspectives. As a bag boy, I could clearly see the damage caused by errant carts. Later in life, at the financial company, I would hear clients tell stories of epic accidents in lots, and see the resulting figures for the damage (average damage in the lot used to be ~$2,000, with the most frequent cause being “backing”). Lastly, as a driver, my first accident happened when a driver backed right into my car as I was driving along minding my own business. But it happens. That’s why we have insurance.

Here are a few stories from the lot:

**HIT AND RUN:** 

Nice warm San Diego night. A smattering of carts on the lot. Not many customers inside.

Enter a large Cadillac; it’s a land yacht. It’s being driven by a senior citizen, and she falls squarely into the Q-Tip category. Small, white, and sporting a moderate senior-frizz of puffy white hair.

She should not be driving anything. The Caddy might protect her, but it’s a lethal weapon to anyone else.

The driver rolls past me, and angles-in to a good spot near the entrance to the store. But she fails to hit the breaks, and manages to smash into another car. She backs-up slightly, and rips the number off of a relatively new Honda.

She pauses, looks around, and stars backing again. Damn, she’s going to run. I have noting to write with, so I try and memorize the plate. Sadly, I don’t get a very good look. She bolts out of the lot and disappears forever. It was not captured by the security cameras. And I never see her or the Caddy again. Bummer.

**TELEPATHIC CART DESTRUCTION:**

A universal truth to retail is that the less you are paid, the more likely it is that you will be blamed for things that had absolutely nothing to do with you.

In this case, I was in the back of the lot gathering carts. Unseen to me, a customer leaves a cart between spaces, and nowhere near a corral. A few minutes later, this cart succumbs to gravity and starts rolling.

It rolls right into the door of a customer who just happened to arrive at her car at that specific moment. A nice dent is delivered and a couple scratches tops it off. Fantastic.

“Hey, you!” She yells. I had not seen the accident, and was nowhere near her. So I don’t register that she’s talking to me.

“Hey, cart guy!” She yells. This time, I see her. So I walk over to her car.

“Do you ned help unloading?” I ask.

“No. I want to know why you dented my car.”

“I’m sorry?”

“You dented my car. You left a cart out and it hit my car! What are you going to do about it”

“I was working on the other side of the lot. I haven’t been in this area for a while.”

She grabs the cart and pushes it toward me. “You left this out and it rolled into my car. Who is going to pay for the damage?!?”

Ugh. “I’ll take you to our manager. He can probably help you out.”

I escort the injured part into the store and introduce her to the manager. Then I go back out and finish the job. The woman emerged after a while and drove off.

Back inside the store, I get called to the office.

“You have to be more careful when doing carts. You just cost the store money.”

“I wasn’t anywhere near the car, and I was not the person who left the cart there.”

“She says you did.”

“How? I’m not telepathic. I could not have caused the damage, and I could not have prevented it. The only thing I did wrong was doing my job. I happened to be out there, but It was not me.”

“Look. Be careful. I don’t want this happening again.”

I left without saying anything else. I was both angry and a bit sad. Angry at the false accusation and fallout, and sad that people behave like this, and it could affect my livelihood.”

**YUPPIE PORSCHE COUPLE AND RELATED BIMBO ASSULT:**

This was the most upsetting of the lot chaos.

I was pushing a line of about seven carts back to the storefront. Carts do not have brakes, and Isaac Newton is not kind to rolling objects with a lot of mass.

As I was moving down the lane, a white Porshe 911 Turbo overtook me, began a right turn, then stopped cold. Inertia made me it’s bitch. There was absolutely nothing I could do to prevent a collision.

The lead cart smacked into the read quarter-panel of the car. It was a pretty good hit; nice and loud, and merciless to the Porsche.

Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo shot out of the passenger door and pointed her finger at me.

“You just totaled a $60,000 car!”

Now, I did not handle this well.

“YOU just pulled in front of a moving like of carts and got hit! Not my fault.”

Second rule of retail: “It’s your fault.” It should not be, but it is.

“I want to talk to a manager right now!”

Yuppie-Husband parks his “totaled” car in front of the store, right on the concrete ramp leading to the sidewalk.  I marched Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo into the store and dumped her off on the supervisor. She muttered about how this was going to cost me my job.

To the supervisor: “This kid just totaled my husbands Porshe. What are you going to do about it?”

Side note: “Totaled” is short for “total loss” This term means that it would cost more to repair the car than what the car is actually worth.

“Lets discuss it in my office.” Meanwhile, I was instructed to wait in the break room until it was “my turn.”

It was a long night. I had to diagram the accident, white up a summary and fill out some paperwork. I was fairly sure I was going to get fired. Part of me WANTED to get fired, just so I don’t have to put up with this kind of crap anymore. The other part of me knew I needed the job and money, and was terrified I was going to lose it.

Eventually Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo left with her Ken-Doll husband. Once again, I was berated for “causing” and accident. I was not fired, but I was told I would be the next time it happened.

The only comfort was that I did manage to tell Yuppie-Bleached-Bimbo it was her husband’s fault and not mine.

Regardless, the claim was paid and the Porsche was restored (but not totaled).

When I was younger I worked at a movie theatre running birthday parties  and concessions --- best job ever. 

You basically team up with the parent to make sure the birthday boy and/or girl and his or her friends have a great time. A typical party starts with games, a tour of the projector room, a movie, pizza party and then ends with deserts. 

During the movie, the mother from my party came to my till to order more snacks.  

Me: Hey, how's the movie?
Her: Great so far and thanks so much for your help.
Me: No problem, what can I get for you?
Her: I'll just have [points to the candy display] a box of Reese's Penis. 

She catches herself, blushes, face palms and giggles.  She was adorable. 

I wish I could say I had a smooth response, but I just smirked and continued the transaction like nothing happened. At the end of the party she gave a generous tip and even went to the manager to tell them what a great job I did.  Such a great gig. ",A Customer's Freudian Slip [PG-13],222

&gt;Not me, but my friend. He was at work, and apparently some asshole customer was berating a new employee, like new as in fresh out of training. This customer was a repeat offender to this type of stuff, people who work retail know the type. My buddy, having worked there for a year or two, comes up and tells the new employee, ""Go, I'll take care of this."" Before the customer can tear into him, he said in a quiet voice, ""Your business is not worth your bullshit and the world would be a better place without you.""

&gt;Customer left speechless.

So bonus post-story stuff, I guess... so far, my buddy hasn't gotten in trouble for it, which he totally could as he is not a manager. As for context, the customer was using profanity and being blatantly unreasonable. This poor new employee literally walked out of the training room to go the bathroom, and customer asked him a question, and then proceeded to ""How could you not know where this is?

Greenwallets,10,4,1r52ex,13,"Hey guys. So I left my big box retailer and jumped ship to a really optimistic retail marketing company. Said marketing company operates a department on behalf of my previous retailer, which means both companies are working along side each other in a VERY small space. 

The issues we're experiencing, largely stem from employees at the store being incredibly hostile towards my new employer being there. They're most upset by me leaving my part time job at the store to work full time (benefits, base pay + commission) as the assistant manager for this new employer.  This went through the store like wildfire the past two weeks, and I've had associates/managers come up to me asking me why I chose to leave the retailer. In a tone that makes it feel as though I have ""betrayed"" them in some way. 

I know it's jealousy from the associates, but it's affecting our relationship with the retailer. There's a very distinct ""Us vs. Them"" mentality that has sprung up amongst the associates which likely stems for the limitations that the retailer has placed on us. We are unable to unlock electronic display cases or cash anyone out who isn't buying a cellular device or related accessory. Specifically, there is one associate who has made rude comments about my manager(s) and I in our vicinity, in addition to physically trying to walk through me. I should mention she did this when I worked there as well- she hates everyone and gets a away with a lot because her entire family works there. Did I mention she's 28?

I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with a toxic work environment, and how you went about rectifying the situation. I should say that my manager isn't likely to do anything because she lacks the confidence in this type of leadership role. She's also struggling to maintain the peace between our company and the retailer. She's too much of a sweetheart, I'm a cynical realist when it comes to this store.",(Meta) how do you deal with a toxic work environment?,17

groundciv,26,46,1r4jqn,209,"I walked off my crappy major retailer job the day classes started up.  I had that luxury.  GI Bill and all that.

However, last week on an expedition to acquire Steel Reserve malt liquor, fritos, and bean dip I came across a man in need.  This guy was obviously fairly well off, driving a 2 year old Nissan SUV and wearing slacks and a button up, but that Nissan SUV was no longer ""driving"".  A lady in a tiny subcompact was trying to trickle charge the battery of his V8.  I momentarily put aside thoughts of daddy's goodnight juice, pulled my car around, and daisy chained.  

We sat there trying to get the guy enough power to turn over the engine for about 20 minutes, it just wasn't happening.  Then all of his indicators and everything went dead.  This is generally indicative of a battery cable, battery, alternator, or potentially fuze error.

I got my tools.  We borrowed the emergency flashlight from the gas station employees.  The one with the fantastic hair called her auto mechanic boyfriend.  We wrenched.  We troubleshot.  I deciphered audio-schematics of a nissan truck's fuze locations from incredibly patient well meaning spanglish into napkin drawings.  We troubleshot more.  a 5 year old was 'lossed' a coke to remove corrosion from battery terminals (and for the guys daughter to then drink while listening to the other station attendants iPod).  I drew my own blood with a ratchet in hand for the first time since I hung up the boots.  It felt good.

It reminded me of past encounters with people that shouldn't care spontaneously caring.  The meth head who helped me drain my fuel tank, drove me to auto zone, helped me replace my fuel pump, on a thursday night in a Wal-Greens parking lot and then refused any money for the help.

""You'd do it fer me.""

The tiny foreign woman who watched my 18 year old between-jobs tire blow-out on I-70, moving to a place I might have a real job, called me in on her AAA, followed me to the service station, and then paid for my tires.

""Paying it forward.  Someone did it for me.""

Those tires got me the next 1700 miles and to financial solvency for the first time in my life.

We got the guy's barely running truck to the Nissan dealership at 2am.  I got them home a little before 3.  He intercepted me the next morning in his comped loaner car on my way to school and we pulled over.  He had a $437 check in his hand for ""roadside assistance"" that his warranty had paid him for.

This was my 6th spontaneous alternator replacement.  I've done battery cables twice.  I did tires once.  My last $246 was going to tuition so I could register for spring classes.

""No sir, you keep it.  But the next time some kid's flat broke and out of gas on the side of the road...maybe pay it forward.""

The look on his face was definitely worth it.  He was a very polite, overwhelmingly appreciative yuppy.  But in 12 hours he met 2 mexican national gas station employees, a poor black woman, a redneck mechanic, and a spanish speaking voice on the phone he couldn't decipher that spent 5 hours making sure he got where he needed to be and refused to take any money.

Last week, it wasn't tales from retail.  It was tales from giving a shit.

So next time that gas station employee pushes you into more light, the heavyset woman of color sticks around for two hours burning her gas to jump your car, the undocumented oil change guy burns minutes talking you through fuze locations, and the soft spoken redneck loans you his car while removing your battery, and the dealership closed 3 hours ago...remember to pay it forward.

It can still exist, and it does a lot of the time.

jake429,3,1,1r4jep,24,"Well, this is my first post on Reddit, so here goes. You guys seem like a bunch of wonderful people, so I can't resist being here now...

I work at a big-box retail store, specifically in the Electronics and Wireless phones department. And while there are stories galore I can talk about (and I may in the future), there is one I need to tell you all about now. This one customer used to come in on a regular basis and shop, then scream and yell at employees claiming that they are stealing from her and cheating her. Mind you, the police have been called in on a few occasions and have even had to subdue her on at least one occasion for trying to start a fight. This becomes even funnier when you know what she looks like: early 60's and about 5' tall: the small spitfire type. 

Anyways, during the past year she has come in and not started a screaming match with my management team, but her store visits have gotten, in the words of Alice, ""curiouser and curiouser"". The last time she came in I was resetting our new release DVD shelving to make way for the next day's releases with my co-worker ""Josie"". In comes the customer and stands 10 feet away from me and ""Josie"". She calls to us: ""Excuse, please; you help me? Now? Now?"" I look over to her, mutter a few choice words under my breath, and ask ""who, me?"" ""Yes, yes. Come, quickly..."" So I get up, say a little prayer, and come over. 

ME: What can I help you with today?

HER: Can I ask you a question?

ME: Sure! What did you need?

HER: Are you sure I can ask? (Motions over to ""Josie"") Can she hear us?

ME: (Confused) Um, no. She can't hear us. What did you need?

HER: (Leaning in, uncomfortably close) Are you both crazy people?

ME: Uhhhhh..... No?

HER: Are you sure? You sure you no crazy people?

ME: No; I'm not crazy, she's not crazy.

HER: Oh. OK. Here's my question...

And proceeds to ask me the same question about her phone for the next half hour; I answer in every way possible besides making puppets and acting it out, and eventually getting her phone company's tech support on the line to help me out. After she grabbed the phone from my hand and began gabbering on and on to the guy on the phone, she left; not really happy about the answer she got. When I picked the phone back up, the guy on the other end sounded like he needed a cigarette break and told me in no uncertain terms that I was correct in my explanation and that, if she doesn't heed our advice, she may get a disconnection notice very soon because she didn't listen.

I was the sole person on the floor with about 6 customers in my store. I was deep in the process of a return when a lady asked if she could hold something at the register. Being such a small store, I said yes, as we can generally keep track of whose pile of stuff is whose and check them out when they're done shopping.

A few minutes later, I've finished the return and processed a few other transactions when I realize the lady has left the store, and left her items on the cash wrap. No name, no phone number, nothing. Just left. Okay...well, I can hold this for a bit and see if she comes back, I suppose.

Three hours later, she hasn't returned and we sell her items. I warn my relief manager (RM) that this lady might come back in, but I'm not sure. Two hours after that, I leave for the day.

The next day, I come in for my closing shift. RM from the day before had opened, and filled me in on what happened after I left:

Lady comes back and says she has items held for her. Nobody can find them, because we don't have them anymore. The lady got pissy and said, ""Well, the girl with the short reddish-brown hair said she would hold them for me."" (I am the ONLY person who works in my store who matches that description.) Essentially, RM told her that we didn't have any more in stock in the right size, so they could order it or she could wait until another came in. Lady decides against the dress, but RM does so much ass-kissing that she still makes a $600 sale.

I'm trying to figure out how she thought I could hold the items for her with no name, no phone number, and no time she would be back for them. Hell, I've been to department stores that require a credit card number for a hold. SOMETHING. Like, I can't just hold it for ""Short Blonde Lady with Baby in a Sling"". That's a physical description of about 30% of our customers. Ugh.

Posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1qxrkh/so_long_and_thanks_for_well_nothing/) a couple of days ago about the lovely way the shitty co-owner of the restaurant I used to work at let me know that she was letting me go. but just not scheduling me! lovely. quick recap: I changed my availability for one shift, restaurant doesnt schedule me anymore, condescending owner wont return my calls. 

I called in today, two weeks after the fact, hoping to finally talk to her. Sure enough, she was there. I wish I had written it down so I could give you a more accurate transcript, but honestly, though most of it I was at a loss for words. FYI it is a small restaurant, with 2 bartenders and 2-3 servers on at one time taking 6-7 tables each. 

**Steph:** Thank you for holding this is Stephanie how can I help you?

**Me:** Hi Stephanie this is Dan

**S:** Hi Dan how's it going

**Me:** *thinking, seriously?* I was calling in to see why I wasnt scheduled the past two weeks, and why noone called me to tell me what was going on.

**S:** I wanted to talk to you about that, you see when you changed your availability we couldnt find any other shifts for you. You will have to switch with somebody to work three shifts a week.

**M:** What are you talking about, I opened up my availability when I said I couldnt work thursdays anymore. I am only trying to work three shifts a week, but I can do Monday through Friday nights, Friday and Saturday morning. How can you not find anything?

*At this point I'm not giving a fuck if I keep this job or not, I want this snide mother f-er to explain herself*

**S:** But people already have those shifts, I cant just switch them for you. Most of the other people are full time, so we do set schedules.

*We go back and forth for a while, with me trying to figure out A) Why she cant just schedule me, and move shifts around so that they can get coverage Sundays where they need it and have me fill the gap and B) Why it took her so long to tell me this*

**S:** So youre going to need to have somebody give up a shift so that you can get three a week.

**M:** Can you give me the numbers of the people that work those nights?

**S:** I can't do that, Maryland law won't let us

*BULL. SHIT. Every restaurant I've ever worked at has the numbers posted by the schedule*

**M:** Can you tell me who is working those days, or who is available Sundays?

**S:** No

**M:** So basically, what youre saying is that I have to drive all the way up there *20 minute drive* to talk to the two servers that are on, because I cant switch with a bartender, and talk to them while they're working to see if they would be able to switch with me? Hoping that they're actually available and amenable to working Sundays, and is actually able to discuss it and think about it during a shift.

**S:** Right

**M:**.......ok. *Fuck it* I also wanted to tell you that not trying to get in touch with me about this, neither calling me nor emailing me or even returning a phone call is extremely unprofessional. I've never had a boss do this, especially since you acted like nothing had happened when **I** called **YOU** just now.

**S:** Well the last time you worked I wanted to talk to you about it but you just ran out.

M: Because I was done, we just cash out to the bartender we dont need to talk to you guys. I left because I was finished, I didnt know you wanted to talk to me, why didnt you let me know before I left so that I would stay?

**S:** I was working on a catering order

**M:** Okay, so what, you expected me to just hang around on a saturday, past the time when I was scheduled to be done, when I had plans later that night, on the off chance that you may want to talk to me?? Come on....

**S:**.....Well I am really busy right now so you'll need to come up here and talk to me about this.

**M:** Ok fine, but again, not reaching out or even returning my calls was extremely unprofessional.

*while Im hanging up on her* 
**S:** Ok. Bye


I dont remember being hired as a manager, so no, I dont think that I am going to take care of the scheduling for you. If it was impossible to find one shift that you could change, out of five different days and 10-12 different people, than you just cant do your job. Sorry.

dimintia,7,12,1r4axm,61,"A lady entered our department desiring a replacement power cable for her cell phone.  

Upon presenting her with what she required, (mind you that it was a cheaper alternative and not the cable from the original manufacturer) she asks if the cable is made in China.  Even though I know the answer to this question I look anyway on the cable's packaging, and when I inform her that her assumption is correct, she erupts in a preaching rant to myself and a coworker that according to the news people have been dying from exploding cables that come from China.  We stare at her blankly and offer no response, giving her the opportunity she so desperately needed to vent (it was quite apparent that she lacks rational people in her life).  When she finishes I ask her if she would instead prefer to take the cable, although more expensive, made by her phone's manufacturer.  She happily agrees, and as I hand her the cable I inform her that the cable and her phone are both made in China. ",Beware of power cables made in China,73
When_Ducks_Attack,10,19,1r465h,97,"A few weeks ago, I wrote about the [Attack of the Knee-punching Child](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1qbcko/when_children_attack/).  Today, I'm going to tell you a story that was entirely **MY** fault.

I was still working at the place where you could get radios for your shack.  It was a day just like any other day, only moreso.  Except that I had a dentist appointment at 1pm to have a filling put into a tooth right on the verge of failing.  To do this, I was going to take a long lunch, then come back to work.

So I went to the dentist's office, they put me in the chair, shot my mouth full of Novocaine, then waited for it to take effect.  And waited.  And waited.  Then gave me more Novocaine.  And more.  Somewhere around the sixth shot, the dentist hit a nerve that basically numbed everything in my face from the nose down.

Eventually, I couldn't feel them poking around in my mouth, so they installed the filling and finished up.  It went really quite smooth, except that I still couldn't my mouth, tongue, lips, right side of my face, and most of my jaw.  ""Well, that happens,"" said the dentist, ""...and we *did* have to use a lot of Novocaine to numb you down.  It'll take a little while to wear off.""  ""You don't say, doc.""

At least, that's what I thought I said.  The doc just looked at me with [an odd look on his face.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P2qeZcHcSGQ#t=1193)  Well, no matter.  Back to work for me!

Around about an hour later, I'm approached by a customer wanting to know about them newfangled electronic organizers (yes, I'm old, I know).  ""Why, certainly sir!  This one is an impressive piece of equipment...""  ...and off I go, describing how it works, so on and so forth.  After a little bit, I realize he's just giving me a really odd look, like he doesn't ""get it.""  As I try to figure out where I lost him, he holds up his right hand in a ""stop"" gesture and asks me ""do you know you're drooling?""

He was being kind.  As it turns out, my chin was soaked, and I had even left a small puddle on the countertop... the Novocaine still hadn't worn off.

As I reached for a paper towel, apologizing the entire time, the customer just sort of faded away and out the door.  Oh.

I decided to call it a day after I discovered my tie was soaked, too.","The Day of the Dentist, or why you shouldn't do what I did.",116
Lightfairy,4,8,1r445p,29,"Been posting a few stories. You can find them [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=author%3ALightfairy&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

Many many moons ago when I was but a young thing I worked very briefly for a very large chain supermarket as a cashier. This supermarket was in a large shopping centre. Having just checked google for the timing of this event I can tell you it was 33 years ago. Wow! Time has flown! 

This supermarket chain was having some problems with an extortion attempt. Bomb threats had been made to various stores. We, the staff, thought it was all a bit of fun to start with and a great way to avoid work. The alarm would go off, we would evacuate the store and if it was anywhere near clock off time, we would get to go home early as it would take quite a while for the store to be declared safe again. 

We were having a bomb scare every couple of days. All good fun we thought as nothing ever happened. 

Then, in the space of nine days three stores were bombed. The culmination being a major store in a major city on Christmas Eve. The police offered the largest reward in the history of this country for information leading to an arrest. 

Cue this story. Two bombs had gone off and we were now getting very nervous and were on high alert. A lady comes up to my check out. Two carts of frozen goods. Chickens, 4 litre tubs of icecream and every other conceivable frozen thing one can imagine. I start putting the order through. Keep in mind this was back in the dim, dark days of hand entering every price and then hitting the code for the department the goods came from. No scanners back then. I was slaving away, making small talk when suddenly the alarm goes off. 

By this time we all knew the drill precisely. Pull the cash draw, throw it in the trolley that came screaming past with a two man escort and exit immediately. We did not muck around any more! So, with the alarm going and the voice over the shop speakers telling EVERYONE to leave by the nearest exit, I pull the draw and prepare to exit. 

'WHAT ARE YOU DOING?' I hear screamed at me. My customer with all the frozen goods. 

I turn to her and say 'Would you please exit the store immediately. It is probably nothing but it is best to be on the safe side what with recent events.'

She is having none of it. 'What about all my food. Only part of it is rung up and I need it. You have to finish my order. It will only take 5 or 10 minutes.'

With thoughts of explosions in my head I turn to her and say, 'Lady you can do as you wish but based on what has been happening lately in our stores I am outta here!!'

Thankfully it was late in the day and I got to go home early again as they would not clear the store prior to my clock off time. I jump on the train and head 1. 5 hours west. Get off in my small town and head down the street only to find I could not take my shortcut home (it was a laneway running alongside yet another of the supermarkets in the chain for which I worked) as they were having a bomb scare as well!! Total of two bomb scares in one day for me!

I heard my register was a mess of thawed icecream and other goo by the time they got back into the store. As for that ladies '5 or 10 minutes'? They received only a 10 minute warning prior to the bombing of the major city supermarket on Christmas Eve. They managed to evacuate over 2000 people before it went off. No one got hurt. They have never charged anyone over the event. I left the job shortly after. This kind of ruined my taste for working check out. 

TL;DR Ice cream and bombs don't go together. Just ask my customer.

spotty82,18,28,1r43bb,139,"Hi all,

I just discovered this sub. I run my own DVD/Game store and have dozens of stories I think you will enjoy so when I get time I will add more :-)

-------- 

It was a typical Wednesday afternoon, we had gotten through the lunch time rush and were tidying the shelves and generally preparing for the after school onslaught that would come in a few hours time.

A rather unremarkable gentleman came into the store and started browsing our movies for sale. Since it was quite time I wandered over and enquired as to whether he was after anything in particular. The person in question replied with a grunt which I took to mean 'No I am fine thanks' so I let him continue on while me and a staff member just went about doing whatever.

----Fast Forward around an hour later. 

The gentleman was still walking around our store, and while we do have loads of things to look at (circa 30,000 movies) a customer being around that long gives us an automatic red flag. We are in a fairly low socio economic part of town, and quite often a customer that hangs around a ridiculous amount of time can be a indication they are waiting for the coast to be clean to steal stuff. 

Naturally we start to keep a subtle eye on him, but he does not appear to be doing anything too suspicious so we let him be and keep our distance, after all some people just love browsing our selection of rare/pre owned movies.

----Fast Forward another half hour or so.

Our strange visitor has been carrying around a movie for around 10 minutes, and he is now approaching the counter. I feel a sense of relief. It is always nice when your gut is wrong about someone. Unfortunately it wasn't to be. 

He comes up to my register and the following conversation happens.

ME: *Scans* ""Hi sir, that will be $19.95""

CUST: ""Nah, you owe me $19.95""

ME: ""I'm sorry sir...?""

CUST: ""I bought that movie 3 months ago and it doesn't work and I want a refund"".

ME: ""Sir, I just saw you pick that movie up from the display stand. Also it still has the stores security lock on it.""

CUST:""Nah not that copy. I bought another one and it doesn't work and I want my money back"".

ME: ""Ok Sir, if you bring the movie and your receipt bac..""

CUST: ""I lost my receipt""

ME:(At this stage just wanting him gone) ""Ok, just bring the movie back and I will give you a refund""

CUST: ""Give me the money now and Ill bring it back later""

ME: ""That is not how the process wor..""

CUST: ""GIVE ME MY FUCKING REFUND OR ILL TAKE YOU OUTSIDE AND CUT YOUR THROAT C***""


At this point I pull my personal alarm (which all my staff have attached to there cloths) and he goes running out the door. I had already given one of the staff a signal to go down the back and watch the cameras and get ready to call the cops when it become clear he was not right and she proceeds to do that.

He jumps into a waiting car that pulls out and proceeds to run into the back of the car in front of it before taking off. Unfortunately I wasn't quick enough to get the rego tags..  

The police came and took a report, but I never heard back from them or the customer again. I can only hope he got his copy of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic to work.


EDIT: TLDR - Dude wanted us to give him a refund for something he didn't have. Went psycho and rammed a car.

ArQuesta,26,20,1r3xmk,43,"Hello again, fellow retail slaves. I've posted a few times before, but mostly about my time before college, when I worked at a Stop for Gamers. Not today. I meant to go get some reading done this evening, but the sky is absolutely pissing rain right now and I'm car-less at the moment, so I decided to tell you about a recent story.

I just got done with my Bachelor's this summer. I know, I should have escaped the abyss that is retail, but I'm stuck at home, saving up money to move to the D.C. area at the moment, while also filling out grad school applications, as well as working on big job applications. I'm in a stupid spot and I need money, so I started working at a big name coffee shop which is a three-minute walk from home. Score.

For the most part the job is fine, no real horrible people to be found. The ones that are entitled dicks who deign not to make eye contact usually end up tipping, so it's fine with me if they like being pricks. They just spent $6 on a f*cking drink. 

Anywho. Last week I encountered something absolutely amazing in its oddness. I was working the drive-thru window, which, at night, meant I was taking orders and money and passing drinks and whatnot. During a rush there's two of us, as people's drinks go from normal to downright stupid-complicated. But, alas, there's always a button for it.

A nice, shiney $40k+ car pulls up, my last customer in a long line rush. She seems nice and as her drink is still being made we chit-chat. Now, for some background, I have the worst baby face. I mean, it's great that I look young, but depending on the person my 28 years looks like 20. I don't wear make-up, drink, or smoke, so I am lacking any pre-wrinkles and I'm chubby so I have the dumbest looking baby cheeks. It's fine though, as I get to surprise people with my age and that amuses me greatly. For this conversation I'll use BAC for the lady, and Me as me.

BAC: ""Oh, are you still in school right now?""

Me: ""Actually I just finished, I'm working here to help pay for grad school applications and get on my feet.""

BAC: ""Oh, what did you major in?""

Me: ""East-Asian studies."" *chuckles* ""It's kind of useless around here.""

BAC: ""Would you say that you could talk about your major confidently?""

Me: *at this point wondering if she works for the nearby college, or needs a strangely specific tutor* ""Oh, yeah, I can talk for days about culture, history, politics, language, etc for days.""

BAC: ""Have you ever read the bible?""


Me: *shitshitshitshit, here it comes* ""...Well, a bit when I was younger.""

BAC: *with smug confidence and a gleam in her eyes* ""When I was in college, my psychology professor told us about the world in two boxes, one where God existed and one where he doesn't. Sure, if you're in the box where he isn't there, fine, but what if you're in the other one? Is it really that harmful to believe?""


Now, at this point my supervisor was standing behind me counting drawers, and had tuned out the conversation, as she told me afterwards. I kept hoping my body language and the amount of time we were at the window would get her to help me, but alas, I was trapped.


Me: *remembering hearing that analogy used to argue the other point of view, but deciding not to argue at work* ""Well, as a kid my dad let me try out every religion, and I've built myself up with the best morals and ideas from all of them. If I had to subscribe to anything--""

BAC: ""Some people are really fake, you know? They pretend to be deep but they lack in the most important area."" *suddenly angry* ""I know a lot of fake people, and they aren't people you should call friends.""

Me: *the fuk?*

This was the most annoying part...

BAC: *suddenly remembering that she in the middle of preaching* ""What are you going to do after you're done with school?""

Me: ""I dunno, work for the government?""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Take care of my parents and family.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Travel or work abroad.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""I've thought about adopting.""

BAC: ""And then?""

Me: ""Live my life happily?""

BAC: ""What about after life?""

Me: ""There's nothing.""

BAC: *legitimately surprised* ""And you're okay with that?""

Me: ""Well, yeah, we're not immortal. You live to the best of your ability until you die.""

BAC: *changing tactics* ""When I used to work in retail I was a great salesperson, really friendly, but it was fake. People are fake. Then I read the bible. There's something there, if you read it you'll understand.""

Me: ""Maybe one day I'll read it, but it's not--""

BAC: ""Well, you know, everyone has problems, right?""

Me: ""Of course.""

BAC: *surprised for some reason that I've agreed with her* ""Well, how do you deal with problems?""

Me: ""Sometimes slowly, sometimes not at all. I try to sit down and think about things and to talk to people. You can either sit down and let them destroy you or try to get up again. Some people can't cope and need medications, but I know a lot of people who deal with things on their own.""

BAC: ""My husband used to be addicted to money, sex, and drugs.""


This is about where my patience absolutely ended, my face started to crack a grin. I'm not an arrogant person, but I write, I read, I study constantly. I'm an intelligent person, and I wasn't going to allow her to outwit or -speak me, but I was also trying to be unfailingly polite.


Me: *corners of my mouth twitching* ""Oh yeah?""

BAC: *conspiratorially* ""He used to be the biggest drug dealer in [my home town].""

Me: *holding in my amusement, badly* ""Really!""

BAC: ""Now he's the best husband, utterly faithful, and he read the bible. He's spiritual now, that's proof. You have to--""

And then, like God himself saying ""Jesus lady, shut up"" the drive-thru dinged and my supervisor started our spiel, I said goodbye to the dear Born Again Christian, and turned away from the window. As I walked away my face flushed bright red and my eyes teared up from all my held back emotions. My coworkers started laughing and asking what had happened. I was a little mortified. I mean, here was this lady with a car worth more than my four-year education, lecturing a girl (lol) who she thought was in the middle of college (~20), working minimum wage at a coffee place after dropping thousands on a, what she thought, excellent education. If she only worked retail, than dear drug-dealing hubby must have paid for that, right? At what point did she have the right to say that I wasn't spiritual? I'm very spiritual, and I have my own views of spirituality. At what point did she have the right to say that to not read the bible was to be a fake human being who was obsessed with drugs, money, and sex? Not only that, did she really initiate a conversation geared towards the non-religious simply because I told her I was educated? 


Plus she didn't tip that poor drive-thru girl who had to listen to her for fifteen minutes What a tool. Seriously.

Takeabyte,8,9,1r3uuj,30,"The former VP of a computer company's retail division had a lot of policies that were intended to improve the customer experience. He was a strong believer that we sales people could deter thieves simply by talking to them and that having security measures like empty boxes of software, door alarms, and fake products were nothing but an annoyance to customers and would ruin the vibe.

Shout out to /r/JealousyGrey and his [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1r24y4/they_do_know_theyre_fake_right/) that reminded me of this gem...

The worst was having real boxes of software on the shelves. I worked in a much smaller store than most, the shelves were only about 20 feet away from the door. At any given time, there would be $50,000 to $100,000 worth of software and accessories on what little shelf space we had. Everything ranging from the full version of design software, productivity software, portable hard drives, headphones, etc. Every time we got the new planogram we would cringe. Think of those shelves in a computer store as a billboard. Every single item on display or on the shelf is ad space paid for by whoever made that product with the stuff at eye level or plugged in being the most expensive real estate (like a grocery store) so we were required to put products where they told us to put them. For example, when one design software company comes out with the new version they would buy double the ad space, we'd have one box for the full version and one box for the upgrade for all the versions of their products and the individual apps on display. It was madness. Over the years though, they transitioned to empty boxes and moved almost entirely away from boxed software since download distribution took over..

The worst for us was a video editing program. It cost $1,299 and had a handle on top since it since it had so many instruction booklets, but it also made it way easier to grab and run with. Anyway, a box of that would go missing *every week!* It happened so often we almost ran out of the software to sell! We'd look over, notice it was missing, ask everyone working, usually only 5 or 6 of us including one technician and one manager (it was a big deal when our store had to have two techs work at once) anyway, we'd ask everyone if they sold it, and if not our manager would have to report it as theft and explain why we were unable to stop it. We would ask time and time again to let us put an empty box out or at least put the upgrade version on the shelf instead.

So, life goes on and time passes. The thefts seem to slow down and the video software never went MIA again. Meanwhile, a friend of mine had to go to a halfway home for drug abuse and I would visit him every so often to keep his spirits up. One time, I was playing billiards in their garage and there's this one guy who was there because he was a [kleptomaniac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptomania) started telling stories about stealing from the mall with his girlfriend and started to talk about the computer store... I couldn't believe it. I was playing pool with the guy that stole about $20,000 worth of software. He was also responsible for taking computers that belonged to customers while it was waiting to be sent out for repair. People almost got fired for that shit! It was crazy. I wanted to punch the guy in the face!

Oh well, he did go to jail for a couple years and [I whooped his butt at pool](http://i.imgur.com/QqHzZ.gif). He got what he deserved and hopefully stopped stealing things. Looking back at it now, it obviously didn't effect the companies business and the customers who had their computers stolen were given the choice of whatever computers they wanted as well as a bunch of other free gear.

**TL;DR**: Someone stole a *lot* of software from the store. I met him years later and beat him... at playing pool.

I have *soooo* many other stories from working that store for so long, I'll tell you guys some more later. For now I'll just wish you a safe holiday season, stay strong, and eat a breakfast.

All the best,

Got a phone call earlier today at (Insert specialty gaming store here.) 

Our phone call customer, we'll use PG for Phone guy, called regarding his Xbox1 reserve.

Now, for the pre-orders for the console, we took a down payment as a deposit for the console to make sure you are actually going to pick it up. Otherwise everyone and their grandma would try to 'reserve' on of the new consoles and only a fraction of them would have the money/time/etc to pick it up at launch. These deposits are of course fully refundable if you change your mind. Or if you go buy it from a competitor, ebay, etc. 

Reserved items are held for 48 hours, we will absolutely guarantee it remain in stock that long for you if you preorder. We aren't going to hold it a week, a month, or longer; sitting around collecting dust and shooing away customers who want to purchase the item you can't be bothered to pick up because you put down a 20% deposit months ago. This is ESPECIALLY true with systems and collectors sets, which we hold VERY FIRMLY to the 48 hour rule.

Onto the story!

PG: ""I had a question about the Xbox 1 I had reserved.""

Sasparilla: ""Go ahead?""

PG: ""Well see, I have a bit of a family emergency, and won't be able to pick up the Xbox until tuesday and-""

At this point I cut him off, having done this conversation so. many. times. this day alone; let alone the last week. ""Regretfully sir, the consoles can only be held till 6pm on Saturday. If you don't pick it up Saturday night, it will go on sale on sunday to the first buyer.""

PG is PISSED. ""What do you mean you'll sell it? I paid for it!""

Sasparilla: ""You placed a deposit on the item in question to have it set aside for you. If you do not pick it up within the hold period, we cannot guarantee we will have it in stock when you come to pick it up.""

PG: ""You can't do that! Your breaking street date!""

Sasparilla: ""How so?""

PG: ""Your supposed to hold it 48 hours! It comes out friday.""

Ah, I see the problem. Not the original problem addressed, but the bone he is currently chewing on. ""We are starting the pre-ring process at 6PM on Thursday. The consoles will be paid for and purchased, but they won't be handed over the counter until midnight. Its to preven-"" 

PG: ""You can't do that! Your breaking street date!"" 

Ah. A street savvy lawyer here. Sasparilla: ""We can, and are, Sir. We can ring up the products early, the steet date only prevents us from handing the product to customers early to get an advantage over competitors. No matter where you go, you will not get your hands on a Xbox one before midnight. But we can make the purchase any time we please.

PG: ""You can't do that!""

Sasparilla: ""We can, and are sir. Microsoft has never had a problem with us doing this for any of their products in the past. Since the items are being sold at 6PM Thurs, you have 48 hours to pick it up."" 

PG: ""Well I cant get there till Tues."" 

Sasparilla: ""Then your console will be sold on Saturday after six. You ca-""

PG: ""You can't do that! We had a CONTRACT.""

Note to any armchair lawyers, we do not. A deposit is not a purchase of the product, merely that he has offered the payment ahead of the time of exchange. The terms of this are clearly spelled out, and his offer is refundable at any time if an agreement (payment at price at time of purchase) is not made.  

Sasparilla: ""Sir, our terms are very clearly explained. If you do not show up for your purchase it will be sold. There is very high demand for the Xbox 1, we cannot hold it for you till Tues. At best, I can hold it to the end of saturday night.""

PG: ""You said you have to hold it 48 hours!""

Sasparilla: ""We are. From opening Friday, to closing saturday."" 

PG: ""Thats not 48 hours!""

...

Your kidding right? Your killing me here.

Sasparilla: ""From open to close Friday. And open to close saturday. Each day is 24 hours apart. This adds up to 48 hours. We can hold your console till then.""

PG: ""Well I can't make it till tues!""

Sasparilla (silently) /to f-ing bad?/

Sasparilla: ""Do you have someone who could pick it up for you?""

PG: ""I dunno, my friend could."" 

Sasparilla: ""If you pay for the console in full and provide him with the receipt, he can come in before Sat and pick up your console for you. I'll even make a note on the account that another person will pick it up for you with the receipt.""

There were a few winners that stick out in my mind from the 3 years I was  there while in high school &amp; college.
One lady was a dominatrix/ordained minister &amp; she hung up clothes at a thrift store. She always hit on the younger guys...like high school/college kids that worked there and that were customers. She was in her 40s, and looked like she had a lot of bad botox done to her face. She would have days where she would be depressed &amp; one of my friends tried to make her feel better &amp; she yelled in the aisle ""I WAS ONCE RAPED IN FRONT OF MY TWO SONS."" She used to work with part time crew (so basically the college/h.s. kids, some of them being underaged) &amp; she would pick up random stuff in the store &amp; tell the guys how it could be a sex toy. For example she picked up a flyswatter, said it's the Texas Flyswatter, pretended to slap one of the guys in the ass &amp; said ""What's your number?"" She wasn't allowed to work with us after that &amp; eventually got fired.


This one lady was straight up disgusting. She was in her late 20s, early 30s &amp; looked like she was 16. I'm not 100% sure if she was on drugs, but overall she looked pretty cracked out. She always started drama. For instance, one time she wanted other employees fired so she smeared her shit on the bathroom wall &amp; tried to blame it on other employees. Apparently her plumbing stopped working in their apartment so they shit in buckets &amp; poured it on the floor when she &amp; her family got evicted. Her kid was always sick. When she got fired from the thrift store she got hired at the local bakery...



There was a creepy man that was known as the ""shoeman"" because he handled the shoes. He was missing teeth &amp; always hit on all the women that worked there. He always made me uncomfortable. He would be hammered while on the clock half the time. I remember when we added a charity to our store, people from the charity came and had a little party to promote their charity. The shoeman was pretty wasted and shouted stuff at the heads of the charity during their presentation. He eventually got fired &amp; arrested for stealing from the woman who smeared shit on the wall's purse.
There was a lot of drugged out people in general. People coked out &amp; pill poppin like crazy. One lady used to smash a 40 oz on her break in her car &amp; do lines off her steering wheel. Another lady, who worked there for like a week, used to ask the employees if they were drug addicts. She used to be like, ""I love drugs: coke, PCP, oxycotton, you name it."" 


One lady just topped them all. We called her Crazy Cari. She was in her 40s &amp; worked with all the high school//college kids part time. She didn't do shit, I hated her on busy days. But she was pretty batshit insane. She used to come into work fucked up all the time. Our manager lived in the same apartment complex as her dealer I guess. Crazy Cari would look in her windows for her when she was all fucked up. She once came into work and was like ""I took a Xanax bar &amp; I just drank an energy drink to reverse it."" She used to just walk up and down the aisles looking confused, barely cleaning up. We called her ""Peanut"" in the beginning because we found her hiding in the production room of the store eating peanuts. Her first week, she fell asleep in a rocking chair that was on the sales floor towards the end of her shift. I couldn't comprehend why the kept her besides entertainment purposes because she was so crazy. She used to talk to the high school girls about how beautiful ballsacks were and she confided in one of the girls that the shoeman came over to her apartment and basically raped her. One of our supervisors wouldn't schedule her a lot because she would always slack off. Crazy Cari would come in &amp; yell at her saying all this random shit like ""My mom's gonna die &amp; I'm alone."" We met her mom, she was fine. She was never alone when she came to visit, she always had gross looking drugged out men with her. We brought this to the attention of the manager because she was threatening towards to the supervisor &amp; employees. He ignored us. She eventually got fired...for firing a gun at the stuffed animals.

Itorres89,3,9,1r3iy4,13,"So I'm working for a big box retail store. We just recently got a new-ish store manager. He was originally an assistant store manager but they put him in charge of another store in our city (I say ""put in charge"" because he wasn't put through STORE management training until AFTER that store closed down) and then transferred to our store as our old a$$hat of a manager got himself transferred cross country.

Anyway, this guy comes in, seems nice enough but he's barely been at our store a week and he's already drastically changing things. I've been at that store for about 4 years, he's been with the company about 2. He hasn't directly wronged me yet but he's developing a bit of a rep with the other associates for favoritism. Things are chaos. People don't even know what they'll be working for ~~Black Friday~~ yet. I'm supposed to be on the ""softlines"" side, but I'm working ""hardlines.""

I've seen my share of management changes and I've noticed that any new manager that starts trying to drastically change things right away (I'd say within the first month or so) isn't a very good manager. With him changing things this close to the holidays I'm thinking we're gonna have a bad time....

TL;DR: Newbie manager fixing what ain't broke.

Anyone else have any input/stories?

xVarekai,78,31,1r3e2x,156,"This story is a little different as it's not about a particular customer but instead about one of the most uncomfortable working experiences I've had with a manager.  I've worked on and off for a certain body care/home fragrance store, shilling overpriced lotion to the masses, and as such I've been in several stores depending on where I lived at the time and the financial state I was in.  My first and only other post can be found here:

[That's called ""stealing"".] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1j0f37/thats_called_stealing/)

and while I probably have other stories it's been a while since I had to deal with that environment, but I'll post any juicy ones I recall.

So, about this (store) manager.  I lived in a small town in the bible belt for some time, and while I hope this doesn't offend anyone I will say that I am an atheist but wasn't exactly ""out"" about it, as I'd experienced some nasty behavior in the past for simply saying I don't go to church.  

My store manager on the other hand was *very* active in her church and wasn't shy about talking about her faith.  She seemed to assume that we were all christians of one form or another, but I don't think that this is something that should be talked about in a place of business.  I've worked with people of all faiths and if you're a decent person I really don't care one way or the other.  In fact I'd prefer it not come up at all as this can lead to problems...like it did in this situation.

So it was really more a culmination of comments and assertions than an actual confrontation for a while, with me quietly holding my tongue and going about my job as best I could.  I was in a difficult spot at the time, stressed in private life and pretty depressed about my lack of direction even though I was actually able to save money for the first time.  I had taken on a minor management role that turned out to be quite a bit more than I had expected.  Some of you can probably relate.

Anyway, I'm struggling to master the many tasks and expectations of my position (I was promoted into lower management and actually moved an hour and a half to take it, so the disappointment was a bit stronger than if it had been within my previous home store) and I can tell that my manager, who we shall call ""Cindy"" from here on out, is wanting badly to get me to church.  Little things like, ""Well have you made any friends at church?"" and ""You should find a nice church to go to, you'll meet more people and feel better,"" when I confided that my personal life was a bit difficult.  I know Cindy meant well but there was no way I could really open up to her.  Plus, she wasn't exactly the model person she seemed to think she was, pitting employees against each other and having her church friends spy on the store when she took a rare day off.  I'm not sure why she delighted so much in the little gossipy things she did but the store was small and her influence made some pretty big waves at times.

One day I was about to close up the store, stooped to pick up some trash off the floor, and came up wrong under the sink overhang, giving myself a pretty solid concussion.  My SO took me to the hospital after I called HR to report the incident, where we stayed for 4 hours to be seen.  I got a note that said I needed to be off for a few days until my symptoms cleared up, and Cindy didn't like that.  She sent an email to a co-manager that I was pretty good friends with about how she didn't want me ""taking advantage of the situation"".  Lady, I had a concussion and I didn't do it on purpose.  That was pretty much the beginning of the end.

Cindy started laying it on thick, such as at management meetings where we talked about personal experiences, looking pointedly at me when she said that faith is the most important thing in her life and she doesn't know where she'd be without it.  She even did this little stunt where she gradually filled a glass with objects of varying size, saying ""If you don't leave room for faith then your bottle is never full!""  Full-on evangelical, which, again, I don't care what you do in your own time, but this is not appropriate for work.

Finally I was able to quit and started making plans with my SO to move back to my home state for a fresh start.  She and I sat down in the food court for a coaching session and she started talking about how this job wasn't really for me, and I agreed with her, saying that I was going to be turning in my two weeks.  She seemed annoyed that I was already making plans.  I thought that was it, and then before we went back to the store she looks at me intensely and asks, ""xVarekai, do you have a bible?""

Alright.  I've had enough.

I said, ""No, I don't.  And I don't think that's an appropriate question for a place of business.""

She looked as if I'd slapped her, and maybe she felt that way too.  I don't like to be confrontational or make people feel bad, but enough was enough.  I never once said anything to her when she was preaching at work, I took it quietly and let her looks of disdain and irritation wash over me.  And it's not just religion--anything that could be controversial, like politics or views about abortion, should not be discussed at work in my opinion.  It's distracting, causes problems, and can make good people make poor choices in their desire to defend themselves.

Anyway, she was stone-cold frosty to me for the duration of the two weeks and I was glad to be gone.  Some of you may say well, you should have gone to HR with that.  And yes, I probably should have.  I suppose it was the general environment and knowing that it probably would have only gotten worse if I had said anything that kept me quiet, and she has a lot of influence in that community.  So I took it until I had a way out and didn't look back.

I don't know if everyone will understand the impact of that one question to someone who is firmly without faith but it was jarring and inappropriate.  I only hope she learned something from the experience and hasn't done that to anyone else.

wigglemaster,45,23,1r3cg6,147,"So I have been reading this subreddit for a while and all of your retail horror stories help make my day manageable. Sorry if there are any formatting errors, but I am on my phone and it is my first post. 

I work in a small CPU (contract postal unit). We do everything a regular post office does, but faster and we know how to smile. We have a fairly regular customer base, and since we are small, we know a lot of them by name. One of our regulars (a little old lady who loves showing me pictures of her dog) came in today and bought a book of stamps, and put three onto her envelopes right away. We chatted for a minute, and then she went on her way. 

Ten minutes or so go by, and a girl that I haven't seen before comes in. She stops, and I see her bend down and pick something up off the floor. ""Oh look, stamps!"" She says, and waves them around.

 I reach for them, and say ""yeah, Mrs. ______ was just in here, she must have dropped them. Ill put them over here and call her.""

""But i found them. Finders keepers."" She says, almost incredulously.

""Well yes, thank you for finding them, but i know who they belong to,"" I tell her, but she wasnt having any of that morality nonsense.

 ""Im going to use them. They're paid for, who cares if it was me who paid for them?"" 

At this point I'm a little stunned... I mean, I understand keeping some stamps you saw laying on the street, but in the store after I tell you I know who they belong to? I wasn't sure how to react. I told her that I can't force her to give them back but I was sure Mrs. ______ would come back in and ask if she left them, and we had a way to contact her to give her stamps back if not.

Here's where this girl blew my mind... ""Are you calling me a thief? Because that's what it sounds like. I'm calling your manager."" And flounced out (stamps in hand) before I could even respond. 

Maybe I am making a bigger deal out of it than I should, because I know who they belong to and we're big on loyalty around here, but it bothered me.

DrChiefChef,10,9,1r31cw,32,"This tale (also my first) comes from a land of happiness and joy, right? no? okay I lied it comes from the place where Dreams go to Die. 

Ever since I was younger I always wanted to work at this theme park here in Florida, I mean I always thought it would be so cool, so when the acceptance into working for this company came I jumped on it. I've been here since May and when I thought I would be working in a kitchen or something related to my major of Culinary Arts, I was wrong. 

I currently work at one of those Popcorn and Ice cream wagons you typically see in theme parks and normally I can get through a day just because I love the people I work WITH. This is not the case of last Monday.

(technically this is retail related cause I do sell some merchandise things)

Mondays shift was from 5:45pm to 12:15am so overall not too bad. I was put at a cart that most wagons close With or Around Park closing time so I was pretty confident that I wasn't closing anything (Closing is a bitch to do when you have closed 90 percent of every week that you work, especially popcorn wagons) I get in and see my name on the closing list as closing Popcorn 1, at this point my heart sinks because that means I wont be getting out of here till at least 1am. 

The day goes by alright, until about 10:00pm (wagon closes at 10:30 for some weird reason when park is open till 12)
Here are a few minor things that just built up

* People decided that it was okay to throw money at me when paying for something
* When I ask how someones day is at least say okay or good don't ignore that I asked and just start with your order, believe it or not I do care how your day is going
* A guy came up and cut my line during the middle of a transaction with another guest and asks what happens if he dropped his frozen lemonade, well normally we would just give him a new one but since I had a hunch he was straight up lying to me I asked some questions; such as Where he dropped it (he wasn't too sure where they were) and how long ago he bought it and where (like 20 minutes ago and from this cart but not from me; huh thats funny I've been here the WHOLE DAY no break for me yet) and he said he ""thinks that their were three that dropped on the ground"" I told him without the carton or lid or some proof I could not just replace 3 free lemonades. 

(Note: I didn't even call the managers because I knew that they would just give in and give him the 3 free, I really didn't care at that point though)

And the grand prize of my shitty night ended at 10 minutes before closing. This lady comes up too my wagon and wants to buy two 12 dollar popcorn souvenir buckets so I go and grab them and start to fill them while she fishes out her card (more efficient this way, not practical I know) 

So I come back after filling these buckets and she's trying to pay with this feature that the theme park has for resort guests that is on their wrists. well it wasn't accepting her pin so I asked for her back-up which is an actual card that  they are given at check in and told to keep with them at all times because they are still beta testing the wristbands. she is all annoyed because apparently our 3 button wasn't working to enter her pin with (funny been working all day lady!) and so her husband decides he's just going to pay cash and I tell him the total. 

In the middle of me saying your total is 24 dollars the woman interrupts with ""you do have bags for these right?"" (No we don't we are a popcorn stand, we do provide handles for you to carry them with and they have lids) I tell her ""no unfortunately we don't but if you turn around and go to them they do""(literally its maybe 5 steps away there is a cart that sells merchandise stuff that has bags)  In the middle of that statement the crazy old bitch says ""are you fucking kidding me"" I just stare at her at this point she keeps rambling on about how ""fucking pissed she is that I don't have any fucking bags"" and that since I don't have any bags she will not be buying them, knocks one of them on the ground and walks away.

FredFltStn,119,322,1r2ps1,958,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  We get our fair share of Spanish speaking customers at my location, and I try to have at least one cashier working that can speak Spanish, just to smooth things along. I don’t speak very much Spanish myself, but I can understand a fair amount, thanks to two years of the language in college, and an ex-wife who spoke fluent Spanish with her family.

I had a couple of guys enter my tent and ask me if I spoke Spanish (in Spanish). I was actually busy trying to stock one of the shelves at the time, so I shook my head no and held up one finger for the universal “one moment” sign. I waved over my cashier to help them, and then went back to what I was doing.

About 10 minutes later, the two guys are shopping on the aisle across from where I was stocking, and talking to each other in Spanish. I’m really not paying much attention to them, when I thought I heard one of them say something like “She’s at the table, put it in the bag.”

I walk around the aisle, and one of the guys is holding a brick of firecrackers in one hand, and a large shopping bag from a different store in the other hand. I look in the other direction, and my cashier is at the front register checking someone out.

I walked up them smiling and said, “Bastardo barato, get out.”

The guy actually dropped the brick of firecrackers on the floor, and they both took off for the exit like I was chasing them with a chainsaw.

I think we laughed about that for a good hour after they had left.

insecure_shit_knob,30,40,1r2plz,171,"This happened last week, but I'm just now getting around to having some free time to write it. It's not a big one, just something to show how customers demand some unreasonable stuff sometimes.

So, there I am at my job, watching the front end and working on giving out breaks for my cashiers. So far it's been a slow day and I only have four more hours left to go. For the first time since taking this job, we actually have the right number of people that were scheduled with no call ins. I had been trying not to let the phrase, ""it seems like it's a good day"" go through my mind or out of my mouth because, even though I'm not superstitious, retail can make you that way. Unfortunately, my coworker let it slip out, so of course something had to happen, and I was the lucky one to get it.

So as I said, I'm giving out breaks to my cashiers, and had just finished getting the last one for the next two hours done when he appeared. I'll call him CC for confused customer, and my thoughts will be in italics.

CC-"" Excuse me, am I not important enough to have the store manager talk to me?""

*Probably not*

Me-""He's actually in a meeting with some of our other managers, can I help you instead?""

CC looks at my name badge and sees the word manager on it, so he starts to unload his complaints on me. Honestly, from the first sentence I could tell that he was complaining to complain, so I tuned him out until he got to his point. When he finally did, he told me that the clearance rack for shorts and shirts was a mixture of clearance and non clearance and he wanted to know what was what. 

*Ok*, I thought to myself, *this is something that is legitimate, I'll go back with him to get it figured out.*

I tell my coworker I'll be back in a few, and head off to the clothes. When we get there he walks me right up to rack full of shirts marked clearance. I mean it was broad as day, big white sign that said clearance $5.

CC-"" How am I supposed to know what is on sale here?""

Me-""Sir, everything is on sale on this rack. This big white sign says clearance on it, and everything hung here is $5.""

CC-""Well how am I supposed to know that? None of the tags are marked clearance.""

*Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece you dipshit*

Me-""Probably because this entire rack is full of clothes and it would make more sense to tag the entire rack instead of taking time to tag every individual piece.""

*Oh shit, I just said that out loud. I didn't say dipshit did I? Look at the customer, is he angry? No. Ok, you're good.*

CC-""Well you need to take the time to mark all of this down. You're confusing us with the way you price something. I'll wait.""

*Did he just say he'll wait? I'm not about to get a printer and print off 100 or so tags for him. Just tell him what he wants to hear and he'll leave*

Me-""Ok sir, well since I'm the front end manager and not the clothing manager, I'll go let him know and he'll get it taken care of. Have a good day.""

CC-""Are you going to get him now? Because I don't have enough time to wait long, so he needs to start now so I can be sure you're doing the job right.""

*I'm going to murder your face*

Luckily, the clothing manager showed up right before I was going to take my box cutter out and joker his ass. I explained to him what the deal was and what the customer wanted. Then an amazing thing happened! The manager explained to the customer exactly what I just explained, and the customer understood! He grabbed what he wanted and started to walk off, but not before looking at me and saying,

""If you would've just told me in the first place that everything was $5, it would've been easier, wouldn't it?""

*Hold me back, I'm about to cut his artery and see if I can make the blood hit the ceiling*

Me-""I did explain that sir. You just didn't understand apparently. I have to go back to my job now, have a nice day.""

Later on, the manager came up to me and told me not to sweat him. He dealt with him the past, and the guy claimed that everything he was buying was on clearance, including the brand new winter coats that the manager had just opened and put on the racks.

I'm really thinking of quitting and finding another job. One that doesn't involve people.

dichotomies,9,30,1r2lgs,15,"Here’s a story that I have never forgotten from my time working as a Personal Banker for a large nationwide bank (not BoA). It happened several years ago. 


The story starts about a week prior in a dream. I rarely remember my dreams, but this one stuck out to me. I remembered many details, from how things were said, and the feelings expressed. I woke up and I continued thinking about the dream; it was a dream filled with a heavy emotion that was difficult to shake off after waking up. 


Fast forward to “today.” I sit down and help a 20 something customer (“John”) who is sorting out his dad’s accounts. John’s dad died a couple weeks prior in a horrible bike accident in Texas. A semi plowed into him. As a cyclist myself we spoke a little bit about it. But, moving on. We have paperwork to do. I take the death certificate and have it reviewed by our legal department (I faxed it to them). As I am talking to John I see that his dad made his son (John) and daughter (“Sarah”) beneficiaries (POD = payable on death). This makes it easier for beneficiaries to bypass an estate process by making a private arrangement with the bank. After having the death certificate approved by the legal department, and verifying John’s ID, I start to talk to John about his dad’s accounts. I mention that Sarah is also on the account and that we will be cutting two checks, “one made out to each of you.” 


Now, this is before smartphones and he doesn’t have the number for his sister on his phone. I think it was because she had just moved or something. John had an address book with him and said, “I’m pretty sure it’s in here. Let me take a look.”


It was at this point that it all clicked into place for me. It was an immediate sensation of a vault coming unlocked and creaking open. I knew, for at least the next minute, exactly what was going to happen. I have never had this sensation before, or after. Normally I get this feeling after something happens (déjà vu). This time I felt like I was observing my own dream unfold before my eyes.


He looks through his address book and can’t find his sister’s number. A guy in his mental state could certainly be unsure of things, or where he wrote things down, so he continues looking in his pile of paperwork for her number. I have to bite my lip to not say anything. I KNOW that his sister’s number is right in his address book. I am so confident that I want to say, “No, it’s in there. Look again.” I only kept my mouth shut because the last thing I want to do is freak out a distraught son, bereaving the unexpected death of his father. John ends up looking through his paperwork for a short bit, then looks again in his address book. He finds it this time. 


I honestly can’t remember why we needed to call her (this was about 10 years ago), but I do remember the feeling I had when he started looking in his address book as if it were yesterday.


As I told this story you might have been thinking, “But this sounds trivial and minor, what gives?” Well, I feel that the events that I remembered from my dream happened a week later in real life enough, and I knew it while I was experiencing it. That is kinda freaky. 


I am an agnostic, and this has certainly been enough for me to keep my mind open. Just thought that I’d share with you guys. Thanks for reading.

Taco Shops, parcel delivery, finance and computer geekdom. Where will we go today?

- - -

**Today is boxes; Shall we begin?**

I’ve written a couple times before about my stretch with the largest parcel delivery service.

My job was to sort packages that went to a group of six different ZIP code in San Diego. Occasionally, a box would show up that did not belong in my area. Sometimes, it’s because of a mistake farther down the line, or it could be a bad address (street does not belong in ZIP code), or it could be a major fuck-up caused by someone believing an address or ZIP belonged to me, when it did not.

This is about a major fuck up.

At the beginning of the shift, the unloaders (people who emptied out the massive silver trailers) and the “presorters” (people who divided the unloaded boxes on to nine belts - one of which went to me), were under the impression that a large mail-order company was now in my area. It was not. But that didn’t stop them from sending a couple hundred misrouted boxes my way.

When I would get a misrouted box, I would toss it on to a return belt near my feet (if it was small enough). If it was too large, or if the belt near my feel got backed up, the box had to go to one of six guys in my area. This pissed them off when it happened, because they had to touch something that did not belong to them. (technical note: this company is absolutely insane with logistics; they preach the art of touching something a few times as possible).

I did my best to distribute the load as fairly as possible. So as the crap came in, I rotated the victim. Everyone except Badass-Ponytail was understanding.

Badass-Ponytail started yelling insults after each misrouted box reached him. Over the course of the first two hours, I got called: asshole, faggot, fucker, mother fucker, pussy, pansy, goddamn piece of shit, mongoloid (surprised at this one, since it required knowing what it meant), blind, inbred, etc). Loudly.

The environment was pretty permissive of this type of banter. It was a dirty, shitty environment, and there was absolutely no decorum. This may have changed over the years, but in this era, there was zero censorship.

Permissive or not, personal or not, I had enough. It wasn't my fault, and there was zero I could do about it. So, I gave everyone else a break and started sending 100% of the misrouted load to Badass-Ponytail. I mean, if I’m going to get abused, I might as well give him a reason.

Box after box went to him. He very quickly got backed up, since he couldn’t handle is regular workload on top of the crap. His anger started boil. He was getting truly and sincerely angry. The verbal assault gained volume, and he started calling out for a supervisor. A supervisor did arrive, and wrongly assumed I was still evenly distributing the crap. So he told Badass-Ponytail to stop being a baby.

At the hour three mark, he exploded. He began throwing boxes at me from about 15 feet away. I shut my belt down, turned around and played wide receiver. He threw, I caught, then stuck the box back on his belt. After a couple minutes of this, I was grinning like an idiot and started flipping his off after each catch.

“You’re gonna die motherfucker!”

Badass-Ponytail jumped up to his own conveyor belt and began to rush me. He is both larger and stronger than I am, and I knew that if there was any actual violence, I would likely get thrashed. So I grabbed the heaviest box I could find and held it up like a shield.

He charged into me, and I thrust the box into his chest, causing him to lose balance. Instead if hitting me, he had to right himself, or he’d fall about three feet onto a steel grate.

After stumbling, his mind cleared. “One more fucking misroute and I’m going to kill you after work.”

“Fuck you, you retarded piece of shit. You’re gonna get everything for the rest of the day unless you close your fucking mouth. As for after work, just try. I’ll fucking flatten you and strangle you with your ponytail.”

Now, I said a lot of stuff working here. It was very typical of me to speak of my physical abilities in terms that far exceeded reality. I mean, if I saw him waiting for me, I’d run to my car like a frightened gazelle and never look back. I hate fighting, and had managed to avoid it since middle school.

But it worked, and he backed down. “Look, hand the stuff out fairly and we’ll be cool. But you keep fucking with me and we’ll have a problem.”

I punctuated the encounter with another middle finger salute, but went back to being “fair” again. No asses were kicked that day.

I sincerely hope the culture has improved at San Diego Sunrise. Looking back, I laugh and cringe at how awful the environment was. Everywhere else I’ve working in life, both of us would have been fired on the spot. And we would *deserve* it.

cono1717,19,9,1r1w6q,51,"**Background**: I work the phones for a Home Store - basically it sells all the large items you have in your house, white goods, furniture e.t.c - I work in the escalation department, the place where all the sucky calls go - because of this I constantly travel. 


Story Time:

**Sort out what isn't your job to sort**

Had a lady transferred to me by a new starter, new starter took some payment over the phone but the account needed not to be paid so I get the call

Me: Hi there! You're through to [supervisor floor] how can I help?

SC: Yeah that guy just took my money
(OH NOES YOU'VE BEEN ROBBED!)

Me: Okay and what was that for?

SC: OH MY GOD IT WAS TO PAY OFF MY BALANCE ON MY LOAN

*aaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnndddddddd stop*

Me: Ah ok sir, the loans for personal items are taken with [loan company]

Sc: Yeah?

Me: Well err, we don't deal with them because you're loan is with them

SC: Well can't you pay it off?

Me: Well no sir, because it's your loan. 

*Rinse and repeat* 

Like seriously, its like buying something on a credit card and going to the store and saying I want to pay off my credit card...GO DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP CALLING YOU FOR THEIR MONEY!


**Second story, same day**

**Oh no it's your fault**

We have different depots that deal with different areas of the country, sometimes sales teams in H/O can change the default depot to something that might have it in stock, problem here is its on the other side of the country and you know can't travel through time and space - Every sales person knows (and it even tells the during the order process) to tell the customer delivery may be a few days later than their confirmation email since we have to get authorisation from a manager to ship it.

We get a call from H/O

Ho: Yeah err I have a customer on the line who was told he was getting delivery today and it hasn't arrived
me: Oh ok what's the details if you please

I check the order and nope, no one said nothing about delivery from our end

H/O: ""Well the customer is expecting it""
(I'm expecting to win the powerball but lookey here)

What's worse is the sales guy just kept saying the same thing, like literally ""Hes expecting it today"" no resolution, no ideas to the point I had to ask ""WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO""

He says he'll deal with it... 20 mins later we get a call, the customer called. I enter the details to see a note has been put on by our H/O that they told the customer to call us...Yeah thanks for that ass-socks now I get to explain the same thing all over again.

I explain to the customer he needed to wait for the auth from a manager before we could ship it out, he asked if he could cancel his order, I said unfortunately not.

Then. Karma. Came.

He paused and said ""Can I cancel it with them and take it with you?""

Usually we would say no, but I said ""Well if we were to do the order for you we wouldn't need the authorisation"" he replied with ""I demand you do it""

""Anything to keep the customer happy sir"" &lt;- at this point there was no suckyness from his part, he knew that there was a game that needed to be played and he knew that if this was brought to the big wigs he can say he demanded it and I just did what the customer wanted.

So we went ahead and did it, and I pocketed a nice commission (I can now afford a dessert at my hotel!!)

endersp,15,23,1r1w3p,78,"So I was fired from the big blue box store a few months ago, it wasn't a b.s. firing, I did what I did and I understood their side of it, anyway during my exit interview I told I could reapply in two months, I told them thank you I'll keep that in mind (I have a policy of never burning a bridge with a manager, for references) and preceded to gtf out and enjoy my sudden freedom before reality sinks in.

Fast forward to yesterday, I have a wonderful job working in a warehouse with fellow temperamental psychopaths and I get a call labeled ""work"" on my caller id, knowing it's the box store I quickly mask my hatred and answer. It's the good manager, let's call her the blue berry (she was HUGE! like 'murrica huge) BB for short, conversation goes as such.

Me: Hello?

BB: Is Ender there?

Me: this is him

Bb: Ender this is BB from ~~The 4th circle of hell that you never want to go back to~~ The Box Store, I was calling to inform you that your able to reaply in our system again and we would love to have you back.

Me: thank you for the call, if I was hired would I get my full-time and old pay again?

BB: no, unfortunately you would go back down and we only have part time available but we would still love to have you back, produce hasn't had a good opener since you left.

Me: thank you for the call but I have a new job (part time) that I would only leave for a full-time position, I will keep it in mind though

BB: well thank you for your time, and I hope your job works out for you.

After this conversation I fly into range mode, what the actual fuck, why fire me just to regret it and try to get me back two months later, why? Did it piss you off that I had full-time and a decent pay I could genuinely live off to a degree so I was never scared of your hour cut threats?

jorcoga,42,38,1r1ut3,160,"So we do breakfast products until 11am. Unlike our closest competitor, we also sell our daytime products in the morning (though I am judging you quietly but immensely for ordering a grilled chicken burger at 6:30 in the morning). Our competitor also stops selling breakfast half an hour earlier than we do, and because this company is slightly more prominent, people get us confused. I get yelled at probably once a week for not being able to sell apple pies.

Anyway, it's 10:55. There are two very hungover teenagers in line, who look like they've been awake for maybe ten minutes. There's also an old lady, her arrival heralding the imminent beginning of what I like to call the 'old people rush' where our youngest customer for the next half an hour will still be entitled to a free cup of coffee on account of being old. They all like to go on and on about how much nicer our store is when it's quiet, all the while getting to listen to my managers freak out because I'm not hurrying them along whilst they dutifully count out seven bucks worth of five cent pieces.

Anyway, the hungover teens get to my till, and immediately want to know if we're still selling breakfast.

""We sure are, what can I get for you?""

Before they can respond, I hear an old lady pipe up with ""No, you can't be selling breakfast!"" I think it best to ignore her, this is far from the weirdest customer I've ever had and this seems to be effective enough. I finish the hungover teenager's order, they head to the back of our front counter area to wait. I hand out their food, and they go and sit down in one of the seats that is clearly visible from where I'm standing. The old lady walks over and starts yelling at the top of her voice at them.

""What are you doing, eating breakfast this late? Why would you do that, breakfast is FINISHED! You made these poor people make breakfast for you when it's clearly lunch time! You should be ashamed!""

Now obviously I can't just let some little old lady harass these two, even if they're doing a terrible job of stifling laughter. I walk over.

""Excuse me, is everything ok?""

""No! These people are exploiting you!""

""Oh, how did they do that?""

""They made you make them breakfast when it's clearly lunch time!""

""Well, our breakfast menu is still available, and they can order from it if they want to.""

""No, you're wrong! It's not breakfast any more!""

""I assure you, it was no trouble for us to make muffins and cook hash browns.""

""Why are you defending them? They clearly made your job harder!""

""Well no, that'd be what you're doing.""

I walked off, she did too. She never did order anything, despite the fact that she'd been camped out in the store for half an hour reading the newspaper. I'm still not sure why a probably 80 year old woman thought she knew my store policy better than I did, but there you go!

jenbenfoo,5,10,1r1rl7,4,"So, I work in the deli at a chain superstore prominent in the Midwest. I've shared a few stories before, but I thought you guys would enjoy this one. Its a nice short story about a guy who can't maths.

So this guy comes up to the counter and asks for there fourths of a pound of turkey or ham or whatever. Okay, no problem. I grab it out of the cooler, get it set up on the slicer, and as I start slicing, I verify with him how much he wanted. ""Sir, did you want half a pound or three quarters?"" He looked back to me and said, ""no, I want three fourths!"" He wasn't rude about it, and I got a chuckle out of it. I gave him his 75% of a pound and sent him on his merry way and went on with my day, waiting eagerly to come home and post this.","No, I said three fourths!",14
shadowmanwkp,12,18,1r1q8g,60,"**Preface**: I work at a Dutch chain store where we sell a variety of things: food, furniture, curtains, cutlery, and a lot more. We're most well-known for selling stuff from abroad and selling it at a reasonable price. Payout may be a bit above minimum wage, but my colleagues are awesome, and my manager is a really great guy.


Being in the Netherlands there's one thing that is even bigger than Christmas: Sinterklaas. If you're not in the know, Sinterklaas is about the same as Christmas, but with the bishop of Myra st. Nicholas coming all the way from Spain to the Netherlands, supported by his personal army of black petes. Last saturday it was the great inception, because old saint Nick, would come into my town with his steam boat. This being one of the biggest events in town of the year and us being in front of the square where saint Nick will be coming, you can imagine that it is very busy at our store when it happens.


**Onto the story at hand**: Our manager warned us before we got started that the amount of thefts is increasing these days. There were about a dozen of armbands stolen from our store the other day, leaving only the cartons. Because we have no detection gates, stealing is easy, but we barely if ever have any thefts, unless it is holiday season. This warning stuck with me the whole day and it was a good thing it did.


Out of our three registers we had two open near the end of the morning, we were still anticipating saint Nick's arrival in town, but that would turn out to be the end of the day... Just to be sure that we had enough registers open, I was near the registers so I could keep an eye on the amount of customers in queue, and man the third register if needed. 


In comes the group of five ten-year-olds, racing past our registers, and jumping onto the candy, which is just before me, already making me suspicious, because usually people will ask us whether or not it is ok to come in through the wrong side. I keep an eye on them, as they enthusiastically discuss what they will buy. **Nearly instantly a customer waiting in line says that they probably are stealing, now I'm on high alert.** 


As one of them goes past the registers, I see him with his hand in his pocket. Immediately as he brushes past me, I ask him: 


**Me**: Do you have anything in your pocket?


He immediately removes his hand from his pocket and begins sticking them up in the air.


**Pocket kid**: No I don't! Search me all you want I don't have anything!


Well, that's a response that shows a **lot of guilt** and makes you suspicious all the more. However, we don't search customers, so I let him off the hook. Just when I finished with pocket kid, from the corner of my eye one of the kiddo's has a pack of chewing gum in his hand. Just as I turn fully around, it is vanished.


I get angry, really angry, even if you're young, that doesn't mean that shoplifting isn't a crime, so I raise my voice a little and say: **""You there! I know you've got chewing gum in your pocket so don't forget to pay for it!""**


The kid is flabbergasted and I am on my way for my lunch break (we are very strict with them on busy days), I see my boss on the way and I quickly inform him about the situation. He tells me he will keep an eye on the situation.


During lunch break, I review my own actions towards those kids, maybe they're going to step up to their parents? Maybe my boss didn't like the way I handled the situation? Anyways, I wanted to talk to my boss, because I was doubting myself. I got my grub and the lunch break end. At this point there are more people in the store, so we open up all the registers to be able to service all customers. Along the way I inform my boss that I want to talk to him. It wasn't very busy, but it's better to be safe than sorry, so I keep working at the register. I help some customers and generally have a blast working.


Suddenly, two girls come up to my register, just barely tall enough for me to see them over the counter. They are being very sweet and ask me if they could ask how much a key chain costs. With a genuine smile, I tell them that it will set them back around €2.50. It's a bit steep for them, so they tell me they want to ask their father to pay for them. I offer them to let me hang on to it, so they can simply walk up to the register and pay for it when they get back, they happily oblige.


I get on with my work, and it gets a bit busier, so I didn't see the girls, nor their dad. It takes an hour or two before one of the girls comes back with their mother:


**Me**: Hello, how may I help you?

**Mom**: Hello, my daughter had interest in a key chain

**Me**: Ah, yes she was here earlier and asked about the price, I believe it's this one?

I show the key chain and the girl confirms it's the one


Just when the mother wants to pull out the money, she suddenly stops:


**Mother**: What's that in your pocket?

**Girl**: Nothing...

**Mother**: Come on, show me what's it


The girl pulls out an I &lt;3 beer key chain


**Mother**: Where did you get this from?

**Girl**: From somebody.


I am a bit doubtful, so I ask the mother if I could check it. I don't recognize it, because we sell dozens of the bloody things, so I flip it over to see if I recognize the markings. Lo and behold, they were identical to the key chain I held onto for the girl.


**Me**: Madam, the markings are the same as the key chain from our store


My boss passes by and he says in a very polite way I would never be able to pull off:


**Boss**: Madam it is from our store


Usually parents do not keep their cool if they catch their kid stealing, after all, you taught them **not to do it** and they still do. This woman however, kept her cool and pulled it off in style:


**Mom**: Now, be honest with me, where did you get this from?  
**Girl**: From somebody in the store.  
**Mom**: No that's not true, we know that you got it from the store. Did you take it without permission?


The girl keeps totally silent, obviously embarrassed by the whole ordeal. The mom waits a little bit to see if her daughter will form a response, but nothing. She respectfully asks her daughter:


**Mom**: Would you like to apologize to the mister in front of you?  
**Girl**: ...  
**Mom**: Come on, apologize  
**Girl**: ^I'm ^sorry  
**Me**: Apology accepted


I feel like a moron asking this, but still, it's an honest question:


**Me**: Madam, do you still want to buy they key chain, despite all this?  
**Mother**: No, it was a present for her, because she was behaving well. However, because she did this, I won't buy it for her  
**Me**: That's ok, I wish you a nice day anyways  
**Mother**: A good day to you as well


The day turned out to be mediocre, saint Nick came and went, and we didn't have as many customers as we hoped. But I didn't forget to make a talk with my boss, so when we only needed two registers open, I asked a colleague to man the register in my place, and I asked my boss if I could talk with him in the back. I make him some coffee and we begin to talk:

**Me**: Well, I hope you know why I wanted to talk?  
**Boss**: Yeah I do  
**Me**: Well, I wasn't really certain if I responded the right way towards those kids this morning, I'm a bit afraid that their parents might come back, because I didn't really follow protocol  
**Boss**: No, not at all! You did the right thing. Although what you've said might have been a bit direct, you did overhear from the customers that those kids might have stolen something. And that thing with the girl was also handled well, you did great today!


Well that was a load off my chest.

For a majority of the time, I've been the designated punching bag (aka ""guest services"") in the store. I run the phones, announcements, returns, special orders, cashiering, complaints, etc. in my little box. 

Today was a surprisingly slow day, but it was nearing our closing time so everyone was trying to rush out. We had a line of maybe 6 or 7 parties, and I was checking people out along with 2 other cashiers. Our line is designed so people have to snake around several twists and turns. Around the last turn of the register, I noticed one of my cashiers away from her station and speaking with some guests. No one in the group seemed very happy. The cashier checked the guests out while I was paying close attention because the guests were yelling and grumbling. I figured I'd be seeing them very soon.

I was right.

Not two minutes later did this middle aged woman with more black eyeliner on than a panda come sprinting over to my station (cutting off the customers coming to check out with me in the process!).

HER: ""You need to tell your cashier to stop licking my stuff!""

ME: ""Uh, excuse me ma'am?""

HER: ""You need to tell that lady over there to stop licking everything. She keeps sticking her fingers in her mouth before she touches my stuff! That's so nasty and gross!""

ME: ""Was she just wetting her finger tips trying to page through paper or something?"" (I don't like it when people do that, and we even have finger wetting stuff to use instead of spit, but I thought I'd try to clarify)

HER: ""NO! She was licking her fingers before touching MY STUFF! I think I will need to exchange all of my items to ones she didn't *lick*. You need to tell her she's nasty.""
*She pantomimes licking her fingers*

HER: ""Here. I want to buy this so I don't have to carry all of those nasty bags she licked.""

WhatsAnEnigma,16,7,1r1dog,19,"First time using Alien Blue on my phone. 



So this is more of a question than a tale. It's my first time working in a store that sells the prepaid green dot cards. 




I work in a corner store in the south. A guy comes in and wants to put 300$ on a Green Dot card. He gives me a handful of 20$'s that reeks of weed. No biggie. I don't care where you get your money. I ring him up. Have a nice day. 




He comes back an hour later telling me the card doesn't work. I try to explain the directions, he gets frustrated and leaves. He comes back and tries to tell me I did it wrong. I again try to explain the directions, he gets frustrated and leaves. And let me just say now that he was very, very ""southern"" so he was hard to understand when he talked so I was a little frustrated too. 




I go to lunch and when I get back he's walking to my car and asks me for a cigarette because ""I obviously don't have any money since this card screwed me over"". I have to admit I was a little scared when he walked towards me because of how upset he was at me in the store.  But then he apologizes about accusing me of messing up and says he called the card company and they said the card was screwed up and they would send him a refund check. I feel very uncomfortable but I tell him that I'm glad they'll fix it for him. He walks back to his car and I think ""gee, that's a pretty expensive car for a for a guy who's barely 20"".  But whatever. Lucky guy I guess. But it weirded me out that he was still in the parking lot even though he fixed the problem with green dot. 





Clock back in and watch the guy in the parking lot. He comes back in and gets another 300$ Green Dot since the other one was bad. I don't understand where he got the cash since he told me he doesn't have money for cigs. But I don't ask questions cuz I'm new to this job and I just do what I'm told. He buys it and leaves. And then sits in the parking lot for another hour. I mention how weird this whole thing is to my manager but he just rolls his eyes. I think that maybe he's just offended at the fact that I mentioned the weed smell and he seems like a really conservative guy so I stop talking about it because I want to keep my job and I don't want him to think bad about me and the fact that I mentioned weed. (I seriously need this job so I get really paranoid).  




Well. The guy comes back in and buys two more cards at 150$ a piece. But this time he comes in with another guy who hangs around the door like they aren't together. I'm just really weirded out because they're acting like they don't know each other. Then they leave and sit in the parking lot for an hour. I don't mention it again to my manager because he acted like I shouldn't worry about it. 





The guys leave. I leave and then find out the next day from another employee that actually listened to me that the guy came back for more cards twice before the manager told him to leave because there's a green dot limit. 




So....what was this guy doing?

Now it had been an hour or so since I had last had anyone in the store, so I was itching to sell something when Mom and Kid came in. I jumped up and gave them my spiel, and they assured me they were fine and were just looking. Well a few minutes go by when Kid and Mom come up to me with, you guessed it, GTA 5 in hand. Kid has that look of pure bliss on his face. The one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his 360 and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun. Except there is one thing between him and that future. A fell and powerful guardian. That would be me.

I should take this time to mention that for the most part I don't like telling people they can't buy something. It is sad not only because I'm missing out on a sale, but I'm also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you. ""Your card was declined,"" ""You have to be 17 or older to buy this,"" etc are phrases I dislike. Except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world. For you, the entitled, the bratty, the liars, the assholes, the pricks, the scammers, the schemers, etc. To you, I find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fattening.

Back to the story. So whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a M rated game, I am required by law to ask for an ID or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen. Now most parents fall into one of two general categories: The ""I don't care, I just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money"" type, and the ""I'm actually have an idea about what is going on here and I'm totally cool with it, now take my money"" type. Those are the ones that just say yes and, having done my duty and covering my ass legally, I move on and make the sale. Not Mom. No, when I tell her about the M rating, she actually stops and ASKS ME WHY ITS M RATED. My heart stopped. I heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when Mario picks up a coin. This honestly never happens. I've worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed. Kid's heart drops at this. But you can still see hope in his eyes, hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming ""Dude...be cool."" 

NOPE!

I like my job, and I like to think I do it well. I'm paid to play and talk about games from the Atari on up to the PS4 and Xbox One afterall. So when someone asks me about a game, I'm going to tell you EVERY THING about it. And thats just what Mom gets. 

First blow: Language. Mom's approval doesn't take any visible damage; Kid is optimisitc and reassures Mom he is mature enough to handle it.
Quick second punch: Drugs and alcohol. I think I saw a grimace....but Mom recovers quickly. Kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like Wormtongue in LoTR.
I'm getting serious now: Violence. Finally, a crack in the armor. Mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure Kid REALLLY wants this game and can handle it. Kid puts on his most mature look *I swear if he had a tux, monocle, and top hat, he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion* He does, he can, he could pay the damn mortgage right now he's that mature.
You're doing well in keeping the situation favorable Kid, but I have a secret weapon: Nudity. Yep, as some of you know, GTA 5 didn't get the 'partial nudity' rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob. Nope. Now this is what Kid feared was coming and hoped I either didn't know, or wasn't going to share it, but I did. Critical hit. TKO. Mom was out. She refused to get it, and told Kid he wasn't going anywhere near that game until he was old enough. I thought that was the end of it but damn, Kid was quick on his feet. He played the ""Friends already have it"" card followed quickly by ""dad will be okay with it, call him.""

So she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him, meanwhile I'm left in the store getting the most venom/hate/spite/rage filled look I've seen. Seriously, I think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me. Not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff. Oh no, I mean slow and painful, years of torture kind. Well Mom comes back in and is on the fence again. Apparently Dad wasn't against it, but she still was. I'm given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what I told her, and I do, and Mom gets the phone back. This time she stays in the store and I must have convinced Dad because this time she hangs up and tells Kid he is not getting the game. 

Reddit, let me tell you I have seen some tantrums, explosions, complete personality turn arounds, etc in my time but DAMN! Kid takes the cake. All illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book. He screams, he threatens, he cries, he begs, every thing. I would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly 30 minutes, so I'll just give you my three favorite parts because I can remember those nearly verbatim. 

Favorite 1: Kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly, but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage. Why is this hilarious? Because while doing all this he is telling Mom that he is mature enough to handle the game, and that the nudity isn't even a main part of it and he won't look at it, and he doesn't have to do it, etc. Except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission. So yeah. Also the tantrum technique? Not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for something

Favorite 2: The ""xxx has it so screw you I'll just play it there."" Now kudos to Mom, she handled this like a pro. Her response ""You won't when I call every one of your friends' parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game. I'm also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playing""

Favorite 3: This one was just stupid, which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious. Kid yells at Mom telling her he doesn't need her and he'll just come back and buy the game in a few days himself. Mom, not fazed or even looking at me, asks me if he could buy it without her. To help her get her point across I ask if he is 17, she assures me he isn't, and I tell them that without an ID proving he is 17 or older no one can legally sell him that game.

The night ends with her dragging his bawling, snot dripping, raging ass out of my store, apologizing profusely for his antics, and before they get out of earshot I can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments he's going to recieve after his behavior. 

Reddit, I love moments like that. It had it all: Drama, laughter, lies, betrayal, threats, crying, bargaining, and a parent actually acting like a parent. 

Oh, and Kid was about 15 by the way. Be honest, you all thought he was 10 didn't you? 

I've got 4 years of tales piled up if you want more.

GrimGuy,29,14,1r0zg2,92,"The longest tract of my retail years is time spent at a large video game retailer. This particular story occurs on the very day that I had been taken out of 'training' at a small store and installed as the assistant manager at a very high volume location. I don't really know what I'm doing yet, much less this new store. 


It was a weekday morning in the summer and rather dead. The store manager and other employee had abandoned me to the cash wrap and sequestered themselves away in the break room. I was doing this and that when a dude comes in asking for a cable to get stuff from his laptop onto his PSP(first gen). No problem, I get him the cable and send him on his way.


Hours pass and my shift is coming to an end. The guy from earlier returns, this time with his PSP and laptop in hand. Now, I'm a video game store rookie at this point - but I know that no good can come of this. It's mid-afternoon now and the store isn't packed, but there's the standard crowd of feral children, meandering parents, and other miscellaneous types. None of them are at the counter, though, so I get to deal with Mr. PSP.

His problem, so he informs me, is that he doesn't know how to access the things once they've been shifted to the PSP. Before I can say a word, he has it all set up on my counter and powered up. With a standard Retail Sigh, I ignore his computer and look at the handheld a while. He definitely moved some files over, so I walk him through it and show him where the files are stored and that's that. Right?


Not so. He still doesn't understand. He asks me to open one up so he can see. I walk through it more slowly, then pick a random file - as they all had random strings of numbers as filenames. I say ""Okay, see, you just go to this and open it...""
The screen goes dark for a moment, then a whole bunch of grainy text appears briefly. I don't see much, but I see enough to notice some 'copyright notice' stuff...and perhaps(definitely) more importantly, an 'all models were 18 at the time of filming' notice. Now keep in mind, this flashed by very quickly and at this point, the thing is back in his hands. 

Next up, a blue screen stating that something like ""Boy Joy Proudly Presents!"" and then a heartbeat later? Instant hardcore man on man. Did I mention he had the volume all the way up? Because he did. Did I mention we're standing side by side at this point, shoulder to shoulder, closely peering at this thing? Because we were. Did I mention that the gentlemen involved in the video were VERY vocal about their appreciation of one another's efforts? Because oh, they were!

A frantic scramble ensues, much too late to prevent the entire store from knowing exactly what's going on, and the dude looks at me wide-eyed. ""I don't know how that got there!"" He says. ""I don't like that! That wasn't on my PSP! I don't have that on my computer!""

I could only manage out a flat ""Well it wasn't on the cable."" before I went in the back room and sat down quietly for a long time.

verynotberry,14,5,1r0rm7,43,"I've been out of retail for several years, but I still look back on those days with horror and nostalgia.  I worked in a store in a smaller town, where you aren't always slammed and get to know your customers.  There was one family I'll always remember with fondness.  They would happily wait in a line several people deep just to go through my lane and I loved them for it. I looked forward to their visits. These were truly kind, wonderful people.

However, there were also the jerks.  The guy I'm going to tell you about is one of those.  Now, normally when someone would be a jerk to me, I would tend to write it off.  It's not personal, I'm not verynotberry, I'm the cashier.  If it happened every time they came in to the store, that was another story.  This particular guy was always short and rude with me and my fellow cashiers.  Talked down to us, treated us like idiots, the lot.  But one day, one glorious day, I got my petty revenge.

He came through my line and threw some bills and coins on the counter to pay for his purchases.  While counting the change, I noticed a Canadian penny.  This store was in the U.S.  So . . . not legal tender.  I tell coin man, CM, for short that I can't accept his penny.

CM:  What?  Why not?

Me:  Well, it's not legal tender.  

CM:  Why not? 

Me:  Well, this is a Canadian penny and we are not in Canada, so I cannot accept this.

&lt;bear in mind, I'm smiling and as friendly as I could possibly be&gt;

CM:  What?  That's bull----.  Just take the d--n penny!   (Truly, he was a gifted debater.)

Me:  Well, sir, I would, but outside the boundaries of Canada, this is not legal tender, so I cannot accept this.

CM:  I PROBABLY GOT THIS PENNY FROM THIS STORE!  

&lt;Because I know I always remember where I get each and every one of my coins, don't you?&gt;

Me:  Sir, if that is true, I am terribly sorry to hear that we are giving out the wrong coins and I will surely tell a manager about it so that we can keep a better eye out for them, but as it stands, I will need an American penny.

(It's important to note that throughout this entire process, he had his hands in his pockets jangling what must have been several dollars' worth of coins.)

CM:  Oh Jesus.  Fine.

He throws a penny on the counter.  I hand him the Canadian penny back with the biggest, kindest, most customer-friendly smile.

Me:  Thank you so much, sir.  Please have a nice day.

Now, if this had been any of our other customers, I would have taken the penny no questions asked because, hey, the American and Canadian pennies are practically identical when you look at them quickly, so it's easy to miss.  I truly believe the gods of karma were smiling down on me that day by not only getting me to notice the penny, but also to allow me to have this moment to make a small stand for my fellow cashiers and get back at a man who always tried to make us feel small.

It felt amazing!

LadyGrizabella,8,8,1r0pr6,18,"When we have our bookfairs, generally sometime during that week we have a breakfast event to try and get parents up there to spend money--Donuts With Dad, Muffins with Mom, that sort of thing.

So this morning, I haul ass out of the house and spend exactly 10 minutes nomming down a slightly stale frosted blueberry donut (which later made me sick to my stomach) and some reconstituted from powder orange juice with my son so that I could go down and work the book fair.

I'm standing there, bagging stuff up for Mrs. BorgImplant (the librarian) when a dad comes up to me.

Me: Hi. How can I help you?

Random Dad: Yeah..do you happen to have the Lego minifig that goes with this?

And he hands me one of these large Lego minifig dictionaries (we have several--regular general minifigs, one that's Ninjago and a Harry Potter one). Now the minifig dictionaries/encycolpedias generally have a cutout bit on the front cover that has a plastic container inside that contains a minifig.

Only with this particular dictionary, the minifig has been taken out. It's not difficult to do, to be honest. It's designed to be easy to open for the kids, I guess. Since the minifig was ripped off, we offered to give the dad a $5 discount off the price (it was $40) but he declined and I shoved it in the back with the rest of the books that had shit ripped off them. We get a good number of books, mostly paperback, that have cheap crappy jewelery attached and those things get ripped off all the damn time.

Mrs. BorgImplant took the theft in stride but I was kind of miffed because that was $40 bucks we could've made but didn't get to because some kid had to be a Lightfinger Louie.

Gimick,8,9,1r0n8k,27,"I work at an office/warehouse where I deal mostly in shipping and receiving. We are technically a distributor, so usually we only deal with wholesale purchases, but because we offer a warranty on a brand that is actually a product we manufacture, we also answer calls about defective merchandise. 

In the industry I work in, almost no one on the retail level does returns on the type of merchandise we make/distribute. We get a couple of calls a day about problem merchandise, where they always explain to us the retailer will not honor a refund. Fine. It's no big deal, we usually just replace it. 

I get a call from a woman who is having trouble with our product. I go through the motions to make sure it's not just some kind of user error, and try to figure out the best and fastest way to solve the problem. She told me what was wrong with her item and I determined she needed to be sent a new one.

I ask her for her information and notice I just took a call from the exact same address. Well, naturally I have to ask about it. It turns out her daughter had just called about a different problem with a different item and had to be sent a replacement as well. It is odd, but not unheard of, so I let it go.

After I get the information I need to process the replacement order, I double check to make sure I am going to send the right product. At this point the woman chimes in that I need to send two. Hmm.

I assume she meant her daughters order, and try to explain to her that I had already packaged that order, and that both would arrive on the same day. She corrected me, telling me that is not what she meant.

She then goes on to explain to me that I need to send her two of the same item to replace the item that she had trouble with. I try to figure out why, which results in her giving me an immensely long story that in no way related to why she should receive two of an item to replace the one that she bought.

I repeatedly try to get her back on track, as I would rather not dally on the phone all day. Eventually I get to the reason why she feels she deserves two.

Apparently instead of calling when her item broke, she opted to purchase a second item to temporarily replace her broken item. It is also possible that it was meant to be a permanent replacement, but after seeing how easy a time her daughter had with our replacement policy she might of opted to go through the process for her own item. That is speculation, of course.

Either way, she felt since she bought a second item (which works perfectly, according to her), I should send her two of the more expensive original item since she had to spend more money obtaining the new, less expensive one. 

I am not sure how those two situations add up for some people, but to me, the math is off. Besides the fact that we did not receive any kind of direct payment from her, as she purchased the item through a retailer, we also are not in any way responsible for how you chose to handle a situation.

Am I alone in thinking that her expectations were way off base? Is this sort of compensation common in other industries? 

Honestly, it made the entire replacement order suspicious. Your thoughts?",I Should Get Two,36
Stachahof,5,10,1r0j3k,48,"This is my first time posting here but I've been lurking for quite a while.  I work in a used media store that's privately owned by a nice guy and for the most part, I love it.  I get great discounts, I have plenty of regular customers who I like, and the entire atmosphere is pretty casual and laid back since there is no big-bad corporate to answer to.

Then there are the drawbacks.  Threats and cursing from customers who don't like their cash/trade offers and just overall rude people.  We also cater to low-income people because our prices are so low (the majority of our stock costs no more than $2.50) and while I don't want to generalize, a lot of them aren't the most desirable type of person.

This particular story happened about a month ago.  The couple in question is fairly regular, though I haven't seen much of them since this happened, but I've never liked them much.  They're usually pretty loud and dismissive.  

This particular day they brought back a movie that apparently hadn't worked.  They just wanted to exchange it for a different movie.  No problem, my co-worker scanned their receipt and credited them $2.67 and they went to shopping.  

When they were finished, they brought a stack of movies up to the counter for me to ring out.  As I took them, the man kept one and told me he didn't have to pay for that one because he'd brought another back.  We'll call him Dumb Fuck.

Me: No problem sir, I just need to scan it to take it out of the computer system.
DF: But I don't have to pay for it.
Me: You won't, sir.  I just need to scan it.

Reluctantly he hands me the DVD and I scan it with the rest of their movies.  I apply their discount and their total ends up being $10.68 for five movies.  The man pays and I think it's finished when he turns to his wife and says to her, not to me, ""She charged me for that movie.""

Immediately I'm irritated that he's talking about me as though I'm not there, but I bite my tongue and explain to him that he'd only paid for four movies.  He ignores me and continues to tell his wife that I've over-charged him.  I pick up his movies, which I haven't bagged yet, and stack them on top of each other, adding the cost of them as I go.

""$2.67, $5.34, $8.01, $10.68, $13.35.""  Then I took off the top movie, the one he'd gotten for free, and set it aside.  ""$10.68.  You only paid for four movies, sir."" I smile.

DF: I can't believe she fucking charged me for that movie when I had a refund.

I really have to fight back my anger at this point.

Me: Would you like me to go through the math again for you, sir?

A miracle, he finally addresses me.

DF: I don't need anyone to do math for me, I'm real good at math.

He complains for a couple more minutes, but eventually he takes his movies and leaves, still convinced that he overpaid for them.

SenorPierre,25,44,1r0aps,193,"what's up, Tales From Retail. I've posted a few stories here from some of my past experiences of working in a mobile phone store and behind the register of a gas station. I am now happy to say that I have escaped those places, and I am now happily employed with a company that most everyone knows of. I won't go into details, but I am more or less a professional ice cream man.. e
xcept we sell a lot more than just ice cream now. 

anyway, being out on a sales route is interesting. I am in and out of people's homes and lives every day. I sell to people from all walks of life, from government officials to drug dealers. I can safely say that most of my customers are pleasant. that is one of the great things about living in the south... hospitality is still a thing.

One of the things about our company is that we accept food stamps. why wouldn't we, since all the food is frozen. when we do accept an EBT card, we need a $1.75 delivery fee in cash, since it cannot be taken from the card. naturally, among many EBT customers, this is highway robbery. 

with that said, one particular story comes to mind. this just happened yesterday. 

me ""okay, I have your order together. I just need $1.75 in cash. 

customer ""what the hell for?""

me ""well, it's a delivery fee that we have to charge for every order. where you used an EBT card, I need that fee in cash.""

customer ""that's a lie! they never charged me that before!""

me ""im sure they did, because if we don't get that from you, then it comes out of our pocket. everyone else has to pay it. I do also, even if I get it out of the freezer at our depot myself (total truth).

customer ""well what if I don't want to pay it?"" 

at this point, I'm losing my patience. she had been very difficult from the start, complaining about prices, asking for free samples (because that is a question I get asked daily) and generally taking up my time. 

me ""if you don't pay it, you don't get the order. it's pretty straight forward.""

customer ""you HAVE to sell me that, I'm the customer!""

me ""actually, you're not a scheduled stop. so if you refuse to pay that delivery fee, I don't have to sell you anything.""

and this is true. I was going to ring her sale up as a miscellaneous sale, meaning I don't have to stop every two weeks. most EBT customers are very hit and miss, so usually we keep a mental note of who has stamps and when they get them, so we don't have to drive 20 miles out of the way to get told no.

customer ""I'm going to call your main office and tell them you refused to sell to me!"" 

me ""hang on, I'll give you the number.""

as I say this I give her one of our books that has the company number on it. true to my word, I don't process the sale. it was a good one too, almost $100 dollars. 

about an hour later, my manager calls me. I pull over and answer, expecting the worst. 

manager ""did you refuse to sell to someone because she was using an EBT card?""

me ""no, I refused to sell to her because she refused to pay the delivery fee and got uppity with me about it.""

yohtin,39,70,1r052q,307,"I used to work at a hotel as a night auditor (overnight front desk guy). It was mostly pretty safe, but every now and again a homeless person would sneak into the building and try to sleep or steal food from the breakfast room. I quit and got a new job for a lot of reasons, mostly related to the fact that my manager was a terrible human being. This was the straw on the camel's back, though. 

One night I was delivering muffins to the breakfast room and was going to make coffee. At about 4am I found and confronted a homeless guy and asked him if he was a guest. He said ""I'm tired of people asking me that question"" and unsheathed a big knife. I dropped the muffins, ran downstairs and called the police. They showed up right away and he was already gone, but had stolen a bunch of the muffins. We had security cameras so I gave them a description of the guy and my manager's number so she could send them the footage.

A few days later, my manager called me into her office, and before asking me if I was ok, she passive-aggresively showed me the security footage of the homeless guy stealing the muffins. She said that she understood why I ran away but I should have taken the muffins with me, because now they were going to be short on muffins for the week. I acknowledge I could have picked the muffins back up and ran with them back downstairs, but not getting stabbed kind of took precedent at that moment.

Cleverness,8,13,1r00wc,14,"So I started working retail in July at a big box store as a cashier in NYC.  I actually am enjoying myself here, the customers at this store are mostly great and there has been no major problems.  The management is great with scheduling me around class, sick days, etc, and there are few things that I take notice of.  Still, alot of people pointed out to me that retail is evil and that I will eventually became insane myself from doing so.  So I figure I'll post some things here that I encounter(I have other things besides this) as someone who is in his 20's and new to retail to see if anyone enjoys or relates to it.  Long intro but yea, let's carry on.

So in my store it's not uncommon for people to bring things up to the register, say they changed their minds, and hand it to me.  I do not mind this at all.  Infact I encourage it, seeing merchandise placed in random places of the store where they don't belong annoys me more than anything.  We can neatly sort it and send the items to their proper departments if they hand it to us cashiers.  

What I do not like are those who bring up a cart full of stuff, and after ringing everything up the card is declined.  Alot of times it will be because they are from out of state and the companies do it for their protection, a quick call and its resolved, I recall the transaction if I needed to suspend it and we finish up(alot of the out of towners btw are great, they are very friendly.  Had a long chat with a guy from LA that I can't be too descriptive about to reveal where I work).  Sometimes though, someone will come up with a cart full of items, their card(s) will get declined, and they either A) remove alot of the merchandise, but once a card is declined I can't back out to the scanning menu for this transaction and have to start all over again.  A minor pet peeve.  Or of course B) they say ""I'll get my other card from home"" and never return.  So we have a cart full of items that now need to go back.

It just boggles me how people don't keep track of what they can spend.  Do they just grab whatever without looking at the price?

kingtigerii,20,13,1r00fh,92,"Or ""How we just got skimmed by an EF-2 tornado and you want your pictures.""


Sunday we had some bad weather roll through the area and the cell moving our way was a tornado spawner. When the inevitable tornado sirens sounded I called a manager and let them know. The following is a round about as to what happened next:

**4:15pm:** Sirens sound for the county. manager called.

**4:30pm:** Store Director makes announcement that warning is in place. Tells customers to wait for second announcement in 5 minutes.

**4:35pm:** Announcement is made again that the Store Director suggests we take cover.

**4:36pm:** Manager suggests we unplug the photo kiosks to prevent electrical damage.

**4:37pm:** In the middle of the phone call with the manager, she yells ""OH GOD THE DOORS!"" and hangs up. At this time I hear a loud explosion type noise and rumbling. 

Instinct kicks in and I start screaming at people to get in the back cram as many people in the bathrooms as possible.

**4:40pm:** People are trying to calm the screaming cashiers and employees (The customers were super calm - go figure...) and I get paged over the intercom. It's the manager, and she sounds like she's shaken up badly. Wants me to watch my cell phone and radar.

**4:50pm:** Try calling employee who is in at 5pm. He's like a brother so I'm worried he was driving in. Texting mom and other coworker. Not sure of damage to store.

**4:55pm:** Getting sick of waiting in a hot and crowded bathroom with screaming cashiers, panic filled environment isn't helping my coworker so i take her out too. Radar says storm is passed. No contact with co-worker who is due in at 5pm.

*- Time line stops*

So I wander up to the front of the store to find that the roof is leaking in various spots, but no major damage is done like many were saying. Cashiers made it sound like the front of the store had collapsed, when in reality it had simply taken roof damage and the glass awnings on the front of the store were gone (later we found they had rolled atop the roof, causing the damage).

No sooner do I reach the front entrance when my buddy shows up laughing and soaking wet. We joked around about it, I explained what happened and we got to work roping off the middle of the store which was leaking badly (Burst pipe and holes in the roof over the clothing department).

As we are roping everything off and making sure nobody plays in the water, my phone rings. 

Now mind you, we have emergency only power, there are no registers open and the employees are thinking the management closed the store down until we can make sure nothing collapses or hurts anyone. Around the store, there are red phones that call an employee in the the department in which the phone is located.


It's a customer (C for short). Turns out we're still open...go figure.

**C** - ""Hi there is nobody back here and we want our pictures!""

**Me** - ""Ma'am, there is nobody to help you back there because all available employees are assisting in cleanup and funneling customers out of the store. I'm sorry about the inconvenience. I woul -""

The customer then hung up on me, and the phone rings again.

**C** - ""Hi, can somebody come back here and give me my pictures?""

**Me (attempting to do 12 things at once and make sure the dumb kid at my feet isn't playing in the possibly electrified water):** ""Ma'am, the roof is leaking. Nobody can help you, photo is closed. Please come back another day. Sorry, have a great night."" 

I hung up. Few minutes later a couple teens walked by and were griping about shitty service.



So my buddy and I get the department and most of the leaks roped off. Manager calls and wants us to caution tape the front of the store outside (where the glass awnings are missing, in case anything falls). I get cracking on that and avoid the reporter outside asking question on what happened.

Next crisis, we are still apparently open and need to close, so we need to get customers checked out and out of the store. I hop on lane and start with a transaction when the register looses power midway through. There goes part of the emergency power. Crap.

My buddy is still open on the lane he jumped on so I help him with a couponer (seriously, she had a book. Could have smacked her but we both kept smiling) and got the store cleared out. 

Signs get posted and we shut the doors. Clean up time.

Employees start grabbing shop-vacs off the shelves, squeegees and anything else that can help like mops and buckets. Others are pulling damaged product from the shelves and putting fallen things back up where they go.

It's about 9:30pm when we get another announcement, from another Store Director. The store is reopening at Midnight. It comes as a demoralizing blow because instead of working towards cleanup, we realize we are all simply here to reopen quick as possible and make the company more money. Most of the people on overtime started to leave because they just stopped caring. I decided to stay until my buddy left, couldn't leave him alone with the mess.

Normal cleanup until around 10:30pm, when the Store Director from the previous announcement announces that we are now open for business. My buddy and I look at each other and the still massive pool of water on the ground and decide we've had enough. We pick up our mess and tell the nearest manager we're leaving. I've got two hours of overtime and my buddy has an 8am class. She tells us to put some stuff back really quick and get out. By the time this was completed it was 11pm. We were tired, wet and hungry.

Apparently the EF-2 ""skipped"" over the store, causing only minor damage compared to the industrial complex it wrecked prior to the store and the houses and drive-in movie theater that were leveled after the store. Thankfully it also missed the two hospitals that are next to the store.


**TL:DR: Met a man made of tin, scarecrow and a talking lion and we skipped down a brick road to meet a wizard.**

HerpsenSterpger,9,37,1qzzz8,172,"This is my absolute favorite story to tell but I've been holding off cause if feels pretty cheesy..


One day when I was a receptionist, a woman came in looking for directions. She had just moved to town and wanted to learn about the area. She was also trying to find a local historic school house her grandmother had attend in the early 1900's. We ended up chatting over this and where she was from for about a half an hour (it was a pretty slow job..) and she brought up that she was adopting a cat later that day. We talked more about that and had a really wonderful conversation. As she went to leave she stopped and turned back around.


""What is your name?"", She asked.


""The name's Herpsen!"" (It's pretty close)


""Herpsen. You are truly a remarkable young man,"" She said, ""right down to your name! Not a lot of people want to hold a long conversation with a loony old woman like me.""


Whoa. I was blown away by that.


""You seem like a very kind person which is so rare in people your age. And you have helped me more than you know today. I see you being an absolutely wonderful man!"" She continued.


""Well thank you very much."" I was really touched. ""This is such a professional place, it's a treat to get someone that's actually personable!""


She looked at me like she knew about a fountain of youth and was debating telling me. ""May I name my new cat after you?"", she blurted out.


SAYYYY WHAAAA??? ""Absolutely!"", I didn't even hesitate, ""If you think he can handle the pressure of such greatness!"" I said with a humble giggle.


She gave me the biggest, most heart warming, most genuine smile I have ever gotten. As she walked back to the door and said her good-byes, she said, ""Your legacy will live on!""


I stared out the door after her with complete shock. I thought about my ""legacy"".. Smoking lots of pot, trying very little in school, disappointing my parents, failing out of community college, getting arrested, stealing, and 9 years of therapy was what I immediately thought of.. But then I felt a warmth in my chest. She was right. I do have a big heart. I care!


So from then on that will be my legacy! 


It was just so beautiful!


That was about 9 months ago and I never saw the woman again. I have no idea if there is *actually* a cat out there named after me but that lady and her new cat will always be a part of who I am. All the assholes, morons, and disinterested customers in the world will never make her memory fade. So the next there's a douche in your face when your just trying to make it to 5 o'clock, remember your own big heart and instead of giving the douche something to clean, make him remember your sparkling personality when he leaves.

Just the other night I had a great experience while at the drive through at In-N-Out. I was with a couple of friends and we all have complicated orders.

Employee: Hi! Welcome to In-N-Out, how can I help you?

Me: Hi, I'll just be one minute.

(Quick conference with friends)

Me: Okay, I'm ready to order, it's a bit complicated, just a friendly warning.

Me: 1 double double, medium rare, extra toasted bun, animal style, whole grilled onions instead of chopped onions and chilis cooked in the burger. With an animal style fry light. A cheeseburger, medium rare, whole grilled onion, animal style, extra toasted bun and another animal style fry light with that. Finally, two more double doubles, one with whole grilled onion and the other animal style.

This took a while to order and I was holding up the line. I just told the lady that I trusted her and don't worry about reading back the order. The guy at the window read back the order when I was paying anyway and sure enough, they got it dead on. Great people and great service. I made sure to mention that to them when I got the food.

starfleetjedi,19,12,1qzs2c,76,"The bakery I work for does vegan goods, so now and then we get emails from earth-friendly citizens complaining about our use of palm oil. The emails usually sound the same:

&gt; ""I will no longer be purchasing your products until you stop using palm oil. And I will tell friends and family to boycott you as well!""

&gt; ""Here is a link to a video and pictures of orangutans being displaced and murdered in Indonesia because of palm oil.""

&gt; ""I demand that you remove your 'vegan' labeling because you are an evil company!""

Blah blah. Stfu.

We explained that it is temporary since the company we purchased our vegan butter changed their formula, which resulted in rancid baked goods. Rest assured that we are testing alternatives. All that jazz.

Anyway, we finally found a company to provide us with sustainable palm oil. No animals harmed during its manufacturing. Yay! We post this information on our Facebook page, our websites, and our Twitter.

The complaints have slowly stopped. However, weeks after that, we get an email from a woman who claimed that she is a lawyer from New York, and she happened to have our product for lunch and saw the list of ingredients. Being the environmentalist that she is, she thought she would complain about the palm oil.

With her email was a PDF attachment that contained her complaint, a scan of the product wrapper, and various links to anti-palm oil websites. All this effort must've taken her an hour or so.

I can practically hear this woman's whiny voice as I read her email. I can't take it. Usually, I'm supposed to apologize and tell them we have sustainable palm oil now, and if I could please have her address so I can send her free products.

Vasite,9,19,1qzps2,83,"Background: I work in a retail store that has fairly small (in my opinion) pillars around the store to hold it up for support. Well to make it look nicer we have put glass mirrors on the 4 sides of the square pillar. Now i have seen these glass pillars chipped before. It doesn't look like your average fragile glass this stuff looks thick and tough to probably avoid easy damage. 

Story: I'm usually a PoS (register/customer service) employee so i'm rarely on the floor. Well today i was needed on the floor due to some call outs. I'm speaking with a customer about some men's shirts and clearance items pretty close to our shoes department.

~Note we wear little headsets on the floor to communicate to each other for various things

Over my headset i hear that a small child has cut himself on glass in the shoe department and i say i'd run over and help since i was really close.  As i'm walking over i can hear a bloody scream coming from the department and i got to thinking. 

""wait a minute, glass, we don't have glass anywhere in shoes. What could he have possibly cut himself on?"" 

I finally get there and oh my god, there's blood everywhere. I can clearly see where the kid has been and what happened. There is a blood puddle right on/next to the glass pillar. I quickly get to the child being held by his mother, trying to close the 1-1/2 inch gash on his forehead. I quickly run off to the backroom for band aids/wipes/ whatever i could find. It wasn't much sadly. 

By this time the parents aren't really saying anything but to help them while calming down the child, I'm not really thinking much of it because the amount of blood all over the department. The manager and some other associates have managed to get over there by now and were taking him to the restroom to clean him up.

Now that the kid (still screaming) have went to the restroom i page the cleaning lady to help me get the blood out of everything. Now i can get a good look and what may have happened. Our glass pillar in the shoe department is wedged in between 2 giant shelves of shoes. There is maybe 2 inchs of space between the pillar and shelf, no enough room for anybody to move through. The pillar has been chipped so i inform the manager that the child may have glass in the wound so the parents would know. 

Then a lady grabs my attention, asking to tell me something:

Lady: Ms. Vasite? (i have a nametag on)

Me: yeah? what can i do for you?

Lady: That little boy was sprinting all throughout the shoes, i asked the parents to watch him but they didn't care, and he ran right into the pillar. I saw the whole thing.

Me: thank you, i'll inform the manager. 

Now by this time i'm used to the fact parents let their kids run wild in the store and maybe this will teach them they need to watch him more. I head back to the restroom to wash off anything i may have gotten on my hands and see the parents signing, again SIGNING a form saying we, the store, are not at fault for this accident. They leave soon after and i was just chatting to the manager about what the women had said and i went on with my day

Now here's the funny part. I come into work the next day to find out that the parents are ""trying"" to sue us for their son's head wound. On the grounds of ""The pillar shouldn't have been there"" Really? What else are we suppose do with a support beam for the building? Lord.",It's the stores fault that pillar is there.,102

If you don't know how a Mongolian barbeque works than I will explain. There is a buffet type thing where there is raw meat and vegetables, along with other toppings. You get in line by this large grill and you give the grillers your bow filled with all of the stuff you put in it. 

While I was waiting around, this short, incredibly fat, potato looking child. He pushes past me to try and get is food cooked first, probably to feed his unending hunger. As he pushes past me he gets pushed to a different, longer line where he stands there with his bowl in his hand. He notices a small piece of raw chicken about to fall off of his bowl. To save his small chicken bit, he reaches up to his bowl with is neck (I should mention that his bowl was sitting on his stomach like a small table) hidden behind its fat shield. And he eats the raw piece of chicken.

 I start laughing at this point because of the face he made. It looked like he enjoyed it and proceeded to eat more raw chicken. Then he took a sip of the sauce that was in his other hand. I could not contain my laughter at that point so I left.

FredFltStn,207,489,1qz4m9,1227,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Josh is one of the guys that work for me every year at my fireworks tent, although I have to use the term “work” loosely with Josh. He’s a tall, skinny, 19 year old high school dropout, who would rather be lighting up than working given the choice. His parents are two of my good friends, which is the ONLY reason he still works for me.

When we’re working, I spend and unreasonable amount of time playing the “Where’s Josh” game. It’s like “Where’s Waldo”, but usually involves Josh sitting out of sight in the back of the storage container or “going to the bathroom” for 30 minutes. I know that if I’m not watching him, there’s a 86% chance that he’s sitting on his ass somewhere avoiding work.

Josh always owes people money. Friends, family, enemies, me, the list goes on and on. Since I’m pretty much his only source of regular income, and I only work him about 6 weeks out of the year, Josh is perpetually broke or in debt.

Last year, his mother let me know that Josh owed them some BIG bucks, several hundred dollars. They were making him pay for the repairs from when they were out of town and Josh had drunkenly stolen his father’s car, and then conveniently wrecked it into his mother’s car. Sadly, just another day with Josh. 

I talked to Josh about it and he seemed embarrassed, and asked me to work him as many hours as possible so he could pay his parents back. Feeling sorry for him (I’m a sucker); I let him pick up extra shifts.

I gave him his paycheck after the first week of work, and reminded him that he needed to pay his mother back. He assured me that he would. He then cashed the paycheck on blew the entire thing on fast food, liquor, and “herbs”. His parents were disappointed, but not really surprised.

I gave him hell after I found out what he’d done, and he assured me that he was going to pay back his parents with the next paycheck. I’m a sucker, not an idiot, and I know Josh too well. 

From July 1st on, we work a TON of hours, since that’s by far our busiest time of the year, and everyone’s happy when payday arrives. I hadn’t forgotten the fast one that Josh had pulled with the last paycheck, and I mentioned to him more than once that he needed to cash his next paycheck and give the entire amount to his parents.

On payday, I walked up to Josh carrying my checkbook and said, “Is this entire check going to your mom?”

He of course assured that it was, and danced around like a kid on Christmas while I filled out the check. I told him the amount, folded the check in half, handed it to him, and thanked him for his help.

About 20 minutes later, I got a text from Josh that said,
&gt;You bastard.

Apparently, Josh and several of his friends went to a check cashing store to cash his check and start the party. They had already made plans to hit the beach and get wasted after they cashed the check, but the store wouldn’t cash it for him.

My text response back to Josh was:
&gt;What? I asked you if the entire check was going to your mother and you confirmed it. Per your request, I made the check payable to your mother. Thanks again for all the hard work.

What i had never considered while looking for a job in retail was ever working with children, occasionally you get that desperate parent who wants to use the staff toilets before the child explodes, but when a customer comes up to you and says 
""im sorry but my son has had an accident on the floor"" my first response is to think, *""why are you apologizing for a possible law suit?""*  but it quickly became apparent that the child in question, who looked well old enough to have mastered the concept of a toilet, had shat on our children's section floor. 

if 10 was a well solid, high protein, wipeless shit, this was about a 2. and it was EVERYWHERE. it looked like explosive diarrhea with an extra cup of water mixed in just to make sure it spread to the corners and under the shelves. the mother was a little red in the face from embarrasment and explained, ""he was just so excited being in the store he didn't want to leave, even for the bathroom"" 

""oh yeah"" says i, ""we get that a lot"". my sarcasm was palpable. 

as a mere underling in the retail world i didnt have anyone to palm the job off to, but as the floor manager was elsewhere i also couldn't plead the classic ""ive never had a child attempt lift-off via anal propulsion before, i dont know what to do"" line. 

having no wish to clean the mess, i (and still with no regret) handed the mother a roll of paper towel and made eye contact 

""oh you want me t...well i gues..yeah i suppose it isn't your job."" 

""yeah, im going to find a mop""

i proceeded to lean on a mop handle and watch the mother clean up the shit, or rather soak it up, (i didnt want to get the mop dirty) then i cleaned the floor with disinfectant.

I get to deal with all sorts of weird and wonderful people and with fetishes that I had no idea existed (google is my friend) but the ones that I do bend over backwards for (get your minds out of the gutter people!!) are the people who come in seeking advice/help due to medical conditions. Life really hands you lemons when you lose your sex life due to accidents or other causes. I worked for a while as a carer for disabled/elderly/sick/dying people. In that job I provided personal care such as assisting with showering/bathing/dressing and all aspects of assistance needed for a person to maintain their lifestyle and their dignity. I try to carry some of that over to my job. I really have seen it all!

Todays tale. A gentleman of around 45 comes into the shop. He makes some inquiries about our range of strap-ons. I go through the different models and show him the various features. He also asks a few questions about other 'toys' that will help him give his wife pleasure. He starts getting chatty and tells me he has had some surgeries and as a result of his medical issues has been left heavily scarred and is impotent. He still wants a happy wife, hence the reason for his visit. He continues detailing his various surgeries for me and then out of the blue says,

'And this is the result' and promptly drops his trousers!

There is this man standing in front of me with his pants at his knees (he had no underwear on), pointing to his limp member. 

'It's dead! Bloody useless thing! Never to rise no more!' 

He points to the scars. 

'And look at this! Bloody road map over my stomach and abdomen! Ugly as fuck!' 

He gesticulates wildly at his nether regions.

I peer down and say, 'I can see what you mean but it really doesn't look all that bad based on the surgeries you just detailed to me. I have seen far worse.'

He pulls his pants up 'Really?' 

'Yes sir' say I 'it sounds like you are lucky to be still alive.'

'Yes I suppose I am' he says  'and my wife still loves me and I love her.'

His no nonsense approach to shoplifters when he joined the branch was exemplary. Previous Managers didn't effectively ban repeat offenders, but he's having none of it. He's seen every trick in the book.

One very sad case was a lady shopping with her 8 year old daughter, always chatty, friendly, a regular. It was after a few months that SO spotted the Mum filling up the little girl's pockets with joints of meat and so on.

SO confronts her at the tills where she was queuing, asks to see the little girl's pockets, the mother started to protest, as this was happening her daughter voluntarily emptied her coat's contents onto a side display. The mother then proceeds to scream at the girl telling her she was naughty, threatening all kinds if punishment when she gets home in a vain attempt to demonstrate she was unaware this was happening.

Only a kid, right? Doesn't know what she's doing.

Banned on the spot, then evidence was gathered from CCTV where mum is clearly picking out the choices cuts of beef and stowing them away herself in her daughter's huge oversized coat.

Makes me want to cry for the little girl's future.

nit4sz,15,8,1qywfg,37,"So Im a waitress at a fine dining restaurant, Its not cheap, but people pay for the best food and service around.

So 3 ladies come in for dinner, I seat them give them the menu's, amuse bouche etc. A little while later I come back for their drink orders. One lady picks up the menu, looks at the wine list and loudly exclaims :

""13 dollars for one glass of wine!? Who would pay 13 dollars for one glass of wine?!""

Me: ""Well I don't set the prices I'm sorry""

Lady: ""Well no I guess you dont. Well thats the cheapest on the menu so I guess ill have to have one of them then""

The rest of their service goes smoothly, excluding the fact they felt the need to harass the table next to them and ask them what they had and if it was any good.

When they come up to pay, the same lady notices a difference in the computers charging and the price list, but not untill after she had paid her portion:

""This bill says $14 a glass! The menu said $13!""

Me: ""Does it? Im so sorry"" *Looks to manager for confirmation of how to proceed*

Manager: ""We can certainly refund that to you, is cash OK?""

Lady: ""Do you do this so you can pocket some extra?""

Manager: ""No we don't""

Me: ""We actually are unable to set the prices in the system, (its a simple press-appropriate-button-the rest is automatic-system) It must be a glitch which we will get fixed as soon as possible""

I finish the sale for the last lady to pay

Me: ""Thank you for coming, I hope you enjoyed your meal""
Lady: ""Oh yes, the food was lovely, the service was great, Thankyou, bye""

TLDR: Get accused of overcharging just to make a little extra on the side. Same lady then tells me the service was great... Wut?","""I don't set the prices"" [Hospo]",45
HealthyFiesta,7,4,1qyv1n,12,"I work in a small  Alaskan grocery store meat department and we pride ourselves in customer service, that being said I hate human beings sometimes. Being a smaller store we can offer custom cuts and orders easier than a department store could.
This leaves the door open to abuse from customers however. EXAMPLE. Some brings a beef roast from the display case to the counter and asks for me or one of my coworkers to cut it to their specifications. We do this for free before they even pay for the item. Some fuckwits have the audacity to use this free service and they at some point decide they no longer need the item in question and return it to the display case. I think it is stealing because the item is nearly impossible to sell      now.             Another thing that drives me bonkers is people asking for a discount because a product looks ""old"".

The next day she comes back and throws a tantrum why didn't you do the list? I responded with ""I did, I did a few things and didn't finish because I was swamped with customers. I did other things that weren't on the list did you notice that?"" 

""Yeah but you didn't do what's on the list.""

""Because I was busy, I noticed we were low on other merchandise and dealt with those, I didn't do the things on the list because that's all we have there is no more. So I did what I thought was urgent.""

""Ok but you didn't finish the list.""

I almost lost it at that point. Her entire argument was I didn't do the things on the redundant  list but I still did my job.  She complained to upper management about it and they took her side over mine. She later slipped in my performance review would be low.

Really I don't care because those reviews are broken they never see the effort I do for the store. And I know for a fact you can't score a perfect on the review because nobody is perfect according to higher management.

Niggarachi,20,13,1qyp1f,53,"I work as a valet supervisor in grand City of Sin at a timeshare resort. It's a very interesting job as I see the strangest things almost nightly. I work the graveyard shift. It's not really pleasant but it gives me an opportunity to study for exams and browse Reddit.

A quick background in how my valet service operates: We are required to park your car safely upon your arrival to the hotel. We bring your car to you as quickly and safely as possible when you ask for it. 

That's it. You want some special treatment? There should be SOMETHING put in my hand when you get your car.

As a courtesy to some of our nicer customers. If we notice that they come down at the same time on consecutive mornings, we'll offer to have it brought down at the time they come down for the duration of their stay. It's just something that helps us clear our garage as well as enhance our tip potential.

When I returned to work, one of my co-workers told me of this guy driving a Nissan Juke. He was slated to stay with us for two weeks. He had showed up on my day off and had requested that his car be waiting for him at the same time, 4:30, every morning. No problem with that. 

But he never, ever, ever tipped. Nothing, nada, zilch. 

So 4:30 rolls around and JukeAss comes down. He doesn't hand me his claim check, but tells it to me.

JA: 807

Me: Ok. May I see your claim check. 

JA: It's 807, you guys already know me. And where is my car?

Me: I don't know who you are sir. I've never seen you before. So for my safety and yours I need to see your claim check.

JA: You know who I am. Just bring me my car.

ME: Sir I don't know you. I cannot just bring down your car without seeing your claim check. For all I know, you happened to be sitting here with someone else and memorized those numbers. I cannot give away a car like that.


He rustles through his wallet and pulls out his claim check

JA: Here it is.

ME: Alright sir, I'll have it down for you right away.

JA: Next time it better be down here before I get here. 

ME: I'm sorry sir. I'm not required to do that for you. We do offer you a FREE valet service. (Emphasis on the free hoping he'd understand that just a dollar here or there would help his chances)

JA: But you guys have had it down the last two nights. Let me speak to your supervisor.

(Love hearing those words)

ME: I am the supervisor. It is not part of our service to have your car down at a specific time. Maybe someone did you a FAVOR last time. But I cannot do that.

At this time, his Juke is brought down. He leaves without another word spoken. We never had his car down again and he never tipped us. Fine by me. Don't expect extra service when you aren't paying the piper.

zobe910,8,11,1qynfk,0,"Okay, so a former coworker (and friend) of mine posted this on her [blog](http://curlycrankycollegegirl.tumblr.com/) and I just wanted to share it with you all since some of us fast food workers can definitely relate. And the rest of you can learn from this.

[Edited from OP for content, chain/product names. I personally edited and added to the list below, as well.]

""I think it is important for everyone in America to hold a job in food service. That way, the human race will start to evolve from total jerks, thinking they are entitled to order a six piece chicken strip basket at the window after spending three and a half minutes just to order a large oreo [treat], to normal human beings. 
Fast food is still FOOD. Granted, the job is not as glamorous as being the editor in chief for a magazine or head chef at a high class restaurant in So-cal,  but end the end it is still a job. 
I think it is high time that society gets rid of the stereotype that only losers work in the food industry. I honestly enjoyed my time working at [ice cream/fast food restaurant], minus the rough moments. Ask anyone. I would go back in a heartbeat. My coworkers became my friends (minus the stupid ones). And I will always look back at the memories I created. 

I got the job when the neighborhood's popular [playcenter] closed for the first time in over 15 years. [Playcenter] had been apart of my life since I was 4 years old and my mom started working there. I was well versed in how the business was run. At age 5, I was running the front of the center, greeting customers and stamping play cards as well as working the snack counter in the back. At age 7, I started helping my mom work birthday parties. By age 15, I was in the store by myself from open to close. [Playcenter] wasn’t a job, it was a life style. 
[Playcenter] had changed hands many times. Luckily for my mom and I, the previous owners always put in a good word for us and we kept our jobs. That was until 2012. 
Due to some underhanded non-sense I was not apart of, my mother and I did not make the transfer over to the new owners. For the first time in my life….I had to FIND a job. 

Luckily, my bff came through for me yet again and put in a good word for me at _____. Then my future in ice cream began. 

When I was first starting out, it was rough. My co-workers and I didn't know each other, I couldn't memorize how many scoops of candy went into cookie dough [treat], and customers were mean. 
I hope if there is one thing you take from this particular post, you take away a new awareness for the workers at fast food establishments. Anyone who is employed deserves respect, no matter what the job is. Minus people at the DMV. (They hate their lives). 

I have learned many life lessons at _______. Most of them from my co-workers. Most of them from my manager (he has common sense). Most of them involving the negative aspects of prostitution. (But that’s besides the point)
The most important thing I learned from working at _____ was how to order in drive through. And now I am going to share this great knowledge with you.""

I give you the 13 commandments for ordering fast food.

1. ""Welcome to ___________. How can I take your order?""
Speak loudly and clearly. DO NOT HAVE THE PASSENGER ORDER; we usually can't hear them.

2. Feel free to say hi to who ever is taking your order. DO NOT ask how their day was. DO NOT repeat their name to them. *Its weird*. Just order. 

3. Make sure your kids aren't screaming and your dog isn't barking. It kills our ears over the headset, we can't hear you (the driver), and it's just rude.

4. DO NOT ask what our favorite item is. 1) We usually don't have a preference. 2) If you don’t know what you want: **GO INSIDE OR JUST GO HOME**. 

5. If you need more time to decide, politely tell the order person that you are “still deciding"" or ""need a moment”. The number one thing to remember is to notify the worker when you are done deciding. Communication is key. 

6. When ordering: ITEM/COMBO#. SIZE. FLAVOR. If you are getting a combo, know what you want to drink. 

7. Notify us early if you have coupons. It's easier to apply the discount when we are initially ringing you up versus making changes at the window.

8. Don't bitch about the prices. We don't make them. If you know the biggest US fast food chain right across the street sells the same ice cream cone *""for like, a dollar""*, go there then. We'll happily cancel your order for you. (Our ice cream tastes much better, anyways..)

9. Please try to make sure you have your cash/card readily available when you get to the window, ESPECIALLY if you are waiting in a line of cars in front of you. You have no excuse to not be ready when you pull up to the window. Plus you are wasting everyone's time by digging through your purse for a full minute. **AND NEVER PAY IN ALL COINS**. By the time we're done counting that shit out, your ice cream has already melted. 

10. Get off your phone. If we try to ask you a question and you don't hear us, that's your problem. Now you are *definitely* not getting any ketchup with your fries.

11. Don't add on food at the window. It adds to our drive time, and time is money. Plus, everyone else now has to wait another 2-3 minutes or more for your 6-piece chicken strip basket to cook. 

12. Mistakes happen. Feel free to **(preferably)** come inside, or roll back through the drive through and very quickly explain the situation. We will be happy to fix something for you as long as you don't bitch about it. In that case, we will *spitefully* fix something for you. :-)

13. And pretty please don't come through the drive through high off your ass. I learned what weed smells like at my job. This is not what I had in mind when I was told I'd gain ""life experience"" by working.

—curlygirl— [and zobe910]

TL;DR: Know what you want when you come through the drive through, have your money ready, and don't be rude. Fast food is an unforgiving job.

consultingcanadian,10,14,1qyln0,103,"Hello TFR! Haven't posted in a while, but I had a very interesting Saturday so I thought I would share. Sort of a short one but very odd.

So I work in a typical Canadian grocery store, and where I work we have a choice of what to wear for our uniform. We always have to wear black pants, black running shoes, and our choice of a work shirt, sweater, hoodie, or rain jacket. If we wear a hoodie or rain jacket we have to wear a colour underneath that matches to the store colours. So on Saturday, instead of wearing a work shirt I decided to wear a sweater and a barely revealing tank top underneath (this is relevant, don't you worry your pretty little retail head).

Now on to the actual story.

So it's a Saturday, pretty typical business, nothing too major. I then get a (what appears to be very Russian) middle-aged woman and what I assume is her daughter. They say hello and start loading their stuff up, I scan as fast as I can go as it's getting fairly busy. Her total comes to around a little over $300. I tell her the total and she hands me what she assumes is $300. I count it over three times and I only end up having about $220. I tell her this and she immediately gets mad.

&gt; Her: No, I gave you $300.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Mam I've counted it three times and I only have $220. I have nothing else here.
&gt; 
&gt; Her: Well I gave you $300, where is it!?
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Mam I only have $220 I can assure you I do not have anything else.

I count it out in front of her and it shows that I only have the $220.

(Now, I should point out, I'm short. Like, really short. This woman had a good few inches on me.)

She starts to look around, very frustrated with me, and then she proceeds to get on her tippy toes, look over my register and glance down my tank top. I basically stood back after seeing what she was doing and gave her a WTF face. She backs off and, while still acting very rude, Throws the rest of the money at me while still telling me that she gave me $300. At this point she's held up my line so I'm a bit pissed. I give her the change and she goes on her way, still complaining. 

Surprised she didn't want a manager. I would never take money, my mom is one of my managers so I would not only get fired but get disowned from my family. I've never been accused of taking money before either, so this was a new one for me.

DoomedPetunias,5,10,1qyioh,34,"Nine months out of the year I work as a manager on duty to a gift shop which contributes to a large theater company, and is almost entirely volunteer operated. As you can imagine, we carry everything from books to bardic bobble-heads.

In my time spent there I've seen my share of sticky fingers -- usually belonging to the younger crowd and going no further than a gourmet caramel or two, which is why this lady was particularly memorable. She was easily in her late sixties, short and rotund, and entirely inconspicuous... until I saw the wiggle.

Part of my job is to make the rounds on the floor to make sure everything is running smoothly. I spot the lady in question with a miniature Monet calendar in hand. It's slightly larger than a piece of toast. I make a mental note and move further down my route, when I see her dart furtively into a corner of the store. At this point I've gone partly up our short staircase, and have an aerial view of her moving strangely in front of the wall. When she turns around again, the calendar is gone.

We hold a strict policy of not apprehending shoplifters in our store, which has always been so frustrating, but I usually find little ways around it. I approached the woman, who now had a visible rectangle protruding from the front of her trousers. With the most negligent glance in that area, I smiled brightly and asked ""Would you like a basket for that?""

She blanched, and stammering out a negative, brushed by me like the calendar had caught fire. I had done what I could. I maintained my distance but kept a keen eye on her while she pretended to browse for a few minutes before hurrying out the door. 

I wasn't too concerned, because before she left I had seen another wiggle, and there! Sitting on top of our tower of fruit preserves was the Monet.

She has a trailer behind the Escalade, the big kind you use to tow a car with.  She asks me to put the tv face down on the open trailer.  Keep in mind, if she slams on the brakes, hits a bump or goes around a turn, the tv will fly off and shatter.  She didn't want to put the dusty tv box in her Escalade.

nihlius,1,7,1qygoh,20,"So I work at a popular office supplies store, and most days I'm on are pretty dead, so I tend to remember most people who come in more than once. However, this tale is about a pair of guys who waltzed in at about 5:50 on a Sunday evening. Both of them look to be between 20-25, sweatpants, hoodies, general casual clothes. I'm a decent distance from them, but I greet them regardless. 

I only get some mumbles back, but that's okay, maybe they're third shift workers who just got up or something? I want judging yet. 

They come to the only open register (mine) about 10 minutes later with a popular office chair, which, with tax, comes out to being just over 100USD. When they start pulling out ones, I knew it just turned all sideways. 

Once I was starting to count their money, I smelled the distinct scent of weed, but hey, whatever, stoners need chairs too, right? 

Two twenties, sixty seven ones, and 80 cents in change later, they start to leave....without the chair. The box is still on the counter. 

I called out to them, and they both turned around. After a second, I get 'We need....a cart.' They were both plenty big enough to carry the box, it wasn't heavy either. So they came back with a cart, deposited the chair into the cart, and proceeded to leave.

Except they parked the cart in the main entrance (keeping the automatic doors open), and disappearing into the aisles again. By this point, everyone on at the time is smirking and the supervisor is trying not to laugh. No one moved the cart, and no one came in during the period it was sitting in the doorway, and after about 10 minutes, the dynamic duo exited the store with their chair. 

Haven't seen them again since, just gotta hope they didn't come back being all like 'man, we don't even WANT this chair!'  Taking back furniture without a receipt is nigh impossible when they paid cash.....so much cash....

SleepKittySleep,4,8,1qyf6u,19,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm a hostess that works only mornings and double shifts on weekends. I am a 20 year old girl who is nice to everyone.

**Background:** I work at a Tex-Mex restaurant that's known for its patio. People mostly come to eat outside on the patio, not for the food in particular. It can seat up to 1,600 people and takes up a city block. It's been open over 50 years and is family run. There are at least over 150 people employed. About 9-17 waiters/waitresses work inside and about 25 outside during the weekends. There are 2-3 busboys per section, 16 hostesses in total (4 work inside/rest outside), there are 3 kitchens, and 4 managers (all related). 

It can get VERY busy on the weekends. There's a hostess to each section and I usually work the line. Most of the times there is an hour to 2 hour wait to be seated. It takes a person with a lot of patience to be able to work the line. We have to be able to walk through every time while having people complain and yell about the wait. There are a lot self-entitled people who throw around a manager's name. Doesn't look, hard but it is. People do get mean when they're hungry.

First manager (L) is head manager. He's real laid back and awesome. Second is (J) cool, but tough and scary. He basically runs everything. Third (Z) is sort of...bipolar I guess. She is awesome one second, but mean the next. Tends to mess things up. She works mostly inside. Third is (B), a lazy ass who only works 3 hours at the end of everyday. She only knows how to complain. She HATES me. Everyone hates her too though. I see her 3 days out of the week.

**Story:** This took place on the patio Sunday night around 7:00p.m. There were only 3 hours till closing. Besides me, there were 5 other hostesses outside. Our line had just ended and I was ready to finally start walking around. When we work line we're not suppose to move from the front unless necessary since we have a clipboard on who is next to be seated.

As soon as **B** arrives we all groan. She always has some thing to complain about. ALWAYS. At least **Z** guides us, but **L** literally does nothing. Most of us have no clue to what she contributes to this restaurant.

Anyways, people are coming and going. We're giving our usual ""Hey, how are you?"" ""Enjoy!"" ""Have a good night!"" We're all in a good mood. Every one of us are taking turns seating tables. We're all doing are part. This was going on for about 20 minutes until it finally died down. Our head hostess was was taking care of the busboys and their stations, 3 hostesses were helping put tablecloths while me and (A)we're watching the front.

I had just came from a section in the back after seating table. I was literally at the front for two minutes before **B** comes up to A and I.

B then asks, ""Do you know a Mexican man with red shirt is sitting? He was with his girlfriend or something.""

We both reply no. This was not acceptable.

""Really? You don't know. He was just here."" Her smile faltering.

A is really sweet, nice and doesn't like to get in trouble, so I reply for her, ""The other hostesses might have sat them.""

""Who else is here?""

I answer with the same fake smile she has and name the other 4 hostesses.

She's getting a bit mad now, ""And none of you know where you sat him?"" She looks at both of us in disbelief then looks at A and asks, ""What section are you at?""

After A answers she asks who is doing line-up. I reply that I am. At this point I know this conversation isn't going to be pleasant. They never are. For some reason, the moment we met we did not get along. I guess it's cause I hate that she's self-centered and spoiled for her age. Also, because with her I tend to be a smart ass.

""You really don't remember him? He was wearing a red shirt."" She snorts.

It took me all I had to not reply back with a smart ass comment. There was literally a man with a red shirt in front of me. So I say, ""After a while, everyone looks the same to me.""

She laughs, ""Are you serious? Can't you remember anybody? You don't remember him?""

""I didn't seat him. I just took a table to OU. It wasn't me.""

She then ""calls me out"", ""You're lying. Ten minutes ago you were standing up here when he was here. I was talking to the cop.""

I knew she was lying. I was being honest. I saw hundreds of people this morning. I do line. I can guarantee that if you're sitting in the patio I saw your face at least once. Eventually, you're only a number to me. Not a face. I worked a double that day with a non stop rush. I was tired.

""Well then I don't remember. They all look the same to me."" I smile.

Still smiling, she looks at me. I can tell she's expecting an apology. Hell no. I smile just as big.

After 15 seconds of awkward smiling, she turns to A and says, ""Unbelievable! Do you remember everyone you seat?""

A is stuttering unable to answer. I can tell she wants to stick up for me, but she doesn't want to get in trouble.

Luckily, a waitress (D/ also her cousin) also works as assistant manager some times, comes and begins to talk to her. She leaves as I laugh at her.

Turns out this Mexican man with a red shirt had only moved her furniture.

**TL;DR** Manager searches for man who moved her furniture.

It may not seem like a big deal, but she has this way about her that I just despise. Sorry it was long. I wanted to give an idea of how big this place is.

E was also told that ROG wanted to, you guessed it, talk to the lady that orders things on the computer. E somehow was able to get ROG to tell him what the hell he actually wanted. 

ROG: I want the number for the Rotel company. I know y'all have that in your computers. 

E: Do you have the can?

ROG: Yeah.

E: That number is on the back.

ROG: No it's not! I want YOU to tell me the number! 

E: Sir, I see that can every single day. It's on the back, have a nice day. 

All I can say is: BWAHAAHA!

acelam,8,13,1qyego,46,"I'm fairly new to retail and used to think that some retail employees exaggerated how ignorant and/or rude their customers could be. However, these last two months have proven me wrong on every single level. The public is full of rude and downright strange people. Cue my story.

About a week ago, I was working on the sales floor. A lady walks in with her son who appears to be in his twenties. Immediately, the son asks where our restroom is located, which I didn't think was strange because it's very rare for men to be happy about being in the store I work.

Once I sent him on his way, his mother and I began talking about some dining room furniture. She tells me about how she found the ""same couch Oprah has"" on the side of the road and had it reupholstered, so she was looking for complimentary chairs. I internally rolled my eyes about the ""same couch as Oprah"" comment, but whatever. She seemed very eager to buy furniture and I don't give a damn what you tell me as long as you're ready to buy from me.

So after showing her some selections of dining chairs, I left her to peruse her options and went to help another customer who'd walked in while I'd been talking to her. On my way to the other customer, however, her son finds me and stops me, pointing to a rip in his shirt and saying, ""Hey, there's a nail sticking out in the men's restroom and I ripped my shirt on it. You need to have it removed.""

I apologized for the fact that he'd ripped his shirt and told him that I'd remove the nail as soon as possible. He left and I finished helping the second customer before returning back to him and his mother.

Instantly, before I could ask her how she liked our selection, she says, ""My son ripped his shirt on a nail in the men's restroom. Did he tell you about this?""

Again, I apologized and told her that I planned on removing the nail as soon as I was able. The store wasn't swamped, but there were only two associates on the sales floor and our manager was having to handle paperwork in the back. So neither of us could really disappear in case things did get busy or we had a customer ready to check out.

The lady replied, ""Well, is that *all* you're planning to do?"" I wasn't sure what more she wanted me to do, so I told her that I would make my manager aware of the problem and that I would immediately take the nail out of the wall instead of waiting.

I went to my manager's office and sort of hovered around, briefly explaining the issue at hand. My manager rolled her eyes and asked, ""Is she expecting us to pay for the shirt or what? All you can do is just get rid of the nail, if there even is one.""

So I grabbed the hammer and went to the men's restroom - sure enough, there was no nail, at least not one in a place where a person's shirt would get snagged. Our restrooms display clearance paintings/wall art that are hung up high and behind toilets, so unless the son was doing some climbing, there was *no way* he could've gotten his shirt hung up.

I sighed and returned back to the mother/son duo and asked the son where the nail was specifically, as I could not find a nail *anywhere* that he'd hang his shirt on.

He then backtracks and says, ""Well, uh, it wasn't exactly a nail. It was those silver hook things on the door.""

The ""silver hook things"" are the very blunt, very wide hooks used to hang purses/bags while a person uses the restroom. Given what the rip on his shirt looked like, there was absolutely *no way* the purse hanger would've caused that rip.

His mother again looks at me and says, ""So what are you going to do about his shirt? It's ripped because of your store.""

I apologized and told her that I couldn't take down the purse hangers. She looks like I've slapped her and says, ""Well, I don't care if you take them down or not. That's a Ralph Lauren shirt. It's a hundred and fifty dollars. I want to know what your store plans to do to pay for the shirt that you damaged. If I broke a candle, I'd have to pay for that!""

I wanted to tell her that maybe her son probably shouldn't wear expensive clothes while he was out shopping. I also wanted to tell her that our store actually doesn't have a ""you break it, you buy it"" policy (because if we did, all of us employees would never make a dime, lol). 

But I just calmly said again that there was nothing I could do and I was very sorry. Her face twisted up and she immediately turned around and stomped out, her son right behind her.

Afterward, my manager told me she figures it was probably a scam. As I didn't get a look at the shirt when the son came in, I had no idea if it was ripped before hand or not (though I highly suspect it was). Either way, my manager supposed that in another store, if this woman had continued to raise a stink, an overtired associate/manager may throw her a 10% discount to just shut her up.

So guys, beware of potential scammers as the holidays get here! Maybe this guy really did rip his shirt in our bathroom, but how in the world is that anyone's fault but his? Ridiculous no matter how you cut it.",It's my fault that you ripped your own shirt?,59

works_in_a_pet_store,62,64,1qybg3,326,"ANTICLIMATIC UPDATE:

Well I got an email back this morning from our customer service rep telling me that the woman had called.  However, she is no longer in charge of customer service calls, and redirected the call to a brand new office.  I have not heard anything further about the situation.  We hadn't heard about it yet because it literally was being announced that afternoon during a conference call.  I asked my store manager to let me know if we got an email back from this new office, but there was nothing in the email today.  If I hear anything, I'll be back here with an update.

BACKGROUND:

As my username suggests I work in a pet store.  A corporately owned pet store, to give you a little more insight.  I'm a shift supervisor, and so I tend to close by myself and it then becomes my job to handle the majority of customer service issues.  



I'll also preface this story by explaining that our store has a new ""no complaints"" policy.  Corporate has been receiving too many customer calls that are complaints that corporate feels should have been handled at the store level.  The manager staff has been told that we are to do whatever it takes to keep a customer from calling corporate.    I could probably write a whole post about how I die a little bit inside each time I have to give a discount to somebody who in any other store would be told to hit the road. 



I'll also mention right now, if we weren't under this new ""no complaints"" policy, I would have asked her to shop elsewhere about 30 seconds into this whole ordeal.  Then again, I guess I wouldn't have this story if I had...

THE STORY


So I was doing my nightly rounds of the store, making sure everything looked nice and neat when I ran into Eighteen Dollar Lady (EDL for the rest of the story)... 

Me: Hi there, are you finding everything you need ton-

EDL: As a matter of fact, I've found what I needed, but I've got something to say to YOU. 

Me: Sure, what can I help you with? 

EDL: You can explain to me why this dog food is so damn expensive here.

------


I'll interject here quickly - she had a 12 lb bag of [Wellness Core Original Dog Food](https://www.google.com/search?q=wellness+core+orignial&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS527US527&amp;oq=wellness+core+orignial&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3211j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8#es_sm=93&amp;espv=210&amp;q=wellness+core+original&amp;tbm=shop).  This is a fairly high end food.  In our store it runs for about 35.98 dollars for that size bag.  The reason the price is so high is because they use high quality proteins in their food, and they use several other ingredients with higher nutritional value instead of a filler like corn.   I attempted to explain all of this to her, but I didn't get a word out...
_____

Me: Well it's a - 

EDL: (begins yelling out of nowhere) YOU KNOW, I NEVER COME HERE ANYWAY.  I ALWAYS SHOP AT ""privately owned store 20 minutes from our location"".  THEY HAVE THIS FOOD FOR EIGHTEEN DOLLARS THERE.

*this is the where the broken record part of the story comes in...also my thoughts will be in italics...*

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.  

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

HOW CAN THEY HAVE THE SAME SIZE BAG FOR EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.  HOW COME YOU ARE CHARGING SO MUCH.

*there's no way the other store charges that for this bag of food...our cost for it is around 25 or so bucks to begin with, and no store would sell it for below cost*

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS....EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.  


EIGHTEEN.


DOLLARS.

*is this really happening to me*

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

*oh god, make her stop*

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

*how many times has she said eighteen dollars now?*

YOU GUYS ARE SO.  GREEDY.  THIS IS CORPORATE GREED RIGHT HERE.  EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.


EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.

*ok, breath.  ok maybe I can offer her a price match.  yeah!  that's what she wants right?  yeah!  ok.  ok, I can still come out of this on top...  just got to wait for her to stop yelling.*

Me:  M'am I'm sorry to hear that, but do you perhaps have a reciept or an ad showing their price?  I don't set the prices here, but I can offer you a price match if you have - 

EDL:  WHO THE HELL CARRIES AROUND THEIR DOG FOOD RECIEPTS?

Me: Well, if you give me a moment, I can look up ""privately owned store 20 minutes from our location""'s number and verify their price. 


EDL: NO.  I shouldn't have to go through all that just to get the right price!  IT'S EIGHTEEN DOLLARS.  WHY ARE YOU SO GREEDY.

*what the...*

Me:  Again, I'd be happy to give you the food for that price, but in order to ring an actual price match on the register I need some sort of verification that the same product is that price at the other store...

*and that's pushing it, we're not really supposed to go below cost to make a bitch like you happy.*


EDL: NO, I WANT AN EXPLANATION.  I WANT AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY YOUR FOOD IS 36 DOLLARS AND THEIR FOOD IS 18 DOLLARS.

*Wow.  Fuck you lady.  I'm trying to help you here...*

Me:  Well, as I mentioned before, this is fairly high end food.  They use a lot of high quality ingredients, so it's more expensive to make.  But you are getting a very good quality food for the money.

EDL:  NO. THIS FOOD ISN'T THAT GOOD.  IT'S NOT HIGH END IF IT'S EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AT THE OTHER STORE.  DON'T YOU LIE TO ME.

*SERIOUSLY?!?!?!  Don't call me a liar.  If you want your damn food for 18 dollars, go to the other damn store. Please, just swear at me so I can kick you out...*

EDL:  WHO DO I HAVE TO CALL TO GET THIS ANSWERED.  WHO?

Me:  Well, I'm a shift supervisor, so if you'd like, the next point of contact is my manager who will be in tomorrow...

EDL: NO.  I WANT SOMEBODY HIGHER UP.

*Crap.  We're not supposed to let them call corporate until we've done everything at the store level to keep them happy.*

Me: Well, I'll tell you what.  I think I can scrape together a few store coupons to take about 15 dollars off your bag .

*I died a little bit inside saying this, by the way.*

Me:  Would that be ok with you?

EDL:  NO.  I DON'T CARE ABOUT A DISCOUNT.  I JUST WANT A NUMBER TO CALL.  YOU CORPORATE BIG BOX PET STORES ARE SO GREEDY.

*side note, I don't work for either of the two stores that probably come to mind when I say big box store.  It's a corporate store, yeah, but we've only got about 150-200 stores total. We're actually cheaper compared to the other two big pet stores that probably come to mind*

Me:  M'am, I don't set the prices.  I can give you a number for our customer service representative, and I can give you some coupons to bring the price down a lot more than I quite honestly should.  

EDL:  NO.  I WANT WHOEVER SETS THE PRICES.

*Fucking seriously?  Nope.  She's not getting anything other than our CS rep.*

EDL: M'am I don't have that information, I can give you the number for our customer service rep, and if she's not able to help you out, then she will give you the number of somebody higher up.  

EDL: Fine.  



We get up to the register.  I find a few store coupon PLUs that we have to use in situations like this.  It's meant to be a last resort, that maybe, just maybe if a customer sees the price come down that much, they won't call corporate.   

Even though I know she's going to call corporate anyway,  I still give her the coupons off,  I think because all that will happen if I don't do it, is corporate will fucking send her a $25.00 gift card ""for her troubles"".  Because to them, she's one more customer that will spend money in our store, so let's give her 25 bucks now to keep her coming back...all about that bottom line for them.


She finished her transaction and left the store. 


Knowing that she's going to call corporate, I now had to write an email to the customer service rep, detailing the whole incident.  


And then I had an idea.


I pulled out the yellow pages.

I looked up that privately owned pet shop that was about 20 minutes away from us.


I called them from my cell phone, pretending to be a customer.


 
Asked them if they had Wellness Core Original in the 12 lb bag, and what the price was if they did.
 
The guy came back on the phone after checking. They do not carry a 12 lb bag at all of that brand.  They carry the largest size 25 lb.  It's 55.99.

Our price on our 25 lb bag is 52.98.  We're cheaper than them.  WE'RE CHEAPER THAN THEM.  I pretty much was dancing at that point. 



I won't know how everything went down on the corporate end of things until tomorrow.  I'm praying and praying that they tell her to shove it,  because I REAAAAAALLLY wanted to.  And I'm hoping that maybe this particular nutcase makes them rethink their ""no complaints"" policy...

denrae-,7,6,1qyazy,32,"The other day, while working at my local grocery store, an older woman came through my check out line. She was using a walker and had a VERY severe hunch back. Her head was actually lower than my register it was so bad. 
I was just finishing up with bagging the items for the customer in front of her. The lady directly behind the woman says to her 'Here sweetie, let me help you put your things on the counter!' (She had her items in bags tied to the sides of her walker.) the woman turns and yells at this friendly lady, and tells her NOT to touch her items because that is HER (meaning me) job. I could tell that she was going to be very difficult after that, so I proceeded with extreme caution/friendliness. I started ringing her items and asked her how she was doing. She then starts mumbling to herself and yells, 'Well I guess I'll dig out my store card since you didn't ask for it and obviously WERENT GOING TO because you don't care.' 
I apologized to her for not asking before I started her order, and as I was waiting for her to find it I bagged her items up with paper inside of plastic, exactly like she yelled at me to do. 
My manager, who is almost sickeningly sweet on an every day basis, could see the woman was being difficult, so she came over to ask the woman if she needed help paying or getting out to the car. The woman started mumbling to herself about how I shoved all her items into one bag ( there were three bags with maybe four items in each, because I figured she couldn't lift much ) and how she doesn't even know what I did with all her stuff (it was sitting on the counter...). 
My manager helped her slide her card through the card reader, helped her read the screen, pushed the buttons for her etc, all while being talked down to by this woman. She then demanded my manager get her a cart by yelling 'I NEED a CART' about four or five times. 
My manager just kept saying 'Okay sweetie. I'll help you.' and goes to get her a cart. She puts the woman's items into the cart and goes to help her to her car when the woman just starts yelling 'STOP just STOP HERE' and leaves... 

And then today a customer came through my line with a gift bag. I don't think she spoke English very well. She handed me the bag and just said 'For you.' It was a hand knitted or crocheted (not sure which) red and green hat. I didn't know her. She just gave me a homemade gift just because. It's the sweetest thing a stranger has ever done, especially while at work. I really almost cried cause it was just so unexpected. I will never forget that moment. 

I deal with a lot of jerks because I work in customer service. I bite my tongue on a daily basis. People ignore me, treat me like I'm an idiot, and belittle me because they think I'm lower class than they are. I get judged constantly, and sometimes I just want to scream in a customers face 'YOU ARE NOT BETTER THAN ME. I WORK MY ASS OFF EVERY DAY. I WORK SO SO HARD TO IMPROVE MY LIFE. I STARTED FROM NOTHING AND I DID ALL OF THIS ON MY OWN. IVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE HERE IN A YEAR THAN MOST HAVE IN 5.' But I never do.
For that woman to go out of her way like that just to say thank you, thank you for being here to wait on me, means so much. When I hear comments like 'You work so hard!' Or 'You do everything here! Do you ever go home?' it gets me through those difficult customers. 

Sorry if I seem overly emotional about it, but having something so infuriating happen then be followed by something so heartwarming gets my emotions all pumped up. ",Some people are just so nasty...,38

lostxfreakx42,2,3,1qy3dy,27,"I did a small stint at the blue vested store as a cashier over Christmas last year. I was reminded the other day of a few stories from that time in my life so here is one.

We had this one woman and her mom who would come in fairly regularly. I would end up checking them out every once in a while. The daughter was heavily pregnant and would drive one of those motorized scooters around the store.

One day, the daughter came in with a friend and between the two of them, they picked out almost $1500 of baby clothes and accessories and clothes for themselves and just dumped it all on top of the belt, leaving all the hangars in a big tangled mess. I had to stop the belt and take everything off the hangars so I could get at the tags to scan them and they didn't like how long it took. They just laughed as I untangled everything and kept saying to each other, ""What's taking so long??"" The pregnant one kept calling her friend a whore and threatened to run her over with the scooter. 

Once I finally had it all untangled and scanned, pregnant girl zoomed off after calling her friend a whore once more. Her friend was left to pay the $1500 bill and began digging through her purse. 

She spent nearly 10 minutes digging a whole bunch of crumpled $10 and $20 bills out of the bottom of her purse and when that didn't add up, began digging for loonies and toonies. Meanwhile the line is steadily forming behind her.

Once all her crumpled money is out and counted, pregnant girl zooms back and tells her whore friend to, ""hurry the fuck up"" or else she'll ""pee in the car."" Not even a thank you to her friend for buying her all these baby clothes. Then they left.

nodnarb232001,130,130,1qy1mf,532,"A little background- This is my first post here (and on Reddit itself), so, be gentle.
I've worked fast food for the better part of a decade now and make it a point to deliver the best customer service possible (and am frequently complimented by customers on that). In that time, I've seen some crazy displays of the unimpressive parts of human behavior. The following is one of those times.

Working the cashier window, taking orders, taking money, generally going through the day like normal, when a customer hands me a Food Stamp card (they're called something else here, but I'll just refer to them as Food Stamp cards) to try to pay for their food. The total is hovering around $15-16.
In this state Food Stamp cards cannot be used for anything at restaurants, and our registers will flat-out decline the card if it's scanned. There is no way to circumvent that. I have the following exchange with the customer, whom I'll call Cheap-Ass Bitch (CAB).

&gt;Me- I'm sorry, we can't take that card.

&gt;CAB- *smugly* Oh? Why not?

&gt;Me- Food Stamp cards cannot be used to buy food that's prepared for you.

&gt;CAB- No, you can take it. I buy food here with it all the time!

&gt;Me- Ma'am, the register itself declines the card and I can't make it take it.

&gt;CAB- You CAN and you WILL!

(By this time, a sizeable line has formed in drive-through and I can hear people elsewhere in the store 
shouting back towards me that the line isn't move...as if I wasn't aware...)
&gt;Me- Ma'am, we legally cannot accept that card and have no way of using it. Do you have any other way to pay?

&gt;CAB- I AM THE CUSTOMER I PAY YOUR SALARY AND YOU WILL USE THE CARD!!!

(At this point, I'm fed up and have a rare moment where I start to snap)

&gt;Me- Ma'am, do you know how that Food Stamp card works?

&gt;CAB- YOU WILL RUN

&gt;Me- (Cutting her off) That Food Stamp card is funded by tax dollars. MY tax dollars. No. You're not ""Paying my salary"" by trying to use that card, since part of it is the money that I paid into the system through taxes. Now, please, do you have any other method of payment?

&gt;CAB- *taken aback at this uppity fast food drone standing up to her, and sputtering* Fine. Here. *thrusts a $20 at me*

&gt;Me- *takes it, cashes her out* Have a nice day.

tl;dr- If you plan on trying to commit Food Stamp fraud on someone who isn't having it, don't try to play the ""I PAY YOUR SALARY!"" card.

So one day whilst working a shift as the pro audio department manager, an attractive lady walks in and begins to look around. My slightly new co-worker K engages her and she's talking about she is interested in becoming a DJ. No problems there. K comes and asks me to assist him in closing the sale, not a problem. We get her into a very nice introductory setup - everything's cool. K begins ringing her up and announces the total - $1200. Lady doesn't even blink at the amount and pulls out a wad of cash. K looks at me with a bewildered look ""Ack, I've never seen that much cash before."" Me being used to dealing with large cash transactions, I just told him to make sure he counts it properly and drops it in the safe. He begins to count the money and is looking very nervous. I stand next to him and ask what's going on. ""Ummm Ack, this is a lot of cash."" I look at him then at the customer and immediately figure out why he's nervous. (In a lot of cases at our store, when folks pay large amounts of cash they tend to be involved in not so legal activities but money is money and as long as the sale gets made, I don't ask questions.) He's making the assumption that she's potentially a drug dealer. I begin to figure out ways to not make the situation any more tense when the customer speaks up and says ""Don't worry, it's not drug money, I'm a stripper.""

The one on the scooter jokingly swerves the thing and almost hits one of my coworkers. Everybody, including the driver, laughs it off and continues with the rest of the night.

JasonNBD,3,7,1qxy70,14,"It was the start of my shift at the grocery store, I was looking for my manager and walked into one of the aisles (had to google spelling). I see a group huddled around a man, this guy had just had a seziur and was dazed. My manager had a blanket around him, and was giving him water, I could see there was a tiny bit of blood on the floor because he must have hit his head on the fall down.

Couple minutes pass by, and two big paramedics show up with a stretcher, and start talking to the man. With around 4 people plus the paramedics right in this guys face, he started to get nervous and attempted to get up. The paramedics both held him back ""whoa whoa not so fast there"" one of them said. They held him back and told him to sit down. He kept trying to stand up, and finally did.

This guy had a blank expression on his face, he reminded me of a wild deer or animal. The paramedics franticly try to get him to sit down, he lunges at one of the paramedics and tries punching him.  The two paramedics attempt to calm him down, approaching him slowley. The old man then targets the second paramedic and lunges at him with a sucker punch.

catielynnb,45,198,1qxv44,749,"I've got a few stories having been in and out of retail for ~6 years. No major gold mines of irritation with managers, at least not from my most recent position, and I dislike (personally) getting into those. 
However, I'm loaded with great customer stories. 

----

My current workplace, we're just generic retail, and deal a lot in pop culture. There are several clothing items and decoration-y things relating to different fandoms, movies, games, etc, but we also carry generic clothing items, sweatshirts, hoodies, pants. This story, is about pants. 

A few nights ago, got a kid (probably 11-12) and his mom in looking at some Doctor Who things, and he's decked out in buttons, keychain Tardis, and a Tardis shirt. I knew this kid and I would be friends, as an avid Whovian, so I walked over and told them about the sales, and asked him who his favorite doctor was. Bam, sales-win. 

Normally I try not to stay with a customer the whole time, because I don't want to be pushy, but this kid kept asking questions, so I kept answering. Ended up getting him in the dressing room to try on a shirt, after about 15 minutes. While we walked back in my tiny store to the one dressing room, his mom noticed the 'Wall of Pants' and exclaimed, 'MYGOODNESS, 26"" WAISTS!?'. She grabbed one, and brought them along with her. 

I love selling denim, it's eaaaaaaaaaasy. 

Ended up, she grabbed a pair of super duper skinny jeans, and the poor kid was like 'I can't, I can't feel my legs.' While I wandered off to find a pair of regular cut, she was telling her son to put his regular pants back on. I came back up, with two different styles and colors. Mom yells into fitting room 'TAKE YOUR PANTS OFF RIGHT NOW!' and I couldn't help but smile, and kind of laugh. 

I try not to have these reactions, often, although sometimes there are several moments during the day I could, and the mom caught me. I thought I was in trouble, based on the look on her face, but instead, she went on to embarrass her son a little more. 'BUT, IF ANY OTHER GIRL EVER TELLS YOU THAT, YOU PULL YOUR PANTS UP RIGHT THEN....'

I had to walk away,... because laughs.

I did end up coming back to them and she bought two pairs of jeans and several shirts, and even complimented me on my customer service. As they left, she stayed back and told me, 'I have to embarrass him as much as I can now. He's getting too old, too fast.' ","When Mom says, 'Take your pants off,' she means it.",947
Sigillite,15,21,1qxrkh,66,"For the past couple of months I have been working at a restaurant in my hometown. I had been let down by being told by my college that I wouldnt be able to get a position which would have gotten me out of the service industry for good.

That same day though I walked in after seeing their ad posted, got an interview, and an offer all within a half hour! Awesome! Turned my day right around. For about a month all was well.

The owner ""Mike"" was great; came from the service side so he was flexible with staff, great with guests, and ran a really tight ship. One of my favorite managers of any job. His wife ""Stephanie,"" though, was just awful. She was great at the business and catering side of the restaurant, but get her anywhere near a guest, or come to her with an issue, and she would find some way to make it worse.

My training was next to nothing, aside from learning the menu and showing me around. It was a new computer system and thanks to that, I would make mistakes that would piss her off, yet how am I supposed to know the proper procedure if noone ever told me in the first place?? The way that they did add-ons or changes to a menu item was not what I was used to, yet noone told me what I was doing was wrong until more than two months into the job.

She also would constantly talk down to the wait staff. I dunno how to explain it, but every time she had a criticism or asked us to do something it was like she had asked us to do it twenty times before and we were all the stupidest people in the world. When I didnt know the ordering procudure, for example, she said ""You've been here for a while shouldnt you know this already?"" Well, no, you ass, because I only had four days of training and the people who trained me were fired not a week after I started!

Red flags all over the place.

I'm also in grad school, which is so far above this stupid job on my priorities list I have to decompress on my way home or I'll get the bends. What's unusual about my program though is that we have 7 week terms. I started in August, and so my availability originally had me working about 6 shifts a week. It was just too much on top of the grad school workload, which was much more than I had anticipated. I asked to reduce my shifts to only 3, on thursday friday and saturday mornings. Lunch is busy, so I made plenty of money for what I needed and they seemed ok with it.
When my class schedule changed though, I couldnt work thursday mornings anymore. I told them that a week before it changed, and I was still scheduled thursday. No big deal, I left class early and was there on time. Next week, same thing. I left class early and reminded Stephanie that my availability had changed and I couldnt work thursday mornings moving forward. She made a big huff and acted like changed the schedule was the worst thing in the world. Apparently, it is really hard to move people around because ""everyone has the shifts that they like"" and ""Not a lot of people can work thursdays.""

Keep in mind that they havent replaced 4 servers that have left in the two months I have been there. It is me and three other waiters, the rest are bartenders. 
Sorry, not my fault. I open up my availability so that I could work any night of the week, friday and saturday mornings, as long as I kept my three shift a week schedule. 

So last week I wasnt scheduled for anything... weird... computer systems being what they are though I assume its a mistake. I can still log in online and see the schedule but Im not on it. I call the restaurant and the hostess tells me that I am not on the schedule. Ok, what the fuck? Are you really doing this? I wait until its been two weeks with no schedule to call back and ask to talk to her. And she wont talk to me. What the hell man, be unprofessional and let me know Im fired by not scheduling me fine, but at least tell me WHY.

She really pissed me off through this whole thing so I was thinking of a way to get back at them, and my girlfriend suggested filing for unemployment benefits which will cause their federal unemployment tax to go up, whether I get the benefits or not, because of their high turnover rate.

InspectorVII,11,12,1qxqo3,53,"Nothing flips the bitch switch faster than when a customer hears no and then breaks into the sob story.

Today I had an attempted return.  No receipt, discontinued product, in all probability something I haven't sold in quite a long time.  Let alone ""yesterday"" as the customer had claimed (I should mention at this point yesterday was Sunday, we are not open on Sunday).  As graciously as my little heart could bear I declined to do the refund on the long discontinued well used product.  However I did note that if she does happen to located the receipt our return policy does extend 90 days and I may be able to work something out with a valid receipt.  With that I am usually done, off to the next customer.  However, I would not be ranting hear if the customer accepted defeat and moved on with life.

His first argument was, ""I just bought this, it is defective"".  To which I reiterate, without valid recipient I unfortunately cannot refund you.

Second argument was "" You should guarantee things.  You are ripping off your customers""  To which I reply.  I absolutely do guarantee things, with valid receipt.

This argument ""I am in here all the time, you should remember me.  You should know I bought this.  How do you even do business if you don't know who your customers are?""  To which I reply that I see hundreds, possibly thousands of different faces every week.   

The final straw was that ""This is for my friend who is dying.  Do you know how hard it is to care for somebody who is dying? You are making this situation much worse.  Don't you have any empathy?  Don't you even care?  All you fucking care about is money.  You're nothing but a con artist""

Cue bitch mode.

I respond, at this point now shaking mad. ""Sir, we are done here.  Leave now.""

However this is an unacceptable solution.  He continues into a story about how much suffering his friend is enduring and how he doesn't have the money to replace defective items.   How I am a horrible person for not doling out freebies because somebody tells me a sad story.

Eventually after about 10 minutes of ignoring him he left, taking a business card on the way out.  My business card, the manager.   I look forward to that complaint.

I should elaborate the reason why this bothers me so much is because we all deal with our fair share of personal tragedy, it is difficult and unfortunate part of life.  It is also inevitable.   Some of us are entrenched in it.  Some of us are working past it.  Some of us are just starting the journey.   It is not that I don't want you to share.  It is not that I wont lend a sympathetic ear.  It is just when you use it as a trump card, and assume that I have no understanding of what this is like I become very offended.

So a week ago a customer comes in and purchases a few travel adapters. He calls the store up a few hours later claiming we didn't give him his change and hangs up saying he will be back. We count the till and it's exact so I figure he will find it in his other pocket or something. Everything is fine and dandy.
Fast forward 3 days and he shows up in a huff. He states he called about not getting his change. I try to explain we counted the till, and we were not off anything. At this point he is begins accusing me of pocketing his money. After a few more minutes of back and forth, he pulls out the receipt and points at the total stating that's the money we owe him.

Dr_Kelvin,50,46,1qxl83,222,"When I was in Highschool in Australia, I worked at a photo processing store across from a Supermarket. It was a reasonably up market processing chain, so the prices were a little higher than some of the other chains around the area, for example the processing cost for 36 photos was around $15 or $11 with a coupon from the Supermarket. 

One night a lady came in to pick up her photos, I quoted her the standard price of $15, she looked at me and said “I am not paying that”, cue an awkward silence before I reply “Well that is the price”. She again says “I am not paying that much, that is way too much for a roll of film”, to attempt to avoid any more arguments in front of the customers behind her I said “Ok Ma’am, no problems, I will be happy to ring you up for the coupon price of $11 then”. I started to ring it up for the discounted price and she stops me and says “No, I will not pay $11 either; I will only pay $9 for that roll of film because that is how much it should be.” I am generally pretty calm, but for some reason her attitude that night pushed me over the edge, so I held up her photos, pointed at the supermarket across from the store and said “Ma’am, I don’t know how you think this works but you cannot just come into a store and tell them how much you’re willing to pay for something. Do you walk into the supermarket pick up a steak and tell them how much you’re going to pay? No, you don’t, you pay the amount that is listed on the product. I don’t know why you think because we print photos the rules have changed, but they haven’t.” I threw her photos back into the drawer where we kept the prints that were ready to be picked up and continued “I am not sure why you think you can name your price, but I am more than happy to hold onto your cherished memories until you are ready to pay the full $15 as you do not have a coupon, if you’re aren’t ready to pay that they will be thrown out in 30 days as per store policy.” As I finished my rant her eyes were pretty wide and before she could reply my Manager ran up behind me and told me to go on break. 


I later found out he only charged her $9 for the photos and I also got written up with an official warning for poor customer service.

It was totally worth it.

aub51zzz,20,37,1qxj70,186,"I've been reading these posts for a while now, so I decided I would share one of the *many* stories I have from working in the food service industry. 

I work at a chicken finger chain restaurant that has a drive-thru and a lobby, and this particular branch gets extremely busy during our peak times. This specific day, I was working in the drive-thru. My other coworkers and I are all on hyper-speed trying to get customers out of the drive-thru as fast as we can without sacrificing the quality of the food. We normal do an exceptional job at this. 

During one of our bursts, a car pulls up to the speaker, and I greet the customer over the headset with one of our overly-friendly, rhyming greetings. The woman on the other end clicks her tongue and says, ""I don't know what you just said. I just want my chicken."" 

I roll my eyes, even though she would not be able to see it. ""Sure thing, ma'am! What can I get for you?""

The lady proceeds with her order, and though she is rather snippy with her responses, it goes smoothly enough. She orders the most popular combo, which comes with a regular (21 oz) drink, specifies that she wants tea (which does not cost any extra,) and I tell her the total and she pulls up to the next window. 

We are slowing down at this point, and the coworker expoing the food runs to the restroom. I am left making the drinks and handing out the food, and luckily for me there are no more cars left ordering. 

The snippy woman pulls up to the window I was at and I smile as she rolls down her window. ""Hi, ma'am! You had a &lt;such-and-such&gt; combo with a tea to drink..."" I hand her the drink and she looks at me like I was the Devil. She has her fingers around the drink like it is full of poison, and asks,

""What the fuck is this?""

I am taken aback. ""Excuse me, ma'am?""

""The combo comes with a *large*, 32oz drink!""

I know this is incorrect, but my coworker has just come back and the drive-thru is picking up again. He is taking orders and the cars are building up. 

""Ma'am, the &lt;such-and-such&gt; combo comes with the regular, 21oz drink. Only the &lt;other&gt; combo comes with the large.""

She thrusts the drink back into my hand and clicks her tongue again. ""No. You're wrong. The other store in &lt;the neighboring town&gt; *always* gives me the large."" Which is wrong.

The cars are beginning to wrap around the store, and not wanting to upset a customer, I oblige with her obvious request. ""I am sorry about that confusion, ma'am. I will be more than happy to upgrade your drink for no extra charge."" I take her drink into the window and get her a larger tea, hoping that she will be appreciative and on her way. However, my patience is not enough for this woman. I hand her the drink with a smile on my face and hand her the food. ""Anything else I can get for you today, ma'am?""

""Your manager! I cannot believe the lack of service here!"" She goes on and on, and I quickly grab my manager. He tries to soothe her and offers her a free combo on her next visit, but she isn't taking it. She starts yelling, ""I am sick and tired of these high school drop-outs fucking up my orders!"" 

At this point, I am furious. At the time I was a high school senior, and I was soon to be graduated and off to one of the best, most prestigious public schools in the state. I nudge my manager out of the way and kindly say to the woman, ""Ma'am, can you please explain how I messed up your order to my manager?""

The woman is red with anger now and says, ""She gave me the wrong fucking drink!"" 
I point to the drink in her hand. ""What size is that drink, ma'am?""

""A large...?""

""Yes, ma'am. And what size did you want?""

""A large.""

""Correct. Now, I could have charged you extra for upgrading your drink, but I didn't. Because you paid for a regular. If you have an issue with my customer service, please explain it again to my manager.""

The lady stutters, fumbling for the words to explain the major crime committed against her.

""Anything else, ma'am?""

She shakes her head. 

""Alrighty then! Once again I apologize for the inconvenience. I guess they won't teach me manners until I get to college in a semester. Have an *awesome* day!""

The fact that she got so angry over a *drink* still amazes me to this day...

Story:
This weekend we had a very popular race in town, which brings in people from all over the country and internationally. Now, I work behind cases. Two gentleman come into the store, one speaking English and the other speaking another language. We will call them ES for English speaker and NS for not speaking.

I show them a few watches from my cases, explaining how the particular brand is pretty awesome. 

NS proceeds to ***reach over the case*** to point out/grab a watch he wanted to see. My reflexes kicked in and I slapped his hand, and pointed my finger in his face, wagging it slightly and shouted ""NO!"" As if he were a dog. I have a dog at home, so I guess that's where my reflex came in. 

He looked at me, shocked. I put the watches up and stared blankly at him. They asked for another brand that I do not carry, so I pointed them to another store. 

Needless to say, I'm sure he'll never try that again.

**Me, after checking her order**: Your order was sent to 1234 Main St., New York, NY. It should have arrived yesterday.

**Consumer**: No! Her address is 12**43** Main St., New York, NY. Are you telling me you sent the package to the wrong address and never told me?!

**Me**: You gave us 12**34** Main St. We don't hand write the shipping labels. Our system took the information you gave us and printed the label based on what you typed in.

**Consumer**: I checked Google Maps and that address doesn't even exist. What are you going to do about it? Where is my package? You better refund me or resend my order for free. I am going to dispute the charge on my credit card because I didn't get what I ordered.

**Me**: We don't send web orders through FedEx or UPS, so we don't have tracking numbers. USPS/US mail doesn't give us that option, and they don't contact us when something can't be delivered.

I’ve written before about being wholly unprepared for some of the “human elements” of being a manager. This is another case. Shit like this is just not covered in business school, but it should be. So I’ll lay it out, tell you what I did, and invite your comments in hopes it may help others.

“Enid” was a middle-aged woman who was hired to service accounts over the phones. I did not hire her, but I didn’t object. Her background suggested she’d be a good fit.

She breezed through training without issue. She was assigned a cubicle not far from my own cube.

It only took a few days on the”floor” before the crazy started.

Enid complained to her supervisor that insects where biting her. The bugs were living under her desk. It was making her work difficult.

Supervisor wait until Enid leaves for the day and does an inspection. He sees nothing. On his way out he dropped by and told me what was going on.

On the off chance there was an actual infestation, I put in a work order to have the area sprayed down over the weekend. Supervisor passed this along to Enid, and she seemed satisfied.

I should pause her to say that we tried to go way out of our way to make sure phone people were happy. Especially new hires. Even if there might be a touch of crazy. Once we hired someone and put her/him through training, we’ve spend close to $20,000 developing the person.

So Enid was going to get white glove treatment.

The weekend came and went. The whole area (not just her desk) was sprayed, vacuumed and dusted. Clean.

Within two hours of Monday’s shift, Enid was back at Supervisor’s desk. Bugs. Still there. She made it a point to show a calf full of bug bites to Supervisor (who did not need to see that).

We waited for Enid to go to lunch. Then we both crawled around looking for bugs. We even pulled up an outlet and inspected the raised-floor space for bugs.

No bugs.

We even asked her cube neighbors if they had any problems. Nope.

At this point, I conceded that we may be dealing with a hiring mistake.

Supervisor told Enid that we’ve inspected, sprayed, inspected again, and verified with others; there was nothing we could find. There was little he could think of doing to make the situation better.

She became really pissed-off and walked into my cube.

“I’m being eaten alive and nobody is doing a damn thing about it!”

“I’m sorry Enid. I’m sure you feel bad, but we can’t find anything, and we can’t do much beyond spraying. We’ve not able to find the source of what is biting you.”

“I can’t work in this kind of environment.”

Okay … I’ll try one other tactic. “Here’s what we can do. I’ll have you move to another desk. We have a few others open. I’ll make sure there are no insects before we move you. Just give me a couple hours.”

We found he another cube, and had our facilities manager confirm it was bug free. He also gave the area a light dusting of pesticide. We gave it an hour to air out and moved Enid into her new space.

Tuesday comes. Enid is back in my doorway. “They are still here! I can see them! They are tiny white bugs and they are still biting me. I’m going to the doctor.”

No objections to her leaving to seek medical help. I hoped that the doctor would give her some insight that I could use to resolve the matter. I also went looking for white bugs. No bugs.

Wednesday morning, Enid approaches Supervisor. She pulls her pants down just a bit, exposing a scabies-infected splotch at the top of her butt-cheek.

“I got scabies from working here!” she insisted. (Note, if you feel like throwing up today, read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scabies).

I asked her to go see our occupational nurse. Off she went. The nurse calls an hour later.

“Did she tell you she has scabies?”

“Yup.” I said.

“There’s no chance she got it here. It’s transmitted from direct contact with an already infected person. Unless she’s sitting on someone’s lap, the odds of picking it up at a cube are tiny.”

“Okay. Is she coming back up?”

“She’s on her way.”

Enid appears a minute later.

“I don’t know what to do. I’m being eaten alive by a parasite and nobody wants to help.”

I give Enid a quick review of what we’ve done to mitigate the problem.

“So what’s next?” She asks.

“We can’t do anything else. We’ve done all we can to accommodate you. There is simply nothing left to be done. I’m sorry you’re having a rough time, but I have to ask you to return to your desk now and begin working.”

“Fine.”

From this point forward, she got no additional support on the issue. She bitched and moaned for a few more weeks, and then finally quit with a vague threat of impending lawsuits. We were never actually sued, and never heard from her again.

vegasyndrome,14,13,1qwpva,22,"Let's say they are in your store. They have a product in their hands and the next thing that comes out of their mouth is ""Your competitor XYZ is selling this product $10 less. Can you do a price match?""

Of course I always check to see if it's true. I go on their website and call from a private line. I also ask the following questions:

1. Do you have it in stock?
If they don't, that's usually the main reason why they are asking for the price match. They can't get their hands on it over at XYZ. 

If they do have it in stock...

2. What colours or styles do you carry? (if applicable)
Doesn't make sense for me to do a price match if they don't stock the same colours or styles as my store.

Despite verifying the price of a product at XYZ if they don't have exactly what the customer wants then I won't entertain the thought of a price match. 

We also refuse to price match with big box stores because they are able to buy pallets and can afford to sell at a lower price which we can't. 

Some companies we sign an agreement every year to agree to sell at the MSRP to balance out the playing field among stores. I know some managers who call up distributors and reps to rat out other stores that advertise a lower price. The most recent on I heard was a popular UK juvenile brand cut out a certain large online store for selling below the MSRP.

BraveSouls,10,15,1qwppq,51,"First post to TFR! It's a bit long, sorry!


**Some background:** I work for a privately owned consignment shop. For those that don't know, it's a second-hand shop (though we also sell new items), but not like pawn shops where the owners can get a loan for an item or get paid the least amount the shop workers can get away with for the items before they resell them. We take the items in and once they sell, we get a commission off the sale, and the original owners get a check in the mail once a month.  

[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)   

I've been working there for a few weeks now, and I love it. My boss, the owner, is awesome and most of the items we have are really cool and interesting. I learn a lot about all sorts of things when researching the items or from customers coming in. It's the first retail job I've had where I genuinely enjoy working at. Most of the customers are really nice as well, but there's always the select few who could make you want to tighten that noose just a little bit.  

[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)   

**People that complain they have to pay tax.**

This is one I get the most. I've had people laugh like I'm joking or rolling their eyes that they have to pay sales tax. No really, you DO have to pay the tax. They like to treat us like we're a fancy in-door yard sale, but we're not. It's still a retail shop in a state that charges sales tax. If we have to pay taxes, so do you. Sorry, but that's just how it works.

I had this one guy give me the “really?” look. I'd reply “Yes, sir!” with the big fake smile all of my fellow retail slaves know so well. No harm done, he pays it and is on his way, but still it can be a little irksome. Especially when they give me a hard time about it as they pay. They make like it takes so much effort to get an extra dollar out of their wallet when they've already put it away.

**Hagglers**

Everyone wants to get the best deal, and I generally don't have a problem with that. We aren't a big box retail store where prices are never negotiable, however as mentioned above we're also not some schmucks selling items out the back of a truck. My boss wants to make the customers happy, but also consider his consignors who drop off the items. Most of which, including myself before I started working for him, are repeat consignors. They'll drop off more items once a month or so, but if they see their items are selling for less than what they were hoping for they may not come back. Depending on how long an item has been in the store, or if the items are abandoned, he might be willing to lower the price if a customer asks for it.   

[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)   

We had this one woman come in looking at a stack of four handmade weaved baskets with tops. They were pretty big, the size of old fashioned picnic baskets (minus the handles), maybe a bit smaller. They didn't have prices on them so when she asked Boss-man said the two bigger ones were $20 a piece while the smaller ones, though still relatively big, were $15 but he'd sell her the lot for $45. Now I know this may seem high to some, but these were quality baskets and they hadn't been used before. I thought it was a good deal anyway.

She fires back “I'll give you $30”

Boss-man politely declines and holds firm at $45, she doesn't buy them and leaves. She wasn't mad or anything that I could tell. Had she proposed $40 he may have gone for it, but there was no way he was going to go for $30, especially given the deal she was already getting.

I haven't gotten any super angry customers as of yet since working there, but my boss has told me some crazy stories. We're also getting into the Christmas shopping season and I'm sure I'll have my own angry customer stories to tell.

so0ks,14,26,1qwp4i,96,"Yesterday, Illinois had some pretty bad weather blow through as well as tornados. I live and work in Chicagoland. It's about noon when we're looking out the windows of the local burger joint I work at. Our food is made to order, so we always park cars at the drive thru. This was not happening today. The winds were howling. The clouds were rolling over and swirling around, and the sky rapidly darkened. Every now and then, lightning would streak across the clouds. In the morning, we got a few sudden hits of torrential downpour. The FSM literally dumped the entire water content of His pot on us when He went to strain His pasta. There is a huge sloping ditch next to our parking lit, and it became a miniature lake by around noon time.

We got a call from one of the owners, and we all stopped doing what we were doing. NOPE. She wants us to stay open. Areyoufuckingkiddingme.

So we had to take orders at the window since it was impossible to hear anything but wind at the speaker, and since we were not parking, only one order at a time was going out. People were getting impatient and we had a few drive off from the drive thru line. By half past noon, nobody was outside, and the few customers we had in the dining room didn't want to leave. Which was totally fine and understandable. Especially when the tornado sirens started going off.

The clouds a few miles out that we were watching from the window looked like they were trying to form. We start trying to gather up the two families left to shepherd them into the bathroom, when I hear my headset beep. I look over at the other cook who was manning drive with me. She goes to answer it, and the guy starts trying to yell over the sirens his order.

Dude. Get the fuck out of your car and come inside.

He eventually gives up trying at the speaker box while my coworker was trying to get him to just get inside. He pulls up at the window and actually honks at us.

The sirens didn't last long, and nothing touched down by me yesterday. The winds and rain were brutal though. About an hour after the sirens went off, the sun broke through the clouds for about an hour before we were hit again with torrential rains. The winds never stopped.

Bears won though. BEAR DOWN!

VoicesDontStop,32,63,1qwlwh,305,"Okay so I'm not employed but I think this story belongs here.

A little back story I'm 17 looking for a job. my mom is one of those people on this subreddit that you guys dont like ( yelling at people for small thing, not understanding clearly stated rules to sales,coupons, etc.) its kind of embarrassing shopping with her. 

-

So I'm with my mom at this little outlet Verizon store trying to see if we can get some internet for our apartment. The guy helping us out was nice enough, helpful and explained everything pretty well. He set us up with a internet package with DSL internet and a TV package. 

So Verizon has to send us a modem through UPS, as it turns out Verizon gave UPS the wrong address (to our last residence, don't really know how they got that) so my mom gets PISSED so to calm her down I tell her I'll call UPS and fix it. 

So I'm talking to a UPS rep trying to get everything fixed and I do but mom asks me to hand over the phone so she can talk to them, me not thinking about it hands her the phone.

Mom: yes hello are with UPS?

UPS lady says something, I assume she says ""yes""

Mom: WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS!? I""VE BEEN WAITING ALMOST WEEK FOR THAT! YOU GUYS KNOW WHERE TO BILL ME BUT YOU CANT BRING ME MY BOX?!

I'm just there speechless as to why she is yelling at this poor woman.

Me: MOM! 

Mom: WHAT VoicesDontStop?

Me: they aren't the internet company, they're just the delivery company it's not their fault. Verizon gave them the wrong address.

Mom:......... hello? yes I'm sorry for that, here talk to my son.

I take the phone.

Me: Hello?

UPS Woman: Yes will that be all you were trying to fix?

Me: um, yeah.... sorry about that ma'ma.

UPS Woman: No I'm sorry.

Me: what? what do you mean?

UPS Woman: You have to live with her.

after that I hang up laugh to myself and go on with my day. A couple days later my bro told me about how she went down to the Verizon store and made a scene yelling at the Verizon guy who helped us get the internet package.

Evenstar22,0,12,1qwl4z,8,"I know, I know. It's been a year since I posted part 1. So roast me. 

Anyway, back to the story. I spent the weekend celebrating with a mate and drinking cheap beer, thinking that my troubles were over. Little did I know, they had just begun.

I came in Monday at 8. The fat man was wondering around muttering under his breath when I arrived, and one of the floor employees, we'll call him Rock Man, brought me coffee and an egg sandwich. Awesomesauce, we were off to a good start.

I headed into the goldfish bowl, munching on my egg sandwich, and noticed that the smell had intensified since my last visit. Oh well. I'd just pick up some air freshener, right? Though today I am convinced the fat man must have been jizzing all over the office. Anyway, I took my seat at the desk and spent several uneventful hours cashing people out as the hive of activity intensifies.

The Rod man turned up. He was a great guy and a Mate of Steve, the aforementioned awesome GM. He introduces himself and keeps the staring down my top to a minimum, and as a consequence I gladly fetch the Fat Man for him. He wants to know why his georgian cedar table is not on the floor for Auction- he delivered it Wednesday. Now the fat man, I am to learn, has a bad habit of selling items off the floor, pocketing the cash, and going and spending it on 1)the waif, his boytoy, 2) late night meals or 3) random shit that takes his fancy (once this was enough pez packets to keep the entire staff going for months).

Unfortunately the other half of his bad habit was not remembering how much he had sold these items for, and regularly lying to consignors about where their items had disappeared to. He manages to placate the Rod man but comes back with a bit of a temper on, and stomps into his back office for several hours. Not that I mind. Basically far less smelly when he isn't close enough for his unwashed odour to take up it's own postcode.

I put it out of my mind and keep cashing people out. It reaches about 9pm and the long day is finally over, the black widow (so named because she never wore anything else and had a bizarre sort of gravitational pull) and I have managed to cash out, and I have managed to prove that no, we aren't short. This would become a regular issue while she was still my boss, as I would later discover she had been stuffing cash in envelopes and embezzling, then balancing the books with some sort of arachnid off mathematics.

Dave heads past me and into the Boss's lair. Except he isn't there, and he's the only one with safe keys. I follow Dave upon hearing the loud stream of expletives pouring out his mouth, and discover the stench that is the small enclosed room where the Fat Man keeps his floor mattress, numerous bags of half empty take-out, and the daily take.

The mattress has no sheets, smells, and some interesting looking stains on it, and strewn across it is the Boss's single pair of filthy overalls that he wore each and every day and never seemed to wash. I know they were the same pair, because the were all torn at the shoulder. Steve calls Matt, his second in command in, and the black widow takes the opportunity to bugger off home while none of us are looking.

So in our hands we have 30k in cash, a warehouse we can't lock the doors too, and some dirty overalls. We are debating one of us staying there, or just leaving. Steve finally says that he is going to have to search the Fat Man's overalls to see if we are lucky enough to find his keys still in his pockets.

Pocket 1. No. Pocket 2. Steve reaches in with a look of fear (fairly so) and pulls out something fabric. And kind of white. In a flash he drops them, and his face whitens a little. And we all realize with dawning horror that these are The Fat Man's skidmark stained tighty whities. I, fortunately, had hand sanitizer in my purse, and graciously handed him the bottle and told him there was no need to give it back.

The keys were found, in that same pocket, and we were saved. But poor Steve never recovered. And we never managed to figure out how The Fat Man managed to leave without a staff of 20 and countless people noticing, nor what he wore. Because in the entire 6 months I was to work there, I never saw him wearing anything but those overalls.....

RenM,60,18,1qwc0g,121,"So I used to work as a pharmacy technician which means I both handled prescriptions and rang up everyday shopping items for customers. It was a combo hell. Here are some of the stories:

1. We had a regular that was HIV positive, super nice, but also a bit mentally disabled. His mother often brought him to the store or just picked up his meds for him. However, one day he came in without her and we exchanged our normal pleasantries. He said he needed a refill, I said I needed a new prescription, he pulls it out of his wallet and I see that his finger is bleeding (it looked like a paper cut). He take out his prescription with said bleeding finger, and attempts to hand it to me. Normally policy is to hold a customer until you are done running the script incase insurance feels like making the job extra awful. Instead I say while typing, ""Oh no, [name]. It looks like you cut yourself. Just put the script on the counter and here take a bandage (which I don't hand to him but instead place on the counter, normally rude but...). We'll call you when the script is ready."" He just smiles, says thanks, puts on the bandaid, and walks away. I smile until he disappears behind an aisle and then tell the pharmacist what just happened. In the end we cleaned it up and my manager actually called his mom. His mom apologized. She was sick and he wanted to run errands on his own. I guess she explained to him that he can't bleed on public things b/c he apologized profusely the next time he came in with her. 

2. Our duties board is posted in a place that customers can see it. This means if they feel like being creepy they can tell when you start work, get off work, or take a lunch break. I had one older gentleman look at my name tag, then at the board, and then he said, ""I'll be waiting for you at 9pm."" Then he winked and walked away. The assistant manager walked me to my car that night.

3. Another older gentleman came to pick up his viagra. That stuff is expensive so most men only get a few pills at a time and refill as necessary. This man said, ""My wife and I don't do it that often anymore. Maybe one of these pills has your name on it?"" Me: ""No, I'm pretty sure they just say 'Pfizer' on one side and 'VGR 100' on the other. Sorry."" Then I walked away. 

4. I lady comes up to buy a behind-the-counter cold medicine. 
Me: ""Can I see your drivers license please?"" 
Lady: ""No."" 
Me: Kind of caught off guard. ""Um...I need it to sell you the medicine."" 
Lady: ""Why?"" 
Me: ""State law."" 
Lady: ""Why"" (She was well into her 40's so I'm not sure why she was mimicking a toddler).
Me: ""Because some of the ingredients can be used to make illegal drugs.""
Lady: ""Like what?""
Me: ""Meth.""
Lady: ""I don't make meth. Can I have it now please?""
Me: ""No, I still need a drivers license.""
Then she asked for the manager. I got the pharmacist and she had nearly the exact same conversation with her. The lady ended up just leaving. To this day I still think she was screwing with us.

5. My favorite story. There was a doctor in the area that had a couple of his prescription pads nicked. All the pharmacies were on alert and he had already agreed to call in any prescriptions until he could get new pads made. Well a couple comes in (and not to judge but they were the rattiest, dirtiest, couple I had ever seen. I mean they actually had dirt on them and smelled like they hadn't bathed in weeks.) and gives me a prescription for a Class 1 Controlled Substance I had never seen filled in my 3 years of working there. We always had a bottle stocked but I never saw us actually fill a prescription for it. This was my first red flag. Then I get to the doctors name and it's just a scribble (not really uncommon), so I go to the typewritten section and realize it's for the doctor that had his prescription pads stolen. I tell them I'm sorry but I can't fill the prescription. I don't give them a reason why. (I hadn't thought this through yet.) So they say okay and instead of leaving pull out a second prescription but for a simple Class 3 Controlled Drug. This time I just take the prescription, smile and say I'll call you when it's ready. Instead I called the cops. 

6. Finally, my last story which shows that sometimes it's not the customer that is the jerk. It's a pharmacy. We sell Plan B. If you are over 18 you do not need a prescription. So I'm working prescription drop off, the pharmacist is mixing up a compound, and my least favorite coworker is working prescription pick up. It's late so it is just the three of us, and I had no customers so I'm just filling the next days orders when a lady walks up to the pick up area. She is a good 30 feet away and very quiet so I can't really hear what she says. Apparently my coworker couldn't hear her either b/c she goes ""What?"" The customer speaks up and all I hear is Plan B. I know my coworker hates all birth control, but what she does next is mortifying. 
Lady: mumble mumble ""Plan B"" mumble mumble
Coworker: ""Oh."" She looks at me, and opens her mouth. 
Me (thinking): ""Don't you dare do it. Don't you dare.""
Coworker (yelling): ""This lady wants some Plan B. Will you take care of it? I won't fill a baby killing drug.""
There is a loud clanging as the pharmacist drops her pestle, the customer begins to cry, and I am just standing there jaw open. 

The pharmacist could not control herself. She yells my coworkers name and brings her into the back room. I take care of the crying customer and get her a gift card that more than pays for the Plan B. I apologize profusely, and she leaves no longer crying but obviously upset. 

My coworker comes out upset and angry, but she returns to her job. About 40 minutes later I'm off for the night so I clock out. I walk from behind the counter to pick up look at my coworker and go ""I need to pick up a prescription. *pause* It's my birth control."" It's not Plan B, but she hates it too. She turns red, looks at the pharmacist who goes ""nope"", and then gets me my prescription. That was her last week. ",Pharmacy Stories,139

I work in a small restaurant in the local mall and most days we open up at 10am (all stores/restaurants/etc follow the same time schedule) and since I'm just a cashier/waitress I show up about 9:45 am, change and get to work preparing the serving area and placing out the buffet items that can sit for a while without getting spoiled (pasta, salad, sauces, etc - in coolers/heaters/water-baths of course). The rest of the buffet is prepped and served at 11am (pizza, enchiladas, etc), sometimes a bit earlier. 

On this particular day I had just opened up the front doors and was placing out the display stands with todays lunch and special offers when a guy showed up and walked past me into the restaurant. I said Hi, which was ignored, he just continued. Ah well, everything was done at the entrance, so I went back to the cash register (its just to the right of the buffet) and waited for him to come over since he was busy with looking over the menu on the wall and the food serving area. He comes over almost immediately and he does not look happy.

""Where's the fucking buffet?!""

(What?) ""Well sir, the buffet opens at 11am, it says so on the sign hanging right above it, so its about 45 minutes left before it opens.""

""But I want the buffet right now! Why isn't it prepared yet? There's lot of people in the kitchen, cant they work faster?""

""As I explained, it opens in 45 minutes, if we put the pizzas out there now they might sit for over an hour before anyone shows up for lunch, and thats not particularly appetizing, is it? And some of the other food is not done yet. We want to serve them as fresh as possible at all times. But our whole menu is available and so is the rest of the lunch menu."" 

""But I want the buffet! It opens at 11am?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Well, I'll come back then but I want a discount!""

""What?""

""I want a discount on the buffet because you were unable to serve it to me when I wanted it.""

(Seriously?) ""I'm afraid I can not give you a discount on the buffet, sir, its already a price reduced offer and I can not make any form of discount on them, the cash register even denies it.""

""But I want a compensation for not getting my food! It is very rude to refuse a customer service! Is your boss here?""

""Sir, I am not refusing to serve you food, I am simply explaining that the food is not yet ready and that you are very welcome to come back in 30 or so minutes when its all done.""

So I work at a retail pharmacy/convenience store. I don't work within the pharmacy, but I work at the front end of the store, where I am one of the managers. Although it's not entirely significant to this story, I'll let you know that the front end is open 8am-10pm 7 days a week, while the pharmacy is open 9am-9pm weekdays, and 9am-6pm weekends. On with the show.

So the night before last I had two very drugged out 20 somethings come into my store. They were both wearing jogging pants and jogging jackets with zippers. His was grey, dirty, and far too baggy for him causing the pants to droop. Hers was black and probably the right size, but her jacket was zipped open to reveal a t-shirt that was many sized too small leaving 4 inches of flabby midriff exposed. Both of them were as pale as ghosts and have the telltale facial marks of meth addiction.

They come straight up to the counter and ask if the pharmacy is open. I assure them, that as it is 8 pm on a sunday it is not open at this time. The male asks if there is another pharmacy nearby that would be open. I tell him that I don't know off hand but that I can check our system to see. I go into the office, and see that there is a 24 hour store just a few miles away form us.

I return to the male who is at the front counter and ask him if he is walking or driving. He looks at me, puzzled for a second, as if to say, ""Where am I  going?"" His drugged out train of though reminds him that he asked about the pharmacy, and he replies ""driving."" I tell him that there is a 24 hour store less than 3 miles from here. I offer him the address, and he loses concentration for a moment. He then asks me if I know any of our nearby competitor/s pharmacy hours.  I do not.

His initial reason for needing a 24 hour pharmacy was that we are the only ones that take his insurance. Now he is rambling that he will check the competitors to see if they take his insurance. At this point he runs off into an aisle to meet his woman. 

I tell my cashier to find them, and watch them like hawks, while I man the register. He nods in agreement and makes his way over to them.

The man and woman have a very loud expletive filled conversation with one another about what they should get. The man comes to the front to get cigarettes. I'm worried that the drug use has artificially aged him, so I ask for his ID. He doesn't have it. He yells down the aisle for the woman to bring her ID to the front. She yells that she doesn't have hers with her. He asks me if a passport will be okay, and I oblige him.

He tells me, and this is important, that his passport is in the truck. So I set the cigarettes to the side and help other customer while he runs out to get it. 

He comes back, the passport shows him born in 1991, which makes him old enough. I ring up the cigarettes again and tell him the total. He tells me that the woman has the money, and runs off to bring her to the front. She loudly exclaims that she obviously wants to buy everything once, and that the cigarette purchase will have to wait.

I call my cashier back to the front, as I have to leave the front to help a real customer.

Fast forward a bit, and they are at the front with Milk, ice cream, and cookies, much less than the woman seemed to be carrying around. They ask if we can check the balance of their food stamps card, my cashier tells them we cannot, and so they stand at the front counter and call the phone number on the back of the card to check their balance.

I manage to ring out most of the line of customers forming behind them. The whole time the guy is loudly complaining about how they cut stamps benefits for everyone, using lots of colorful language. He keeps telling my cashier that they were only supposed to cut it $20-$30 but him and a buddy of his went down $120. Oddly enough none of our other multitude of food-stamp customers have mentioned this.

Finally they find out that there is around $5 dollars on the card, they swipe it to pay, but obviously it's not enough to cover the food in the transaction, so it is declined. I tell them any my cashier that if they don't have enough to cover the full amount on the card, that he must enter the exact amount they wish to use, and then the rest can be paid separately. At this point they decide not to buy the food, and to instead just buy the cigarettes with cash.

All is well, except that the woman's fairly large canvas bag purse seems much fuller than when she walked in. The walk through the doors and the shoplifting alarm goes off, myself and my stocker immediately head over to stop them.

The man immediately exclaims that the alarm went off because of him. It didn't, it obviously went off when the woman's purse went through. I tell the woman I need to see in her purse, as it is what set off the alarm. She holds it up and sticks her face in it. She exclaims nothing is in it except for her stuff.

I grab the purse to look inside of it, and she grabs it back and screams at me. She exclaims that it is her personal purse and you go lookin' in peoples personal bags.

Her and the boy friend bolt out the door. Myself and my stocker follow them out. I tell them that I am calling the police and begin placing the call on my phone. At this point I could grab her bag from her, but I don't I have health insurance and I'm not getting into a fight with two druggies.

This is the fun part, the girl is screaming to the guy to get into the truck. It's a black ford explorer, that my stocker is writing down the license plate of.

The man starts saying ""We didn't bring the truck. This isn't my truck. We don't have a truck.""

The woman after a minute or so decides she has had enough, and begins walking away in tears. 

The man shrugs and gets in the truck finally and pulls out of the parking lot.

The woman runs around the other side of the car and jumps in, and they speed off into the night.

millondefloss,16,38,1qvyd5,210,"Not too sure if this post is entirely appropriate to this subreddit but the memory of it still makes me chuckle, and is the occasion when I grew a pair and stopped giving customers everything they wanted.

So I was working in a customer service call centre for a multinational grocery chain when I received a pretty typical complaint call from a pretty typical entitled asshat of a customer. It was something to do with product quality. I asked if he had the packaging. He didn't.  I asked for specifics regarding the poor quality, and the best he could come up with was that the sauce ""tasted funny"". Oooookay. Now, I should have let him go with nothing but I had only been in the role for a month and so I offered him 500 points on his reward card for the inconvenience.

""500 points?! That's what, £5? Not even worth it.""

Having had this more than reasonable offer thrown back in my face, I realised that I was done being nice.

""Ok then, sir. I'll still forward your complaint to the company. Thanks for bringing the issue to our attention.""

""When will I see the points on my account?""

In a saccharine tone of voice - ""Oh, no, you said that the points weren't worth it, so I've voided the credit. If you want to take the matter further, you can write to the address on the back of the receipt. Have a lovely afternoon!"" 

And with that, I hung up. Moral of the story - if you're complaining for the sake of complaining, take what's offered.

chesterfeildsofa,29,19,1qvy3h,102,"I worked 3rd shift at a grocery store for around 6 months, and I would start at 10pm, get my lunch at 2am, and get off at 6am. For my 2am lunch, the assistant manager(AM) would have to come up and run the register the 30 minutes i was gone, as well as close out the register for that day. It was probably worded different, but at 2am the computers would freeze and not let you scan anything until you did the end of day stuff. 

I can only remember one extreme coupon incident. I think maybe twice a year the store would have triple coupon days, where any coupon under $.99 would automatically be tripled. 

This lady came in around 1am and got to my register around 1:45am. She had a TON of coupons and a lot of duplicate items. I finished scanning all of her items and had started scanning the coupons around 2:15am. So of course the computer would freeze right then. The AM tried to fix it, but it said nothing could continue without doing the end of day, which would also void the entire transaction. A line had started to form behind the lady, so the AM said he would rescan all of her items on a different register while I took the other people behind her.....only my computer wouldn't work until he did the end of day stuff. So I am standing there, looking like an idiot, while he tries to get this lady out of the store. Then HIS computer freezes. I don't know what happened after that because he told me to go to lunch, and he would take all the other customers on his register. This whole situation was confusing as fuck because he was so frustrated and wouldn't explain anything he was doing to me.

I came back 30min later and he tells me he got her taken care of, and she got $300 dollars worth of stuff free, and he even had to give her money from the register when he was done. I thought that was probably a huge mistake, but whatever, it's on him not me.

The next night I come in and the General Manager asked me what had happened, so I told him the story of the previous night. Turns out the triple coupon deal was only to be applied to the first 3 coupons for a certain item, then just the regular coupon after that. No one had told us this before they left the previous day, so we didn't get in trouble for it.

One good thing though that made all of it worth it is what the lady told me while I was ringing her up. She said she worked for a church, and everything she was buying was going to that church's food pantry.",Coupon Nightmare,121

I'm used to doing that, but on a much smaller scale of adding $2.50 to a sale.

I used to work at a Greek and Lebanese restaurant as a busboy. I liked the job; good boss, easy job, chill coworkers. I was also the only white guy working there with an all Palestinian family. But one day my boss rushes in and demands that I start ""working the floor"" cuz of a ton of customers at once. My first table was a very VERY stereotypical traveling the country super tourist types. The conversation went a little like this. ""Hi, I'm your waiter for the evening, can I start you off with anything to drink?"" 
""Are you the oldest son?"" 
""No, sir, I'm just a white guy working here.""

""Our daughter can belly dance. Wanna see her belly dance?!?!"" 
The daughter was about 240 lbs from what I could tell and starts to stand up and lift her shirt up showing me a million stretch marks and tries to dance. Well after just staring at it this... spectacle for about 3 minutes, I promptly made my exit without getting their drink orders in. 
Apparently, they really liked me and demanded that I wait their table, and my boss made me go back out there. However, after they had finished their meals, they left me about $60 for their meals that cost about $35 in total.

So, I work at a very large store in the general merchandise section. I wasn't in a very good mood today, so this particular customer picked the wrong day to try to start crap with me. 

This story starts out with Snotty Man (SM for short) asking about [this thing] (http://img3.targetimg3.com/wcsstore/TargetSAS//img/p/14/03/14038840_120706163000.jpg) that was sitting on a clearance endcap.

Me: Yeah, all the Beywheelz stuff is over here.

SM: So these will work on the ramp?

Me: I'm pretty sure, yeah.

SM: You're *pretty sure* or you're positive?

Me: I'm pretty sure.

SM: (snidely) You really don't know anything do you?

Me: (laughs) Do I know every specific detail about a children's toy? No.

SM: Well, do you know someone who would actually know?

Me: No, you'll just have to do your own research. I'd suggest Google.

HeloRising,41,75,1qvprn,394,"This was another incident that happened at a pottery store where you color things that will soon belong to you. The last one took off so I figured I'd throw another one up.

***

I was working one very slow afternoon and three teenage guys come walking towards the door. This wasn't strictly unusual, sometimes guys would come to make something for their girlfriends. These guys were decked out in full hip hop gear, though, and all whiter than bleached snow. A little odd but this was in an *incredibly* white area of the city I used to live in and in a major upscale mall, it wasn't unusual to spot five or ten Vanilla Ice clones on a given day.

So 3Ice come walking through the door and start looking at the shelves full of unfired pottery pieces (a lot of what we sold was figurines as well as plates and dishes). I greeted them but they didn't take much notice so I went back to what I was doing until one of them comes up to me a few minutes later.

""Yo...Yo man...you got like any frogs?"" 

""Frogs? Yeah we've got a couple of different ones, they should be up on that shelf"" 

""Naw dawg, I saw those ones. But I'm lookin' for somethin' special. Somethin' *gangsta*.""

I stared at him for a full thirty seconds trying to process what the actual fuck a ""gangsta"" frog looked like. I turned and looked at my unreasonably hot coworker, thinking this was some kind of joke to play on the new(ish) guy. She had this look of complete bewilderment on her face and I knew she was a crappy actor so this had to be for *reals*, yo.

I told him to hold on and I'd check in the back. I went back where another employee was finishing up glazing.

""Hey...I don't know our whole stock yet. Do we have anything back here that we don't have out there?"" 

""A couple of things, why what'd they ask for?""

-long pause- ""A gangsta' frog.""

""....the fuck is a ""gangsta' frog?""

""I have no idea. Do we have anything that meets that criteria?""

""We've got one with a big chain, give him that.""

We did in fact have a frog with a big gold medal around its neck and I brought it out to him.

""Yeeeaaahhhh booooiiiiiii! That's what I'm *talkin'* 'bout! 'Dat's the *shit* right there!""

So he sat down with a pallet full of suitably thuglicious paints and started pimping his pottery. His cohorts also selected figurines, Thug One went with a springing lion and Thug Two defied all expectations and selected a small rose. From listening to their back-and-forth, these were suitably gangsta' choices for various reasons.

As they were painting, my unreasonably hot coworker came up to me and in a quiet voice asked me if she was in fact tripping balls or were there three teenagers treating the experience of painting figurines as an experience worthy of song (they had, in fact, begun busting mad rhymes about the various colors of paint they were working with).

They took about an hour to finish their pieces. I wouldn't have given them any awards for quality but they took their work seriously. We could tell they were proud of their work because they went on *at length*, though I'm not positive how a springing lion can look ""straight outta Compton.""

Once they finished, they paid with credit cards (not as gangsta as a wad of cash but *way* easier for me to deal with) and left. Last I heard, they were turning the date I gave them to come back and pick up their pieces into a rap. To their credit, they weren't half bad at it.

Metroidzoid,9,24,1qvkqw,76,"I have to get this off my chest.  It is the ultimate example of our assistant manager's complete lack of reasonable authority.

'Donna' has been working at this store for ~8 years.  Huge inflated ego, talks to everyone like they're 5, and stupid (she was a school teacher), basically has piss-poor customer service skills and a non-existent work ethic.  She finally gave her two weeks a few days ago because apparently me and other people there made it too difficult for her to work there**.

Today she's sitting at a table next to the register, not on break, and she answers her cell.  There's line forming; 2, 3, now it's 6 deep.  She's still on the phone.  And the piece de resistance was hearing her say, loudly, ""Oh, they don't care that I'm on the phone.  What are they going to do, fire me?""

It took all my energy not to ask my customer 'excuse me', walk over, grab that phone and chuck it into the street.

** She works in nursery, and so did I before transferring.  She orders things based on whether or not she likes them, I order things based on customer demands and what's priced right, among other things.  She spends 5 hours ordering what takes me 30 minutes, and she'll spend that same time completely changing what I've ordered when I was asked too.

Personsen,445,652,1qvk5o,1615,"[](/lyranotsure)I'm not a huge fan of coupons in general. There is usually some problem with them like they are either expired, they don't scan, or some issue in the fine print that will either make the customer go into a yelling fit or make the line pile up (which is a pet peeve of mine). If you want to use one or two coupons, I am fine with that. I completely understand wanting to save some money.

But there is a trend that pisses me off to no end.  

""Couponers"".  

A lady came in a while back, with a large amount of deodorant in her basket. After I finished ringing her up, she said,  
""Oh and I have a few coupons...""  

She then pulled a massive wad of coupons out of her purse.  None of them having scannable bar codes, meaning that they would all have to be keyed in manually. I called up a second cashier and began to read the fine print as I am supposed to.  

She notices I am reading them and says ""Yeah. Those should pay for the entire transaction.""  

""I'm sorry, it says limit one coupon per customer and that they aren't to be used with any other coupons."" I reply.  

""No. I did the math. I have enough here to cover the entire transaction. In fact, you guys should technically be giving *me* cash back."" she says with a chuckle.  

At this point the line was piling up again on my register, so I called up a third cashier and the manager.  

The manager comes up and asks how he can help.  

She says ""Yeah this guy won't let me use my coupons.""  

I point out to him that it clearly states that the coupons can't be used like this.  The manager ignores me and lets her have the fifteen or so deodorants for free.

Before she left you could just feel the smugness radiating off of her. She says ""You should be expecting more of us.  We couponers are starting to get pretty big around here. Next time just scan the damn coupons"" She then struts out the door with a smile.  

The manager was fired soon after.  ","Fuck. ""Couponers"".",2267

So, tonight I had a really annoying family who came in. First, they ordered. Fairly ordinary, right? The last person (The mom) ordered, and I assumed it was for her. Apparently it was for someone in the car or something. So, I said, ""Is that going to be all?"" the dad said ""Sure"" and paid up. As they were getting to the seat, I heard them grumbling about how the mom wasn't eating. I figured, not my business, shouldn't care. 

About **15** minutes after they got their food, the dad came up and glared at me (He was a big guy; could have been a lumberjack). It was clear that he was trying his best to contain himself and not go full out yelling at me. He told me I never gave his wife a chance to order and it was all my fault. I just said sorry, what can I get for her, etc. He just ordered a cheeseburger, paid, and sat back down. 

Because it was slow, we had it 5 seconds after he sat down (all the way across the room). I called his name, and he was genuinely pissed about having to get back up to retrieve it. I would have brought it over, but he practically ran to get it.

Again, after 15 minutes, he came up and slammed on the counter, yelling ""BOSS!"". My manager, who was 5 feet away, turned around. I had other customers so I couldn't hear all the conversation, but basically the burger was supposed to have no onion and he wanted a refund for the burger along with saying that I should have given it for free anyway since I had made a mistake. With people like this, pretty much all the managers turn a blind eye, since it's clearly not me. I gotta say, I have some pretty good managers.

FredFltStn,137,230,1qv8tj,791,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  I love fireworks. I got into the business because I love fireworks. I spend my vacation from my real job selling fireworks in a parking lot because I love fireworks (that, and it pays really well). I spend months researching fireworks, attending firework demos, and watching videos of new fireworks. Please don’t walk into my business and try to talk shit to me.

One of my employees grabbed me and asked me for some help. He had been showing a guy around the tent, and the guy was asking some questions that he couldn’t answer. He was apparently also kind of being a dick about it.

I walked up the to the guy and introduced myself.

**ME:** Andy told me you had some questions. Is there anything I can help you with?

**GUY:** Yeah, I was looking for some good stuff, but you guys don’t carry anything good.

Note to potential shoppers, if you’re looking to piss me off, this would be the way to do it.

**ME:** If you’re talking about legal fireworks, I carry some of the best stuff imported into the US. Is there something specific that you’re looking for?

**GUY:** I usually shop at &lt;other company&gt;, I just thought I’d stop by to see what you had, but their stuff is definitely better. I wanted to pick up some mortars, but I guess I’ll have to make the trip to the coast.

**ME:** Really? What mortar pack are you planning on getting?

**GUY:** I always get &lt;mediocre pack&gt; mortars. They’re definitely the best you can buy in the US. I'm not surprised that you don't have them, since you're just a tent.

**ME:** Wow, you have shitty taste in mortars, and those definitely AREN’T the best in the US. Hell, they’re not good enough for me to carry in my store.

**GUY:** You have no idea what you’re talking about.

**ME:** Really. &lt;mediocre pack&gt; mortars are imported by the Beihai Kylin Fireworks Co, located in the Guangxi province of China. Of course the fireworks are actually made in one of hundreds of factories located in Liuyang, a province of Hunan. It’s a 1 ¾ inch diameter 48 gram canister shell. Sadly, it only gets about 125 ft of lift out of the tube, because they skimped on the lift charge. 

**GUY:** But…

**ME:** The shells are also hand packed, rather than machine packed, which probably explains why the breaks aren’t symmetrical. That means it was made at an older factory. That’s probably why they sell them so cheap and will put any label you want on them. Then again, it’s only a 48 gram shell…and not even the best 48 gram shell that Beihai Kylin imports. 

**ME:** If that’s really the type of stuff you’re looking for, I probably won’t have anything you’d like. Thanks for stopping by.

I turned around and walked away from the guy.

He actually did end up shopping for a while, and picked up a lot of stuff from me. Sadly, he didn’t have any other questions for me.

WishfulOne,29,30,1qv8pl,164,"I used to work with an older lady (she was 70+) whom I'll call Bee.  Bee had been working in retail a long time and was hired by our store when the company she had been working for closed down.  Bee was very set in her ways, insisted things should be done the way they were at her old store and could try the patience of the calmest saint but was also very kind and hard working.  

Bee really wanted the position of department head, the position she held in her previous store, and tried to get it several times.  She was continually turned down because she had never learned how to use the telxon (a device like a hand held computer that stores can use to order, do price changes, check what's on-hand etc.) and didn't think she should have to.  One day one of the managers caves and tells her she can have the position temporarily while one of the heads is on medical leave.  I'm given the task of teaching her to use the telxon.

Teaching her the telxon is an exercise in futility. She's just not getting it.  Part of me understands because this technology is all new to her and pat of me is screaming in frustration because I've explained it a dozen times already, wrote out step by step instructions and she still doesn't get it.

Cue the morning of this story.  I'm explaining something to another dept. head when Bee approaches us.

Bee: ""My telxon isn't working.  I don't know what's wrong with it."" She gives it a shake.

Me: ""Let me take a look at it."" She hands it over and I try to turn it on (yes, I honestly thought she didn't try to turn it on). It won't so I hand it back. ""I don't think it's frozen. You probably need a new battery.""

OneWayOfLife,6,19,1quuqs,46,"Alright.

After my first year of retail, I think I'm finally starting to see how customers can really be. And not in the good way.

Today was particularly and unusually rife with people that decided to be as disruptive and blameless as possible. It may be because of Christmas, or because some distant stars have aligned or something, but either way, GAAAHH!!

--------

Firstly, an elderly gentleman comes up to the till next to me and puts all his stuff on the counter of this closed register. Between this till and my own (or more accurately, between me and where he was standing) is a small tower that houses lottery scratch cards. This meant that out of the corner of your eye, you can't tell if it's a person or this tower next to you. So this bloke dumps his stuff down- the paper he wanted to buy and his bag- and proceeds to stand there for several minutes while I'm stood doing nothing (not serving I mean, I was working Vikki! I swear!). Occasionally, people will use un-manned tills as desks to write out lottery tickets/birthday cards etc, so I feel it was perfectly reasonable to assume this is what he was doing. At this time, a queue starts to build. I have to serve relatively quickly to get through all the customers, so I forget this guy is even there. After about the 4th person from the queue, he says in a rather loud, angry tone:

##Cust: I'm sorry, am I completely invisible to you?!

Note that he is stood at an empty register, with an obvious queue for my till. I reply:

##Me: I'm sorry Sir, but there is a queue…

I decide that to not make a scene, I will serve him next. He comes over, and requests the free CD that comes in his newspaper. Now on the front cover, it says in blue letters at least ½ an inch high, that the CDs are available in [Major Supermarket] and [Other Newsagents] but not our store. I call my supervisor, Vikki, over (I hope you don't mind me using your name if you're reading this… :P) and the conversation between her (now V) and the customer ( C ) goes like so:

##V: I'm sorry, but we aren't doing the discs this time.

##C: Yes you are.

##V: We aren't I'm afraid. We haven't down them for a while actually.

##C: Yes you have. It says here. That's false advertising.

##V:We don't do it, sorry.

##C:Errr, yes you do.

##V: only [Supermarket] and [Newsagents] do it, sorry.

##C: Well how am I supposed to get there?!

-- [Supermarket is about a 3 minute walk away…]--

He then pays, and walks away grumpily with no more words uttered.

The second customer that decided that she deserved me to instantly and faultlessly understand what it was she wanted came up to me while in mid conversation on the phone. It should be noted that she had quite a thick (possibly Jamaican) accent. She shall be known as Phone LAdy (PL). She grunts:

##PL: Lyca Mobile!

while thrusting a £10 note at me. Note for non English reditors- Lyca mobile is a telephone provider. We have both the SIM cards and top-ups for this brand, so to make sure I'm doing what she wanted, I clarify with her:

##Me: Is that a top-up for Lyca Mobile?

She half nods, so I process a £10 top-up for Lyca Mobile for her. She leaves and returns about 10 minutes later (yes, it took her that long to notice…):

##PL: Where is my change?

##Me: I'm sorry, what change?

##PL: I gave you £10!!

##Me: That is a £10 top-up…


##PL: I asked quite clearly for a £5 top-up!! I want a refund!!

[We can't refund this]

##Me: I'm sorry, but I can't refund now. You'll have to ring customer services and see what they can do.

##PL: So I have to use my credit to call ip for your mistake when it's all your fault? I want to use your phone!

I went on to accept responsibility and apologised for mishearing her (I didn't, she didn't even specify a top-up, FFS), bust as a friend of mine pointed out, she shouldn't be worried about using her credit to phone CustServices, as she already has £5 more than she expected anyway…

Stuck_In_Purgatory,7,22,1quu03,110,"I work in a fish and chip shop in Australia. It's a great job and I love it. Last night, I had a couple interesting encounters and thought I'd share them with you!

There's a group of young boys ranging from about 10 to 13 that hang around the shop sometimes. Yesterday, 2 of them came in and sat on the chairs and waited. My boss (who is Greek and doesn't have the best English) asked what they were waiting for. The older one says ""oh we ordered $5 chips and 2 potato cakes.""
I laughed and told them ""we don't have any orders for that.""
Their response? ""well that didn't work.""  So they got up and left. I was both annoyed and amused. Amused that they thought we were that stupid, and annoyed that they were so rude to try scam food off us. 

A little while later there was a few more of them. 5 total. The youngest one walks into the shop, looks at our lollies, and walks out. Bit of info: we have a container of lollies in front of the register for paying customers to eat. Now these kids had no intention of buying anything, so when the kid walked out my boss's son said quick grab the lollies! So I took them to the back right as they walked back in. 
Kids: ""aww where's the lollies?""
Me: ""I took them to fill them up.""
The kids seemed happy about that, thinking they'd have even more lollies to take, until I said:
""except you don't get any, because you haven't bought anything."" and I walked off. All the other workers kinda laughed that I'd be so mean but they definitely deserved it. 
Boss's son talked to them for a tiny bit but they realized they couldn't scam free shit off us, so they left. 

I can't believe that kids these days are so rude and disrespectful. Which is why I don't take their shit.

A little later, a guy and his girlfriend ordered food. Once it was ready they decided to buy drinks and a sauce. The total came to $5.10

Remember how I said I'm in Australia? Our smallest coin is 5c. And no one tips except to say oh keep the 10c (or whatever) change. 

The guy pulls out two $5 dollar notes. I hand him one back and tell him not to worry about the ten cents. He hands it back to me and says, ""keep the change.""
I asked him if he was sure he wanted to give me $4.90 change to keep and he said yes. So I thanked him and told him to have a good night.
I went abd told my boss and she said ""that's the biggest tip we've ever had!"" I told her, ""well it makes up for all those 10c we tell people not to worry about.""

I guess it really does come back around :)",Good customers and bad customers.,132
JizzBeef,179,160,1qutuf,717,"Today at my gas station job a woman came in to get some cigarettes. Now we have a policy (and also it's kind of the law here) that if we think you look under 40, we need to see your ID. I know it may seem a little odd, but w/e, I do it cuz in the slim chance I sold alcohol or tobacco to a minor I'd be fired, fined, revoked of my liquor license,  and I think I'd see time in jail as well. So anyway, this lady looks like she's maybe 20 or 30, but I've seen people that look older but their ID shows a different story, so I ask her for her ID anyway. Our exchange goes like this:

Me: may I please see your ID?

Lady: I don't have it, but I'm over 18

Me: I can't sell you cigarettes without seeing your ID, it's against company policy

Lady: I know that! But I don't give a shit. My year of birth is 1986!

Me: lemme see that on your ID.

Lady: look, I told you I don't have it! This is bullshit... can't you just get somebody that works here everyday to confirm my age? I'm a regular here, I come in here like 3 times everyday for the past six months!

I turn to my manager, then I remember two things:

1. My manager is new, and he only works on the weekends

2. I work everyday, and this lady is just a fucking idiot.

So then I tell her, ""mam, I've worked here just about everyday for over a year now and I've never once seen you. I can't sell you cigarettes unless you show me your ID to confirm your age, I'm sorry, but it's also the law. I'm not willing to lose my job over you.""

The lady looks at me all pissy, and obviously embarassed as she has caused a line and everyone was dead silent listening to our conversation,  so she turns around sharply and yells ""fine! This is fucking bullshit but I'll be back with it!""

45 minutes later she was back, with her ID. Sheepishly defeated, she didn't say anything during the transaction. If she truly is a regular I plan on asking for her ID everytime I see her from now on. I'll just pretend like I don't remember her.",1986,877
vegasyndrome,23,37,1qulv3,90,"I work at a baby store. Recently we had a sales associate ring through a hefty order last week. She made a couple of mistakes while ringing through this customer (the expecting grandparents). She accidentally discounted too many items on this invoice. One of my managers noticed this and pointed out that we didn't break even (around 5%). 

The expecting mother calls us a couple of days later and pointed out we didn't discount a couple of items on her receipt. We explained why we didn't (long winded but valid) and I was told she said ""I guess you don't want our business then."" 

I don't get that. Most of our products don't have a margin greater than 40% especially the bigger ticketed items. We gave this customer's parents around 45% off their whole order. We lost money. Why do we exist as a business if we are expected to give them more? Why bother running a business at all if we don't make money?

Kaeobais,30,51,1qu5pg,164,"I used to work at a fast food place in a mall. It was a pretty terrible job, over all, although the staff was mostly nice and I got whatever hours I wanted, almost. The issue is that the company is cheap (I got a 10 cent raise at one point, though!), the uniform sucked, and the people... well, I'll just tell you about them. I can't remember everything though, so expect some paraphrasing and lacking descriptions here and there.

It's also very late, so I'll just do a couple, and might post more tomorrow (if I can remember more good ones).

* **I find your lack of dip disturbing.**

The place had yam fries, which were served with a small plastic container of chipotle dip. One day, a guy who worked in the mall ordered said fries and dip. He was nice enough, and left to go eat his food at work. 

However, a little while later he returned. He placed the plastic container on the counter and said, ""What do you see?""  
""Uh, sorry?"" I replied.  
""What is this?""  
""Uh...?""  
""Where's the dip? Why the hell is there so little? Like, are you f@#$ing serious? There's barely enough for one fry. This is bulls%$t.""  
""Dude, the dip is free. If you want more you can have more.""  
""Well yeah I'd like some more!""  
So I grab him his dip, hand it to him, he scoffs, and says under his breath, ""F$%#ing ridiculous"" as he walks away.

* **Friday Guy**

Every Friday, around 10 to 5 minutes before close, a man in what I would guess is his early 40s would arrive, ordering the same thing every time: A cheeseburger and large fries, a large coke (which must be bagged), 4 packs of ketchup, 6 packets of salt, and 6 packets of vinegar. He always paid with a 20 and always required that his change be entirely in loonies ($1 for those outside of Canada). He would always exchange some of his spare change fore a quarter, and would always throw out his plastic bag in exchange for a new one. The most annoying part was he was very talkative. He followed every sentence with ""Okay?"" and expected you to reply, or else he would just keep asking. 

Upon leaving, he had to tell us that he would be back next Friday at the same time, and the Friday after that as well, as well as saying thank you and goodbye several times, and if you didn't respond he would continue saying it until you did. Apparently he would also come in the following Saturday to tell us he'd be there the following Friday, though I never witnessed it. He had been doing this for 5 years before I started, and never missed a day, except once, at which point he got angry and began banging on the counter because we were closed.

It's obvious he has severe OCD, so I can't really be mad at him or anything, but it was REALLY annoying, especially after a busy day.

* **Dumb Question Lightning Round!**  
    * ""Do you have any deals on?"" they ask, ignoring the banner 5 inches above him, the two posters on either wall, and the menu behind me all stating a 2 for 5 deal going on.  
    * ""Could I get a new burger? I asked for no cheese, but it has cheese on it."" they ask, handing me what's left of the burger they clearly had no problem eating.  
    * ""I'll have the double bacon burger. Is there any pork in that?""  
    * ""Can I get a McChicken burger?"" Pro tip: We weren't a McDonald's.  
    * ""I'll get a spicy chicken burger. Is that spicy?""  
    * ""I didn't bring my coupons, do you have any here that I could use?""  
    * Here in Canada we've phased out the penny. No stores will give you pennies in your change, and few will take them. We round either up or down to the nearest 5 or 0. So a woman bought some stuff, and I rounded down her change from $3.16 to $3.15. ""How come you get the extra change?"" she asks angrily.",Fast Food Fun,215

Welcoming the break to my endless hell, I did not expect a text from my boss as this was my day-off. Dreading an emergency ""get yo' ass here this minute"" text, I tapped on it. 

""Check your FB. I sent you a link.Someone's pretending to be [The mother's name from Birthday Girl]"". the text read.

I closed the game and went to my Facebook, thinking somebody is reaping in the real life Karma for something that they shouldn't deserve. I was right and much more. It pissed me off. 

Mrs. B has a daughter that games and just had a birthday, but she isn't the Birthday Girl. I never saw Mrs. B in the shop, ever and I was pissed of by what she is doing. She was claiming that she and her daughter are in the story and ""was happy someone wrote about her.""

GreenEyedDemon,107,178,1qtb0s,559,"I've been lurking here for a while, and decided to post a story from my minimum wage slave job. I'm a cashier at a gas station just off a highway that runs through my state, so I get assholes from all walks of life. From the man who's impatient because I'm not counting his $5.07 in pennies for cigarettes fast enough, to the woman who demands I pump her gas for her because it's a bit windy out. This story happened about a month ago.

It was myself and a new-ish guy alone for the 4-12 shift. This guy was new enough to require some supervision for certain things (money orders, prepaid cards, phone cards, etc.) but there long enough to be capable of being alone for five minutes while I do my chores. Well, I'm outside doing trash and there's a few people in line inside but not enough for me to have to run in. I'm happily picking up peoples refuse from the overfilled bins, when I hear a regular customer yell my name out the door and say ""Green, (new guy) needs you"". I drop my stuff and go in and there's about 3-4 people in line behind a guy wanting a pre-paid card specific to the gas brand we sell (rhymes with hell). These take a minute to do, so I ask him to wait and open my register and get all the other customers out the door. After, I motion him to my register and he asks for a $50 station card.

I grab one and I'm getting ready to activate it, but I tell him I need to see the cash before I activate the card (as is our store policy). He says ""I'm not paying cash, do it as credit"" and puts his credit card on the counter. Oh boy, I know where this is going.

Me: Sorry sir, but I can't use credit or debit cards for purchasing a prepaid card.

Him: Are you kidding me? I've done this hundreds of times at different stations.

Me: Sorry sir, our store policy is cash only for prepaid cards.

Him: This is bullshit! I've been waiting for fifteen fucking minutes (closer to five) and you won't sell it to me?! I'm going somewhere else, you lost my business!

Me: Sorry, have a nice day.

He leaves, and I'm telling my coworker (this was his first experience with a mean customer) to ignore the assholes, the regulars make it worth it. I look down and what else do I see but the douchebags credit card. I look out and see he's just now leaving his pump. Normally, I'd run out and give it to them, but oh no, it appears I need to hang this card back on the rack and by the time I've made sure it's nice and straight, he's left. It's a company card, so I know he'll be back.

Hours later, near the end of my shift he walks back in, looking much more sheepish than earlier.

Him: Hi, uh, I was in here earlier and tried to use my card to pay for a gift card, did I leave it here?

Me: Yes sir, you did. Here you go! (I hand it to him with a nice smile).

Him: Sorry about going off the handle about that, I know it's not in your power to change the policy. I'll be going, thank you for holding it.

Me: No problem, have a great day!

GrimGuy,58,63,1qsw32,270,"The scene is a movie/game rental store in the final days before their downhill slide. This particular store is a fairly busy one, but it's a weekday afternoon and the place is nearly empty. I've been ""borrowed"" from another store for the day and, having just finished my shift, am lingering while I shoot the shit with coworkers.

Enter a child and his mother of non-assuming appearance and demeanor, their appearance and demeanor non-assuming enough that I forgot about them nearly immediately. Minutes pass, I putz around in indecision over which crappy movie to use my daily free rental on, and the mother/child come around to our games. 

Now, we primarily rented movies and games, but we did sell some as well. Invariably, the games we sold were ancient shovelware and sports games half a decade past their day; all of them were without instructions or original cases, all of them were scratched to hell. They were also all ludicrously overpriced, running damn near what a new game might.

For whatever reason, the child decides he has to have some baseball game. He's been quiet so far, but he's found his muse in the form of a brightly colored plastic box with one of our generic store inserts serving as cover art, and ""Baseball 2001"" written half-assedly on it in Sharpie. ""Baseball 2001"" could be one of a couple games, but the kid wasn't concerned with quibbling details. 
His mother, either due to wisdom or disinterest, wasn't having any of it. The first couple polite refusals weren't taken well, and soon the kid is pulling out the arsenal. He tried to bargain, he tried to plead, and the crying didn't come long after. 
Hoping to soothe him, she let him carry it while they continued their rounds. This only led to him using it to smack her on the leg and continue to ramp up his growing tantrum. Her refusals became more firm as time went on and things escalated steadily. 

By the time he threw himself to the floor in full tantrum, the scene had garnered the attention of my coworkers and I. It was nothing alarming, and there was an almost refreshing quality to the mother not breaking down in the face of a crying kid. When his tantrum began, she earned a bit more of our respect by taking the game from him and stating very clearly:
""I'm not buying you this game today. We can talk to your father tonight - but if you keep this up, I'm going to write down the game's name and tell him about it so neither of us EVER buys it for you for your WHOLE LIFE.""
My coworkers and I all had a look I can best describe as that Obama ""Not Bad"" face as we nodded to each other, assuming the matter was closed.

Not so.

The child, face red and tear-streaked, stopped making much noise. This wasn't because he was soothed or stopped, but because he'd turned into a white-hot ball of seething rage, his senses failing as his world collapsed around him.  
He started making noise, eventually, in an unconscious sort of way. It was this half-asthmatic, cat-in-heat, moaning sort of sound that belonged in a Lovecraft novel. It never got very loud, but his actions spoke volumes.

Promptly, he dropped his pants and took a splashing, chunky, yellow shit all over the floor. 


My curiosity about how this would end collided with my minimum-wage survival instinct, and I got the hell out of Dodge in short order. I'm told she cleaned it up, in tears, while the child went back to asking if he could have the game.

Locclo,70,39,1qssv1,140,"**Background**: I work in the bakery department of a big retailer. My duties mainly include packaging bread and stocking the floor, and occasionally taking a cake order (or handing one over to a customer).

So, today I found out about something new that my store is doing, and I'm pretty bummed out about it. Where I work, the scheduling system gives a lot of freedom and control to the employees. Scheduling is automated, and it's based on what you put in for your availability, meaning that if you ask not to come in until 3 PM, the computer won't - and in most circumstances, can't - schedule you until 3 PM. What's more, managers can't change the schedule on a whim, they need your login and password in order to do it (and that's one piece of info they don't have).

What's all this got to do with anything? Well, for the first time since I've started, and probably as a result of Target infamously opening on Thanksgiving last year, the computer is allowed to schedule people completely outside of their availability for one week. Take a wild guess as to which one. 

Thankfully, the manager I spoke to said that he'd be able to tweak my schedule ever so slightly so that I can actually go to class on the Monday before Thanksgiving, since my school only closes on that Thursday, but sadly, for the first time in 22 years, I'm going to miss out on my family's big Thanksgiving dinner, because I have to work from 11 AM to 8 PM on that day, and dinner's right around 4-5. I even have to skip class on Black Friday, because my manager told me flat-out that I could not change my hours for that day. (Edit: to clarify, he did flat-out tell me that I wasn't going to be able to change my hours on Friday, but after reading some of these comments and considering my options, I'm definitely going to at least leave early on Friday to go to class)

I don't think I've ever contemplated calling in sick on a day that I know will be busy, but this news has me pretty tempted to do it on the 28th out of spite.

TL;DR: For one week out of the year, the world stops to stare at my store, and any employee who says otherwise might just be out of a job.

Edit: For the record, the store is open for 24 hours, and the only day they close is Christmas Day; the only change in policy here is that the computer is being allowed to schedule people outside of their availability, and said people are not allowed to change their hours on Thanksgiving/Black Friday.","A New Store Policy, or Why This is My Last Year",179

This happened when I was working at clothing store that buys gently used teenage clothing (sounds like plates in spanish). I was about 30 minutes into my shift and this lady was running around with a friend and i'm assuming her daughter. They were really strange but I shrug that off because I had seen worse.

Well when it came time for them to checkout they had quite a few items. I'm ringing them up, making sure I don't leave any security tags on, then making a pile so I can put them in a bag. She starts getting really impatient with me even though i'm going as fast as a I can and says (we'll call her CL for crazy lady):

CL: ""You don't have to fold them, just shove them in a bag and hurry up.""

ME:""I'm sorry mam, i'm checking for security tags.""

CL:""Well you need to hurry up because I need to change my bandage. I got a foot of my intestines cut out and I shouldn't have been standing this long. Let me show you my bandage.""

KGBsurveillancevan,6,20,1qs00e,94,"Earlier this year, I worked for a franchise that bought and sold used clothes. I only worked there for three months total, but one of the regulars that I started recognizing was a tall, gorgeous redhead in her late 20s or early 30s. She was always really nice to the staff, and just casually flirted with the guys on staff, including myself. One of the most charming people I've met, and by far my favorite customer. Everything about her was just relaxed, energetic and carefree, even though none of my coworkers knew anything about her.

The last time I saw her was during my last week of work, two weeks before I moved to another state. She was in the store with what I presumed to be her boyfriend. She chatted with my manager briefly, just asking him to open a fitting room for her. He did, and then walked over to me. ""Dude. She just said the craziest thing to me. I'll tell you on break.""

She finishes trying everything on, we check her out, and she leaves. When I go on break, my manager comes back to the break room, and I ask him what it was she said that got him so freaked out.

Hello. This is my third post in Tales From Retail. It's more of a moany whinge than my others, but I enjoyed writing it, and hope you enjoy reading it. Here is the [blog](http://anthropologyandbooks.wordpress.com/2013/11/16/stubborn-petty-and-childish/) entry, by the way.
Here you go:



This morning I was cheerfully buttering my toast when I promptly dropped it into the cutlery drawer, butter side down.

This didn’t upset me in the least, and after I’d checked the toast for cutlery drawer grime and cutlery drawer hairs, I thought to myself
‘Haha! I am easy going and calm.
That is very cool.
I am both unfazed, and cool’

I was very pleased with myself. So pleased that I was still thinking about it this afternoon.
But then I thought about how I am at work, and the little things that annoy me. Tiny things give me no amount of rage. I mostly get annoyed at customers, for ridiculous things.

So I have decided to make a list of these things.

By the way, I know they are ridiculous. I know they are insignificant and unworthy of my attention, but after this long in retail, sometimes I can’t help myself. Often I become petty and unreasonable, and I amfully aware  that I am being petty and unreasonable, but I cannot stop myself. The small sense of satisfaction I get from these actions is childish, and stubborn, and utterly worth it.


**1: Not saying hello.**

Why? Why do you do this? I mean, I know we aren’t buddies. I’m not asking for your number. I won’t follow you home and ask for some tea.

We are both human people. I am a human person. I don’t exist just to serve you. I like to be acknowledged as a human person. Just say “Hello” (But don’t go too far. This is Britain. When you ask how I am, I get confused and slightly offended).

If this happens, sometimes I wait for the customer to say hello, but I don’t have the staying power a lot of the time. It gets too awkward too quickly for me. So I will go slowly. I will take my sweet, sweet time.

And then I give you the most change I can without it becoming obvious. I also find the dirtiest pennies I can. I will also not offer to give you a special stampy on your stamp card.

And then I will say “Thank you!” loudly and cheerfully, and perhaps even wave as you leave.

Hee! You lose!


**2: Customers putting money on the counter.**

What’s wrong with my hand? Am I dirty? Am I going too slowly for you? If this is the case, then you are making me take more time, because I now have to pick up your money, count it (if it’s change), and then put it in the till. I will also do this at a slower pace, because hahaha, that makes me the winner.

I will put your change on the counter, too. Because that will definitely teach you a jolly good lesson, and you’ll never do it again.

 **3: Asking for something before I can offer it e.g. “Can I have a bag/receipt/a stamp on my special stampy card?”**

I will offer you these things, because that is my job (unless you are being rude).
The only reaction I have to this is to become cheerily sarcastic e.g “It’s £5 per bag/If you say please!”

Ho ho. I win.

**4: “Can you look up a book for me?”**
No. Really, I have no way of looking up a book for you. This computer I am standing behind does not have the capacity to look up a book.

Also, I can’t type.

Sometimes, if they look like they have a sense of humour, I will say “No” to them and pull a funny face. Let’s all have a laugh, while I teach you a lesson, and then win.

**5: Customers who take the receipt from the printer.**

You win. You idiot. Unless the Gods are smiling down upon me, and you walk away without your change/book/saying thank you.

Then I can call after you, and give you a smug face. You idiot.

**6: Giving me a reason as to why you need a bag.**

I do kind of prompt this, because I always ask “Do you need a bag?” so I think a lot of people feel like they need to justify why they need a bag.

Is it a gift? That’s nice. Is it raining outside? Oh, my! You want to keep the book nice? Well done you!

I don’t care.

Just say yes.

*I don’t care.* 

Also, it isn’t my fault that we don’t have paper bags. I do not spend my time out the back constructing our bags from recycled materials. It is not my decision what kind of bags we offer you. When you tut at me for not having a paper bag, it makes me want to put one of our plastic bags over my head and secure it with a rubber band until you walk away. 
Without a bag.


That’s my list of unreasonable things that annoy me. Of course there are reasonable things that annoy me, but I don’t think I’d enjoy writing about them as much.


I would like to thank a few of my colleagues for reminding me about items to include in this list. The rage it brought me whilst we were discussing it was worth it.

No, really.","Stubborn, Petty and Childish.",59
BadgerSixTwo,9,16,1qrroa,95,"I work in tourism and my job is primarily to sell tickets for various length excursions. I also have certification to operate the equipment so I work out on the trips as well. About a year and a some months back, the trip was shortened due to flood damage and I was working the trip.

At the end of the trip, we all stand by the exit and wish people a good day. There are four workers on this trip consisting of me doing ground work, N doing narration, W the old conductor, and E the engineer.

The trip unloads front to back and the last two groups are a mother-daughter (MD) pair about 80 and 50 years old, respectively, and a family of four. As the MD pair are leaving, they see my orange vest and stop to complain about the family causing too much noise and how it ruined their trip and they wanted a refund. I apologized and said they could talk to the manager (J) inside where they picked up their tickets. They complain for another minute or so and start to move on (slowly though, the mom has a walker).

The family is behind them and aren't even listening to them. They seem normal and during the whole trip they were no louder than every other child on any of our excursions. Also, at no point during the trip did the pair complain. I also say they both complained when it was actually just the daughter.

They get about ten feet and stop at N and complain to him as well. He heard me and gave them the same instructions to see J. Meanwhile the children are getting bored because two old women aren't moving, so they busy themselves with patty cake. The daughter (D) hears this and loses it.

D: SHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP! THE WHOLE TRIP YOU'VE BEEN NOTHING BUT LOUD AND RUDE AND IF YOU WERE MY CHILD I WOULD PUT YOU IN YOUR PLACE!

The parents move in to protect their children. N draws the pair's attention to him and I take the family out the second exit at the back, profusely apologizing for their behavior and assuring them their kids were fine the whole trip and the pair were being unreasonable in their expectations of children.

After this I stand at the main exit and wait for them to leave. They finish with N, mad that someone let the family off before them. Next in line is E.

E is an older man who has that sort of pissed off look at all times. He can be a pretty nice guy though. That being said, he doesn't take anything from anyone and will be up front  about it.

D: We just wanted to comp-

E: I don't want to hear it.

D: But-

E: Leave.

They climb down the steps and turn to me, the only person with an orange vest. She starts complaining again instead of focusing on her elderly mother trying to climb down the steps. I tell her I heard her complain already and I would take her straight to J. She still complains to me anyway and her mom almost falls because of her inattention.

As we walk in she spots W the conductor and goes to complain to him. W is a sweet, friendly guy, but he doesn't know how to handle complaints that well. I tell her he's not J and I will take them to J.

We get inside and they spot N moving snacks from the trip back inside for the day and try to stop him to complain. He din't stop and just said ""I'm busy right now."" D shouted that he was rude but he kept going.

They finally get to J. They complain to him and I tell him my side out of the pair's earshot. He denies them a refund because 1. no refunds anyway and 2. they didn't have a valid reason. D flipped out again how we were all unprofessional and we cheated her out of her money and we were going to go under if we didn't change our ways and how dare we refuse them a refund, didn't we know who they were, etc.

JizzBeef,9,10,1qrqn5,50,"I work at a very popular gas station/convenience store in the midwest that everybody loves, including the people that work there. (Out of paranoia, I ask for everyone to please respect the Anonymizing Rules) 
So the location I work at can only be described as the worst location in the most entitled part of the state that's in the smack-dab-middle of the United States. And when I say that it's the worst, I don't mean that it's the most entitled location, I mean the complete opposite of that, ie, I see prostitutes and drug deals as well as having to deal with drug addicts and homeless people on a regular basis. Due to this, I have absolutely no tolerance for rude people or for shoplifters or the sort, and oftentimes I come off to many customers as being mean just because I can never let my guard down.

So anyway! I was working an evening shift earlier this week. As I was walking to the back of the store towards our ""supply room,"" an older man wearing a yellow sweater was kind of walking towards me, as well as my new coworker. Due to his yellow sweater, we'll now call him YS. He was kind of approaching us slowly, and my coworker, I'll call her S, was a few steps ahead of me. YS tries to stop her, but I butt-in, automatically knowing that this man would be some sort of trouble. She stops as I stop to deal with him, but I shoot her a look of I'll-deal-with-it, so she keeps on doing what she was doing and walks off. 
When YS gets close enough to me, my encounter with him goes something like this:

YS: Hi, um............. can I uhhhh ask you a.............. question?

Me: (obviously aggravated but trying to hide it) Yes, what can I do for you?

YS: Well, come over here with me..... I'd like to show you something........

I don't normally follow male customers when they try to lead me somewhere, just because the only thing that us gas station employees fear more than a robbery is a kidnapping. Luckily though, this was not the case. Instead, YS leads me over to our roller-grills and shows me the tongs ""attached"" to them. I say ""attached"" like that because they are not actually attached, as you can take them off of this little metal loop to use them and people drop them all the time. Another thing about our tongs is that we clean them very vigorously every time they happen to fall, and we also have another clean set in a cabinet at all times to replace the old ones with every three hours. This is all relevant, don't worry.

YS: Why aren't these chained to the grill? 

Me: I don't know, would you like to discuss this question with a manager though? 

YS: Yes, if you would please. But.... uhm.... what's her name? (He says this as he looks up at our register, noticing that my other coworker is on the main register, so he assumes that it's her)

Me: HIS name is Justin, and I can get him for you really quick.

YS: Justin, huh? How long has she been working here?

Me: Uh, wha- uh well uh HE, JUSTIN, has been here for over 20 years. 

YS: Okay, well, yeah, get him for me, would you? Oh, and, also (he holds up some silverware in his hands- two forks and a spoon) where could I find a spoon?

I ignore that he's already holding a spoon and point out where he can find them, but then he suddenly realizes that he's holding one, and says, ""Oh, nevermind! I already have one!""

Great. So now I have to go into the freezer where my boss is trying to get inventory done as fast as possible before our next shipment comes in in less than three hours and tell him that there's a senile old man that would like to speak to him. About something completely idiotic. Which is exactly what I tell him, to which he replies, ""Oh great, this is exactly how I'd like to spend my night.""

After Justin comes out with me, we find YS guy, and he talks to him, and basically it just goes like this:

YS: Why aren't the tongs chained to the grills? What happens when they fall? I've seen other gas stations where the tongs are chained, why aren't yours?

Justin: Here in [state], it's not a health regulation or requirement that the tongs be chained to the grills, and this actually works out to our advantage as well as it's much more sanitary than having attached tongs as this makes us able to clean them every three hours as well as any time they appear to be unsanitary or if they've fallen onto the floor.

YS: Yes, but, why isn't it a health regulation? I mean, germs exist in [bordering state], why don't they exist here?

What. The. Actual. Fuck.

Justin just repeats himself, then attempts to persuade YS to fill out a customer comment card, to which YS agrees to do, but then just keeps asking the same questions over and over again. To which Justin just responds with the same exact responses. This goes on for twenty. Fucking. Minutes. YS has now become a fire hazard as well since he's standing directly in front of the front doors and refuses to move despite Justin taking a few steps back in an attempt to get him to move. There are probably about 30 customers in the store at this point, and we're getting backed up on the register, and I'm afraid that something might go wrong with one of the newer employees that they may need Justin's help with. So I briskly grab a customer comment card and hand it to Justin just to try to make it clear that this guy is just a hopeless broken record and he needs to leave. 

Eventually YS leaves, and Justin looks so pissfully exhausted. He then tells me ""I thought that was never going to end.""

tl;dr what",The Perpetual Question,60
Captain-TomTom,48,29,1qrots,92,"Have you seen those shirts with the above mentioned title name? ""I love my church."" ?

I see them all the time where I work. Ah, the joys of working in retail. No I'm joking. Anyone with a few amount of brain cells would know there is little to no joy in retail.

Now about this shirt. I work in an art store. We cater to the creative crowds. Usually our customers range from teachers, to soccer moms, to christian educators of the like. They flock to our stores each Friday, Saturday and especially Sunday when the new sale starts up.

These customers are 80% more likely to wear this shirt ""I love my church."" You'd think they'd be our most understanding and nicest customers. The model christian that everyone aspires to be (Or believe they are.) Yeah I thought that too for a while.

You see these people are something different. Outwardly they wear a smile that seems as if they are a friendly and kindhearted individual. However, if you were to look deep into their eyes. I swear to you, they are not human. They are something else. Something evil...

This one customer changed my entire view on this shirt. But its just a shirt Captain TomTom, it can't be that bad. Oh, but it is. Oh, but it is...

I had the pleasure of cashiering a sunday afternoon right after the churches let their sheep out of their sermons. (I call them wolves in sheeps clothing. Thats what they are.) Most of them wear this shirt I keep bring up. So did this customer who I'm finally starting to tell you about.

I knew she was trouble when she walked in. (Our store likes to play this song over and over on the PA system. Even during chistmas time.) In tow she had 3 kids who immediately left her side and went running through the store. I greeted her from the registers and she smiled and was mumbling about something to herself and continued on her way. Not before I glimpsed at her shirt: ""I love my church."" I was naive to the plight of retailers at the time. I did not know what was in store for me.

Roughly about 13 minutes later she comes to the front of the store with a shopping cart full of random items. Yarn, popsicle sticks, glue, construction paper... all kinds of stuff. She still had that smile on her face. The kids were following her and had candy and other crap that crafty kids like within their grubby little hands. I cleared my throat and began. ""Thank you for shopping at -----'s I can check you out here.""

She motions her 3 kids to come along. The 3 kids immediately started to pile up things on the register making it hard to keep things organized. The mother of the three dug into her purse and pulled out several coupons. That was the second omen. Our store has a strict coupon policy. One coupon per customers, per day. We can't bend the rules at all for anyone no matter who they are, what they do, who they are affiliated with. In bold print it clearly states our coupon policy on each and every coupon. It also states it on the registers. On the walls when you first enter the building. In the bathrooms. But these signs seem to get ignored.

She hands the coupons over to me. They were all the same ones. 40% off one regular priced item. ""I'm sorry ma'am. You can only use one coup---""

Before I finished she smiled and said. ""Ok."" I smiled back thinking she understood. She kept mumbling and talking. Then I realized she had a bluetooth earpiece in her ear. Apparently holding a conversation with someone on the other end. That was the third omen. I was clearly a deer in headlights. I proceeded with the transaction, scanning and bagging each item. When I was picking though some of the things piled up on the registers. I touched something wet... and slimy. One of those nasty little kids opened a sucker and licked it and put it in the pile of items on the counter. Immediately I recoiled and investigated what it was I touched.

I gagged a bit as the drool trailed from my fingers to the sucker. I quickly regained my composure and wiped my hands on my apron. (someone stole the napkins from my register along with the hand sanitizer that day.) I looked at her seeing if she was going to apologize as she was staring at me. No, she was carrying on her conversation in that earpiece. The kids looked at me and just laughed. Those little laughs haunt me till this day. It was just innocent child laughter. It was off, it was like they plotted to do that. I could be paranoid but those laughs tell me other wise.

After bagging several items,  I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. She was going to pay and leave with her little monsters. She dug in her purse again and pulled out the coupons. I stared at her baffled for a moment seeing that she understood that she couldn't use those coupons. ""You forgot my coupons."" She smiled again.

""I'm sorry Ma'am but our coupon policy only limits one coupon per cust----."" She cut me off again.

""Yeah I know. Can we just split the transactions or something and I can pay it several times?"" She started to wag the coupons impatiently. 

""No ma'am I can't do that all. It wouldn't be fair to the oth---."" To my absolute horror her eyes narrowed as if I shot her in the heart. Her face went from a fake smile to a completely menacing bitch from the 6th level of hell. 

""I don't see why you even have coupons all the time if you can't use them at all. What kidn of place is this?! I thought this place was for creative people. All you people want to do is take money. How about giving for a change."" She continued on and on. I almost blacked out for a moment. Literally spit was flying out of her mouth and hit my glasses. 

""I--- Well our coupon pol---."" Again she cuts me off on queue. 

""I don't care about the coupon policy. You know what?! I don't want any of this! Come on lets go."" She motioned for her brats to follow suit. I thought it was over as she started to make her way to the exit. No. No it wasn't over. Right when I started to move the cart of bagged items out of the walkway for the next customer. She comes back again. ""This place is the devil! You are just a follower! Coming to work and trying to swindle hard working Christian people like me out of their money. I answer to a higher power!."" It scares me how I remember some of the things she had said word for word. But I do remember clearly that shirt she was wearing and the final thing she said to me. ""I pray for you. Because you need it.""

Needless to say. All the shouting drew attention to the check out lines. Customers and other employees stood and watched  . No one said a word. However Taylor Swift once again blared over the PA system ""Trouble trouble trouble! Oh! OHHH! Trouble Trouble!"" Finally the event was over and she dragged herself out of the store. The other customers looked at me.

""I can... I can help the next customer in line."" I spoke with a shaking voice. I still didn't know what happened. Like I was in a  car accident and wasn't able to cope with the situation that had occurred. The next customer walked up and smiled. 

""I'm so sorry that woman was so irate with you! You poor thing! She wasn't really a christian woman now was she?"" The old lady was friendly and understanding. Until I noticed she was wearing the same shirt. My heart felt like it stopped. ""I have a couple of coupons to use."" she said.

Ladies, gentleman, ambiguous space beings, we deal with the public every day (except for me today because I somehow managed to get a weekend off. I... I had forgotten what a Saturday was) and every day there is at least one person who asks a REALLY dumb question. How we keep our faces straight, I'm not sure.

What are your favorite dumb questions? Here's a few of mine:

Note: I work in a women's business-casual clothing store

- ""Do you have black pants?"" (Said after she passed a giant wall of nothing but black pants)

- ""What's 40% off?"" 
""Everything!""
""So jewelry?""
""Yup! Everything is 40% off!""
""What about this sweater?""
""Yup. Everything. Is. 40% off.""
""What about your denim?""
(this conversation, unbelievably, kept going)

- ""Do you have denim corduroy pants?"" (Uhm...what?)

- ""Do you have a tailor on staff?""

- ""If I try to shrink this and it shrinks too much, can I return it?""

- ""If I wait to return these shorts until next summer, will I get a full price refund for them?""

- ""So...how do I tell what the sizes are?"" (cue me pointing out the size rage, the size label stamped into the clothing, and the size sticker)

 - ""Can I use a coupon on my credit card bill?""

-  ""How do I know what's on sale?""
""Anything on promotion will have a sign with it.""
""So, this sweater?""
""No, unfortunately not this one, but these tops over here are on promotion, just look for the white and red sign.""
""Oh... How about this jacket?""
""No. Just. The. Signed. Items.""

- ""Can yo just give me $15, I didn't find anything I want to use my $15 coupon on and it expires tomorrow, so can you just give me the $15?""

I guarantee you that there are more, but I could probably go on for hours. So share yours and let us all have a good laugh!",What are your favorite dumb questions?,135
itsanrnotau,7,9,1qr9mt,75,"On Saturdays I usually work the closing shift. 1pm-10pm. This week though, my colleague who does the opening shift (8am-2pm) on my department is off, so I have had to come in and do my 9 hour shift in the morning to balance it out a little. Most people have said ""I bet you're made up!"" But really, no, I like my late shifts. Sure, of a night there is more alcoholics and drug addicts to deal with and stuff, but most of the managers go home at 6 and a lot of the people who work the closing shifts are my age and I get on with everyone a lot better. It's a lot of fun working lates with them. I usually dislike mornings because, well, I'm lazy as shit and even getting up at 12 for my late shifts annoys me, so getting up at 7 sucks ass. This as well as the fact the majority people who come in before 11am are weird. They're always bitter old people or just people who I would avoid if possible, but meh. 
This morning though, 8:15, my first customer, I realised why I don't like the people who come in so early.

OW: (shouting) this is disgusting. All I want is a chicken. This is such a fucking joke. Look at this?!?!

Me: you alright love? 
OW: you! What the fuck is this about? (Pointing at a chicken.) this shop is a fucking joke!! 
Me: what's wrong with it? 
(I'm still walking up to her so I can't see it)
OW: it's out of fucking date. You can't sell out of date chickens!! You fucking idiot.

Me: the cook in the bag ones with stuffing? I should have another one here let me Che... Oh, I do, take your pick out of these ones. 
OW: the things you have to do around here to get service is a joke. 
Me: sorry, it's still early and nobody was on our department last night so everything's a bit of a mess right now
OW: well I used to own a supermarket. Asda. That was mine. I was the CEO. I know you can't sell out of date chickens. It's illegal.

I've been staring at the white walls of the video game store for about 2 hours since lunch. It was a very slow day, I glanced at the tables in front of the store,and my heart ache. It was the donation table for the victims of Typhoon Yolanda that wretched my country and even though I have donated what I can, I still feel sad whenever I saw the people on the TV suffering. 

I was broken out of my thoughts when the doors jingled open . Customers, finally!

She was a small girl, about 10 or 11 and a pink Hello Kitty backpack was at her small back. Her mother was accompanying her, a few plastic bags in tow. I recognized her mom. When I was selling cigarettes on the street, I see her peddling clothes she made herself on her stall at the market. She now has her own online shop and making a name for herself. 

The daughter just had a birthday and her mom finally has enough money to buy a PS3 and some games. 

The girl half-jogged, half-skipped to my counter. She opened her backpack and pulled out a console. Her mom handed me the bag full of games.

""Can I return this?""

""Sure sweetie, no problem.""

I inspected at the console and the games, and nothing was opened. Per policy, I returned the money to the mom. She handed the money to the girl, and she ran off as fast as her little feet can take her. I was about to ask when the mom, seeing my expression, explained.

""She wants to sell her birthday gift, so she can donate to the victims.""

I honestly teared a bit there. She was willing to give up what was supposed to be hers and gave to those in need. That's real generosity out there.

While I was watching her talking to the girl at the donations table, I was reminded that even though there are a lot of selfish assholes in the world, there's a person just like that little girl and I was happy.

Edit: Yolanda and Hayain are the same typhoon.

Dhenn004,42,79,1qr32l,361,"I've posted here before, and I mentioned I was a Movie theater shift manager. And I apologize this may get long.

Anyways to the story. It's Friday night, and it's busy, Thor came out last week and Catching Fire is next week so pre orders and Thor are making it absolutely nuts. It's also bringing the worst out of my employees (rightfully so, they are stressed) and the customers.

Anyways I digress. At our concessions we offer a free refill for MEDIUM and LARGE drinks and popcorn. It's to beat our competitors because they only offer on Large. Now, typically people who come out with a small and want it refilled I offer to let them pay the difference from a small to a medium and switch their cup for them. It's like 50 cents and most people accept. Not Today, Not this customer.

So this man comes out and wants a refill. My assistant manager politely tells the man that she is sorry but only MEDIUMS and LARGES get refills. 

**asshole:** ""Well one of your employees said I get refills.""

**Assistant Manager:** "" I'm sorry but our policy states-""

**Asshole** ""What, I don't care about your policy I want a refill"" At this point I hear him raising his voice so I start to walk over. But he just throws his cup on the floor and walks away before I can try to defuse the problem.

I shout across the lobby "" Come on man! We work hard to keep this place clean!"" Basically to make him guilty. (if it were even possible). I pick my Assistant up with the ""he's an asshole"" speech and we figure its over with.

Jump about 10 to 15 minutes later. We get a complaint about a man in a theater being loud and talking. With the same description of the man we just dealt with. I sigh and go in and stand in the corner so I can assess the situation without him seeing me. (If I'm seen, most of the time people stop right away and don't make a noise). I hear him and see him talking in the corner. It's the asshole.

I make my rounds, I walk up both set of steps make it seem like I'm not there for him. I walk to his side and stop a couple of rows behind him. He's still talking. I walk up to him and whisper for him to please be quiet. He stops talking for, I don't know, no more than 30 seconds? I ask again. Nothing is working on this guy!

He continues and I once a gain tell him to be quiet with a firm voice. Also I include the I will have you escort you out if you don't keep quiet. He just laughs right in my face. So I tell him to leave immediately.

**asshole:** "" make me HAHAHAHA"" Now this is getting the attention of everyone in the theater. 

**Me:** "" I have no problem calling the police, sir""

**Asshole:** "" Go ahead I'm not doing anything wrong""

**Me:** "" yes you are, you are disturbing everyone's movie experience, I've done this before and the police will be on my side on this""

**Asshole:** "" yea okay whatever, bitch.""

 I radio up to my assistant who has been right behind the projector upstairs and tell her to pause the movie. I announce to the crowd saying I'm sorry for the disturbance but I need to stop the movie so they don't lose their experience and miss out on the movie. (The whole point of me doing this is to call him out, maybe embarrass him). Well it worked but not in the way I expected.

I stands up and I see him ball his fist and bucking up to me. Typically in a business situation you can't fight back or do anything. I wasn't looking to fight this man so I back up to put some space between this guy and myself. He starts moving towards me, and I quickly as possible Radio up and tell my assistant to call the city police department. (911 wasn't needed).

He lunges at me so I just back up as quickly as possible. I'm a pretty quick guy so I easily just moved out of the way. But he tried to get even closer and pushed me. After that it was on baby! Actually not really, he pushed me and I just grabbed him by the neck and held him in a position so that he couldn't do anything. 

I asked him if he was done but he was just getting furious. He tried dipping out before the police showed but I was prepared and had the doors locked so if something like this were to happen I could keep him in the theater. He ended up hiding in the bathroom until the cops showed up. Several police asked other movie goers what happened. Let me off with a pat on the back and said I did the only thing I could do to stop him and arrested him. 

TL/DR: I channeled my inner bruce lee and put him in a headlock.

arizean,12,6,1qqwwp,27,"So there's a double meaning to the title. One is that I was in the hospital recently, which is a bit of a complicated story, and two is the huge mistake I made only a few days before I went in to the hospital.

So I work at a combo pharmacy and retail store. A popular chain with a very strange array of customers. Anyways, there is a policy that any and all found items should be handed in to management so they can cross check IDs and stuff I guess. Great. Would have been wonderful had I been told before this happened. I should have done better, and I know now that I was a complete moron. Still, I suppose this makes a good story.

So a pharmacy tech gets off her shift. Drops her wallet in the parking lot. Someone finds it, hands it in. I put it off to the side of the counter. 

We get a call. It's the pharmacy tech, asking about her wallet, I let her know we have it.

Not too long after that a woman comes in with her mother and describes the wallet, saying she lost it. Heres the huge mistake, I gave it to her. So stupid of me.

The pharmacy techs boyfriend comes and asks about it. Than my manager had to call the police and the store manager. All I could think was two things ""I'm a horrible person."" and ""I'm in so much trouble.""

The cops ask for a description. Problem is my memory sucks. Especially when I'm sick, as I was at the time. Sadly I could give only an estimated age and hair color. And she was wearing a headband.

The cops take down my info so they can call me if need be. For any questions I guess. I comply, of course, and they go on their way. I am than informed of the policy.

Recently I had to call my manager and let him know I will not be able to work until after, if all goes well, this Thursday. When I was about to say good bye he tells me the cops want my help with IDing the thief. 

I don't know what to do TFR. I can't remember what she looks like except for her hair and headband. I don't want to give false information.

blarglznoflo,28,43,1qqwj5,133,"A few weeks ago or so, my store had a brand of vitamins/supplements on sale as buy one/get one free. Simple, right?

The brand has tons of coupons. There are almost always those little folded-up coupons stuck to the top of the bottles. I mean, it's a decently expensive brand of vitamins, so people really appreciate getting a buck or two off of their $16 vitamins (although we sell the same thing in much cheaper brands, but whatever...).

Well, I had a customer come through and, in addition to his groceries, he had two bottles of these vitamins. First, I had to explain to him that they had to be the same price for the BOGO, but he accepted that easily enough and we had a clerk grab a replacement bottle so the BOGO would work.

I put it through just fine, he paid like $11 for one and the second was free.

He then hands me all his grocery coupons, and eventually I notice several coupons for these vitamins. I point out to him that we're only allowed to use one vendor coupon on each item, so I would only be able to use one of his ""$1.50 off a bottle of Vitamin Brand"" coupons.

He freaked the heck out. 

Customer: ""No! I paid $11 for TWO BOTTLES, so I need to get all $3 off!"" (the amount it would be with the two coupons, in case that wasn't obvious)

Me: ""But sir, because of the sale, technically you only paid for one bottle. We sold you the second bottle at zero dollars, and we can't take $1.50 out of zero. The computer simply will not let me.""

I turned my screen around so he could see the error message that popped up when I scanned the second coupon. It was something like ""no applicable item"" because, well, one coupon had been applied to bottle 1, and bottle 2 wasn't eligible.

Of course, he gave my favorite outcry of ""let me talk to a manager about this!""

I called over a manager, knowing that I had done it correctly. We face this issue EVERY...TIME we have this sale. But he kept repeating what is now my least favorite phrase, and I do not understand how every problem customer is convinced of this delusion...

Customer: ""I did this just last week!""

Manager: ""Sir, we don't allow that on BOGO sales. And these weren't on that sale last week.""

Customer: ""Well, it was last time, whatever. And (name of another manager) let me do it.""

Manager: ""No, sir, she wouldn't have because this is part of our company policy, we've discussed this issue about this sale.""

Customer: ""Well, I did it last week!""

Manager: ""And you won't be able to do it today. Do you want the two bottles for $9.50, or not?""

Customer: ""Not if you won't let me use coupons like EVERY OTHER STORE!""

Manager: ""Ok then, sir!""

She removed the coupon and took the vitamins back to put them away.

These vitamins are usually $15+ at regular price. We have them on sale, PLUS buy one/get one free, PLUS using a coupon...so getting about $30 of vitamins for $9.50 wasn't good enough for him?","No, you can't get $1.50 off a free product.",176
bekahbbydoll,24,17,1qqw6j,86,"I would like to take this time to praise my front end manager. I came in an hour late because of a miscommunication with another manager. The phone call I received was anything but nice and professional, but I'm not here to talk about that. 

So after I came in I didn't let my foul mood try to get in the way of doing my job, I was super polite to guests and professional. My front end manager could tell something was up though. She asked what was wrong and I told her. She apologized profusely and told me that she was so sorry that it happened. 

Fast forward about 4 hours. A guest brought in some boots that she bought online. She didn't like that they had a colored zipper on the back. She bought them for like 35 bucks. When she returned them the price got reduced to $8.07. The boots were my size and I was dying to have them. I had mentioned this to my front end manager. But then realized that I didn't have enough cash on me to be able to use my team member discount. 

I was a little bummed. I knew someone else would snatch them up in no time because of the killer savings. My manager asked why I wasn't going to buy them and I told her I just didn't have the money to. Even though they were super cheap. So i go on break a little bummed.

I come back from break and my manager is holding a bag out to me. I asked her if it was a paid and left and she shook her head. I looked at her quizzically. She nods her head down at the bag and says 'look inside.' I open the bag and low and behold it's the boots! I look up at her and I'm just in awe. She told me it was no big deal, she knew I was having a bad day and that I really wanted the boots. I just had to promise that I would wear them tomorrow. I practically ran around the counter to hug her. It was the nicest thing anyone that I work with has ever done for me. I seriously almost started crying. 

**TL;DR:** had a crappy day, manager cheered me up by buying me boots I wanted and just being all around amazing.

Mystic-Spiral,2,13,1qqiq6,39,"Disclaimer: on phone

So I'm sitting in the bath and this story comes back to me. The women's clothing store I work for has been doing a LOT of promotions lately. The store is routinely 30-50% off, and considering our already reasonable to moderately expensive prices, these are very good deals. I don't have to tell all of you that promotions make people a little more nutty than usual.

To start this off, for a good week we had run 50% off select items. The items chosen were some of the older styles that were clearly headed towards a markdown, but hey, why not try and get some money out of them? Alas, Sunday rolls around and a  new week starts thus prompting a promo change. Select 50% is over, however it goes to 40% off the entire store. 

The store obviously gets fairly busy during this. I'm incredibly efficient at registers so I go to ring, assign my best sellers to fitting room and floor, and my best taskers to keeping up with the slobs who destroy the place.  Of course ringing puts me in direct line of fire. 

You know what's coming next. 

A client approaches checkout with her stink face on and a huge stick up her ass. My retail senses go into over drive and I can already feel myself tensing up for the impending battle, whatever it may be. 

""Hi! How may I help you?""

Bug up her butt barely replies and proceeds to whip out a dress and a receipt. ""I need a price adjustment on this dress. I bought it full price and now it's on sale."" 

Okay, not too bad, maybe I was over anticipating. ""Sure, no problem! It's 40% off everything so I will credit the difference back to your card, super quick and easy!"" 

I swear to God the Earth shook. ""No! I want the 50% off that it was yesterday! I was busy and couldn't get to a store.""

Ah. There it is.

I put on my best face and fight on. ""Well unfortunately that promotion ended. I can't price adjust for past promotions, but it IS still 40% off today, so you are getting a great deal!""

""No. I want the 50% off that it was yesterday!""

""Ma'am, I can't do that. Corporate policy is that I can only price adjust for the current days promotions."" 

""Fine! But I'll be calling corporate! Give me their number!""

""Okay, the customer help line is 1-800-RETAILERSNAME""

""NO! I want your head office AND I want your district manager's phone number! Now!""

""Unfortunately we don't have the number for the head office and I am not allows to give out my DMs personal number. The 1-800 number will put you in touch with the person who can help you best."" 

""That's ridiculous! I can't believe you can't give me your district manager's number! They will be hearing about this too!""

""Okay ma'am. I do apologize, but my hands are tied by corporate policy.""

And this is my favorite part. 

""I don't believe you. You have more power than you are letting on! I'll take the 40% off and then I'll talk to your corporate about the other 10%!"" 

I do her transaction and hand her the receipts all while she still rants about how awful we are, about how I don't know how to do my job, and how she will get us all. 

""Alright, you are all set, remember the number is 1-800-RETAILERSNAME and just hold on to your receipts so they know the price adjustments we made today.""

She glowers at me and makes another passive aggressive remark about how it's stupid that I can't even give her my DM's name.

""Well you never asked for her name, just her number, which I can not give out. Have a nice afternoon! I can help whoever is next!""

:P

RaxonDR,23,34,1qqd6p,136,"A while ago, I posted the story of CRB. After a week, I have finally gotten the story out of her. This is that story. Names have been changed to amuse me. We will call CRB Daisy this time.

It was a typical day in the neighborhood, a typical day for cosmetics. Daisy was working her counter, when this kid, about thirteen or fourteen, ran past her, grinning. One of the security guys, Rosco, showed up, looking around. Daisy knew what was what and pointed where the kid had gone. A short while later, she's doing a bit of tidying, cleaning the front of her displays.

As she's bent over, she feels her skirt moving, followed immediately by an excruciating pain in her arse. ""That's what you get for snitching!"" The boy from earlier had just stabbed her in the ass by ramming three pencils into her soft flesh. He had pretty good aim. They were all right around her rectum. They were, unfortunately, cedar pencils. Daisy was and is allergic to cedar.

Her brain started to get muddled. She turned and slapped him so hard he fell down. Rosco showed up about the time she was starting to to get sick. She couldn't walk, but she had tears streaming down her cheeks.

She was gripping him by the collar of his shirt and hanging on for dear life. Her manager, Boss Hogg, was called, as well as her brother, Bo. They called an ambulance, and the EMT had to cut the boy's shirt to get him free.

Good thing they did, because she was having convulsions and shaking him violently. The kid was yelling ""GET THIS CRAZY BITCH OFF ME!"" Boss Hogg called the police, and decided to press charges. A few days later, Daisy was back to work. She needed a cane, and could not sit down, due to three sore, golf ball sizes swellings. She had to have a [very special pillow] ( http://www.hemroidharry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/donut-cushion-from-duro-med.DMI102.1.185.jpg) to sit on. Boss Hogg bought the pillow for her. She was and is one of his best workers.

A few days after she got back, guess who she saw! As the boy ran past, he said, ""bitch!"" She grabbed him by the back of his collar and yanked him off his feet. She let go and let him hit the floor hard. Homeboy was down and out.

Ambulance was called. Kid had a concussion. It was finally decided that he had ignored some wet floor signs. That was the last they ever saw of homeboy. Daisy got a verbal warning and told she was lucky no customers had been around.

Ever since, she has been referred to as the ""Crazy 'Roid Bitch""",Origin of the crazy 'roid bitch.,170
chrilo,40,69,1qqbev,188,"Okay, some background first. The currency in Norway is crowns and cents (not really cents, but lets call it that for simplicity). When you buy a soda, or other kinds of soft drinks, you pay an extra 1 crown for the bottle if it's 0,5l, and an extra 2 crowns 50 cents if it's a larger bottle, this is known as pant. You get this money back when you return it, it's to make people recycle or something.

Now, a couple years ago, Norway removed cents (as in the physical coins, prices are still set to 1.49, 3.68, etc.) from it's currency system (1 US dollar equals about 6 crowns these days, so you can imagine how little it was worth), so if your total comes to 3 crowns and 0-49 cents, it's rounded down to 3 crowns, and up if it's 50-99 cents.

Finally, the real story. Now let me just tell you, I have seen some cheapskates in my day. I've had people yell me an earful because an item had the wrong price-tag, and people who would rip me a new one because a sale ended the day before. I've had customers that literally went to 5 different stores to get their shopping done, just so that they could take advantage of every sale they could find, but NOTHING beats this woman! 

This lady comes up to my register and hand me a check from the pant-machine. It's for 2 crowns and 50 cents, I scan it, press enter and lo behold, she gets her 3 crowns. Fairly uneventful. The she gives me another. And another. AND ANOTHER. Turns out she has 10 of these, that she wants in cash, one at a time, so that she can get an extra 50 cents for each. She should have gotten 25 crowns, she got 30. And after that she has the AUDACITY to ask me to change it for her, 'cause she ""doesn't want all this loose change"".

She basically did this to ""save"" 5 crowns, ALMOST 1 US dollar (I use the term lightly, swindle is really a more appropriate word). I was about ready to rip her throat out, unfortunately, my boss wouldn't let me...",So I had a run-in with the biggest cheapskate I have ever met today...,257
Coolio23,16,11,1qqa7s,31,"I had quite the morning today. This is a long story, no apologies. TL;DR is at the bottom.

Last Wednesday night I was browsing the Craigslist ads for part-time work because I've been hurting for a job for quite a while now. I came across one for a big sporting goods store near my area, so I sent in my application and went to bed. Having done this countless times and never gotten an interview, I didn't think much of it.

The next morning, as I put on my pants to get ready for classes, my phone rang on the bedside table. Lo and behold, it's the sports store! The woman introduced herself and says that they'd like an interview. Hell yeah! She told me to be at the store at 7:10 AM, and to just ask for a manager when I get there. I thought to myself *""Okay, that works perfectly for the class times I have tomorrow.""* I agreed and hung up, excited. They had called barely 12 hours after I sent in the application! They must really need someone, I thought.

Now, this was going to be my second ever job interview. So I prepared myself, prepping responses to interview questions, getting a folder for a hard copy of my resume, references, and any questions that I would have for the interviewer. Psyching myself up, I set my alarm early and went to bed.

Friday morning came (yes, *today*), and I got dressed: slacks, a tucked in button down, and some nice shoes. I rolled out of my driveway and headed to the store. 

It was 6:30 AM when I left, and dark. While I've driven this route before (the store is next to a mall that I shop at occasionally), I've never gone through it this early. As a result, I got held up by school buses, which in retrospect I should've thought of since it was a residential area. I silently raged at the high schoolers as they boarded the bright yellow bane of my existence. Regardless, I got to the general area of the store with 10 minutes to spare.

And I made a wrong turn.

My navigational skills aren't the best in the dark. The wrong turn sent me *way off course*. After calling the store's phone number and letting them know I'll be late, I asked for directions and the woman kindly obliged. I thanked her profusely and hung up. 

I arrived at the store at 7:20. The gates were up and the doors were locked, so I caught the attention of a passing-by employee, who directs me to ring the doorbell, literally. I did so, standing in a puddle of my own worry because I was ten minutes late for a job interview I really need. 

The guy came back and motioned for me to ring it a second time, then left again.

He came back a third time and held up nine fingers, saying something that I couldn't make out because of the soundproof glass between us. He left again, this time returning with a woman who I assume is a manager. She rolled up the cage and unlocked the doors.

&gt; Her: Hi, can I help you?

&gt; Me: Yes, I'm Coolio23. I'm here for a job interview.

&gt; Her: Oh, you're the person from the phone? 

&gt; Me: Yes ma'am.

&gt; Her: Oh, I was wondering why you called so early. Well, I'm not allowed to let you in before store hours.

&gt; Me: But, I was told to be here at 7:10.

&gt; Her: Well I can't let you in right now, can you come back at 9?

&gt; Me: Um, no, I have classes during the morning that don't end till the afternoon...

&gt; Her: Can you come back at like 12 or 1?

&gt; Me: Uh, sure. 1 o' clock is fine.

&gt; Her: Okay, thank you.

I walked back to my car and head home, wondering if I've ruined my chances or made myself stand out by arriving two hours early. I went to class, got some lunch at home, then returned to the store at 1 PM. I walked in and got the attention of a big guy in a store uniform, saying I'm there for an interview. He walked over to the register and asked the woman from earlier if she wanted to do the interview and she said ""No"". The guy shrugged and motioned me to follow him to the back. He seemed like a pretty cool guy (he wasn't frowning or angry), which put me at ease.

I sat down in his office and he walked in with my application. He asked me why I applied here, what my previous jobs entailed, where I was going to school. He said that he liked my hours of availability (Fridays and weekends), and how I had no retail experience (*""We'll teach you the way we teach things.""*). He said that he'll run this by his boss and that I'll probably get a call.

That was it. The whole interview was over in *six minutes*.

I was caught completely off guard by how short it was, so much so that I didn't ask any of my questions or anything else that I had prepared for. I shook the guy's hand and went on my way. I'm still not completely sure if I got the job or not.

ChestyPetite,21,23,1qq95t,87,"I am a young girl and  I work at a self serve frozen yogurt joint. It's a new locally owned business that sells some pretty delicious yogurt. I have worked here for two months and sometimes there would be this kid that would come in who would never buy anything, beg for samples, and hang out from open to close (and often sleep) on our couch. Our boss is totally okay with this for some reason and he leaves us girls alone for the most part so nobody complains.  He is obviously homeless but not starving because he is overweight. Early twenties. 

So back track to Halloween. The kid comes in and likes to do this thing where he will walk up behind a big group of people who I am handing sample cups to, to seem less awkward when he begs. I feel sorry for him today and decide to give him my shift meal under the condition that he never asks me for samples again. Big mistake. So he gets his yogurt and sits down right next to me at the cash register to eat. I wanted to be friendly because I felt bad for the guy so I asked him some questions about his life and recommended that the could go to the library and study interesting things or read or something because he had a lot of time on his hands. I mean this kid literally just sits and watches our shop tv from 10 am to 10 pm. 

For some reason he starts to ask me questions, and gets aggressive about it. He asks me if I want to see his resume, and angrily repeats ""WHY NOT"" when I say I am busy and I have no reason to. Then he asks me if I want babies some day. I tell him that that is not an appropriate question and I don't want to answer it. This is all met with ""JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION"". I eventually said no and at this point I'm just playing with my phone trying to stop this conversation. ""What are you doing on your phone. Are you texting? Who are you texting? JUST TELL ME"" I just say I'm browsing, and I'm using all of my body language to show him that I don't want to talk anymore. For now he leaves me alone but just stares at me until my shift is over and walks away when the next employee shows up. 

My next shift is a few days later and of course he is there again. Of course he asks for sample cups and of course he plays dumb when I remind him of our agreement. I brush him off and ring up some customers, so he recedes to sit at the front on the couch like he always does. Here's where the fun starts. 

I go to the back after a few hours of being behind the register to refill some raspberries. When I get to the toppings bar I see that our homeless friend has sample cups in hand and is stealing yogurt. I tell him that he can't do that and that he is stealing. "" I'm not doing anything wrong, everybody gets sample cups!"" And looks at customers (who are uncomfortable at this point) for support. ""You are here every day and you buy nothing, begging for sample cups every time a shift ends and a new employee comes in. You can't do that, and you need to throw those away."" He just smiles at me and acts dumb. ""No. I'm not doing anything wrong."" 

I get frustrated and text my boss, who says it's my fault because I left sample cups on the counter. This makes me petty angry because that's where he keeps them when he works and not a single employee keeps them anywhere else. My boss tells me to leave the dude alone. Whatever. 

The next day rolls around and I'm back at work. At this point I've talked to some of the girls who work there about homeless dude and every single one has a story of him doing something strange like that in the last couple of days. While I'm chatting with my coworker ""M"" about the problems I've had, the dude walks into the store. He tries to wave and I just shake my head at him. He smiles and gets closer and waves again. I just shake my head. He then sits down at the closest seat to the register and continues to stare at me. M excuses herself to use the restroom, leaving me all alone with this guy. 

He tries to talk to me and I look at him mid sentence and just shake my head. At this point, HE STARTS TO CRY.  I ignore him and play with my phone, so he purposely tries to cry LOUDER.  I ignore him and tolerate his ridiculously creepy staring until my second coworker arrives and I beg her  to let me work back. 
     At this point I text my boyfriend who gets angry and comes in to sit with me for the rest of my shift. All is well at this point. Boyfriend stared him down until he left his spot and went back to the couch to watch tv. He leaves us alone for the most part but occasionally gets up to watch us though the reflection of the store front windows. 

Closing time has rolled around and all customers have left. I come out of the back after a day of mopping and dish washing to watch the register while my coworker uses the restroom. Boyfriend is still sitting and doing his homework. This is when I see homeless dude stand up from laying on the couch. He begins to walk incredibly slowly over towards where I am standing. After getting about 7 feet away, he stops and stares at me. At this point I am shaking. I have no idea what he wants and I am incredibly uncomfortable with him. I do not feel supported by my boss because I have been told that he is allowed to stay for as long as he wants. I muster up all of my strength and in a monotone voice ask ""can I help you with anything?"" He shakes his head no at me. ""Unfortunately, we have to close the shop..."" He turns around and very slowly walks towards the door, only leaving after staring at us for a minute. 

I lock the door and call my boss in tears, who tries to convince me nothing is wrong and that I can only ask him to leave if he is bothering customers. It takes 20 minutes for him to give me permission to ask him to leave if I am personally uncomfortable.

This little old lady comes up to my register and starts piling up tins and tins of cat food. I'm talking a lot of cat food, the good stuff also -the chunks and gravy variety.

Seventy_Times7,2,9,1qq7et,57,"Yesterday was the Playstation 4 launch, and I headed into work expecting things to be insane by the time I arrived for my 5pm-1am shift. I work in electronics, and was going to be one of the 3 guys working past midnight. To my surprise, things were pretty calm. I started to work with my friend/coworker to get everything PS4-y ready for the night. It was all going swimmingly for a couple hours. 

Then, she showed up.

One of our ""regulars"" is in electronics trying to pull a locked up 40"" TV off the shelf. She's a loud, slightly balding, skinny, red-headed woman in her mid to late 30s who has been suspected of trying to steal stuff multiple times. Usually she has her 6-7 year old daughter (who is adorable) with her, and is constantly screaming at the poor girl for ""touching things."" My coworkers roll their eyes and one motions for me to go ""deal"" with her.

Because she's about to pull a bunch of 40"" HDTVs down on herself, I run up to her. ""Hi ma'm, let me help you with that!""

""I don't need you're help."" She replies flatly.

I sigh a little. ""If you'd like me to take care of that TV for you, I have unlock it first.""

At this point, I expect her to argue that she has more shopping to do, so she has to take it with her (which I can't let her do). But instead she turns around and looks at me, sizing me up for a brief moment.

""Oh... Well is this a good TV? We need a new one for our living room.""

I go on to tell her that she has actually chosen my favorite TV in that size range. She looks at me with an eyeroll and states ""Yeah I bet you'd say that if I had chosen anything else high-priced."" (it is the highest priced 40"" we carry)

I happily state ""Oh no ma'm, I'm not a salesman of any kind. I mean, I don't make commission or anything, and I know a good bit about our TVs. You actually chose what I would buy if I had to choose a 40"" TV from here."" I had given her the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I brace for another sarcastic reply but instead she looks at me again, and silently walks to our displays.

I expect this to be the end of our chat. But then, she turns and asks for my help. I turn to see my coworkers looking at me with wide eyes and raised eyebrows. This is a first.

I never expected things to go well, but we ended up having a great 20 minute conversation about the various brands we carry, the differences between TV types (plasma, LED, LCD), refresh rates, and what Smart TV really means. I expected all the info to go straight over her head, but she understood it all pretty well. It turned out that despite seeming ignorant and rude, she knows a fair bit, and is a pretty quick learner.

After we finished discussing everything and looking at the upcoming Black Friday deals, she did something we've never seen her do before. As she left, she turned and said ""Thank you! You were a great help!"" and then, she SMILED.

supersporky,8,6,1qq65t,19,"Ugh I just wanted to kick this older guy in the face just now. It seems that he always has some sort of problem with me and how the owner runs the store. 

He wanted to special order a set of scrubs and has the tags of what he wants, which is awesome and easier for me too. I get the order set up and he is rushing to get the check written before I ring up the items. I tell him the total and ask to see a valid form of ID because not only is it store policy to check and make sure the DL number is on there but also to get a phone number if we need to call them because of *insert whatever reason there is* .

The policy has been like this and is clearly posted on the desk along with a sign that says if you write us a bad check, not only do you have to pay that amount, but you also owe an additional $30 to cover the cost of the bounced check (other stores may vary). 

I let him know that I know it can be inconvenient and annoying but that it is store policy, so could you please go and get it? He does but when he comes back inside, he won't take it out of his wallet and **COVERS** the address. *Which is on the check he just wrote*. He proceeds to ask me *sarcastically* if there are anymore hoops that he needs to jump through to make a purchase. I stare at him right in the eyes (asserting my dominance) and tell him no. He did not get a smile or a have a good night. He doesn't deserve one.

After he left I wrote down in the customer accounts notes that this gentleman refuses to show any form of identification and to call the owner and see what they want to do with his money. Hopefully his check does not bounce and I wont have to deal with him again.

Locclo,9,17,1qq0j6,67,"This happened a few months ago, but wow, I never thought I'd meet a guy who could be so frightening without saying a word. Let me preface this by saying that I live in a Minnesotan suburb, so about 95% of everyone I meet is extremely nice.

I know it's a wall of text, you guys can deal with it. Why are you here if not to read, anyway?

**Background**: I work in the bakery department of a big retailer. My duties mainly include packaging bread and stocking the floor, and occasionally taking a cake order (or handing one over to a customer).

Our story begins during one of my long shifts, right around noon. I'm happily bagging bread when a customer walks up and asks to pick up a cake. Sure, I can grab that, no problem. I stop what I'm doing, head into the cooler to grab it...

And it's not there. No cakes. Not a one. My heart starts to sink, but I'm thinking to myself, ""Okay, not a big deal, maybe the decorator just stuck it in the freezer."" It's not as uncommon as you might think; we only had the one decorator at the time, so sometimes she would make orders a few days in advance when she had a day off immediately before the pickup date.

Nope, no cakes there, either. Or rather, not the one this guy's looking for. The one he wants is covered in red and pink hearts (this is nowhere near Valentine's Day, but whatever, I'm not going to question his choice). I consult with one of my coworkers, and we dig around for the original order, but for some reason, we only find one of our two copies, and it's the wrong one.

(As a quick side note, there are always three copies of a cake order. One goes into a sort of organizer so that the decorator knows what needs to be made for what days, one gets attached to the kit or design so we don't accidentally run out before making it, and the third goes to the customer.)

Anyways, so we find the design order form, but the one that goes in the organizer is nowhere to be found. I glance at it for a moment, then turn to ask my coworker for advice. Apparently she turned into the Sidler from Seinfeld, because she's nowhere to be found. If my life was a sitcom, I'd be looking around confused while a laugh track started playing.

So, I take a deep breath, put on my brave face, and go out to the customer who, by the way, is a big, burly guy with a neutral, patient expression on his face, and I explain the situation to him. Or at least, I start to, because I get more and more nervous as I'm looking at him. Why? Because throughout my whole explanation, he is saying *nothing* while giving me [this](http://www.visualphotos.com/photo/2x3664152/man_glaring_at_camera_portrait_FAA022000042.jpg) look. He has cranked the death glare up to 11, and I'm getting the full blast. He wasn't even blinking.

I'm floundering here, I'm wringing my hands together, scratching my neck, and wondering if the scary Russian man is going to put a price on my head. After what seems like an hour, he finally says, ""You have *got* to be kidding me.""

And don't get me wrong here, I didn't tell him that we didn't have it and he was screwed. I told him that we couldn't find the cake, we had to ask our decorator about it, and she would be back within 10-15 minutes (she was on break at the time). Thankfully, my department manager came around and I was able to pass this guy over to him. 

There isn't much else to the story - the manager talked to the guy, the decorator came back, and he agreed to come back in a few hours to pick up the cake, which he was getting at no charge because of our mistake. 

What was interesting, though, was the person who came to pick it up later, because it wasn't him, it was his wife. Why was that interesting? Because his wife was the complete polar opposite to him. I mean, maybe I just caught the guy on a bad day or something (entirely likely, really) but he was big, burly, and scary, and his wife was cheery, friendly, and completely okay with us screwing up the order. I mean, she actually said the words, ""it's no big deal as long as we got a cake out of it."" Complete reverse of how her husband acted.

So, yeah. That was the first (and so far, only) customer I've had that actually made me fear for my life, and he didn't even say a word.

sxcamaro,82,105,1qpvmc,503,"MY current position involves setting and placing the advertisements for the week in the store. I also am responsible for store wide pricing, and usually the associates of the store direct calls to me that should go to the store director.

Well a customer calls and asks about at least 20 items, and ensuring that they are in stock. He then states our flier is offering items at 100, 80, 60, and 40% off. I correct him and point out that it says $ off not %. He argues back and forth that I'm wrong and he sees it right in front of him.

After several minutes of this nonsense I ask him to bring the original ad in so that I can prove that the $ does not equal %.

Anyways, many moons ago I worked for a local grocery store chain. Since I had just started there, I hadn't learned to keep my nails short. So it's busy, and I'm rushing to get this middle ageish woman through. I pick up her big ass tub of cat litter (I don't remember exactly how much it weighed but it was the biggest tub you could get) My nail on my middle finger gets caught under the lid and proceeds to RIP OFF.

My ENTIRE nail RIPPED OFF. I had NO NAIL.

So of course I start screaming in agony while holding my bleeding hand and crying. All the other customers in line are freaking out and the lady I was serving just stands there calmly and with an emotionless stare says;

""Yeah, can I have a bag please?""

I couldn't believe my ears. I slowly turned to her and gave her a look of ""REALLY?"" all while tears are pouring down my face.

We stand there staring at each other for a few seconds. All the other customers in my line are giving her dirty looks and thankfully my manager comes over and takes over for me while I go to get bandaged up.

Kellynn,8,16,1qpkpt,56,"Oops, this got real long. 

I work at an awesome makeup store. I just started, so my job so far has consisted of watching a lot of training videos, soaking up a ton of knowledge, and I'm just now getting onto the floor. I was on the floor for probably an hour last shift ringing up transactions, but last night was my first shift where I was on the floor for all of it. I was told when I came in that my job was going to be to ring up most of the transactions that night to get me comfortable on register, and shadow my coworkers when there weren't customers to ring up as well as learning all the proper closing procedures. So I'm happily trailing after my coworkers, learning my way around products, and greeting customers while making sure to not accidentally blow up a register. 

Enter The Cougar. She will be known at TC from this point on. She is being followed by a much younger man, and I could not figure out if it was her son or sugar daddy, but after the fifth time she asked for the credit card, I think I got it. She has her hair tightly pulled back, her makeup caked on, she is one botox treatment away from her face locking up for good, and a brightly colored knitted jacket designed to make her look rich, but only made her look kinda crazy. My coworker goes to greet her with me trailing after. Immediately TC is in a tizzy. 

TC: I bought some skin products here, and I just really need to get them again, but I don't remember what they were, and UGH, why can't I remember?!

My coworker explains to her that we have the ability to pull up her purchase history so we can tell her exactly what she bought from us. It's a nifty feature we have for customers who are rewards members with us because a lot of times a customer will come through looking for a product in a certain shade but they can't remember it. It's a lot easier to look it up real fast instead of having to keep guessing at it and hope you get it right. But TC is still losing her shit. ""I just bought so many products and I just can't remember them and I got this one from this other brand and do you carry that brand, I want that brand!""

My coworker explains that we do not have that brand, but asks TC what it was she liked about it, so we can suggest a product we do carry. ""I DON'T KNOW, I JUST LIKED IT OKAY."" Alrighty then. We're doing good. We show her some of the products in the anti-aging area, because they seem to have similar properties to what she's looking for, to which she starts bitching ""I'm not fifty, why the hell would I need anything from anti-aging?!"" As if fifty is some magical turning point to being able to use anti-aging products.

So we manage to establish one product she liked before we can get her over to the cash wrap and get her product history up. She keeps telling us, loudly, about a product she swears she bought from a brand we do carry that had honey in it. I can tell in my coworker's face that she thinks this woman's nuts, and says she doesn't believe that brand carries any product like that, but let's get up the product history and see what it was. I scan her card, pull up her product info, and give her her card back. We look at her product history, going through every single item back until the beginning of the fucking universe. There is not a single product here with honey in it. The one product she bought that she claimed was the honey one? It's a greek yogurt based product. We show her this product, and she keeps asking if we're sure this is what she bought, really, totally positive? Because she swears it was a honey based product. She continues to ask at least ten more times if we're TOTALLY SURE. Lady, I am looking at everything you have ever purchased ever. I'm sure. So we pull up our store's website on the computer, look at the brand, and she continues looking for this legendary honey product. This brand has literally never sold this mythical product she's claiming exists. My coworker finds her a few other products that will work, and we think we've finally pleased this crazy cougar. Oh no. That would be too simple.

Her younger gentleman partner left a while ago because he was 10000% done with being in a makeup store, as if being anywhere near product was a threat to his masculinity. We get to checkout finally, and she calls him and starts screeching into the phone about how he needs to come back NOW because he's got the credit card and needs to pay. She hangs up, leans in and whispers to me, ""let's just not tell him how much all this cost, okay? It'll be our little secret."" 

Um. And how do you propose I hide the total when he's the one paying? 

So we ring her up, and I'm still keying in items when he's already furiously swiping his card over and over again, bitching about how it isn't working. I nearly gave myself a headache trying to contain my eye roll. We get her her samples, and her rewards perks which she spends another five minutes agonizing over and asking if we're SURE it's not a honey product, and are these REALLY the only rewards we have available? 

Finally get her total. Boyfriend decides the total is too high. TC declares to me, ""well SOMEONE thinks this costs too much money, so I guess we're gonna need to take a cleanser off to make SOMEONE happy."" I finish her transaction. Her items are bagged. My coworker says I can take my break. I think I'm free.

""WHAT ABOUT MY BIRTHDAY GIFT?!"" 

So when we hit total, it pops up all the rewards info. We tell this to the customer, and it has a little checklist of things we're supposed to offer to the customer. If birthday gift is applicable, we give it to them. Birthday gift did not pop up for The Cougar. I tell my coworker that it didn't prompt for it, so I didn't offer. She asks TC when her birthday is. It's early October. 

Now, you can get your birthday gift during you BIRTHDAY MONTH. My birthday's in June, you don't see me walking into work demanding my birthday gift right now. After demanding her gift TC wanders off to look at something else, and my coworker just mutters ""Oh whatever, I'm just gonna give it to her anyway, it is not worth the hassle to say no."" We get her birthday gift all done. Her items are bagged. She's leaving. I can still hear her screeching to her boyfriend about the honey product all the way out. I run for the exit for my break before she comes back to look for it again. ","No, I swear we're not lying to you about your product history.",72

Guest: Jeez, these are all around $30, do you have anything cheaper? I just need something small, you know?

Me: Well, no, we don't have anything else other than these...

Guest: That's a shame, I just want to make sure the one I already have works.

GeneralELucky,41,27,1qpcnb,58,"I work in retail management and I'm a PC Gamer. Over the past ten years, PC gaming has transitioned from physical media to digital distribution. As such, retailers carry a very limited selection of PC games (if any at all). My store is no exception. 

The other day I noticed a customer browsing our video games. This woman, in her upper 50's or 60's, asked where the PC games were so she could buy one for her husband. Judging by her age, I assumed she was looking for the basic, casual games (like slots, mystery ""adventure"" games, etc). I walked her over and pointed out the prices and the savings by buying two packaged together. She looked them over for a moment and frowned. 

""My husband likes action games.""

""Unfortunately, PC gaming has gone digital and is moving away from CDs and DVDs. The good news is that makes PC gaming even more cheaper than video game consoles. The bad news is that it can make it harder to include in regular, everyday shopping like you're experiencing now. But, let me see if I can help you out.""

I led her over to the laptops and opened up in Internet Explorer.

""Ma'am, I'd like to introduce you to Steam. It's the premier digital distribution network for PC gaming. It includes literally thousands of games and has more users than Microsoft's Xbox network. What I would recommend doing as a gift to your husband is introducing him to Steam and giving him a Steam Gift Card, which we sell at our sister store. Alternatively, you can create your own account, and 'gift' him games too.""

I pointed out several games. What they were selling for on Steam and how much they retail for on consoles. 

""Another option is the Humble Bundle. For a mere **five dollars** you will receive six AAA games. That money goes directly to charities. It's easy to focus on the savings, but the truth is that the money is going to various goodwill organizations.""

""What if my husband's computer doesn't have even RAM?""

""One of the benefits of PC Gaming is that the systems can be tweaked to work on just about any computer that's five or six years old. I hook up my laptop to my girlfriend's 50"" TV which she bought here during our last sale event and it is hardly powerful at all.""

""You are very passionate about PC gaming. Thank you for your time.""

""You're welcome. My parents instilled in me that consoles are only for gaming, while a PC can do everything under the sun. PC gaming really is the best kept secret in gaming.""

Mystic-Spiral,7,7,1qp3aa,41,"On my phone: beware of typo's 

A short time ago I decided that I was done slinging clothing at the over privileged masses and left women's clothing to try my hand at working in a car dealership. It was Hell. Easily the worst and most traumatic experience of my life due to horrible bosses and even worse customers. (The owner and her family are incredible people though. Absolutely the best and nicest and most generous people I have ever had the privilege of knowing). 

This story comes from that time. 

I wound up in the cashiers office which is where people would come to pay for parts and service. These were easily the most jaded and hard to deal with customers that I have ever had to deal with. The job was completely soul crushing. 

Anyway, I'm filling my time doing some small odd jobs in the booth (otherwise known as Facebooking) when a customer comes around to pay for a parts ticket. 

This person is your Standard Redneck Guy. Beer belly, scruffy face, pseudo mullet, and skin stained from years of working under trucks and tractors. His appearance doesn't faze me much as I have a few SRGs in my family (this is the Midwest, SRG is a common part of our flora and fauna) and know that they are usually okay guys. This SRG was mad as heck though, and as I was trapped in a booth and couldn't escape, his hunter's instinct knew that I was easy prey for his rantings.

""I don't even know why I am paying for these parts! This is ridiculous! You know why? Because it ain't my fault that my truck was damaged! I was driving along, and you know what? A damn deer jumped out in front of me and hit my truck! Now I have to pay for all these parts, but it's okay, I'll get my money back!""

I cringe as I let out an ""Oh?"" before I can stop myself. 

Now knowing he has an audience, SRGs volume raises as he continues to rant. ""The state is suppposed to control the deer population so this don't happen! I'm gonna sue them to get my money back and they're gonna fix my truck for me! It's their responsibility to make sure roads are safe for people, so I'm gonna sue them and make sure that I get all my money back, because it's ridiculous that I have to pay for all of this!""

He was really redundant and very adamant. 

After about the billionth time he announces his plans to sue the state he finally pauses long enough for me to offer some extremely helpful advice. 

""Well sir, I think you are being awfully silly. Clearly you should look into suing the deer since the deer is the one who damaged your truck.""

I smiled my sweetest smile and may have possibly innocently fluttered my lashes at him as I gave him his receipt. 

He didn't voice his thoughts on my advice but was still mumbling and grumbling as he left.

---------

I had been scheduled to secret shop a nearby fast food chain location, for the breakfast rush. This is a popular time to check things, because its a prime time for customers. 

So I get started on my order, this time I'm doing a drivethru one. I place the order, and the girl is actually...quite rude. Doesn't offer a combo size upgrade (this is HUGE for these guys), doesn't ask what drink I want, doesn't even tell me what my order total is. She just immediately tells me to pull up to the next window. 

Oh, this is a lovely start. 

There's like three cars ahead of me, so I sit back to wait, and it takes a surprisingly long time...about ten minutes. For a breakfast *rush*, this is **bad**.  As a baseline, you're supposed to have something like 60-90 seconds per car. I get to the window, and they just yanked my card out of my hand (another ding, they're supposed to greet you and tell you your total again), and tell me to pull up to the curb ahead, and they'll bring my food out when it's ready.

This is a huge no-no, because it screws with the times recorded for their drivethru. They're failing miserably, and they know it, so they start to do this to try and fake good times.

My order arrives another five minutes later (bringing this all up to...about 17 minutes. For a breakfast sandwich.), and I'm not terribly surprised to find out its made completely wrong.

I park, write down on the form what transpired, record my times, and head inside with them, and my sandwich. You see, for this particular one, I have to get manager signatures to confirm that I did, in fact, go there. 

As I went inside, I immediately just hear this...piercing laugh. The dining room's almost empty (not surprised, most hit the drivethrus so they can get to work asap), and there's employees chasing each other around. They spot me, and one of them does a leaping slide across the counter, and then grins at me.

....I held up the forms and the grin just...fell.

He called the manager on over, who was holed up in the back, and she scowled and muttered as she read over the form. ""Oh really. OH REALLY. REALLY. Oh look at this.... Someone woke up this morning with a stick up her @$$...""

...SAY WHAT.

I inform her to sign the form now, as I need to get back, and she does, then literally chucks my copy back in my face. 

Forget the sandwich, I'm leaving.

I stalked out the door, seriously angry at what happened, and honestly, annoyed at the fact that I'm going to have to rake them over the coals for this. 

Which, I did. I was straightforward on my report, didn't embellish, and I *still* got a call back from my rep, asking if I was telling the truth. I assured her, it was all true. She was shocked, but admitted that this location tended to not have the greatest reports. This one though, took the cake.

Fast forward a month, I'm asked to shop the location again, but this time, dinner rush.

I get things started as normal, did another drivethru this time (was in a rush, hehe), and they did a bit better this time. Still forgot to offer the combo upgrade, but the drivethru girl was quite polite, told me the total, etc. 

I drove up to pay, and hooooly cow. IT WAS THE BREAKFAST MANAGER. They'd apparently switched her shifts on me! GAH. 

She immediately recognized me, and started squalling. ""ITS HER."" Turning around, she grabbed a poor teenage boy working the drink machine, and yelled ""You handle her, I can't do this right now."" Aaaaand, then she up and left. I could hear her freaking out as she walked all the way into the back.

The poor boy was obviously super confused as to what was going on, so I tried to be as nice as possible. 

The shop went pretty well, all in all, so I went on ahead and filled out the report, and headed inside to get the manager's signature. I was praying very, very fervently that maybe Breakfast Manager was just working that night, maybe she wasn't the manager on duty.

Noooope.

It took them five minutes to convince her to come up front, and then she started cursing at me and saying I'd gotten them all in deep trouble. ""Do you know that you got two people FIRED?! How do you sleep at night!"" Lady, I'm sorry, that's not really my fau--""Oh sure, SURE it isn't. Stupid shoppers, they always pick a *itch to do them. Well here you go, hope you're freaking happy with yourself. You got us all in trouble, and now they're crawling up our @$$ because of you!""

At this point, every single one of the employees turns and looks at me with huge eyes. One guy pipes up ""That's...the shopper?! That's why the DM came down?""

Yeaaaaah, time to scram.

Made my second report, and again, rep called to see if I was making things up. Nope, it went well, except for that psychopath of a manager. My rep was floored, and informed me apologetically that since I'd been recognized so easily, I could never secret shop that location again. Honestly? I was relieved at that. 


Well, its been a long time since...and unfortunately, psycho manager still works there. I had a friend go in to check a few months ago, and yep, she's there. Does she still hold a grudge? Ha. Said friend's order was made wrong, and he made a joke about ""Well at least I'm not a secret shopper."" Apparently, the manager JUMPED at that, and proceeded to regale him with her version of events about ""the *itch who tried to get the place shut down.""

Yep. I can never go back now. :(

“I’m waiting to come.” I was waiting for a coworker before attending a meeting.

“She said it was a big explosion; smells funny.” Regarding the suspicions behind a property loss.

“Can you give me one of those french kisses?” “Hershey” was the word I was looking for.

“I didn’t do much this weekend. Just a huge dump.” That is, I took a large load to the dump.

“Was she happy with your performance?” Mild “That’s what he said.”

“You really need to be aware of what you say, and feel the butt.” That is, when speaking with customers, try and be more fluid when restating something, then offering an alternative. Part of what we call “objection handling.”

“Please get the crackers out of my area.” Said to noisily-eating desk mate.

“I’m having a hard time, can you reach around?” Said to a tech who was helping me install a PC. I couldn’t get to the ethernet cable.

I used to work Saturdays at a pharmacy doing some online work for them. To make me as useful as possible, my employer would make me stand at a work-station in the middle of the shop while I worked on a laptop. This was so I could help out my colleagues or customers when the shop floor got busy, which I was happy with.

The following happened on numerous occasions but I'll cite one occasion. 

A woman walks up to me, while I'm typing away on my laptop at the work-station, and just stares at me. On a bad day, when I am not up for dealing with customer crap, I pretend to not see people who do this until they say something. I dunno, I just think it's rude to just stand there and stare at someone. Anyway, these people will always stand and wait until I look at them. 
So when I finally 'notice' her, I instantly put on helpful shop assistant mode: ""Hi there, can I help you?"" 

She stares at me some more, looking a bit clueless and clutching her items. She dumps them in front of my laptop, 'Can I pay for these here?'

'Oh no,' I say pleasantly, like I always do, 'Just take them over there to the cash till.' That's when I point to the big 'PAY HERE' sign, that is visible throughout our little shop because it is so BIG and hanging from the ceiling.

Sometimes, as you all know, customers do not take kindly to their own stupidity. 

'Oh,' she says flatly, 'So what do *you* do then?' She does not say this in a nicely conversational way, rather a 'you're kinda fucking pointless then aren't you?' way.

I just kind of stare at her for a second, wondering why she is getting arsey because I cannot scan her items on my laptop. I regain my composure and start to reel off all the technical stuff I do online: running a foreign trading site, answering emails in a foreign language, and also doing some social media posts. 
It is important work, I tell her, because we do more business online than in the shop these days.

I was the fill in girl so I worked two days in Santa's House (he had to have a ""helper"" with him at all times to avoid any possible lawsuits), two days as the face painter and then one day in the shops. On days not in face painting, I also dressed up as Snow White and did the character actor thing while I worked because it was so much fun. Moving on!

I was working this particular summer day in the Girls shop (there were several shops for various themes) and my manager was a tremendous hag. All of the managers were older women who never had real jobs and just derped around this park their whole lives feeling entitled because they had control over teenagers. This woman, we'll call her Etta, complained constantly and while I was experienced in working the other shops, each is different and she never really trained me for working this shop.

Eventually Etta decided it was time to push off for lunch and leave me alone in the shop. Of course, this is the perfect time for awful tourists to come in. This woman walks in with her little girl and starts looking around. She soon finds some of the watches we have at the counter, little plastic and rubber junk things meant for kids with all kinds of colors and crap on them and they are expensive, like $10 a pop for this little junk watch. BUT, on the other side of the counter there is a tub which used to hold some kind of candy and now holds the overflow of the watches which don't fit on the display. The tub they are in is labeled with a price sticker the says $2. 

So the lady turns to me and asks what the difference is between the expensive watches on the display and the seemingly identical but cheap watches in the tub. I have no freaking clue and they do look the same because they are so she starts taking watches out, choosing one for herself and apparently all the members of her family to give as souvenirs. She's got a handful of watches and the shit soon hit the fan.

Enter Etta. She immediately sends me onto the floor of the tiny shop to stock and clean while she rings up our high rollin' watch pimp. Unfortunately, the watches were $10 each and came to over $100 so the woman had a fit and starts screaming about mislabeling and how the watches shouldn't be that expensive but Etta tells her the watches in the tub were mislabeled and the real price is $10. Lady starts demanding that they be given to her for the cheaper price because that's false advertising and that I had told her the watches were $2 (not true). She wants the discount and blah blah blah.

Lady eventually voids the whole transaction, puts all of the merch back and storms out. Nothing was ever said again and I swiftly moved the watches in the tub.

Back in high school, I worked for a coffee chain. Let's call it Barschmucks. We had all sorts of customers and a few good regulars, but one of our regular demographics was the elderly. We were located very close to a pair of assisted living homes and were in a community that's 97% white and whose average home value was $900,000, so we had quite a few grandmas and grandpas coming in. 

One trend I noticed was that the old-timers would often want their drinks hot. They would almost never order cold drinks and they would request that their lattes be extra hot. We'd often be asked to microwave drip coffees because 170 degrees ostensibly wasn't hot enough for them.

So one day, a little old lady comes up and asks for a Zen tea, extra hot. No problem, my coworker rings her up while I make the tea. On our coffee maker, there's a hot water spout. You know, those red levers that dispense water? Well in case you didn't know, that water is at an off-boil (~205 degrees). It's hot enough that you can't hold the bare cup whilst filling it, lest you burn your hand. To make tea, you simply grab a cup, drop in the tea bag, fill it with the water, top it, and serve it. 

I do steps 1-3, but while trying to put on the top, the wall of the cup caves inward and sends 190-200 degree water all over my arms and hands. This isn't the first burn I've had working there, so I dutifully remade the drink immediately.

I hand the lady her new cup of tea and apologize for the hold-up. She takes a sip, frowns, and asks if we can make it any hotter. 

I look at her, down at the blisters forming on my hands, then back at her.

*forced smile*
""No ma'am. That's as hot as it gets.""

oh_papillon,82,143,1qopj8,513,"Dear customers,

I'm going to have to ask you to please stop turning every problem you have in our store into a race issue. In case you haven't noticed, we live in a very culturally diverse area where it's pretty much impossible not to come across people of many different racial and ethnic backgrounds. The same is true of our store. Now, as I'm sure you noticed when you came to shop here, people of many different races and nationalities both shop here and work here. Whatever race you are, we probably have at least one person on staff who is the same race as you, probably more. We value all people and strive to treat everyone the same when upholding store policies and resolving issues.

Sir, I am sorry we sold you a defective phone. I get that it sucks when you're expecting a new piece of technology to work and then you take it home and it doesn't. And while you can bring it back and exchange it for another one, I get that it can be a huge hassle for you. But when you insinuate that we sold you a defective phone because you are [race], you are implying that the lovely people in our mobile department A) knew the phone was defective (they didn't), and B) knowingly sold you a defective phone after C) squirreling it away upon finding out it was defective, until someone of your particular race (that's you, you lucky bastard) tried to buy that particular model. Do you realize how ridiculous that is?

Look, we are a store. We like money. We're one of the larger retail corporations out there. We REALLY like money. Even yours. We would never ever purposefully do something that would cause you not to spend money in our store just because your skin is a certain color. We're too greedy!

So the next time we tell you that we can't give you the full price of the item you're returning back in cash, it's not because you're white/black/Hispanic/Asian/Arab/whatever. It's because you don't have a receipt, and them's the rules. For you, and for everyone. ","On the ""race card""",656
endersp,33,61,1qooq0,175,"I recently left retail to work at a better job, but im enjoying telling a few of the more horrifying stories just to get them off my chest. For the most part I loved my co-workers and they were the only reason I stuck around. Here's where it started to change

So back when I worked at the blue box store of evil I was a produce worker, also because I was brainwashed I had been convinced to take a ""unpaid leadership role"" basically as the fill in department head/ trainer in the department. We had a great crew and I never had to do anything other than ask someone to quick fill the major sellers in a section.

Our crew for the most part meshed really well and we were all nerds/geeks of some variety so we sometimes would get on 20 minute discussions while one person would keep going to the floor to cull/check for outs. The conversations were fun as hell, usually involving ridiculously stupid puns.

On the Friday before Easter our department head did a 2 am to 11 am shift so she could go to a family dinner, putting me on 8-5 as the big boss that day. We had new freight put away by 10 and the floor was 100 percent stocked, not a single out on the floor. As long as we patrol the floor and keep the lettuce and cauliflower rolling out were golden.
 
Any time you ever think everything is going to go well in retail, your wrong, so wrong that the record keepers of mount retail will use you as a cautionary tale ""here is Endersp, the moron who thought he was gonna have nothing go wrong before a Holliday"".

PROBLEM NUMBER ONE: the customer who couldn't do basic math! It is 11:54, my scheduled lunch is at noon, I hurry to finish my cart and get off the floor, along comes jumbo, now I don't use this term lightly, I'm 6'5'' 300 pounds, but this man looked like he ate people like me for breakfast, and his glare made me think of a person who has written off happiness entirely, in jumbo's hand is a legal pad, so yay jumbo knows exactly what he wants, if he asks me for help I could get him everything in like 12 seconds. He walks up to me

Jumbo: how many pounds are your white onion bags?

Me: there's 2 options, 3lb and a special 5lb bag that is only 25 cents more.

Jumbo: how many bags do I need for 9 pounds?

Internally my head is screaming with rage because I know this will continue the whole way through
,Me: you could get the 3lb bags or 2 5lb bags and have and extra pound for cheaper.

Jumbo: thank you, can you help me with a few others?

Me: absolutely sure sir!

We proceed to do this for 26 items from produce before my favorite co-worker El Hipster (his actual nickname, he was a Columbian born hipster) saves me so I can get to lunch.

PROBLEM 2: EVERYONE WAS HAVING TOO MUCH FUN!
1:15 I get back from my one hour lunch at chipoltle and everything is trashed! The veg wall is empty, the Apple orange section had hooles the size of me, and there was inner bag of potatoes on the shelf, this is weird because our closers should have just started making we should have a whopping 5 people not including me. I'm confused but I clock in and go to investigate, all five are in back talking about horror stories of an ex co-worker!

Me: HAVE YOU SEEN THE FLOOR!?

El Hipster: Na man, what are you doing back so soon, thought you were getting chipoltle?

Me: that was an hour ago!

He and angry feminist exchange a glance of oh fuck and run to the floor, get back in and look at everyone and hipster screams everyone get a load cart ready before assistant  dan sees this!

Now luckily I'm exactly the sort of person who thinks nite clearly in a tight situation, so I give everyone a section and help them build emergency carts and we scramble, 5 carts hit the floor in a matter of minutes, I build a banana rack cart and almost make it out when Dan walks 

Dan: what the hell is going on Ender!?

Me: (not wanting to throw anyone under the bus) sorry sir, heavy rush.

Dan: we put you in charge so shit like this doesn't happen, fix it in 20 then come see me in the office

So we get the situation under control and I go to talk to Dan and he gives me the whole ""your a senior employee (everyone hates it here so much 3 years gets you that tag) we trust you, if you want your own department I better not see that again"". I walk back to the department and there's no one on the floor again, only now everything's half filed. I walk in back and everyone's taking again

Me: what fuck!? I was gone 10 minutes!

El Hipster: chill out man your not the department head

Me: no but I sure as fuck get blamed like one, get back to work you lazy asshats!

I get through the rest of my shift, go home and watch Netflix, come in next day my time clock informs me I must find Dan, I go find him and we have a conversation about how I can't be abusive to my fellow employees and I won't be given a coaching but I will no longer be the fill in manager/ trainer.

Long story short, mother fuckers tattled on me after I took a bullet for them!

Takeabyte,7,18,1qomjx,35,"First off, I don't know why I'm telling the internet this. I don't know what it makes me sound like from everyone else's perspective and I fully expect you all to correct my spelling and say *TITS or GTFO* kind of stuff. I'm not perfect and I'll take any constructive criticism you've got for me. That being said, I hope you all have as easy of a holiday season as possible. Thanks for letting me vent.

-----------------------------------------

My current job isn't the greatest *especially* this time of the year. You know how it is. People are crazy, demanding, and rude especially when they don't get exactly what they want. Just telling myself that it could be worse doesn't always help. It's been a while since I've had an upset or angry customer and I'm exceed all of my goals right now, so I've got that going for me.

I'm surrounded by lazy co-workers who don't take their job seriously (not all of them obviously, but the ones that are tend to be the most vocal or cause the most issues). Even if it's just a part time retail job, you should still go and do it. I get it, the managers suck, customers are stupid, and you'd rather be doing something else. Hello! That's what nearly all a job is, a place to go do things that someone else tells you to do for money. While I may not like what I do for a living right now, I'm sure as shit going to do the absolute best job I can at it. I mean, it's not rocket science to ring up a customer with a smile on. It can be fun sometimes, not vary rewarding but at least I'm not unemployed anymore and I get to meet some interesting people.

Okay, on to the reason I came here tonight.

Today at the store I work at, I could see *that* customer from across the store... He's already made eye contact with me. Immediately, my brain recalls every interaction with this guy. Every purchase, every return, everything he's ever said to me. He's one you never forget...

*Setting the scene: It's busy, it's not quite the holidays yet but the sales have started and all the new people are being trained. We've got a dozen customers all needing help and only a couple people to help them. Children are running around. Mariah Carey's, ""All I Want For Christmas Is You"" is blaring through the speakers. The store manager is expecting every goal to be met and reminds me by saying, ""You know you're supposed to do (thing) right?"" Ya... thanks, nice to see you too.*

Back to *that* customer... but unlike the customer you hate, this guy is different. He is a genuinely nice guy who understands that I can't work miracles but he knows I will be honest and do what I can for him.

He tells me I'm a nice guy. I don't believe him but he's says it in front of other customers so maybe they believe him. I'm just doing my job. It's stupid sometimes but I signed up for it so I can pay my bills next month. 

He looks at me and says I'm an asset to this company. Am I? I sure as shit don't feel like it. I feel like just another retail junky trying to get people to buy more.

He compliments me. He says positive things to me. He makes me feel like I'm actually useful... I've failed at so many things it's hard to believe someone would genuinely say things like this to me. For one reason or another, it's hard for me to accept his compliments.

I feel guilty for not being able to do more for some customers. Sometimes the shit caused by other employees or by other customers makes it almost impossible to give the service everyone deserves. It's maddening.

After I've done what I can to help this one guy, he says thank you, but not like the normal, ""^Thanks ^^bye!"" it's with a handshake... no wait, he gave me a hug today, like a good friend kind of hug... He tells me I'm doing good things even though it doesn't feel like I am. I can't explain it... I just want to cry because deep down I know I'm just some random guy to so many other people. Just some random guy who can be replaced by a website and a call center overseas.

----------------------------------

There really is no point to my story other than to vent about bullshit. I guess I just wanted to say thank you to that guy for making my life just a little bit better. Thank you for always saying nice things to me. Than you for being one more customer I enjoy helping. *Thank you for being a nice guy.*

Again, thank's for letting me vent a little here. Have a safe and easy retail holiday, only six more weeks to go....

OmegasParadox,10,6,1qoi9u,27,"Hello all. Let me apologize for the fact my title is not a cool pun. I only manage a bar and restaurant not a fish shop.
Anyway, as I was just on my break a young guy approached the bar and said the pokie machine 'ate' his $20; rare but easily fixable problem. Notes that get pushed into the note accepter folds on the rubber tracks and moves over it into the machine itself. But not this time.

I looked up the top, around the back, and under the note stacker; nothing. He keeps saying ""you know I did put it in. Check the security camera. I did put in in there"".

It is the policy of the trust that owns the machines to never pay out when a fault occurs. So I tell him I'll take his name and number and call him tomorrow. Just before he leaves I looked at the security footage from 10 minutes before and guess what? Scam.

He is clearly seen looking around him, opening his wallet, touching the inside of it, not taking any notes out, and then touching the note accepter hole. So I asked for his id and he actually had given me his real name. Young and silly little man.

I didn't say anything about what I had found out. Instead I told him a tech will look at it tomorrow and I'll look at the paperwork tonight and to come back tomorrow and check up on it. Before leaving he also said ""So I can't get $20 until then?"". I'm hopeful he will regret it in his own time.

We have all done stupid things when we were young so  I'll let him off but if he comes back in to claim thin air tomorrow I'll be posting an update.

PaigeyPie,39,19,1qohhj,82,"So I work at a beauty supply store, that and being a cosmetologist has lead me to try different things with my hair.

My hair was bright red a few weeks ago, and many people would come in and compliment it. Occasionally, random people would come up, ooh and ah, and proceed to touch my hair. Wth? It's not even like my hair is long, people have to get all up and personal to touch it.

Now my hair is blue/purple, and I get a lot more looks than I did with the red, but today was awkward. 

I was helping this lady's daughter (I assume) and she come straight up to me and, without saying a word, proceeds to run her fingers through my hair.

Lady: wow, that's different

Me: (nervously) hehe.... *steps back*

I'm ok with touching, and I do like hugging. But why the hell would you go up to a random person and freakin caress their hair?! It's just fucking hair!

NotOnFile,20,12,1qoetf,38,"Okay, so I'm not sure if this belongs to TFR or TFTC. I have never been on the ""customer"" side of retail where something goes wrong. It is always a smooth sale..or that's what I though until I visited the chihuahua's hut. I have been going there *at least* once a week(more like two or three times...we'll blame it on the holidays.) I work a night shift and we get out late then go for a drink or two, and always finish the night off with a visit to that cute little Mexican dog place. I didn't notice until today when my friend pointed it out that **every single time** I go to the hut, they get my order wrong. Every. Time. It didn't annoy me until tonight. I started to think about it and found out that since I had to deal with those ""asshole customers"" all the time, I never made a fuss when someone got my order wrong b/c I would most likely always eat it, until today. It seems each time I go they miss two or three burritos on my order(I'm a fat ass, but I pay!) It's the same people each time, so I can easily blame it on the same person and it be legit. Tonight was the first time I checked my order **before** I got home(which is about a gallon of gas away.) My order was a gordita crunch, a quesadilla, and two beefy burritos. I was only missing a burrito, nbd. I tell the dude I'm missing a burrito and he just gives me this look like ""forreal it's a f****** burrito"" but he tells them anyways. No ""excuse me"" or ""one moment, please."" Eventually after much time wasted, he makes a new burrito.

Hobothug,21,39,1qodto,201,"So, I work at a big, popular electronics store in the US, selling computers. I've done this for about 3 years off and on, and it's been a pretty good job for me throughout high school and college. Aside from typical work BS, not very many exciting things happen at work - but, today was pretty special.

So, I came into work in the early evening, my typical Thursday shift, and everything went completely as usual. It was slow; the customers we did have inquired about our Black Friday deals, and I spent a good deal of time just making new price tags and doing other mundane tasks throughout the department. Nothing special. Sold maybe about 3 computers, whatever. 

So, anyway, I'm in the midst of my third sale - customers had just picked out their computer, and I was just making a quick joke about Black Friday when I glance towards the front doors, open wide and exclaim, ""Oh my god it came early"" as  40 or 50 people, all in a group, march in in quick succession.

My customers turn to look, and both they and I watch, mouth agape, as this huge group of people pile off of a bus and file directly into the computer department. The leader of the group, a loud woman with too many botox treatments comes up to me, and quickly says, ""These are all business teachers and I'm going to spend some time teaching them about technology, ok bye,"" before dashing to the middle of the department and asking her massive group to circle around her. They circled, and filled up the entire middle of my department - making it impossible for legitimate customers to get near the merchandise.

My customers and I just watched as she began loudly beginning to welcome and begin her lesson - in the middle of my electronic department. 

I was stunned for a moment - and then began looking for a manager; any manager - because god knows that this situation was beyond my authority. It didn't take long for the management to arrive. My direct boss picked out the group leader, made his way to the front, and was like, ""What do you think you're doing?!"" 

""These are business teachers, and we're with the State Business Teacher Club and I'm teaching them about the newest technology. We already spoke to a manager.""

""I AM the manager and you didn't speak with me.""

""Oh, no, I called and talked to a Diane."" (We have nobody named Diane who works here; total BS.) 

He was a bit dumbfounded and retreated, just as the store manager arrived on the scene. At this point, I made an effort to rescue my sale, and led my customers a bit away from the mob, to talk about MS Office - as they had some questions. 

Apparently, as I was doing this, our GM was on the phone, calling all of the other managers to see if any of them had given permission for our store to be turned into a classroom; with no luck. This lady just forced herself and her class onto our sales floor.

And meanwhile; she's going to town talking about products. She's not... wrong or grossly misinforming them, thankfully; but she is doing quite a bit of product bashing along the way. ""I would never buy an [insert brand here] computer; always pick [another brand]."" Loudly. 

And then, she decides that it would be the opportune time to talk about Microsoft Office - as I'm talking about Microsoft Office. She and her group descend on me and my customers; basically forcing us to get out of the way - and we took cover down the desktop aisle. 

My customers and I just watched, awe struck, as this happened. They made some quips about her Botox, and her rudeness - and then we moved to a register far far away, and I got them out of there.

And then returned to my department; where I stood at the corner looking distressed (I mean, it was the only space available) and tried to explain to unsuspecting shoppers what in the hell was going on. Management hovered nearby - shooting her looks designed to make her feel unwelcome, debating about whether to kick her and her group out or not.

She got the message, thankfully, and cut her lesson short - staying only an hour as opposed to the full two written out on their itinerary (I looked it up online after I got home - they were supposed to spend TWO HOURS hogging up my department); and then they got back on their bus and went back to their hotel.

Ugh. 

According to a friend who works at the hotel, when they got back, they were all complaining about ""the manager who asked them what they thought they were doing."" They SHOULD have been complaining about their instructor - who just led a humongous group into a store unannounced with the intention of using it as a classroom. 

Ugh. Agh. Ugh.

mycarebeardontcare,38,36,1qnzkj,182,"Let me preface this by sharing a bit of my medical history (for reference):

I've been battling fairly severe allergies since I was born. Normally around spring is when they get bad, but since the weather has been dropping (and rising) fairly out-of-season where I live (ex: it was 20 F yesterday, and the high today was around 50 F) i've been having a rough go of it lately with not being sick. I have also been battling a nasty cold lately, so combined with that, my nose can produce god-knows-what at any given moment. 

Where I work, we use iPods fitted with a scanner and credit swipe machine to check people out anywhere in the store. I'm in the middle of using one to check out a line of about four people, when I can feel what i think is a massive booger stuck in my nose. 

*""Oh, no big deal, I can run to the bathroom and fix it when i'm done with this next customer.""* runs through my head as i'm finishing with her. 

In the next few minutes of running her card, I can feel my nose running, in what I **think** is your standard nose run-off from having a cold. 

Well, no. Between suddenly not having a headache that I was sporting all day long, [my nose pulled one of these on me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeVfLOqtPR8) and I suddenly looked like I had been decked in the face by the ghost of John L. Sullivan.

I clutch my nose, give a polite *""exthuse me""* to my line, and rush to the bathroom to plug it up. I'm not prone to nosebleeding, so I take a few minutes to sit at my desk, lean my head back, and make sure i'm fine to get back on the floor. 

Someone was able to cover my line for me as they saw me rushing to the back, but apparently that wasn't enough for one customer. Oh, no. 

In the kerfuffle of me leaving the floor to take care of my nose, a lady in line had pulled the store manager to the side and exclaimed that I was (in no particular order):

-Rude and offensive to her because I wasn't able to check her out

-Disgusting because *""she [I] had a lot of nerve showing up to work sick like that""*

-Someone who apparently has no respect for others because *""if she [I] had bled anywhere near me, you [the store] were compensating her for medical bills if I had to go to the doctor to make sure I wasn't catching anything from your employees""*

Oh, and she was also mad because she wasted her lunch break having to wait in line for an additional two minutes while someone covered me.

auApex,22,28,1qnot0,128,"This will be fairly long as it involves several incidents that happened over a few months.  Quite a few years ago now I was working the night shift (9pm-5am) at a 24 hour bakery to save money for an overseas trip.  I had some of the most bizarre experience of my life while working in this place.  Some of this might sound made up but I swear it is 100% true.

The first story involves a night shift manager.  I worked with a crew of about five guys who were all really cool.  The manager was a bit different from us but seemed OK.  He was *very* Christian and constantly received praise from the owners for being responsible and a setting a good example.  

All was well until about five weeks into my stint.  The manager started disappearing for short 20 minute breaks, several times a shift.  This didn't really phase us because it was generally quiet during the night shift and his absence allowed us to play up a bit by putting on good music and sampling a few of the delicacies on offer.  However, unbeknownst to us the owners were checking in from time to time on the video surveillance and noticed the manager's absences.  It turned out this guy's sole destination during these breaks was the bathroom.  The owners kept watching him and discovered that he was taking a certain kind of adult magazine with him every visit.  So this guy was jacking off in the bathroom three to four times every shift.  I didn't really have a problem with that but the owners did and he was fired.

That was nothing compared to what happened next.  A few weeks later, the owners (husband and wife team) called us in during the day for a meeting.  During this meeting they informed us that large amounts of money were going missing during the night shift and they suspected that one of us was stealing.  Obviously this was a big concern and created a lot of distrust among our otherwise close team as no one knew who was taking the money.  

The real story behind the disappearing cash only came out because we all got together and called our union rep because we were threatened with dismissal and a police investigation.   Did I mention the wife was a raging alcoholic and also a gambling addict?  It turned out what was happening was the wife would get black out drunk at the bar across from the bakery, come into the shop and collect the night's takings.  She would then go to the local casino and gamble away everything.  The husband claimed she was so drunk she didn't remember which is why she was so adamant one of us was stealing.  This came out when the union rep told the owners he would initiate some sort of protective proceedings if they didn't give him footage from the security cameras so he could prove none of the staff was stealing.

The final part is more tragic than funny.  Obviously the situation with the drinking and gambling didn't do wonders for the owner's marriage.  Over the next couple of weeks we were witness to several late-night fights between the two at the bakery and got wind that the husband had left his wife and moved out of their house.  Because we knew about the gambling incident and were witness to these fights, the husband called us in for a meeting where he explained that his wife was mentally ill and going through a breakdown.

One evening at the beginning of my shift the wife brought in her two young kids for a hot chocolate.  It looked like they had been on an all-day shopping spree as the kids had bags and bags full of new toys and clothes.   Two evenings later, the husband came in for yet another meeting.  He was visibly shaken and very upset.  He told us that his house had burnt down the night before and his wife was inside when it happened.  She didn't survive.  We didn't ever find out for sure but it was pretty clear she had taken her kids out for one last special day before taking her life and burning down her house.  A very sad situation all around.  

At this point I'd had enough and quit my job there.  While looking for work a couple of weeks later I got a call from one of my former colleagues who told me to meet them for a drink as there was something they wanted to discuss.  When I sat down, the union rep we had talked to about the theft situation was also there.  Apparently while looking into the place he discovered the enterprise agreement the owners made us sign so they could pay us normal wages during the night shift instead of overtime was invalid.  As a result, the business owed us standard wages as outlined in our relevant industry award.  This ended up being thousands of dollars each because there was a clause that said we were entitled to 50% extra every hour worked past midnight and even more during Saturday and Sunday.  We eventually settled with the owner for a payout of around half what was owed but it was still a large sum and gave me enough to immediately buy my plane ticket and go overseas.  

All up, it was a crazy six months or so and not really worth the stress for a low paying retail job.  It sounds stranger than fiction but everything I've described above happened.  This was the last retail job I ever worked as I took an office job when I got back from travelling.  Thanks for reading.  

*edit* Shit, just realised I missed one very important detail. During this ordeal, the husband was banging the day shift manager who was a long time family friend and the wife found out. This was the main subject of several of the fights and us knowing about the affair was the reason he called us in for a special meeting after the fire. Knew I left something out of my post.

I am a sales manager at a car dealership. Basically, the way I function is: if you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. If you're an ass to me, I am smarter and I will screw you and you won't notice it. I think thats fair. 

*A customer, we'll call her CB (crazy bitch) came in to buy a car today. The car she wanted had an MSRP of 24,395 before any tag fees or taxes. My invoice on this car was only 23,976, so I didnt have a lot of discount room available. She comes in and gives my sales person a sob story of how her husband had just died and she was having a horrible year already... I felt bad so I gave her a price of 23,000 on the car, much less than the invoice price so yes, we were losing money on it already, minus a rebate for a competitive car (this comes from the factory. All I need is a registration of a similar car and she gets another 1,000 off. There is nothing I can do about this. You either have a registration or you dont)*

She then starts yelling at the sales person that she isn't trading in her other car. I get up from my desk and go talk to her. This is how the conversation went...

Me: Ma'am, I hear you have a question about the pricing?

CB: I'm not trading in my car!

Me: I understand. You don't need to trade it in, I just need proof that you own one, so your registration is enough. 

CB: If I give you my registration you are going to steal my car!

Me: No ma'am. I just need it to send to corporate so that they can approve this rebate. You can keep your registration, I just need a copy.

CB: I'm not giving you my car and I won't buy it until you take that off right now!

*she then went on a rant about how we were thieves, my parents should have aborted me because I am someone who is willing to take advantage of an old lady, the sales person was threatening her, she didnt want to work with the sales person because he is black, blah, blah, blah. I stayed quiet and pretty much just sat there, straight faced, for about 5 minutes while she went on.*

Me: Ok, I'll take it off. You do understand that if I do that, the price is going to go up, right? 

CB: Of course it is! because you're not buying my car! Do you think I'm stupid? (2 minute rant on how educated she is)

*I go back to my office with the sales person. Usually, when someone disrespects one of them that way, I kick them out. I ask him if he wants me to do that and he replied ""not if you can get me a good deal""... I go back to my desk and print out another price. Remember how the MSRP was 24,395 but I was willing to sell it for 23,000, 900 below invoice, and a 1000 rebate?... I gave her a price of 26,395 plus tag fees and taxes.*

CB: The price is different. Why are you trying to take advantage of me? Stop changing the price

Me: I took off the rebate because you didnt want it. I can put it back in, but the price will go down when you let me copy your registration. You don't want that, do you?

*She agreed, signed up, and went on her way.* 

*She paid over 4,000 more because she was a mean old lady.*

IronyJudge,24,22,1qn3uj,82,"Being in retail you grow a pretty long fuse. When you have to deal with the worst of humanity on a day-to-day basis there isn't really much that shocks you, and most of the time you know that it isn't personal and that the customer is just a total asshole.

For a few years I had some skin issues mostly localized to my hands. I had a hangnail which got cut on a bag of dog food, which then failed to heal and progressively turned into a bigger and bigger patch of scar tissue accentuated by the ridiculously dry air of winter. That lasted about a year and a half before healing up. Just as that was healing up I got a pretty good sized wart on my other hand, right at the base of my index finger. I got it frozen off, and then a few months later it came back even bigger. Due to the size and visibility of these I got a bit self conscious about them.

A guy came in one evening wearing a bluetooth . I got called in to help him figure out to put a harness on his dog. I love these ones because most of the time i show them and they give a look like ""oh, duh."" Most harnesses are ridiculously easy to put on. Bluetooth guy was asking about one of these.

BG: ""How do you get this harness on a dog."" 

I have a littke skit I to through pretending my hand and arm is a dog. As I'm doing this skit he notices the wart on my finger.

BG: ""DAAAAAAAAAAMN! HOLY SHIT! YOU SHOULD GET THAT CHECKED OUT.""  
Me: ""I have. It's just a wart. I'm treating it.""  
BG: ""Are you sure? Holy shit man, that's huge!""  
Me: ""It's just a wart. Harmless, sometimes itches. It's nothing.""  
BG: ""Shit dude. Are you sure that's not cancer or something?""  
Me: ""Yes.""  Side note, I'm relatively safe from a few forms of skin cancer due to my placement on the skin tone paint chart.  
BG: ""You should get that cut off.""  
Me: ""Did that. Grew back. Trying a different strategy.""  
BG: ""Okay. Man that's huge.""   
Me: ""It's not as though I don't know it exists.""  

I then continue to demonstrate how to put a harness on a dog, and how to adjust the harness to size. I'm pretty pissed at him by this point, but able to maintain my composure.

We part ways and I go back to doing dosing calculations for a fish tank with some ick problems, and he comes over to me again. 

BG: ""So how do you adjust it again?"" He's got a daughter of about 6 running around his feet now.  
Me: ""You take these little buckles...""  
6YOG: ""DADDY. WHAT'S THAT ON HIS HAND?!?!""  
BG: ""Fucking ugly that's what that is!""  

6YOG then screams at the top of her lungs and hides behind his legs.

Working in retail you grow a progressively longer and longer fuse. Then there are customers who grab the fuse, kink off the trailing two feet, and light it an inch away from your limit.

I took the harness, threw it at him, said ""Figure it out yourself, dick."" and stormed into the office where I told AGM (of ""She wants you to apologize"" fame) exactly what had happened including my reaction. She basically said she may have handed the harness gently to him and not called him a dick, but wouldn't have stood for it either.

To top it off, when BG bought the harness he told the cashier about the wart and that I really needed to get it checked.



A few months later after the wart had been slain (freezing + duct tape) he came back and had some questions about dog food. During the exchange he apologized for what he'd said. Some redemption, but he still marks the only time I've blown up at a customer.","Daddy, what's that on his hand?",104
FredFltStn,115,191,1qn3fi,612,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**OFFER:**  Thank you, thank you, and thank you, to everyone that’s taken the time to read and comment on my [stories](http://www.reddit.com/user/FredFltStn/submitted/). I’m looking forward to sharing more of the craziness as I gear up for the coming New Year’s Eve. I know it’s not even Thanksgiving yet, but as you can imagine, I get a LOT busier the closer we get to NYE.

I know that we’re all big fans of reddit. I’m particularly impressed with some of the great things that go on here, like /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, /r/Loans, /r/Assistance, /r/SantasLittleHelpers/, and /r/RandomActsOfChristmas/, to name only a few.

I know money is tight for a lot of people right now, but reading some of the stories on /r/RandomActsOfChristmas/ always chokes me up. Thankfully, I have a great job, good friends, and I’m able to provide for my family. I can’t even begin to imagine how hard it is for those parents that are struggling to provide a Christmas for their kids.

Since I started posting my stores and pictures, I’ve received several comments and PM’s from people asking to buy our company shirts. We don’t actually sell them to the public, since they’re kind of a badge of honor for those who’ve lived and worked the craziness first hand. 

Now I’m a big believer in Karma, and I wanted to do something that would encourage all of us to help out our fellow redditors AND kick start the holidays. I think I’ve come up with an idea. You help out a fellow redditor from the /r/RandomActsOfChristmas/ or /r/SantasLittleHelpers/ subs, and I’ll send you a **FREE PYROSPOT T-SHIRT**. 

**- HERE’S THE DEAL -**

* Spend at least $10 to purchase a gift for a child from the /r/RandomActsOfChristmas/ sub or the /r/SantasLittleHelpers/ sub. Make sure to read and follow the directions posted in the sub on how to do it.

* Post a comment to the requestor and let them know that you’ve played Santa. Please don’t mention me or my company in your post, because that’s not what playing Santa is about.  

* PM me the same proof of participation that you send to the /r/RandomActsOfChristmas/ sub or the /r/SantasLittleHelpers/ sub moderators, as well as the shirt size and a mailing address where you would like me to send the shirt.

* Bask in the knowledge that you’ve helped a fellow redditor out AND gotten a free shirt for doing it.

It’s that easy. Buy a gift for a kid, get a free T-Shirt. Since I don’t usually keep that many on hand, I’m actually going to have more printed up just for this. You can check out the shirts [here](http://imgur.com/a/NYx2C). The shirt is available in safety green or white. I’ll pay for the shirt and the shipping (continental US only). Would someone please call my accountant and tell him that this is all a valid tax deduction. 

**- RULES -**

* Limit 1 shirt or offer per person. I’m trying to spread the love, not outfit your baseball team. Sizes are Small, Medium, Large, XL, 2XL, 3XL. These are standard Classic Fit Adult T-Shirts, so order size accordingly.

* Continental US only. Sorry my international reddit friends, but I’m afraid the shipping would bankrupt me.

* Limited to the first 100 or so people who participate. I’ve seen how this reddit thing works, if I didn’t say this, I’d be printing up 30,000 shirts. It’s going to take several weeks to get the shirts in the mail, but I hope to have them all shipped and delivered before Christmas.

* If you try and scam me, I will post your mailing address in my next story. I should also remind you that I own a company that deals in explosives. Just sayin (kidding of course). 

* I get to change the rules or make up new rules if I see that they’re needed. That’s the joy of being the boss.

* Josh is not eligible for this promotion. 

The other thing I'm going to ask is for all of you to help spread the word. I would love for as many people as possible to know about this offer. Feel free to Facebook, tweet, or use smoke signals to let people know. Nothing would make me happier than if we ran out of kids who needed Christmas presents. 

Merry Christmas! Now go buy a kid some presents.

**UPDATED 11/22**

Thank you to everyone who's jumped in to help. We have about 38 participants so far. **We have plenty of shirts left!** Help us spread the word.

Thank you to redditor Thelittlestelf13 for starting a list of all of the families who have received little to no help so far. It shows the requestor username, number of kids and how many gifts each child has received. the /r/RandomActsOfChristmas goal is to reach 5 gifts per child!

insecure_shit_knob,18,9,1qmwmy,38,"So I've got some free time before my next class and I thought I would share something that happened this past Monday. I'm on my phone, so hopefully I don't have many spelling mistakes (thanks Swype)

I work as a lowly manager in a giant retail corporation store. This one I work at is called the ghetto store, and for good reason. It's been here for almost a decade now, and everyone I know calls it the ghetto-mart. It's located in the poor part of my city, and we honestly have about as many people on welfare as we do people who aren't come through. Not only that, but our employees are also called ghetto because they live in this same part of town. Now,I don't care of you're on welfare, my family has been on it too several times. I know sometimes it's hard out there, and luckily since I've been an adult I've made enough money to get by. But what I do hate is how some people who frequent my location act. Our store is notorious for theft. One of my managers told me that last month we lost around thirty thousand in theft, one guy even stole three tv's from us, he just put them in his cart and walked out. 

I don't need a job. I get enough money from financial aid and the gi bill that I don't have to work, but I do because I get bored sitting at my house doing nothing, plus some share change never hurts. I got the job because my gf told her manager about my military and retail experience, manager asked me to apply, and I was hired on as a manager in a week. I told them in the interview I didn't need a job, and I don't deal with customers or employees yelling or insulting me. They were fine with that, so that's how I operate.

So Monday, I'm helping out my cashier's and customers when I get called to a register. This customer (who I'll call MADA-middle age dumb ass) is irate that his movie is higher than he thought.

Me-""what seems to be the problem?""
MADA-""this movie is twenty dollars, but I got it out of the five dollar bin.""

I look, and the movie is Grown Ups 2, just released last week or the week before. It is not $5. I explain that to him, and that it must of been put there incorrectly, probably by a customer who decided they didn't want it.

MADA-""that's not my problem,I want it for $5.""
Me-""you can't have it for $5. It's a new movie.""
MADA-""I know you can override the price, give it to me for $5.""
Me-""I'm not going to do that.""
MADA-""that's not fair. It was in the cheap bin. This is bullshit.""

I asked him not to swear, and tried to explain to him that I can not sell it to him for that price. I apologized it was there in the wrong spot. His retort was that it's not his problem and he continued to raise his voice to the point he was yelling loud enough that an assistant manager came up to us, but she didn't interject into the conversation.

MADA-""if you're not going to give me the fucking price I want it at,I won't fucking shop here!""
Me-""ok.""

Right in front of him I cancelled his sale, put his items to side and started ringing up the next customer. This really pissed him off and he started yelling again.

MADA-""I'm going to kick your ass!"" And other threats.

My asm stepped in, told him to leave, and paged the operator to call the cops on a hostile customer for threatening me. The guy quickly took off.

I received no punishment.",The one where the guy doesn't understand prices.,47

We have this one guy who brings in a few cameras at least once a week. He's an older guy, probably in his eighties. Every camera he brings in is all crotch shots of him sitting in a chair in underwear. But wait... He's wearing women's underwear. Victoria's Secret to be exact. Each picture is him in a different pair of panties. Sometimes there's even a little ball action.

They were being very loud and had the GM on the verge of tears. The other manager, SM if you please, present walked up and looked at the insignias on their uniforms. SM grew up in the military and knew the patch. SM proceeds to ask them what the CO of their unit would think if he called them about their behavior.

This is bad for them. The managers can kick you out but one's CO could do so much worse. The General at the base was really pushing community relations at that time. Extra physical training and apologies were usually in order for this type of thing. Once SM mentioned the unit name they were out of there quick as can be.

alpha_orionis,19,25,1qmisk,97,"Hi from the Deep South, y'all! Today I have a short story about one of my managers who is really rad. Really Awesome Crazy Manager (who, for the purpose of anonymity, we will call Mary) is one of our newer managers. She's much younger than the other managers. At work, she's pretty tough, but fair. I love working with her. 

Anyway, the other night it was pretty chilly down here. For Mississippi anyway, 30 degrees is cold as balls to us. Because of the cold and windy weather, we've been slow for hours. Mary, our cashier, myself, and one of our dog food reps (let's call him Fred) are hanging out at the register and bullshitting at this point since we didn't have anyone in the store. Mary starts doing some overexaggerated leg stretches for a laugh and Fred starts to mimic her. 

""Oh wow,"" Fred says after stretching for a minute. ""I feel great. I could run laps now.""

""You and me!"" shouts Mary. ""You and me, five miles around the store! Right now! Let's go!"" And I'll be damned, Mary and Fred run full-tilt out the front door. The cashier and I howl with laughter. 

Within five seconds, Mary and Fred come sprinting *back* into the store. ""Oh shit, too cold, too cold!"" Mary says. The cashier and I are in tears at this point, doubled over and cackling. 

Later in the evening, still without a customer in sight, Mary's friends call to let her know they're dropping by. Mary quickly triple dog dares Fred to jump into a massive bin of dog beds and scare her friends. Fred, not one to turn down a dare, jumps his happy ass into the bin. Mary covers him up with a few beds a minute before her friends walk in, who didn't witness any of this exchange. On Mary's cue, Fred pops out of the beds and scares the living shit out of the group of friends. Big laugh, great night.

Heather_Avery,9,5,1qmi26,31,"Haven't posted in a while, but something made me remember this incident from when I worked at the girl's clothing store.


It was an ordinary day, and I was flitting around the store,~~deterring potential shoplifters~~ greeting customers and I came across this one lady with her two kids looking intently at our belt rack, which was located in the back of the store, in front of the fitting rooms.

The way our cameras were set up made this area a blind spot, so naturally the sales associates paid a little more attention to people in that area. She wasn't directly in the blind spot, so I wasn't too concerned, but I hadn't greeted her yet, so I made my way over there.

(Let's call her belt lady, or BL for short)



Me: Hi, do you need help finding a certain kind of belt? They're on sale now for $x.yz!


BL: Oh hi, honey- I've been looking for a belt since I lost all of my weight from my second liposuction surgery.


(It's not unusual for people to divulge more information than necessary to me, I guess because I look relatively non-threatening, so I just rolled with it)


Me: Oh, okay. Well you look great! Now are you looking for a thicker belt or a thinner belt?


BL: Oh, I'm not really sure, --But you know, I lost a lot of weight and then gained it back after I had my second child and had to get surgery again, so hopefully I don't gain it back!


Me: Well, I think you look great! (Trying to get back to the sale) What outfit are you trying to match it with?


BL: Oh, just for an everyday outfit to wear with jeans. You know, my friends are so worried that I'm doing too much surgery, but I think I look so good! They say I have body dysmorphic disorder or something. I mean, do you think I look too skinny?


(At this point, I realize that she wants to go into a long conversation about her surgeries, and as sympathetic that I am, there were other customers that I had to attend to, and I needed to find a way to gracefully exit the conversation.)


Me: Well I think this, this, and this belt will look really flattering against your skin tone and its a basic casual skinny belt that you can wear with x, y, z, or abc. If you like them, I can hold them for you at the front for you while you shop around some more. 


BL: Oh, I love them! I just love shopping for new clothes after my surgeries and weight loss, and I can't wait to get my tummy tuck so all the loose skin goes away.  (Keeps talking about semi-graphically about the surgeries with her very patient and well-behaved kids in tow)


Me: Alright, I'm glad you like them. Let me go put these up at the front for you--



And then Belt Lady moves in front of my path to block me from moving to the front to put her belts and continues to talk to me about her surgeries. Although she was a slender woman this lady TOWERED over me (I'm only 5'2 :p) and made me uncomfortable. I immediately went into small animal survival mode and frantically locked eyes with my manager C, giving her the HELPME SOS HELPME look, while trying not to get noticed by BL, who was yacking away. 


As soon as my manager noticed and came over and said hi to BL, the TMI switch in BL's brain flipped off, and like magic she waltzed over to the checkout counter and was off with her new purchase, raving to my manager at how helpful I was. After we checked her out, I explained to C about what she was talking about and how I was literally trapped. She laughed and said, 


""Sometimes, we have to be our customers' therapists too. Normally, it doesn't get that bad, but if it ever gets that bad again, let me know.""


My therapy must have been either terrible or amazing, because I never saw her again.

malnormalish,24,45,1qmfi2,214,"Hello all, I work for a crafts store that sells fake floral arrangements. This week, the fall arrangements were 70% off, but still had their 50% tags on it from the previous week. The managers had been telling us to notify the customers and override when necessary.


An old couple walks up with a custom floral arrangement, and this one happens to be a fall one, which wasn't ringing up correctly. So I tell them, ""This is supposed to be 70% off this week! Let me change this for you.""


Now it is important to note that whenever I'm about to manually change something I explain every step to the customer because I've had people freak out that I'm messing with prices, even if it's for the better. So I narrate as I go along what I'm punching in. 

""So I'm going to enter the original price and deduct 70% off of it"". The total came to like $12 or something, whereas before it was coming up $19 (I can't remember the prices that well since it's been a couple weeks but you get the gist).


Well I guess the old man couldn't do math because he started screaming at me to put it back. ""I WANT THAT PRICE TO BE $19.99! I DON'T CARE WHAT THE COMPUTER SAYS!!!""


""It's not the computer, sir. It was coming up $19, which is the 50% sale price, and it is supposed to be 70%, so I changed it. You'll only be paying about $12 for it now.""


His total came out, with some other stuff, to be around $35. He screamed some more about how he doesn't care and how he wants the price on the tag. I explained it to him several times that I was helping him out and getting him the better price but he was not having it. 

I call my manager up to void the transaction. All the while he's screaming, repeatedly, ""I DON'T CARE WHAT THE COMPUTER SAYS!""


The void occurs and I re-ring it up, keeping the arrangement at $19. His total comes out to over $40 now and he smiles the most condescending smile at me. ""That's better.""


Really, asshole? That's better? Your total last time was $35. You're paying more than $40 now. Even if you couldn't figure it out before, this is proof enough I was giving you a discount. Well, whatever, I don't care-- it's his loss. 


If he hadn't added that smug ""That's better"" at the end I really wouldn't have cared that much, but really? I was so tempted to hold up the void transaction receipt and outline slowly how he was paying more and just calling him out, but I decided against it.

FredFltStn,122,465,1qmc2g,1154,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  In Florida, we get our fair share of rain, especially in the summer. During light showers, it’s business as usual, but when the wind and the rain really pick up, we batten down the hatches. We lower the sides of the tent and use plastic to cover any shelving or product that may be getting dripped on.

One afternoon, we got the typical fast moving heavy thunderstorm with wind, rain, and lightning. It really came up on us fast, and we had a load of people in the tent shopping at the time. I grabbed all of my help, and we went crazy trying to get all of the sides down and boxes off of the floor before stuff was ruined.

We managed to get everything down and covered before we had gotten much damage. We did however get totally soaked. 

while all of this was going on, my cashier was still ringing out customers, and new customers were running through the rain and lightning to get INTO the tent. No offense, but in a lighting storm, **I** don’t even want to be in a tent in a parking lot.

Of course, that’s about the time we lost power. It was early afternoon, so we didn’t really need lights inside of the tent, and I actually have my registers on small uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), so they don’t cut out every time the power fails. 

My cashier is still churning and burning trying to get people out of the door. About 30 minutes later, the power still hasn’t come back on, it’s still pouring outside, and the UPS’s give up the ghost and run out of juice.

Not a problem. I was a boy scout, and I have a backup plan for my backup plan. My parents RV has a generator, so I can switch over my critical power to that if I need to. It does require us to reroute some power cords and stuff like that, so I can’t just flip a switch and make it happen. but it's doable.

My dad and I brave the rain and wind to start getting stuff ready for the switch. While I’m out in the storm, one of my employees comes out to tell me that they need me in the tent.

At my counter, screaming at my cashier is uber bitch (UB). She’s pissed off that my cashier has refused to ring up her purchase, just because the registers are dead. My cashier was nicely trying to explain to her that the power should be on shortly, and they would ring her up as soon as possible, but UB didn’t want to hear about it.

This particular cashier had worked for me for five years or so at this point, and her father is one of my best friends. She’d actually graduated high school, and was home from college on summer break, working for me. I always joke with her that she’s the boss, and I’m just there to do her bidding.

My cashier is keeping her cool, but I felt bad for her so I stepped in to try and defuse the situation. UB demands to check out **NOW**, because she has somewhere that she needs to be, and I need to take care of it.

I’m soaked to the bone, and I just want to get this bitch out of my tent, so I pull out my phone and ring up her purchase on that. She actually had a pretty big purchase, and when I told her the total, she didn’t believe it. She wanted to see my phone to verify. She then went down the list of stuff, at least 30 items, and questioned each price. 

When she was doing this, she actually found a mistake I had made. I had entered in an item as $9.95 when it should have been $19.95. The only reason I knew this is that she was making me verify the price item by item as she called them out from my phone.

You should have seen the look on her face when it dawned on her that the only mistake she found was where I had UNDERCHARGED her. I grabbed my phone back and happily told her I would fix the price for her, and then gave her the new HIGHER total. I should mention that the entire time, there’s a crowd of people around watching the scene, and a couple of them started to openly laugh when this happened.

When I told her the new total, she lost her GD mind. She started screaming at me that it was my fault, and that she shouldn’t have to pay for my mistake. In fact, she should get a discount for having to wait so long. I let her yell for a good two or three minutes, just standing there expressionless.

I’m tired, I’m soaked to the bone, and my dad is outside in the rain trying to get the power switched over by himself because of this bitch. I called to one of my employees and told him to put her stuff back on the shelf, then I turned to uber bitch and told her, “You’re going to need to go somewhere else, because you’re not allowed to shop here anymore.”

I turned to my cashier, in front of the customer, and told her, “Don’t sell that bitch anything.”

She left, screaming obscenities and threats the entire way out and into the rain.

**ONE YEAR LATER**


The same cashier grabs me from the floor and points out a customer shopping in the tent. It’s the same uber Bitch lady that I had thrown out the year before, and she’s shopping with three or four other people. To be honest, even after seeing the lady, I didn’t place her face. If my cashier wouldn’t have recognized her, I’d have never noticed she was there.

**CASHIER:** What would you like me to do?

**ME:** It’s up to you. You’re the boss.

The lady and her party finished shopping and got in line at the counter to checkout. When UB got to the register, my petite 20 year old female cashier stood her gound, looked her dead in the eye, and told her, “I’m sorry, you may have forgotten, but you’re not allowed to shop here.”

Stone. Cold. Baby.

The lady actually walked out of the tent without saying a word. I think she was embarrassed because she was with a group. In the end, one of the people in the group paid for the stuff, and they walked out confused as hell.

**PREAMBLE**

I’m taking a quick break from Tales from Finance to write about an event during my time working as a parcel sorter at the largest parcel delivery company in the US. After all, “peak season” is just around the corner (peak season being the name for December in the delivery game).

Welcome to San Diego Sunrise. I’m a young lad again. 20 years old and unbelievably fit due to handling around 4,000 boxes each morning. My job is simple to describe. Packages come to me on a conveyor belt. Then, based on the address of the package, is moved to one-of-six different convert belts. On a normal morning (4AM to 8AM), this is done by me around 4,000 times.

On other days, it can get worse … 4,800 times. As best I know, 1,200/hr is my maximum speed. For those playing at home, that’s 20 boxes per minute.

**THE GOOD STUFF**

Yesterday, [I wrote about an exploding lobster box.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1qjgz7/a_bad_case_of_the_crabs_er_lobsters_a_short_break/)

Today is somewhat … similar

If you ever venture into the world of buying “adult” products online (or from a catalog, if they still make those), you will typically see an assurance that the products are always shipped discretely in unmarked boxes and a generic-sounding return address.

And this is true. I’ve probably sorted thousands without ever knowing that below the cardboard lurks jackrabbits, Ben Wa balls, and cotton candy-flavored lube. And really, even if I did know what the boxes contained, I simply would not care. I mean, really, everyone has toys (even back in the 90’s), but we just didn’t talk about it then.

Now, when it comes to discretion, there is one way it can be ruined. The box.

In the case of the Porno Volcano, it was a pretty spectacular failure. Not because of any sort of flashy explosion; it was the sheer volume of pornography that was heading to a nice man’s house in an upscale ocean community.

So. Much. Porn.

The most perilous time for your delivery is just before it is placed on a vehicle and sent to your home or business. At this stage, it has been moved along a complicated belt system and now sits on a “slide;” a long, curved steel structure that serves as a temporary home for boxes, until that are picked up by a “preloader” and placed on the shelves inside the “package cars.”

It’s perilous because if the slide backs up, or there is a massive weight difference between a few packages on the slide, then boxes get broken.

In this case, it was a really bad backup. Packages that I sent down the line could not be put away fast enough, so the pile got bigger and bigger, until it backed all the way up to me. At this point, I have to move boxes “anywhere” to keep everyone else moving.

And then a large box was crushed open about a two feet away from me. Contents: VHS tapes; many many VHS tapes; lube; toys; books; magazines. DVDs were still a few years away, so none of that. So the contents spilled out and mixed in with all the clutter. And there is no censorship on the stuff inside.

For about fifteen minutes, my work station looked like ground zero for a Key Party of epic proportions. Every imaginable sex act and accessory was in eyeshot. I finally shot down the belts and started collecting the items in a tote. As soon as it become clear that I was dealing with pornography, everyone in the area wanted to pitch in. Not that it helped. It was like Easter for swingers. Every time an article was found, it was held up and shown to everyone else.

Lesson? I could have finished much faster on my own (pun intended).

Fear not. Everything was eventually collected, and a new parcel was constructed. The owner likely never knew he gave a few people an interesting morning.

And it was likely that, on this day, the morning wood was not a mystery.",”The Porno Volcano” or … Morning Wood - A Short Break from Finance,87
sexi_squidward,9,10,1qmamc,51,"I worked in ________ Cafe for a few years during my first couple years of college and I can tell you...people suck.  I have tons of stories I can share from the shitty management to some of the better customers.

But today, I will share with you Smoothie/Pizza Lady.  

I had the blessing of working by myself one night with limited pizzas though it wasn't a particularly busy night.  I just needed to clean and ring up the orders.  It had been dead for sometime.

A woman comes up to me and notices we were out of the supreme pizzas.  She VERY much wanted ONE slice of a supreme pizza.  She literally begged me to make more for her and I told her I could not.  

For one the pizza supplies were already cleaned up and put away and if memory serves me right, we had no supreme pizzas that day.  I think we were out of the veggies so the morning shift just made everything else.

This woman literally BEGGED me to make more.  I explained to her that we were out of the product and that I couldn't make more.  I offered her the Take and Bake pizza, which from the name you know you can take it home and bake it.  I explained that if she wanted to buy the whole pizza it would only be $8 as opposed to a $2 slice.  She could take it home and have left overs.

Well apparently this woman lived with her mother (who has to be elderly as sin since this woman had to be in her 40's-50's) and her mother doesn't have an oven to heat up any slices.

Ok.

She's still begging me to make this pizza that i have NO INGREDIENTS for.  Finally she walks away.  I'm like whatever and continue cleaning up the back. 

She returns with the Take and Bake pizza.  I'm thinking, ok, she took my advice and is going to buy the pizza.

NOPE.

She wants me to cook the pizza and sell her a slice of pizza.  I explain to her that I CANNOT DO THAT.  She whines a bit longer and finally leaves.  And she left, for good finally.

Seriously, this is over ONE SLICE OF SHITTY ______PIZZA. 

------------

A few nights later I was telling my co-worker about the woman and my co-worker was telling me about this woman who came late trying to get a smoothie after we had no more.  While we were talking in the back....SHE SHOWS UP.  I just DIVE to the ground and my coworker is like OMG THAT'S SMOOTHIE LADY and I'm like OMG THAT'S PIZZA LADY.

Now when we worked at ______________ we would shut down the smoothie machine early (by like 7-7:30...we closed at 8:30) because it took FOREVER to clean out.  It was the worst machine ever.  Of course that is what this woman wants.  She literally just stands there WHINING about how she wants a smoothie and how she wants us to stop the cleaning process (while the machine is filled with cleaning water) and make her a smoothie.  

NO.  SERIOUSLY.  

My coworker explained to her that we had run out of ice cream and that it was in the process of being cleaned out.  The woman just stands there and complains about how this happens everytime she comes in (all of 2 times since we were the typical closers).  

Mentally thinking, ________ is at the Mall...there are WAY better smoothies there than the shitty ________ smoothies.  (Except for when they had Pina Colada because that was the best ever).

In the end, she never got her smoothie though she may have gotten her pizza that day that she so desperately wanted the other day.  It's been a few years but I remember her.",The Smoothie/Pizza Lady,61
trevor_magilister,78,80,1qm8p7,305,"I was asked to run a different location of the restaurant I work in while their manager (at the time) was on vacation.  These are two of the notes she had up for her employees.

Jwright281670,48,137,1qm353,535,"It's my first Black Friday and I get to work at 5am at my clothing retail store. The place is packed with customers so I'm running the register as fast as I can, slinging sales, bags, and boxes. 

At this time we were a relatively small store in the grand scheme of things and we didn't have shopping carts. Normally not having shopping carts isn't a big deal because we happily hold items for customers on our large rack behind the counter until they are ready. On Black Friday that simply isn't possible. No carts, carry your own stuff etc. 

At 6am I'm in the full swing of things when a lady pushes a cart past my register. I was like 'hold on now, we don't have carts'. Looking closer I could see an arm poking out from beneath the clothes with a hospital band on it! Holy !@#$ there's a person under there! 

That's all the time I get and back to work until she comes to check out. Turns out there is a 300lb man in a wheelchair, passed out, still in a hospital gown (had on pajama bottoms), with his family piling clothes on top of him. Not just a shirt or two. But a few dozen different items. 

tl:dr Passing out in a wheelchair means you are now a shopping cart.

jorcoga,44,75,1qlxo4,341,"So at my fast food place we're selling coffees for a dollar (which is really cheap in Australia) as part of a promotion which has led to so many people coming in and being appalled that their one dollar coffee doesn't taste like a five dollar coffee made by a barista earning thirty bucks an hour (once again, do not underestimate Australian coffee culture). This one really sticks out.

We have two espresso machines.  One looks fancy, is visible from the counter, and is set up to look like it is more complicated to use than putting a cup under the spout and pushing the 'cappuccino' button. The other one is in the drive thru area, is out of sight of the customers, and looks a lot less fancy. The ultimate product, however, is the same thing.

After breakfast has finished for the morning. the fancy coffee machine shuts itself down and does not let you use it again until it's been run through a 20 minute cleaning cycle. The other one will flash a ""Please Clean"" warning over and over again, but it's still usable and we clean it as soon as the fancy one is ready to go again.

Enter the customer. It's 11:05 so the nice machine is beeping and spitting hot water everywhere and not being usable.

""Do you use powdered milk or real milk in your coffee?""

""We use real milk, the same stuff you'd buy at the supermarket""

""Are you sure?"" 

She's giving me the sort of look I'd expect from a police officer in an interrogation scene from some terrible cop show.

""Yep, it's real milk!"" I'm now brandishing a bottle of name brand milk.

""Ok, I'll have a latte then, but only if it's REAL milk!""
""Sure!""

I walk over to the drive thru coffee machine, which, I will reiterate, works in exactly the same way as the other one. I make her latte. I make it with real milk. It is indistinguishable in every way from a coffee from the other machine.

""Here you are, one latte!""

""I'm sorry, where the fuck did you get this?"" What. 

""From the other coffee machine we have in our drive thru area, because this machine is in cleaning mode and won't be operational for another twenty minutes.""

She's disappeared. Ok, that was a weird experience!

Suddenly there's a commotion at the drive thru window. That's weird, I have a headset and no cars have come through in about ten minutes.

Oh. She's staring at the coffee machine. Awesome.

""That one's different!"" Oh god. 
""Yes, it's a different model, but it produces the exact same end product!"" I'm yelling. I am not opening the drive through window for this woman, and my boss is *not* going to believe me if I explain this to her.

""There's no milk receptacle! You gave me powdered milk!""

""Yes there is!"" Now I'm taking the machine apart, and showing her a tub full of milk. This is not how I wanted to spend my Saturday.

""Well I'm not drinking this, you've done something to it. I saw you looking at me funny as I walked in!""

""Excuse me? Are you accusing me of poisoning your coffee?""

""Yes!""

She's off again. Fan-fucking-tastic.

Ten seconds later, I hear the great rally call of the understaffed fast food restaurant, the guy in the kitchen yelling ""You've got a customer!"" Maybe it's someone else! Maybe this is an elaborate ruse by a mystery shopper to see how far I'll go for customer service! I amble over, I'm in no great hurry to talk to anyone again. There she is. Oh. She's taken the lid off her coffee. Not two seconds later, I'm splattered in the stuff. I wish there was a better ending to this story, but we never did identify her (she was the only customer in the entire store at the time) and I never did see her again.

MagneTismen,28,88,1qlrym,396,"A [recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1qktu7/chili_chili_everywhere/) reminded me of a story from my time when I was in the fast food business. Some of my earlier stories can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/17zn7n/if_you_cant_pay_i_can/). It's been a while since I last posted, feels refreshing!

So I was working my 3rd (?) year in the fast food restaurant and was doing both cashier work and burger flipping. This particular Sunday was fairly easy-going and not too many customers coming in and out. Sundays usually meant slow business and thus, lots of cleaning/preparation for the coming week.

I was on the burger flipping side of the counter when I realised that we were about to run out of french fries so I did a quick check-up on what needed to be refilled and headed down to our storage room. This was the only time during the day that I was not in the vicinity of the counter/cashiers and was gone for roughly 5 minutes. When I come back up the three cashiers (new girls who had worked &lt;3 months) was standing scared shitless by the manager's office and one looked like she was about to cry. The following is a recap by one of the cashiers so I can't be 100% sure it went down like this but here's what happened:

A father (whom I had seen come in) had ordered a meal for him and his two boys (roughly 7 and 9 years old) and went on to have their meal. The father then comes back to the register and screams on top of his lungs that **""one of my kids cut their finger on a screw that was loose on the chair he was sitting on!!""**. He then proceeds to grab said chair and throws it over the counter towards one of our cashiers.

Yes, you read that correctly.

**He threw the frickin' chair towards one of our cashiers**.

Apparently it didn't hit her but I'm not sure that I would've been able to keep my cool if it happened to me, unless I would be too flabbergasted to be able to comprehend what just happened.

Our then roughly 150 cm tall, thin, blonde-haired shift manager who at the time was 16 and was the nicest person you could ever deal with then went out to have a little talk with said dad. On your shittiest of shitty days when you felt like putting your head in the fryer instead of the french fries she could come in and say ""HI MagneTism!"" and all your problems would go away. That's how happy and nice she was. Not today. Game face on.

She walks up to the dad and says with the most straight-faced and serious look I've ever seen:

**Awesome Happy Shift Manager:** Do you think that you, as a father, is setting a good example for your boys here by doing that? Do you think that behaviour is acceptable? Do you think that you're being a good role model?

His face was so red with shame that we probably got slightly skin tanned by his insecurity. He apologised for his behaviour so much I thought he was never going outside of his house again.

Still, the fuck dude? Anger management pls.

**TL;DR:** Anger management pls.",Let's assault the cashier for no reason,484
Yeah_Jordy,31,4,1qln4z,41,"I work at a video rental store. Today I had someone drop a DVD off and by the time I got around to scanning it in he was gone.

I open the case, and instead of seeing the film 'This is the End' that should have been in the case, I find a disc for a porn film.

Now it's my responsibility when someone forgets to put the disc in the case to call them up and let them know, but this made for some awkward conversation over the phone. I told him he forgot our disc and he sounded panicked and said he'd bring it in later.

An hour later he turns up holding this disc with this wide-eyed expression and I didn't even have to tell him that he brought in a porn disc; he seemed to be fully aware. He dropped off the disc, I handed him his lusty film and he muttered a quick 'thanks' and almost ran out the door.

Kellynn,7,13,1ql896,65,"I just started my new job at a makeup store. So far it's been a lot of video watching, but the other day I got to be on the floor shadowing the other girls and learning my way around the register. I love my job already. When one of my senior coworkers explained, ""Listen. If a client is being a dumbass, give them to me. If there's any question on a return, pass them to me. You can refuse a return, and if they're trying to make a stupid return, you tell them no. You're in the right."" I actually did not know how to respond. After working at my previous job (see all my previous stories) I don't know what to do at a job where they don't treat me like shit. I think I could hear a choir of angels singing in the distance because a miracle has clearly occurred. Anyway, onto the story. One girl is at lunch, so there's two long time employees and me, aimlessly following them around and being supervised on the register to make sure I don't blow the place up. So one of my coworkers goes to greet a customer. Now, our store is very small. It's a store within a store, so it's not like this is a huge place. I would guess maybe twenty five feet max in every direction, maybe. The perfume rollerballs are towards one side of the store, while the opposite wall is all of the bottles of perfume. All of these have testers as well. 

So the customer is at the rollerballs. My coworkers greets her, we're watching them interact, the woman is suddenly furious, and then the woman walks off to keep shopping. My coworker comes back over with a now opened rollerball. The customer had decided that since there was no tester of the rollerball, she would rip open a new one and use that as a tester. My coworker explained to the woman that there was a tester of the full sized bottle on the perfume wall, and the woman proceeded to start yelling at her about how it was too far of a walk and how dare she ask her to go over there to test a sample and why isn't there a rollerball sample over here?! Coworker is pissed and now has to damage out the perfume the woman opened. She leaves to go take the damaged item to the back. The woman continues to shop, then comes up to check out. I'm doing the ringing, my coworker is supervising to make sure I don't accidentally destroy the register. The woman quietly says ""Listen....I know she's not in here right now, but will you please tell that other woman when she comes back that I'm really sorry? I didn't mean to get angry like that, it was just I didn't want to go over all the way to the other side to test it. I'm just really sorry."" We tell her we'll pass her apologies on, finish her transaction, wish her a good day, and send her on her way. And despite her bullshit, lazy excuse, I am dumbfounded. A customer admitted her mistake. She apologized. I am convinced that a hole is about to open up in the middle of the floor and swallow us whole because there's no way this is real life.

This stuff is all important I swear. So I have this uncle who is very stand offish when it comes to his family socializing with the rest of our family. Our family is fairly close knit you could say. We have family dinners 3 times a week and we all live very close to each other even this uncle. However this uncle and his family are so standoffish that I only see them a couple times a year usually when they want to suck up to my other uncle who is loaded.

Since I have started working at this place this uncle and his family have come in to my restaurant twice and not once have they recognized me or acknowledged me. The first time I took their order and the second time I brought their food out to them. The second time my uncle even asked me to get some food that we forgot.

Personally I think this is funny. I mean I've had people who I haven't seen since I graduated nearly 2 years ago recognize me at work. This either shows how little he is around myself and the rest of our family or just how little he thinks of fast food workers like myself that he won't even acknowledge me.

Shortly after I started working there, only about two months in, I started working drive-thru. I would run the orders that were coming in for drive-thru and make sure they are correct. I grabbed an order and right when I got to the opening to the dining room from the counter, a man in a suit ran up to me behind the counter (yes, he went behind the counter) with a chili cheeseburger in his hand and started screaming at me, ""THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'VE ORDERED A BURGER FROM HERE AND Y'ALL CAN'T GET IT RIGHT.""

-momoyome-,5,14,1qkp0e,49,"I was out of work for a year and a half. I have a college degree and a few units shy of my masters, so I was fairly unemployable. Finally a high-end fashion retailer took pity on me and hired me last month. I get between 4-10 hours a week (usually closer to 4 hours) but at least it's proof that I'm being productive somewhere and a paycheck. 

The store I work in is in an outlet mall very close to the Happiest Place on Earth so we get a lot of tourists ready to drop big money on mediocre-quality clothing.

I love sharing stories of me visiting their home country and telling them what I loved and missed.

Now, let me describe myself: I'm young, slightly blonde, and white. I have zero Asian blood in me, I don't look Asian at all, and I certainly don't look Chinese. I don't have a sign on me that says I understand Chinese. 

The more she talks to me, the wider my eyes get. I finally moved her giant stack of clothing aside and said loud enough for her to hear me (and probably half the store) ""I don't understand Chinese!"" in Mandarin. I took a year and a half of Mandarin and I spent a month in China and it was the only thing I could think of to get her to stop causing such a scene. Wrong move, buddy! Hearing Chinese made her speak even *faster* and louder. 

I succumbed to defeat and started talking over her and in my broken Chinese found out she wanted me to hold her clothes for her while she went to the bathroom. Not two seconds after she left the store, my manager told me we were pushing payroll and it was time to clock out. Told her there was a woman who only spoke Chinese and was quite loud going to be back soon and to have fun with that.

Coolio23,17,23,1qkn9u,91,"First post here, but I feel like I'm cheating because I'm telling a story that my dentist told me. Ah, well. It's a good one.

**Backstory**: My dentist is the same one I've been going to since I was little (we'll call her Beth). She's a sweet old lady with big curly hair and a sassy attitude. She has a two-year old granddaughter  (this is important later on). Today, at my appointment, I also learned that she's a huge badass.

**Story**: According to her, this happened last week at her local gas station. As she was filling up her car, she noticed a lady who had removed the pump from her own car, but had not gotten back in yet. Beth asked what was up and the lady's daughter said that her mom had locked the keys in the car, and that her grandma was coming to give her the spare.

Right on cue, the grandma pulls up and hands the lady her keys. The lady unlocks her car and my dentist sees that there's an infant in the front seat. As Beth is about to get in her own car and drive away, she sees the lady remove her baby from the front seat and slings the infant *over her shoulder*, ready to drive away. Not in the back seat, not even in the front seat (which is dangerous anyways). Over her shoulder.

My dentist goes into full-on Momma Mode. She gets out of her car stands in front of this lady's vehicle. There's even a baby car seat *in the back*. This woman was just too lazy to place her baby in it.

The lady honks and screams and calls Beth all sorts of filthy names. The grandma, who was still there, joins in as well. Pretty soon people gather than there's a scene happening, and one of the gas station employees comes over to see what the hell was going on. Beth explains it to the young man, and he also joins forces with my dentist. 

The lady threatens to call the police on the two, but (obviously) they don't care, because that would solve the problem for them. She never actually called them. 

While the gas station employee remained standing (the manager joined the fray as well, wondering what the hell was going on in his station), Beth walks up to the driver's side of the car and tells this woman how, years ago, she saw a man do the same exact thing with his kid in that very gas station. As they drove out, their car was T-boned, and the child's neck was broken, killing him instantly. Beth said that she would never again stand by and let something like happen.

Finally the lady relents, and puts the baby in her car seat. She still half-assed it and didn't bother to buckle the poor kid in, but Beth noticed and made sure she did.

**TL;DR** Don't mess with my dentist when it comes to putting little kids in danger.","Tale from a Gas Station, or how my dentist is a badass.",114
CharlestonButterfly,40,63,1qkm3m,286,"This happened a few years ago at my first job in the mall food court (yes, I was one of those Asians shouting ""TRY SAMPLE"" at you as I pass you a chicken toothpick). Anyways, this job was pretty stressful to say the least, but none other was more stressed than my manager. 

One day on the job, it was like any other, but this was the day my manager would snap. A disgruntled customer came up to us to complain about something strange in her food and wanted a refund. This was after she had finished her whole meal, and the ""something strange"" in her food was a slice of ginger in from her orange chicken. We told her this, that it was simply ginger and completely edible. She wanted to speak to our manager to get a refund regardless. 

Turns out though, that this customer complaint would be the last he took at this establishment as he suddenly and loudly cursed her out. He just started swearing, telling her, ""FUCK YOU, I CAN'T FUCKING TAKE THIS ANYMORE!"" Among other loud and indecent phrases in Chinese. He paced around a bit, continuing mutter curses under his breath, when he suddenly ripped his uniform shirt off and just stormed out of the building never to be seen again. 

It was shocking to say the least, but I don't blame him. I quit shortly after as well, and eventually the restaurant closed down. ",Manager Meltdown at the Mall,349
KroipyBill,25,58,1qkgre,211,"A few years ago we had some spots during the winter that were rough. This particular day working at a large electronics retail store was alright. It was raining, which meant we weren't going to get snow finally. At least, not until the evening. 

During the times it was raining, an older couple came in (not way old possibly 60's or so) looking for a brand new massive T.V. I was assigned the task to assist them, and they were overall extremely generous and nice. It was over all a very pleasant experience showing them televisions, how to mount and hook up components etc. They eventually went the whole nine yards, by purchasing a Bose sound system with a massive entertainment system attached to a flat screen mount, and of course a Blu-Ray player. The entire endeavor was nearing $4,000. Graciously they paid for it, and were excited for taking all of these new things home. The TV was a 55 inch, and the entertainment center box was extremely heavy. I offered to carry it out to their car if he could bring it around front. 

As the husband began to walk out the door, he slipped and biffed it hard on the sidewalk. I noticed there was a little bit of snow falling (as it was later in the night) but didn't think much of it. As I rushed out to help him, I too slipped and fell. I got up, helped the husband up and looked out onto the massive parking lot. The light glare showed me how the parking lot was now one massive sheet of ice from the rain. 

**Husband:** Man I didn't think it froze that quickly

**Me:** Yeah that's really insane...

I began to contemplate how we are going to get this stuff out to his car. The lot was sparse as we're nearing closing time. And his poor wife. She'd probably eat it hard. I helped the husband up as best as possible, and we both walked inside. 

My manager came over, and we began to discuss the situation. 

**Manager:** Looks like if you carry that stuff you'll get workers comp and maybe die. 

**Me:** Thanks for your concern you're like a father to me

**Manager:** So, how are we going to get all of this crap out of here? 

I looked over at one of the floor carts. 

**Me:** Dude...I need a long, hard object. 

**Manager:** Ha my wife says that to me sometimes too!

**Me:** No stupid I need like a pole or something. 

**Manager:** Why? 

**Me:** I think I'm going to ""row"" a floor cart with some of his stuff out there. 

Manager looks at me wide eyed, shakes his head, smiles, and gets me a 4 foot or so long PVC pipe. 

I first started with the heaviest object which was the couple's entertainment center. I felt the weight would probably help me with traction. I knelt on the cart, placed the entertainment center on it, and began using the PVC Pipe to row it out to the customer's car. He unlocked it using his remote after he saw me get there, while losing all control with his laughter. I crawled into his car, and from the back of his car I pulled the entertainment center in. I rowed back, and put the TV and Blu-Ray standing on the box's side. This was tricky, as I had to row my slippery cart to his car while holding onto the TV. Thankfully I managed, and the customer graciously gave me the keys so I could drive his SUV to the front of the store for his wife and entertainment center. They both drove off laughing and extremely happy of the outcome. Needless to say, my manager was excited to see what lengths I'd go at to land a sale, even if it meant an icy death.

whereismypassport,12,18,1qke7l,102,"I worked at a dry cleaning chain about half a year ago. I have since gotten a better job elsewhere, but every now and then I get to thinking of all the ridiculous customers I had during the time.


One night I was working the entire shop alone when a lady walked in. The first thing she asked me was if I was alone because some other workers were familiar with her. I told her it was just me there that night. She proceeds to ask if I had heard of her and her ""situation.""


The lady tells me that she had used our services a while back for a lot of her clothes after her house was found to have a mold problem. Apparently, her insurance was covering the dry cleaning bill because all the belongings in said house were contaminated and a serious threat to her well being. 


So, not that complicated of a situation, but when I ran up her name on the computer, it turns out that she had brought her stuff in over a year ago. Apparently, at some part of our dry cleaning process, the contaminated clothes had gotten even more contaminated, possibly with some sort of radioactive chemicals. Okay… well then. Because that's totally possible and everything.

She then tells me that her stuff should be somewhere in the shop, possibly in a cardboard box with her name on it. She insists on walking behind the counter and looking around for herself (obviously, not allowed). At this point I ask her to give me a moment to call my boss. He tells me there should be a box just as she described in the back of the shop. He also advised me to remain ""very patient"" with this individual.


I find the box, hand it over to her and she approaches it with extreme caution. What happened next was like straight out of a candid camera show. She pulled out gloves from her purse and demanded to go through each article of clothing – me as a witness by her side – and write down observations of them in a notebook she brought. Some clothes appeared to trigger no ""symptoms"" in her, others made her make strange sounds and movements and facial expressions. I was watching this nonsense happen in front of me for at least an hour. She would describe in such detail just how she would start feeling nauseous and light headed and tingly in her toes. I couldn't help but raise my eyebrows every once in a while, especially when she had me sniffing a hat and asking me if I could smell any type of abnormal chemical or if it made me feel strange in any way. Every time I simply replied ""No, it seems perfectly fine to me."" I loved he way she looked at me as if I was the one with an issue.


I asked if she would like to take any of the clothing home with her, she looked at me with utter seriousness and said ""Well, I would have to burn the car down after that, so I would rather not… a lot of my other belongings have already suffered that same fate.""

Anyway, due to demand, we have to work overnight weds to set up the event stuff, then come back 530 Thursday for ""Black Friday"".

People were waiting outside the day after at 430 in the damn morning. (We reopened at 6).

apple_crumble1,52,15,1qk89v,60,"For those of you who don't know, mystery shopping or secret shopping is when a company hires an outsider to go to a particular branch of their store on a specific date to pretend to be a customer and scope out whether the correct stock/promotions are in place, employees are upselling as required, and that customer service is at the standard expected.

Usually the shopper will get paid a set fee, or if they need to make a purchase to evaluate customer service they will get reimbursed for the costs and get to keep the item, or a combination of both. It's pretty fun to do, you get paid, and sometimes you get to score awesome free stuff. I have about $1500 worth of free stuff from this, gained over the past year, from a doughnut to a pair of expensive sneakers.

So one time, I had accepted an assignment at a store that sold nothing but expensive (but really cute) T-shirts. For this job, there was no set fee, but I'd be reimbursed up to $40. So I did the job, it was easy, I got a cool T-shirt out of it. I submitted my assignment with a scan of my receipt to prove that I spent $40 on that specific day at that specific store.

I got an email back from the mystery shopping website saying that I had completed the assignment on the wrong day, and thus wouldn't be getting paid. After some back and forth emailing, it turned out that they had the wrong date on the site, which they corrected. But they still maintained that I could not be paid for doing the assignment on a different day to the one they wanted. Now I have enough money to pay upfront for this stuff and not starve while I'm waiting for reimbursement - but I'm not rich enough that it doesn't hurt to see $40 gone on a T-shirt I never would have bought unless it were free (I rarely spend that much on a single T-shirt).

My only alternative would be to go back to the store on the correct day, return my item and buy another item (and evaluate customer service again). But I somehow had to do this without the return showing up on the purchase receipt; and I had to pay for it in cash/card, not store credit.

So the day rolled around, and I made the mistake of coming to the counter and saying to the guy behind it, ""I want to return this T-shirt, it wasn't in the correct size.""

Guy: (pleasantly) Oh, well I'm sure we can find the correct size for you and then we'll exchange the items.

Me: (Uh-oh) No, could you process the return for this one please? And then I'll pick out another one.

Guy: (still pleasant) It'll actually be a lot easier to process it as an exchange and get you $40 store credit to spend on another T-shirt.

Me: (think, think!) But I'm not sure if I'll buy anything.

Guy: (endlessly patient) Well, how about you have a look around, and if you don't see anything you like, we'll process the return, and if you do, we can exchange the two.

Me: (panicking now, pretty sure I had a crazy look in my eyes by now) No, I'd really prefer for you to process the return now.

Guy: (smile gone) OK, let's see your receipt.

(then followed a LOOOOOONG process in which he entered the receipt number, verified my purchase, asked for ID, got me to recite my address from the ID, put that and my name and phone number into the system, etc. This lengthy process must have been to prevent employees from processing non-existent returns and keeping the cash. By the end I could see why he hadn't wanted to do it when there was a simpler alternative)

And after I put the poor guy through this I then had to ask him inane questions about the T-shirt designs, materials, etc. to assess his product knowledge. So here I was, having forced him to do a lengthy and unnecessary return because I 'wasn't sure if I wanted to buy anything', only to turn around and ask him specific questions as if I was very interested in the brand and the products.

Then of course I selected another $40 T-shirt and brought it up to the counter for him to ring up.

Now he was very professional, but I could tell he was inwardly frustrated/raging. He smiled tightly and said, ""See, I told you it would have been easier to just exchange these.""

I apologised, grabbed my receipt and ran out of there. I'm sure I will form one of his 'crazy unreasonable customer' stories, and I have been too embarrassed to set foot in that store again.

Any of you recognised that you had a mystery shopper in store? Any funny stories/interesting experiences? And what, if any, were the repercussions?

yessircapntightpants,69,104,1qk546,588,"I used to work for a video store, which is this thing that used to exist that was kinda like Netflix, except a Netflix you could walk inside.  I was a Shift Leader (one step below assistant manager) and was working with my coworker, whom we'll call Dave, on a very busy Friday night.  Dave was the sweetest, most mild-mannered person I ever met.  Chipper and mellow and genuinely happy to be doing his menial, thankless job.  

Friday nights at the video store were always a chaotic mess from about 6:00pm to 10:00pm.  Huge lines of people wanting movies for their weekend viewing pleasure, and a very limited number of cash registers and employees to ring them up. The store I worked at had a fantastic Store Manager, and as a result, incredibly low turnover. Everyone there knew what they were doing, and we moved the crowds out fast, provided no customer insisted on being difficult and taking up a register for ten minutes while they tried to figure out what phone number or name they put their account under or something like that. 

So one particularly crazy Friday Dave and I are working the registers up front, doing our usual hustle to get through the hordes of movie-renters, when in walks The Horrible Bitch (THB from here on out).  She had the sort of tan that one can only achieve by laying around and barking orders at the pool boy all day, every day.  Her bleach blonde hair was teased to near-Jersey Shore levels, and her acid-wash skinny capris screamed, ""I regret becoming an adult and am actively attempting to revert to my teenage years, despite clearly pushing 40.""  The dead, yet somehow angry, look in her eyes was both haunting and repulsive.  She had three boys with her, ranging in age from roughly four to nine-years-old, and she gave the impression that motherhood was the worst decision she ever made.

She didn't bother us while picking out movies, and while she was curt and generally shitty to Dave while he rang her up, she wasn't an exceptionally bad customer. Dave was his usual sweet self, and managed to get her rentals in order while she alternated between rolling her eyes at him, making heavy sighing noises before answering questions, and screaming at her kids to PUTTHATCANDYBACKRIGHTNOW!  

If you work retail, you know that these sorts of customers barely phase you.  Sure, they're unpleasant, but if they're not actively yelling at you and causing a scene, you just kinda assume they had a bad day and try not to make it any worse.  Dave handed her the movies she rented and wished her a pleasant evening as she left, and then went back to ring up the next customer in the incredibly huge line. 

Less than thirty seconds later THB angrily storms back in, clearly looking for something.  Dave sees her and asks if she forgot something, and she snaps that she left her keys on the counter.  Dave checks the counter, and also the space behind his register and around the cash-wrap, but doesn't see any keys. While still ringing up other customers, he asks me and the other people working that night if any of us have seen a set of keys.  No one has.  A couple of helpful, generally nice people waiting in line even hear this and do us a solid by looking around the front area (since we can't really come around when there's a huge line of customers).  No one sees any keys. 

Dave is trying to helpful, but he has other, less horrible customers who need his attention, so THB winds up storming around the cash-wrap area, searching for her keys amongst the display cases that line the registers. This wouldn't be a problem, except that she's searching by pulling all the product down from its neatly organized POP space and just leaving it in piles on the floor or the counter. We're busy, and she's clearly ready to explode, so we don't even try to stop her.  We both know it'll be easier to just clean up her mess than it would be to try and reason with her.  

After tearing our cash-wrap displays apart, she starts loudly accusing us of hiding her keys out of spite.  Maybe she's seen Clerks, and maybe she's fully aware that she's an unpleasant bitch to the Plebians that ring up her purchases, but she's become absolutely certain that we threw her keys in the trash. She demands that we dig through the trash RIGHTTHISSECOND and give her back her keys. We explain that we haven't seen her keys, and we certainly didn't throw them away. Dave even takes a moment away from his register to show her the small trash bin we keep up front, which is almost empty and clearly doesn't contain any keys. 

THB is not satisfied.  She wants us to check the big, outdoor trash can by the door.  Despite the fact that her truck is parked right in front of the store, and that no one could have thrown her keys away in that can without her seeing them, she is insistent that we drop everything and go pick through the garbage. Honestly, if it were a slow time and there weren't any other customers waiting, one of us probably would have thrown on some gloves and just done it. Years of retail make you highly likely to do something you know is stupid, because it's always easier than trying to convince a customer that their request is, in fact, stupid.  It's Friday night though, and there's no way we're closing a register to placate her obvious personality disorder. 

She storms out again, and Dave looks out the window a minute later and informs me that she has dumped out our outside garbage, right in the middle of the sidewalk, and is forcing her children to dig through it.  Nothing like adding a little child-labor to your harassment of innocent retail clerks to really take things up a notch.  He mentions that she's probably going to leave that mess there, and he's not wrong.  THB gets a cab or a ride home from someone, so the next time we look outside she's gone, leaving only a pile of video store garbage and her shiny new truck in her wake. 

Later that night, after close, we're doing our standard restocking and straightening of the concessions out front, when Dave yells for me.  I look up and he's pulling a set of keys out one of the candy bins.  The same candy bin that THB's child had been digging through before she started screaming at him like a volatile harpee. Now, I don't know if said child just happened to drop the keys and forget, or if it was purposeful revenge for the screaming, or if he realized that he'd dropped them but was too terrified of his psychotic mother to speak up, but either way, her keys had been there the whole time.  

Without a word Dave took the keys and walked out to the parking lot, where THB's shiny new red truck was still stranded.  Because Dave was such a nice guy, I assumed he was going to toss them in the back and maybe throw a note on the windshield or something.  Instead, I watched him hold the keys in his hand and slowly gouge a scratch from the back of the tailgate to the front headlight, and then throw those keys in the same trashcan that THB has upended during her rage.  

He walked back in, saw me staring and said, ""Bitch made me pick up garbage. Fuck her and her keys."" And with that he quietly resumed his closing duties.

NotOnFile,15,11,1qk1mr,49,"Okay so I'm about to explode. I'm just ranting, sorry for this word vomit. She's just getting the best of me. I have the worst partner ever.
I'm a manager at a grocery store and at nights we have two managers. I normally do the paperwork and the other(X) is supposed to work the floor. I always do paperwork bc she never stays on top of it. Basically she takes two hours after the store closes and it takes me only fifteen minutes. For some reason beyond me, I often feel bad about the way I feel towards her. Like I can't stand her being a manager bc I didn't like her to begin with. Then she does me this huge favor to remind me how much she sucks.

She just became a manager in July and it took her two months to train. Two. Months. Anyways, my old partner(who was a great worker) got another job so that means I need a new nighttime partner. This means I get X. Mind you, she has had two months to train so I expect her to know as much as I do(I had one week to train...during holidays). 

**Day 1:** So, I'm doing my paperwork in the office and up comes X who just plops down next to me letting out this dull sigh. ""There's nothing to dooo.."" Now she was a cashier on my shift before she became a manager and knows this is NOT what you tell me. Plus, I cannot stand when I'm working and you want to sit there and watch me work? No, there is always something to do and if you disagree, I will happily find you something to do which is exactly what I did for her. She learned quick to stop saying there's nothing to do.

**After a couple days:** So she's learned to not come in the office while I'm working. She has started avoiding me at this point. This one night I was ahead on my paperwork so I decide to fill my time with productivity. I go check to make sure the necessities are being stocked by our bagger. Nothing has been done. I am a huge douche bag to those who think they are above doing ""grunt work."" Don't want to do it? Get off my shift. GO AWAY. So I find them, I'm pissed. They notice I'm pissed. They take the hint and start working the hardest they've ever worked.

**About a week after(you would think she'd learned by now):** As a manager, you do not get formal breaks here. It's short shifts anyways(7 hour shifts). Everyone else gets a ten minute break every two hours. When there are two of us, we can take turns going to the back to eat once everyone else is back from their breaks. So everyone comes back from their breaks and I'm helping a customer so I just tell X to go ahead and go eat b/c it's the beginning of the month and we're about to get slammed. As predicted, they all come rushing in at once and everyone including me is on a register. Where's X? I can't worry about that right now, I have a line of customers and there are two people at the courtesy booth(managers only are allowed to go in the booth). I call her up to deal with the booth and go about my customers. By the time we finish the rush(about five minutes), the customers at the booth still aren't serviced so I go fix them up. Ten minutes pass and still no X and we get another rush. This goes on for about forty more minutes with me constantly calling her b/c I have no time to go on a wild goose chase. Finally we slow down and I am pissed. Not once did she come up when she was called. I'm behind on paperwork, customers are still coming in packs and packs and there's no ******* X. I go all around the store looking for her, giving her the benefit of the doubt that she is in the warehouse where she can't hear the intercom. My last spot to look is the break room and there she is with her feet propped on the table, her music blaring playing on her phone. I give her one deadly stare as she takes her feet down and turns her phone off acting like she wasn't on it(no phones allowed). 

Me: You done with your vacation?

X: Yea girl what you got?

She follows me into the office and once we are alone, I go off. I have a short fuse and this girl knows how to light it. 

""You're supposed to be setting an example for your fellow employees as a manager and you want to screw everyone over by getting paid to sit there and play on your phone while we are working our asses off? Are you kidding me? If I see you in the back one more time, any day of the week where you are supposed to be elsewhere, I'm clocking you out and I'm tearing your card up. I'm done with having a shit partner who wants to sit there and cry when she gets a raise but when it comes to physically showing them how thankful you are for everything they do for you, it's the end of the world. Hell no. If you don't want to work then g. t. f. O."" 

This catches her off guard. She runs off and doesn't stop working until I turn the lights off. I found out the next day I had made her cry.

The next day went okay. She's slow, but she worked. I told her I don't like being a bitch, but I can't stand people who don't work. There are plenty other people out there who will work their ass off if they were in her position. She says it's okay and we have a good day.

**Beginning of last week:** She takes another long break(20minutes). I warn her if she doesn't start doing something, I'm gonna pull her card. She finally comes out and starts ""looking busy."" That doesn't fly with me, but I just told her to hustle. She needs to step up her game. This doesn't do much help, but I do not want to explode again.

All of our bosses know what's going on so there's no one else to report it to, I'm so tired of babysitting this chick. Holidays start next week and if she doesn't step it up, I'm going to A-bomb her ass real quick. We're about to start handing out turkeys to all the plants workers(we hand out probably around 1,000 per holiday. Excluding hams and doubles). I do not see the rest of this year being a good one.

She looks at him for a second and says ""Just making sure you weren't dead."" and walks away.

A description of Jen and John. Jen and John are both around 5'2"" and 200 lbs. Jen has wispy white hair that falls past her shoulders and wears way too much makeup. John is balding and always wears the same thin jacket with jeans.

A month or so later Jen and John are back, with John in the wheelchair and Jen at the makeup counters trying everything on that they would let her. She is starting to look like a clown she has so much on. Tired of that, she comes over to Men's to check out our deals. I greet her with the standard ""Hello! Is there anything I can help you with today?"" She walks over to me without look at me for more than a second and says ""Yeah, baby what ya'll got on sale? Anything good?""(she calls everyone baby) I go through my normal rounds of stuff and she goes the clearance racks yelling ""JOHN, OVER HERE JOHN."" The man sighs, gets up and walks over to her and she starts thrusting clothes at him to try on. With defeat in his eyes he takes the clothes to the fitting room.

The next month I learn that Jen may not be as innocent as she looks. My boss asks me to see if I can get a peak in her purse. She is at the racks at this time with a very large purse on her shoulder. I walk over and talking to her begin to organize the racks next to her. Nothing unusual in the purse.

I don't get to see Jen or John this time but the story circulated quite quickly that she was caught in the women's bathroom ""washing herself"" in front of the mirror.

By this time Jen and John are a normal sight but Jen is really annoying with her constant ""Baby, does this look ok? Baby what about this one?"" Now this wouldn't be a big deal if she would listen but she rarely bought anything. John would sit at the front door hogging the wheelchair and when someone would ask him where Jen is, he would say ""Somewhere between lost and found huhuhu."" Rumor has it they may be homeless?

Another month and Jen and John are in the store when over the intercom it is announced that there is car on fire in the parking lot. Naturally is is Jen and Johns. Fire department comes etc. Jen keeps shopping while John looks defeated. One of the managers gives them a ride home.

The last memorable account I have of Jen and John. Jen is shopping in Men's clearance, which I can see from my vantage point at the register. A few customers are in line and I am busy ringing them up, going through the motions. John just starts screaming at Jen out of seemingly nowhere. ""I'M NOT TRYING ON ANOTHER !@#$% PIECE OF CLOTHING YOU CRAZY !@#$%."" Jen looks stunned for a moment and then says ""But you neeeed to try it on."" My customers have all turned around and the guy at the register says ""Do you think he is going to hit her?"" I shrug and call my manager quick and tell her to get over here asap. Jen and John are asked to leave until they can control themselves and I went about my day as usual.

Never found out their living status and Jen was never accused of shoplifting. They are still living despite the tl:dr. I doubt they could actually make up a hill without their car.

tl:dr Jen and John go up the hill and die of over-exposure.

Lolawalrus51,6,30,1qjna1,161,"This happened a few days ago and I thought i'd share.

I work in the pharmacy department of a large chain retail store/pharmacy. As I've stated in previous [stories] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1hg3o8/this_is_a_pharmacy_not_your_bedroom/) I go back to the pharmacy to check out when there is a huge line, but I was recently promoted to pharmacy technician and work back there full time. The one thing I""ve noticed about transitioning from the front to the pharmacy is that while the front can seem super busy, 90% of the time it's got NOTHING on the pharmacy. Especially from 5:00pm to 8:00pm, which is our crunch time. 

On this particular day we were so slammed we had 2 managers working the registers as backup so that we had more people filling. I was working the drivethru and had a line of at least 5 cars. I had just finished a woman in lane 2 who had me almost to the breaking point because almost everything that could have gone wrong HAD gone wrong. Her prescriptions were rejected by her insurance, then once we got them covered (by switching to generic, which she said she didn't want when she dropped off her prescription) it was still too much for her. So we switched it from a 3 month supply to a 1 month supply. Then I had to check her ID (because it was a controlled substance). She harped on me about never having to show it (which is crap, state law forces us to see one for every purchase of a controlled substance) and once she did I tried to use her card, and it was denied. I sent the card back out to her, and she sent me in cash and FINALLY we were finished.

During this time, the first line was waiting patiently for me to finish with the second lane. She was very polite and was understanding when I apologized to her about the wait and thankfully her transaction was easy as pie. Grabbed the prescription, told her the price, swiped her card, done.

BUT THATS NOT ALL!

When she grabbed her prescription she put a BOX OF COOKIES in the drivethru bin and sent them my way. When I got them, I just sort of looked at them and asked her why she sent them. The woman replied ""Oh, this is a present for you all! Make sure you share them, and tell [on duty Pharmacist] that [patient's name] says to have a good day and a great weekend!"" And with that she drove off. 

Those cookies tasted like magic.

confusionhysterical,33,25,1qjmgs,1,"Hey TFR! Long time reader, first time poster. For some reason, I've been thinking about this instance a lot today and decided to share it with all of you!

I used to work as an assistant manager for a well known international clothing store. Some of our locations carry all departments and some smaller locations only carry women's clothing. My old store had been one of them up until fairly recently when we had a very small men's section installed. After the very tiny men's department debuted many men would ask me why we didn't have the whole men's line. My go to answer was that we didn't have a large enough location and that hopefully we would be renovating and expanding soon. Most men were okay with this answer. However, one evening this young entitled jerk (from here on in to be known as YEJ) decided to have it out with me because we didn't carry the whole men's line. The exchange went something like this:

(young entitled jerk is approximately 17-19 years old and looks and sounds like he could be a Jersey Shore cast member. The scent of Axe body spray trailed him wherever he went. His hair had so much gel in it it should have been registered as a deadly weapon. For the full effect, his part is best read in a thick Jersey accent.)

YEJ: I don't get why you don't got all the men's stuff. 

Me: (in my most cordial and understanding tone) I'm sorry sir, we're simply not a big enough store to carry all of our men's merchandise. But if you would like you can find our complete men's line at our other locations. (I listed our three closest locations for him and provided the addresses.)

YEJ: Yeah, well, I think this is outrageous! 

Me: Again, I am deeply sorry for the inconvenience this caused you. 

(He walks away and goes back to the men's section. A few minutes later he is at my register and I am ringing him up for a t shirt.) 

YEJ: You know, it's really awful you don't got all the men's stuff.

(By this time my patience is wearing incredibly thin.)

Me: I already apologized. There is really nothing I can do about that though. The items we are allocated is decided by people higher up than I am. 

YEJ: It's sexist!

(Now, I am a feminist and I lack a filter, especially when it comes to persistent idiots. The latter is one of the myriad reasons I can not work with the public anymore and now work with animals.)

Me: Sir, when your reproductive rights are debated on a daily basis, then you can come talk to me about sexism. But they're not. So for now you can take your t shirt and leave. And if you want to see our full men's collection you can go to our other locations. 

(Young Entitled Jerk just stands there, mouth agape. He has no quick come back for me.)

Me: Have a great night! (I smiled, handed him his bag, and waved him off.)

TL;DR-young douche tries to claim my company is sexist towards men. I remind him what sexism really is.

Jwright281670,30,53,1qjm6r,217,"It is my second year in clothing retail. One of our shoplifter alert warnings that means watch the door is one of our associates getting on the intercom and saying ""Jimmy Rustles, your party is waiting at the door. Jimmy Rustles, your party is waiting at the door."" 

When I hear this I walk to the front door (the Men's department where I work is near it) and lock two of the three doors. I simply tell customers that only the one door is open, and holding it for them, they don't ask and don't care. Now protocol dictates that only managers are allowed to confront shoplifters as my company won't pay for you getting hurt etc so I merely watch and wait. 

After a minute or so I can see a commotion up the isle. A very large woman is arguing with three of my also very large managers. ""I ain't got nothing. I'm leaving I am leaving."" That was all I heard as she lowered her right shoulder and plowed through two very large women. The man got in her way and she grabbed his tie and kept her balance using it. He went to the ground and she came rushing at me.(Three very large managers rolling on the ground trying to get their feet under them is highly amusing.) 

I've done this before so I just step through the door and lock it behind me. It was only another moment before the police showed up to an enraged large woman with her back to the glass doors yelling at the top of her lungs that she is being assaulted. Customers are standing around trying to get in and out or just watching the show. 

The two cops come in the doors, I unlock it and this lady begins telling a story about how she ain't stole nothin' and that she had been assaulted and wanted to press charges etc. My business done I unlock the doors and retreat to the Men's department. From my vantage between racks of clothes I watch as the cops usher the lady out of public view to the offices in the back. 

She comes back out later in handcuffs and is seated in the back of the car. I learn later on that she was charged with three counts of assault and attempted shoplifting. Apparently she was wearing several layers of stolen clothing.

tl:dr Chubbernaut is the fat version of a Juggernaut.

Gneissisnice,159,242,1qjhdd,807,"I work in a college bookstore, as you could probably guess from the title. You might remember some other stories I've posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1l5mxv/the_customer_metamorphosis_theory/), [here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1i7v3m/can_i_get_a_discount/) and [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/15bc1z/i_want_it_now/). Today, I thought I'd share the story of why I stopped answering the phone at work (warning: very long).

Now it's November at the bookstore, and things are pretty much dead. We've sent all of our books back to the publishers and cleared out the store, so there's not much to do except tell the lazy procrastinators ""no, we don't have that book, yes I'm sure, why did you wait until November to buy your book?"". So when the phone rang, I was eager to have something to do. Boy, was I wrong about that. 

""University bookstore, this is Gneiss speaking, how may I help you?""

""Hi, I was wondering if you could pull up receipts for my daughters purchases since 2010"". 

WHAT? No, I can't do that. I explain that for us to find it, she would need the exact date and time for each purchase. Not that we would even be able to pull up a transaction from three years ago anyway. But then a thought occurs to me.

""Did you maybe order them online?"" I ask. She says that yes, she ordered everything online. Ah, that's a different story, and doable. But just because I can do it doesn't mean I should. Why does she need receipts from 8 semesters?

I ask her why, and she explains that her crazy ex-husband refuses to pay for her daughter's textbooks unless she can prove that she only spent money on books and not sweatshirts or other merchandise.

Oh. Uh, okay. I guess that kinda makes sense, in a way. Ignoring the obvious questions, like ""Why is your husband paying NOW, 4 years later?"" and ""He really wouldn't pay if your daughter did buy any logo merchandise?"", I decide to send her the emails.

I pull up her daughter's book orders and tell her that they only go back to Fall 2011. She asks why, and I don't know, but I guess that we either changed systems at that point or it just doesn't store the orders for more than a few years. I mean, how often would you need to pull up orders from that long ago? 

She's unhappy with that, but we proceed. She asks if I can cc her on the emails. Nope. I can only send them to her daughter's email that the order was placed under, and I tell her the email address to confirm that it's correct. Now that the orders have been fulfilled, I can't change any of the information. I do tell her that she can have her daughter forward her the emails though, and she agrees to that. As I start sending email after email, I inform her that one of her purchases has the status of ""Cancelled"".

""Why?"" she inquires.

""Probably because you cancelled the order."" I respond. 

8 emails and 30 minutes later, we're finally done. She thanks me and that's that.

Or is it? Apparently not, as it turns out. A few hours pass, and I hop on the front register as it gets somewhat busy. Just as I get off, the manager calls me over. ""Gneiss, phone for you"".

Phone for ME? That's weird. I pick it up. It's Her. 

""Hey Gneiss, you helped me out earlier. I just had a couple of questions. One, my daughter didn't get all of the emails! What's going on?"" 

I pull up her orders again, and I immediately see the problem. ""Your daughter changed her email, the first few orders went to her old email. I did say that the emails were going to that email"". 

""Oh. Can't you change the email?""

Sigh. ""No maam, as I explained earlier, we cannot change the email address. You should have your daughter check her old email and see if it's there""

""Ok. Well, can you send them again?"" SIGH. Sure, why not. It's not like I have anything better to do.

""Oh, and my other question. Are you SURE that you can't pull up anything earlier than 2011?"" I explain to her that yes, I'm sure. Here come the dreaded words: ""Can you check with your manager to make sure?"". Ugh. I put her on hold and go over to the assistant manager, who usually deals with web orders. I explain the situation, and he thinks the entire thing is absurd, but he agrees to check the woman's order. He asks for name and I tell her.

His eyes widen. ""HER???"" and suddenly, memories come flooding back to me. The woman that kept me on the phone for an hour last semester asking me to go over the price of every book her daughter had rented. The woman who calls once every couple of weeks with some kind of crisis. The woman who is already famous in the bookstore for being a major pain in the ass. It's HER! Now the situation makes more sense. He checks and tells me that we can't search for orders before 2011. 

I go back to the phone and tell her. She asks ""Who did you talk to? Was it Jay? I know Jay. Let me speak to him"". Sorry Jay. He grumbles as I pass him the phone, leaving him to be stuck with Her for another 30 minutes. 

But hey, the situation's out of my hands now, and all is resolved.

Nope. 

Two days pass and the phone rings again. ""Hey, remember me? I called yesterday, but you weren't in, so I decided to call again today"" I scream internally as I force myself to say ""Of course! What can I help you with today?"" ""Are you SURE I can't pull up orders from before 2011?"". I once again explain that I am absolutely positive. 

""Oh ok. Well, I have another question. I see that one of the orders was cancelled. That's not very good proof that I paid for the books, I was wondering if you could remove that status from the order"".

Now I'm dumbfounded. ""No maam, I can't do that. You didn't actually pay anything for that order because you cancelled it, and I can't change the status"".

Her: ""Why not?""

""...Because that would be lying? Besides, the order was completed 2 years ago, we can't change a finished order"".

""Oh ok. That's all I wanted to know, thanks""

Well, that's probably over now. It's Thursday and I'm not working again until Tuesday, hopefully it's all done now. Even though I'm off on Friday, I come in because it's the assistant manager's last day and I baked her cookies (I'm the best employee, I know). As I come in, the phone rings. I joke ""It's probably her"" and a coworker gets it. She grins, looks at me, and mouths ""It's Her! She asked for you!"". 

No. Absolutely not. I'm not even working today. My coworker takes the call, comes back 20 minutes later, and tells me ""She asked if we could pull up orders from before 2011. I said no, and she demanded to speak to a supervisor!"".

So now when the phone rings at work, I always ask for someone else to answer it, and if it is Her, tell her I'm not there.

unmined,30,59,1qjgz7,262,"”A Bad Case of the Crabs … er … Lobsters.”

I’m taking a quick break from Tales from Finance to write about an event during my time working as a parcel sorter at the largest parcel delivery company in the US. After all, “peak season” is just around the corner (peak season being the name for December in the delivery game).

Welcome to San Diego Sunrise. I’m a young lad again. 20 years old and unbelievably fit due to handling around 4,000 boxes each morning. My job is simple to describe. Packages come to me on a conveyor belt. Then, based on the address of the package, is moved to one-of-six different convert belts. On a normal morning (4AM to 8AM), this is done by me around 4,000 times.

On other days, it can get worse … 4,800 times. As best I know, 1,200/hr is my maximum speed. For those playing at home, that’s 20 boxes per minute.

So, retail … I was the guy who sorted everything that was heading to San Diego’s highest-end mall, as well as a few other ZIP codes.

Now, the cased of the crabs … lobsters.

Believe it or not, people mail-order live lobster. Far more than you’d expect. Since I live in a town next to the ocean, I assume there must be some logic behind this, but I’m not quite sure. Season? Atlantic lobster better? Cheaper? I have no idea. Seafood revolts me (I don’t know why … it just does).

The lobsters are shipped in what is essentially a thin foam coolers, but with air holes. Their claws are banded. They somehow stay relatively wet. Occasionally, I’d sort one of these boxes, and they’d be pissed off and thrashing inside. It was like handling a miniature prison in the midst of a riot.

We were in the middle of peak season, and the convey one belts were getting backed up. The volume was simply too much of anyone to handle. When this happens, the boxes become bunched together and back up all throughout the system.

Boxes are usually very well designed. Companies actually spend a lot of money designing containers that will protect contents in just about every scenario. Delivery companies help out and provide guidance as well.

It wasn’t enough for the live lobsters this morning. Just before a shipment made it to my station, the styrofoam exploded in a beautiful winter snow, and many pissed-off crustaceans were now free. On my belt. Everywhere.

I hit the stop-plunger and froze the belt. I called out for my supervisor, but he was nowhere around. My coworkers in the vicinity were not inclined to help.

So, I jumped up on the belt and started wrangling them. One at a time. Again, seafood (live or dead) is revolting to me. And banded-claws only addresses one injury vector for these assholes-of-the-sea. They thrash around. They are pointy. Gah …

A further complication is that I have no way of knowing how many were in the box to begin with. Could be three, could be more or less.

Each time I found one, I had to grab it and move it back to my station. It was a fairly enclosed space, so I wasn’t worried about another escape. I found four total.

As this is happening, the stopped belt is causing backups all the way down the line. I can hear people yelling a block away (the building itself is around four blocks long, one block wide).

So I’m having a mild veracious breakdown at both the lobsters and the yelling. I stumble around looking for enough of a container to hold them until a clerk (this is the title give to people who repair boxes) showed up.

I finally found a large cardboard tote and ran back to my station. All four still there. I grab them and hoist them into the tote. The tote goes to the clark station, and i restart the belt. I begin digging myself out of package-tetris-hell.

Then I grab something moist and crunchy.

Rest is peace, #5. My smelly hand served as a tribute to you for the rest of the shift. I always knew someone would die on the belt, but I always thought it would be me.

* Dealing with shitty people
* Passing the 19 hour day
* Staying fresh for such a long shift
* Etc.

With such a wide variety of people here, I know there will be some awesome tips that we can all use to make the day a little less ugh!

Here are a few things I've learned over the years.

* If your store offers a credit card, walk the line with clipboards and applications, *before you open*.  People that wanna sign up will fill the application out before entering the store, it will save you and them both time.

* Have an employee dedicated to entering credit apps into the system, and if possible, get this done before the store opens.  It will help sales!

* Setup a coffee pot, and give people in line free cups of coffee.  They don't have to be big ass cups, just cups.  People have been out in the cold for hours, and will be glad to see something warm to drink, especially when it's free!  As a bonus, if you have them in your line, they will usually remember that you gave them something, and be a bit more pleasant to deal with.

* Have good shoes and socks.  Your are gonna be on your feet for a LONG time, having good shoes and quality socks makes a huge difference!  Buy the shoes now, so they are broken in by BF!

Customer (seemingly normal old man, or OB) fills up and comes to pay. His card is declined, so I grab good details and let him go try the ATM for his bank.  Comes back 10 minutes later saying his pay hasn't come through yet, but he'll be back in as soon as it clears.  This is where I start to fill out the drive off paperwork we have and get his contact details. The whole time in doing that, he's complaining about his perfect record and how he can't afford to have a driveoff on his record, to which I reassure him that it's for our records only, unless he doesn't show to pay for it.

Cue an hour later, he comes in to pay and starts ranting about how he's a former policeman and prosecutor and that I've filled out an illegal form and that I'd I don't destroy it he'll go report me to the police.

M: ""That's just our internal paperwork, I have to fill that out and it'll show that you've paid for it""

OB: ""You have to destroy that right now, that's an illegal report! I'm a former policeman and a prosecutor, I can't have that on my record and if you don't destroy that right now, I'm going to go straight to the police station and have you arrested!""

This continues on for 5 minutes, during which time a police car has actually rolled up and started getting fuel and one of the constables had entered the store.

OB: ""I demand to speak with your manager!""
M: ""OK,I can get my area manager on the phone""

30 seconds later, policeman comes up and asks ""So what was all that about?""

I summarise for him, we laugh about it and I tell the story of how some random earlier demanded I pay for repairs to his sister's car after she t-boned me, and how his big shot lawyer cousin was going to take me to court (nothing happened there after I laughed at the dude on the phone, since his sister was at fault)

 **#1 Time Bomb**

So in my past collection I talked about our ID'ing policy. ""Under 30"" is what we shoot for. Also another thing of note is that if you come in with a party of people to buy age restricted items **the law** states that I must make sure that no second party sales are being made, so to make sure I have to ID everyone with you at the time of the purchase. 

This couple walks in, and begins to peruse our cooler doors looking for drinks. He grabs a soda, and she grabs a V8. They're clearly having a conversation, and they approach the counter together and place their items on the counter next to each other. I ring them up and ask if that will be all.

Unfortunate Female: &gt;We&lt; will also need a pack of _____ and a pack of _____. 

Me: No problem, I just need both your ID's.

Before I can even finish the sentence the male is standing half way out the door cursing at me, calling me every name in the book and yelling at the girl to leave. She had such a bewildered expression on her face about what was going on, and turned to me.

UF: You have to see his ID to sell it to me?

Me: Yes, the law says-

TB: Just leave this fa**ot isn't going to sell us the cigarettes.

Me: You really are brave standing half way out the store.

She then begins to plead with him to stop being such an asshole, before eventually just walking out the door with him. This is the most pity I've ever felt for a customer.

I often have men and women dressed in scrubs walking in and out on a daily basis going to/from work/break. 

This lady who I honestly just thought was a regular customer, an RN by her name tag, came in every night and got something. Usually energy drinks and something to eat, but this particular night she came in and bought cigarettes. Another piece of critical information one should know is that once cigarettes are sold, it is **illegal** to take them back (something about people buying cigarettes from other states and selling them in another, idk). This is at our discretion if they have yet to leave the store property, but once they leave it's no longer viable. She asks for two packs of one brand and two packs of another. Here is her quote (almost) verbatum.

NMcB: I would like two packs of ____, and then two packs of ____ 100's.

To any person who's worked in retail selling cigarettes this hits the ear as she wants 2 packs of shorts and 2 packs of 100's. Well apparently NMcB meant she wanted them both 100's. 

I rang her up, PLACED THE CIGARETTES ON THE COUNTER, and asked if she would like a bag. After LOOKING at them she said yes. I placed them into the bag with the receipt. Gave my pleasant goodbyes and went on with my night, cleaning and stocking. About 30-45 minutes roll by and she walks back into the store, and sets the cigarettes on the counter. 

NMcB: Hey, I needed both of these in 100's.

Me: I'm sorry, once the cigarettes leave the property it is illegal for me to take them back.

NMcB: Well I have the reciept, so you have to take them back.

Me: I'm sorry, I can sell you the 100's but I cannot take back the cigarettes. It's illegal, I could lose my job and go to jail.

And this is when she snapped.

NMcB: You HAVE to take them back, I don't want these cigarettes I want the 100's. You fucked up so you WILL take them back.

Me: I *legally* cannot take them back, as I said before I could *go to jail*.

She then grabs the cigarettes in a huff and walks out the door saying ""You're going to regret this."" I shake it off, and honestly didn't care. If you're going to be this rude you deserve to have your day shit on. Fast forward about 2 hours and she comes back in.

NMcB: When will your manager be in.

Me: He'll be here at 8am (he is in earlier but is doing paperwork until that time).

NMcB: I'll be here at 8 then. -she half walks out the door then pokes her head back in- Maybe you should have finished High School.

This is the only time I've ever lost my cool, I went back into the restrooms to let the rage vent. I can rest at night knowing that when she came back in my boss told her the same thing. Haven't seen her back since.",Collection of small stories #2,51

lel0,31,17,1qimeq,45,"Edit: Whoops, this turned into quite the rant! Sorry for the length, guys.

Background: I work as a cashier at a supermarket chain in Australia.

Recently, the service staff have been told to start collecting trolleys from the two carparks we have in the complex (one upstairs and one underground). I'm still not entirely sure where the trolley guys are, as they're the ones who were employed specifically for this purpose, but oh well.

I actually quite enjoy it. It makes a nice change from just standing around at the registers.


So, the other day I was pushing trolleys. Now, I'm a 21 year old female, naturally quite small, but I consider myself to be strong. I have recently started lifting weights at the gym and love it. So after a few comments like these, I started getting really pissed off.

Asshole guy. I've encountered him one time before this. He's downright arrogant and very loud. Kept telling me how much money he has, like I was supposed to be impressed.

He walks towards me from the shop and sees me pushing trolleys towards the doors. He grins and says (more like yells), ""Sending a woman to do a man's job, huh!""

I ignored him and kept my eyes forward. He muttered something under his breath as I walked into the store.

Nice old lady was standing at the top of the ramp that leads to our downstairs carpark. She stood aside for me as I pushed the line of trolleys up, sweating profusely and probably quite pink!

Nice old lady: ""Oh, that's no job for a young lady""
I chose not to say anything and just smiled.

A couple of other men would walk past, look concerned and also a little amused, and ask ""Are you okay?"" or ""Do you need some help?"" I decided to firmly respond with ""No, thanks"". It was getting hard at this point to keep myself from snapping at them, but I knew they had good intentions. 

One man came straight up to me. I had just started trying to pull out a trolley that was stuck between the curb and the concrete blocks that are at the top of parking spaces (not sure what they're called). 

He walks straight up, says ""need some help?"" and, without waiting for an answer, lifts the trolley up for me. I told him thanks and stacked it with the others.

My boyfriend's friend and his girlfriend came up to me as I was trying to turn the line of trolleys around to get up the ramp. 
Him: ""Hey are you alright?""
Me: ""Yeah I'm fine""
Him: ""Why are you guys doing the trolleys now? What happened to the trolley guys?""
Me: ""I don't know. It's weird, it's like they disappeared or something.""
We both laugh.
Him: ""So why'd they get the smallest girl to do it then?""
Me (teasing): ""Hey! I'm stronger than I look okay.""

(I felt that I could be more honest with him in what I said, as I knew him as a person outside of work, not just as a customer.)

He, like most of the others, was obviously trying to be nice and help me out, but it really made me angry.

Do I look weak? I kept thinking to myself.

I guess I get a bit red in the face when I do any physical activity, but it doesn't mean that I'm necessarily struggling.

Although.. I was struggling. I don't want to admit it, as this reinforces the 'weak little woman' stereotype that I'm trying to avoid. But I was only struggling because it was the second time I had done this, and I still wasn't used to the work. What I'm used to is standing around and scanning stuff. It's quite a big change in the amount of physical activity you have to do! 

I really feel like I have to prove myself now, somehow. As I said at the start, I've been lifting weights at the gym and I love seeing the progress I've made in the size of my biceps. I am by no means 'weak'. But I am not used to the sheer exertion needed to get a line of trolleys up that ramp. 

Anyway, I just absolutely was not expecting the number of comments I would get based on the fact that:
a) I am female and
b) I'm doing something extremely physical.

FindingMoi,37,42,1qih1c,152,"Let me start this off by saying I am so frustrated and angry and want to beat this lady senseless! 

Okay. Now that that is out. 

2 months ago, I was hit by a shop lifter 2 nights straight (I work in retail) and was unable to prevent it. This lady knew what she was doing, and both times got away with several hundred dollars worth of merchandise. It was beyond frustrating. Each time, she snuck past us, and since our retail store lacks cameras (I know, I hate it) we can only do so much. 

She had a completely BS story about attending her daughter's wedding...Quite frankly, we carry nothing remotely appropriate. Still, she engaged us in conversation, asked questions, and wanted help carrying things to the restroom (our ""fitting room""). She was completely visible and it made things so frustrating when, despite being vultures, we found tags and hangers and packaging shoved in the trashcans. 

Did I mention she hit us 2 nights straight?

Flash forward to tonight. I see her, and immediately grab my manager. I'm on her like a hawk. I ask her if I can help her, chat her up about her party (her latest excuse for shopping), offer christmas gift ideas, and generally refuse to let her out of my sight for a second. My manager also watched her, as well as the whole sales team. 

She had items she wanted held, so I took down her name and number (turned out to be fake). I gave her a total for the items she picked, and continued to follow her around, even catching her trying to put things in her purse. I wasn't allowed to directly confront her, or I would have. I caught that bitch red handed, but still could do nothing.

She went into the restroom, then went to eat in our attached restaurant. I parked myself next to the host stand and greeted guests as they came in while keeping a close eye on her. A manager went into the bathroom and found maybe $50 worth of merchansise she'd shoved into the trashcans in the stalls...  which meant we officially had the go ahead from corporate to call 911. 

Cops show up with specific instructions: wait for her to leave the bathroom, verify the items were taken, they're waiting outside to confront her. So, we waited. And waited. And waited. I felt like a secret agent as we monitored this freaking lady and spoke over the headsets. 45 minutes later, she emerges, and the cops confront her....

....in the bathroom, $200 worth of you name it: scarves, christmas decorations, candy, salt and pepper shakers...everything under the sun. Shoved into trash cans in the stalls, then covered with toliet paper. 

When the cops caught her, her pockets and purse (a HUGE purse) were 100% empty. She knew we were on to her and emptied her bag out. It was impressive, given how closely she was watched, the sheer scope of what she managed to take. 

Ultimately, we could prove nothing. She couldn't be arrested. Having her ID, we got her real name and address, and sent out a warning to other stores, but she got away with nothing more than a ""you're no longer welcome here.""

I'm soooooooo frustrated. I'm glad she didn't get away but we were so close! I'm the sort of person who cries when she's angry, so I had a good angry cry in and I guess that helped. I can only hope karma bitch slaps her in the facw for me.","And we almost caught her, on her 3rd time stealing from us...",194

IronyJudge,24,25,1qicc1,78,"Back in high school I worked at a brightly colored smoothie shop. The management style of the company was a bit more relaxed towards customer service standards, and we'd do things like put three times the suggested dose of fiber supplement in the drinks of people who were snotty at the register. Most of the time if a customer had a special request we'd do what we could to accommodate it, even if it was a little odd.

The store itself was in a high-end part of town, with a very popular park within loogie's reach. We'd get fitness freaks who were jogging around the lakes coming in and filling themselves with pseudo-healthy 800 calorie smoothies. In came a lady wearing clothes somebody 20 years younger than her would get nasty looks for. The ribcage below her ribbon-like sports bra was 1080 high definition. Despite having no ass she had booty shorts with ""PINK"" printed on them.

Rib-Cage: ""Hi. I'd like one of your [corny smoothie name], made with water instead of apple juice.""  
Me: ""Well, we can substitute our low-calorie smoothie base for the apple juice. We've never really had somebody ask for water.""  
RC: ""You've got a tap right, instead of apple juice fill it with water from the tap.""  
It was rather hard to type in the instructions on the register, so I just added a note that said ""Ask me.""  
Me: ""Alright. I'll tell the person making it to come ask me for directions.""  
RC: ""I want one strawberry in it.""  
Me: ""Okay, we can cut the portion in half. Normally it comes with two scoops of strawberries.""  
RC: ""Not one scoop. One strawberry. A single strawberry""  

Water instead of juice, and a solitary strawberry. This was going to taste horrible.

Me: ""I'll call up the other cashier and make the drink myself.""  
RC: ""I also want 5 scoops of whey protein in it.""  
Me: ""What will cost 50 cents per scoop, as well as significantly alter the texture of the drink.""  
RC: ""I want it as thin as possible.""  
Me: ""We'll see what we can do, but whey usually results in a more whipped-like texture.""  
RC: ""Do what you can do.""  

The other cashier gets up and I go back to make her drink. I do it exactly as she asked, and in an effort to make it as thin as possible blended it on low. I give it to her, and she smiled and left a satisfied customer.

This is in the middle of a massive rush.

As I'm ringing through other customers I see her get halfway through the parking lot and pivot 180 degrees. She storms in, stomping as hard as her frail 80 pound body could muster. She gets inside the store, and had appeared to have started screaming at me before she even got in the door.

RC: ""-- KID WHO CAN'T FOLLOW BASIC INSTRUCTIONS!""  
She then chucks the drink on the floor, splattering frothy whey protein scum over all of the tables, the chairs, the floor, and a few customers.  
RC: ""THIS WAS TOO THICK. I DEMAND A REFUND AND A NEW DRINK!""  

The manager on duty at the time knew the story.

Manager: ""I'm sorry, but 5 scoops of whey protein is going to make a drink thick no matter what.""  
RC: ""MAKE IT AGAIN.""  

She's forgotten about the ""refund"" part of her ranting. I wasn't going to remind her.
The manager goes back, makes it again, and puts a single scoop of whey in but mocks putting in 5. She gets her drink and storms out. One of the customers in line came up to the counter and said ""You guys deserve a medal.""

But ribcage wasn't done.

She pivots around in the parking lot and comes back in. She storms back up to the counter.

RC: ""Are you sure you put 5 scoops of whey in?""  
Manager: ""Yes ma'am. Just as you asked.""  
RC: cheerfully ""Great! This is the perfect consistency!"" and walked out again.

I didn't want to give you guys nothing so I waited until stuff actually happened!

During the meeting I recorded it, when I played it back you couldn't hear anything but what I had said which you guys already know. 

So far it seems like Danny has turned this into a personal issue between myself and Regina rather than a business problem. It's also continued that way because she still can't look me in the eye.

Danny didn't mention the meeting at all when I was working with him. However, I spoke to women's AM, Zac, on Sunday night about the meeting. He was talking to me more about me going to HR and how he'd be affected, saying ""We had such a good thing going here."" Meaning the ebb of how the store was going. Yeah, real great...

Today I was highlighting the companies Code of Ethics in which I thought Regina was breaking for the department store to have on file. I come out of the copy room and I see my DM standing there. I immediately knew why Drew was there, said hello and went back to my section waiting for him to come visit me. 

He came down the escalator and we spoke about the sneakers a little and then finally dove in, talking about Regina and Amway. Throughout the conversation he was VERY understanding and wanted me to know I did the right thing, which was so relieving to hear. After all of the managers saying not to do anything, then doing it and not being reprimanded was a very good feeling.

He wished I had came to him earlier though. That was the big thing I got out of the entire conversation. I know I should have but with the peer pressure not to from everyone except myself I was starting to think I sounded dumb for caring about a company that doesn't pay me $100,000.00.

At one point in the conversation Regina actually came down the escalator and was definitely in earshot of myself and Drew. He immediately changed conversations and we spoke about the stock room until she left. We spoke about the repercussions of the situation and what could happen. He didn't specify but he will be talking to a few more people before Regina and him have a meeting. I told him that if things didn't pan out I'd like to transfer stores because I refuse to work for/with her...or I'd probably quit.

I'll make my final update when I find out what happens to Regina!",Manager is unethical and brainwashed. (Update #3),320

SeaBones,9,14,1qh76g,30,"I've done my time slaving in the mall, most of us have. It's times like this, during that calm before the explosion of the post-Thanksgiving holidays, that we sit back and reflect on the mall as an entity that serves human kind with tons of bullshit to waste money on. It's there to wander around as we examine the contrived realities that corporate stores have created. A chance to walk in and out of separate, sustained little environments offering up soaps and teas and shoes and sausage logs. Keurigs and linen sets. Handbags and jewelry. 

We employees walk bleary eyed to our daily grind, practically hovering in slow motion through rivers of human flesh slurping pumpkin fraps and dragging built bears by the leg like prisoners taken in war.

All of this is set up and carefully placed in window displays and store designs to offer you the chance to finally start living your life to the fullest it possibly can be. Teas to awaken your spirit, clothing to flatter, candles to enliven your senses, gifts to open up on Christmas morning and gawk at in awe as your family shares a moment to revel in your apparent money-spending brilliance. 

So I ask myself, what more can this contrived corporate fantasy-land possibly do to bring people in? I've witnessed the evolution of the mall from indoor wasteland of records and grungy teenagers to [outdoor meccas](http://lbpost.com/images/business/thepikeoutlet.jpg) that successfully lead a family through a day of parades and outdoor shopping glee to night-time restaurants and movies. A full experience where the most money can possibly be spent. These outdoor malls have concerts, children's games and events at day, and bustling restaurants become ""clubs"" and popular bars at night. It's a complete package. It's not just something to show up at and leave, it's something to stay at. To live in?

Could a person live in the mall? Could a person become a fixture in this dystopia? Could a person open their window to advertisements of new body washes for the holidays and listen to drunken nights out at night? Can a person do this in the comfort of suburbia? 

The answer is apparently yes, and [it's already happening](http://www.belmarcolorado.com/). As I searched for apartments I came across a new trend that's now being incorporated with outdoor shopping and theater centers. Cut and paste ""luxury"" middle class condos and moderately priced apartments, right there in the comfort of a mall environment and conveniently located right in your suburban area. They pop up seemingly overnight. It isn't the result of apartments and Chinese restaurants coming and going over time, it's a pre-made, specifically designed shopping and living dystopia.

So they've done it (the bastards!). A completely plugged-in, hip new standard of living that provides a mass goods store entrance mere feet from your front door and a corporate candle store visible from your morning breakfast table. Not only will residents never escape this mall lifestyle, they're permanently incorporated in it so that customers are literally forced to walk by stores on a daily basis. 

Is this happening in your area? Are you yourself now a mall-element? How far will we go to give in to corporate stores forcing their way into our lifestyles?  ","Let the Malls Take Over, an Observation",44

Tales From the Financial Company - Somewhat retail, since we accepted cash in exchange for paper. Really expensive paper.

Let’s talk about calling in sick.

This is a good example of a scenario that is uncomfortable for all parties involved. I hate calling in sick. And in my former life, I hated taking sick calls.

Here’s my general advice:

1 - Detail. I’ve lost track of how many over-share calls I’ve taken. The worst was listening to one of my female employees speak of her intestinal distress.

“I have really bad diarrhea. I can’t even get out the bathroom. So I’m not coming in.”

Other nuggets:

“It’s shooting out of both ends, boss!”

“I’m not going to be anywhere that’s not in five feet from a toilet.”

“I’ve got the trots.” (older employee. I had to look this one up. Yet another euphemism for diarrhea).

My favorite (from my least mature, but hilarious employee): 

HIM: “I’m having a Wizard of Oz morning.”

ME “What?”

HIM: “A lot of music and a bunch of munchkins.”

2 - Drama. Sometimes sick is a state of mind. I’m not discounting it, just retelling it.

“My roommate stole my paycheck. I don’t know what to do. I’m having a breakdown.” She was referred to our surprisingly-good assistance line.

“I was in a really bad car crash. I’m okay, but I can’t stop thinking about it.” Also referred to assistance line.

The worst: “I was out partying last night, and I got raped by my ex boyfriend. I’ll be in tomorrow.”

“Did you call the police or go to a hospital? Are you okay? Dear God, don’t feel like you have to push it, we can see about having some leave.”

“No, I’ll be in tomorrow.”

I know rape is a hot topic on reddit. And I’m not trying to be inflammatory. But she made it up. She didn’t formally accuse anyone. She just wanted another day off, and she had a history of absenteeism.

She came in the next day. Naturally, she blabbed to everyone that she faked a rape call to get the day off. People were so disgusted that they snitched.

I had informed our HR health rep (an RN) the day of the call and asked how to proceed (not know =ing it was fake). Once I let them know about her going around and bragging, an investigation was launch. She came clean, and was fired. Oops.

3 - Death. We offer a week of bereavement leave if a family member dies.

I’ll jump right to the best. My immature guy called in three separate times for a dead grandmother. This is certainly possible if he had step-family. But he did not. When he came back from the first dead grandmother, we talked a bit about this family.

When questioned, he admitted death #3 was fake. He was also let go.

Here’s the takeaway …

1 - We don’t need much detail. Cold or flu is fine. Food poisoning is a good standby. Unless your company insists on detail, just stay within the basic disease.

2 - Exotic diseases. They happen. Sure. But if nearly all your calls are for weird shit (scabies, lyme disease, west nile, etc …) we will get suspicious and probably irritated. Especially if you come back the next day and you are perfectly fine. West nile doesn’t have a 24-hour variation.

Keep it simple.

3 - Take special leave if needed, but keep track of who died. Very simple.

4 - If your employer allows you to call out by text or email. Use it. Honestly, I’d rather just deal with a quick text than a phone call.

5 - Do not abuse your leave, or ride a fine line. If you like to use up your sick leave, make sure there is a cushion in case you really do get sick. I have seen too many people take a bunch of mental health days, then get the flu. The flu takes the count past the firing line. And now no more job.

6 - Curb the drama, never fake the drama. If you are a great employee who suddenly needs a day to take care of mental health stuff, fine. Just call and say you are not feeling well. Don’t paint a flaky picture of yourself.

7 - If you have a real, chronic condition, get certified for ongoing FMLA. Make your employer aware of you have special needs. The more it’s documented, the more secure your job becomes.

FredFltStn,120,227,1qgzk5,775,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  I’m very picky about the fireworks I carry, and I make sure I choose only the best and most reliable products for my tent. To back it up, I also offer a “No-Dud Guarantee”. Basically, if it doesn’t work, bring it back and I’ll refund your money or give you something better. What I really need is a “It’s not a dud, you’re just an idiot” guarantee. 

Mortars are one of my favorite types of fireworks. Basically, you place the provided tube on a flat level surface, you load the ball or canister shell into the tube, you light the fuse, you run like hell. The fuse lights an ignition charge, which sends the shell up into the air. The fuse then lights the shell charge, which explodes with different effects or colors. 

Mortar shells have to be loaded into the tube with the lift charge on the bottom. Most of the mortar shells I sell have “TOP” and “BOTTOM” stickers on the shell. The mortar shells themselves are manufactured so that if they are put into the tube upside down, the fuse won’t be long enough to stick out of the tube. The instructions on how to load and light the mortars are included with every box of mortars I sell. It’s often printed on the box AND on paper instructions inside the box.   Sounds pretty simple, right?

Here are a few of my favorite “It’s a Dud” returns for mortars so far. 

**”It’s defective!”**  - The guy lit the mortars first, and then dropped them into the tube.  He missed the tube, and the mortar exploded on the ground. That made it “defective”.

**“They didn’t fly up into the air before they exploded!”**  -  It turns out he was lighting the shells in the middle of the street with no tube.

**”I’m too drunk to light these!”**  -  Now here’s a guy you can be proud of. He actually realizes that he’s too loaded to light these safely, so he wants to exchange them for something else. I happily exchanged the mortars for some finale cakes, which are much easier to use. My pride was short lived after I watched him climb into his car to drive away after we made the exchange.

**”I’m afraid that I’m going to hit a plane!**  - We asked. He’s nowhere near an airport. He just thought that they flew so high, they might accidentally hit a plane if one flew by.

**They’re blowing up in the tube!”**  -  Ok, this rarely happens, but it can. His pack had come with two tubes, and both were destroyed when he tried to fire off a mortar. I assumed the shells had gotten wet. While I was swapping out his package of mortars for a new one, he also complained that the fuses weren’t long enough, and that he’d had to stick his lighter into the tube to light the damn fuse. When I showed him how that could only happen if he put the shell in upside down, he got mad at me and told me off. Sadly, the upside down shell thing happens so often that we now keep a collection of exploded tubes on the counter.

**“They blew my tube apart!”**  - The guy decided he wanted a better show, so he had actually loaded three shells into the tube at once and lit them.

**“These things are dangerous! It scares me every time I light one!”**  - Once again, a guy was lighting the mortars first, and then dropping the lit mortar into the tube. He fired off a few, and then returned the rest because he thought it was too dangerous. When I showed him the instructions printed on the box, he yelled at me because, “How the hell am I supposed to read that in the dark?”

Maybe they should watch fireworks on TV next year.

rabbitkills,57,62,1qgyju,302,"So, I no longer work in retail. THANK GOODNESS. It took me almost ten years to escape, but I did. However, I have many stories of insanity, and this one is by far my favorite.

I worked in custom framing. I had this visibly pregnant woman come in and place an order. At the end, when I tell her it will be due, she says, ""I'll be in the hospital by then!""

Cheerily, I reply, ""Well, that's okay, it will still be here waiting for you!""

Few weeks later, I call to let her know it's done.

Pregnant Lady: ""I'm at the hospital. I can't do anything about that right now!""
Me: ""That's perfectly fine, I just wanted to let you know."" (Thinking: why didn't you just let me leave a voice mail...?)

That wasn't good enough for her. She sends her mother to pick up the job for her. I hand it over, mom leaves, everything is happy-happy in my land.

Until two hours later, I get a phone call.

Pregnant Lady: ""There is something WRONG with this. I am not happy. I am IN LABOR and can't deal with this right now!""
Me: ""Um.""

I really wanted to ask, ""You're in labor, so... don't you have more pressing concerns to deal with?"" But all I could get out was the, ""Um.""

She ranted at me for awhile longer about how she was in labor and in the hospital and giving birth and what an inconvenience this was to her and her having a baby, I guess? 

Just... priorities? I don't know. But it was definitely one of the most bizarre / hilarious interactions I ever had.","""I am IN LABOR and can't deal with this right now!""",364
FlameEverlasting,51,120,1qgxyo,544,"I was a server at a small town restaurant/steakhouse for five years.  Like everything in Minnesota, it's on a lake.  We get tons of people coming in from fishing and ice fishing. 
This couple was one of them, in for lunch.  I had waited on them a few times before and they had been pleasant.  Not this time, though.

**Me: Hi!  How are you guys doing today?**

**Woman:** (in what I can only describe as Bad Attitude Teenage Sarcasam, even though she was well past forty) **Uh, hungry?  Can we, like, get something to eat?**

I feel like it's important to note that I literally followed them to their seats with menus.  They hadn't quite finished sitting down when I started talking.

**Me: Absolutely!  Are you ready to order?**

**Woman: We haven't even looked at the fucking menus yet!  Would you just get us some beers, PLEASE?**

**Me: Sure.  On tap we've got Amber Bock, Leine's Heff-**

**Woman:  JUST get us some FUCKING BEERS!**

I scurried away from the table and got them two bottles of Mic Golden Lite; a pretty safe bet because everyone up here drinks that.  They seemed fine with that and ordered without much fuss, but very curtly.  

Five minutes went by.  I stopped by to check on them, and they said they were fine.  It was slow and there was only one other table of customers, so I was refilling salt and pepper shakers.  Five more minutes went by.  The man started waving me down from across the floor.  I saw and started over to them, and the woman,- having seen that I was coming,- *whistles* to me and shouts.

**Woman: HEY! Could we get some service over here?**
Not trusting myself to sound polite, I just stand at their table with a bland smile, waiting.

**Woman:  Where the FUCK is our food?!**

I turn and look at the clock.  It's been eleven minutes.  Knowing that she wouldn't believe me if I just said that, I take my book out and show her the time I put the food in, and explain that burgers take fifteen minutes to cook.  
These ain't no fast food burgers,- I hand-pattied that shit myself,- they're plenty thick and really do need to spend all that time on the grill.  I didn't get to explain that, though.  She was furious, and her husband just sat there, looking like he didn't want to get involved.

**Woman: It has NOT been eleven minutes!  It's been half an hour!  We've been waiting for thirty fucking minutes!  You're a fucking liar!  That is NOT the time we ordered!**

Okay, now I'm nervous.  I've never waited on any outright crazy people; you know, the kind of people that you have to eventually get the cops on to escort off the premises.  Wanting to get out of there I tell them I'll go check on their order.  I go relate the situation to the owner, who was cooking that day, and by the time I get done so are the burgers.  She follows me out and watches the ensuing scene.

They're halfway to the door.  Smokers usually go sit out on the front porch, so I didn't think anything of it.  I smile and say that these are their burgers.

**Woman:  I DON'T WANT YOUR FUCKING BURGERS!  WE'RE NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN!**

The owner and I are standing there, openmouthed, as they storm out.  They didn't leave money for the beers they had, or the meals in my hands.
The next time I come in to work, however, there is an envelope clipped to my time card with a hundred dollar bill and a note inside.  The woman had come in with it, shamefaced, the next day.  The note read, 

“Yesterday I caused a scene in your restaurant.  This was the result of being in the sun all day, and one too many beers.  I don't mean to make excuses for myself, but I hope you will understand and forgive me.  We love your restaurant, have always been happy with the food and the service, and hope we will be allowed to come again.  I am so ashamed of the way I acted, and have enclosed $100 to pay for our meals and drinks.  The rest is for the poor soul who had to deal with me.  I am so sorry.”

The owners, being awesome, ate the cost of the walkout and let me keep the $100.

tl;dr- woman is awful but then comes in later with an apology and a c-note.

jordan89115,10,13,1qgvx1,74,"Although I have quit, I remembered a pretty small but weird story on how ignorant people can be. The mall that I worked was is located in a Hispanic community. I do not know the crime stats.

It was a hot muggy day in the summer. Slow, but until it started to rain, it was a thunderstorm. We're in an outdoor mall, so the girl working at the Italian ice in front of my store grabbed her cash tray and ran inside my store. She is Latina (I'm mentioning this as it is important later). She came up to ask if she can count her money and stay dry. My manager okays it, and she takes the money draw to the back. 

The rain has stopped, and she comes out with the tray and several bags of money, and she thanks the manager. Then a man about 60 years old comes up to me and says:

""Is she counting drug money? If so, you better call the police.""

I was in shock of the racism, so I tried to say along with lines of: ""I doubt it sir. She was working out there and came in due the thunderstorm.""

""Well she looks like a drug dealer. You know they're around here, I'm just looking out for you and your store.""

""Thank you?"" Was I could say. 

He left a few minutes later. I told my manager and she said that she can't do anything unless he came back.

I don't understand how that man could be so ignorant to someone he didn't even know.

Me: Thanks for calling INAP, This is Fig, how may I help you today?

IDC: I need a set of plugs and wires for my Dodge. 

ME: Ok, what kind of Dodge? 

IDC: I don't know, does it matter?

ME: Well, yes, it makes a big difference

IDC: Just give me your cheapest stuff. I dont want to spend alot of money

ME: Ok, but I need to know what model and year it is.

ME: I told you I don't know!

ME: Well, can you give me a VIN number? I can run that and it will tell me what kind of car it is.

IDC: Do you really need that? I don't have the car with me. It's outside.

ME: Well, I can wait, or you can call us back when you get it.

IDC: FINE, jeez I just need some simple parts, and you guys just have to make it so difficult. no wonder everyone hates you guys. The guys at Vehiclezone didn't give me such a hard time. 

ME: I understand the frustration, but you have to realize that I could be quoting you prices that are not true. Would you rather I lie to you, or give you accurate information. 

IDC: Whatever. I still say it's stupid. spark plugs are all the same, it's not like it really matters.

ME: Well, yes it does actually. If you came in, and I gave you a set of random plugs, one of two things are going to happen. They will be too long, and will impact the piston and ruin your day REALLY Quick, or you will have plugs that are too short, and make your car run like crap. Also, different model engines use different size holes in the cylinder head and may not fit. So...Yeah, knowing what you are working on is pretty important.


IDC: Whatever. it's still pretty stupid if you ask me. (rustling of papers and door slamming) It's a dodge, that's all my car says on it. 

ME: What about that vin number? its usually on your registration or the VIN plate is near the corner of the driver side front windshield. read me that number

IDC: No, you'll steal my identity!

ME: I can assure you that I am not able to steal any personal information with that number. It will only give me the year make and model, along with the engine type information. Its the best way of knowing what we are working on. 

He gives me the VIN.

Me: Ok, looks like it's a Chrysler product-

IDC: It's NOT A CHRYSLER! I DRIVE A DODGE!!

ME: Sir, Dodge is a Chrylser PRODUCT. Like how GMC, Chevy, Buick, Pontiac and Oldsmobile are products of General Motors.

IDC: That doesn't make sense!

ME: I know. It's just how it is. 

I pulled up the price of the plugs, and go to find wires for it, but realize that it's a coil pack ignition system. there are not wires on it. 

I relayed this to the customer, and he got pretty upset about this. 

IDC: WHAT DO YOU MEAN I DON'T HAVE PLUG WIRES!? I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT THEM!! WHY DO THEY LET A BUNCH OF MONKEYS ANSWER THE PHONES HERE GODAMMIT!? YOU GUYS ARE FULL OF SHIT, I'M NEVER CALLING YOU GUYS AGAIN!

Also, Pete is the assistant manager and Tony is a shift supervisor (manager).

**Story**: ^^Names ^^changed ^^to ^^protect ^^privacy.

So lately we've been getting a higher amount of returns. Other stores around us have been telling us the same thing. Whatever, people don't like their items I guess...

I get this one woman, middle aged, grumpy. Grumpy asks if she can return this item and shows me a very expensive face cream. So I go through the whole routine

&gt;Grumpy: I've got a return, I don't have my receipt and it was a gift from my friend.

She didn't tell me this, and it doesn't make sense. Why would you have a receipt for a gift a friend gave you? Unless she gave you the receipt... I don't know.

&gt;Grumpy: Well, I called earlier and Pete said it was okay to return it.

&gt;Tony: I wasn't aware of any phone call that Pete received. Let me ask him real quick.

I can see her getting antsy.

&gt;Grumpy: Oh, no don't worry, he'll just say he did get a call since I called. You don't have to call him.

&gt;Tony: It'll just be a second.

&gt;Grumpy: Come on, I have to go just give me store credit and I'll be on my way. I have to go, you're just holding me up now. I need to be out of here, I have an appointment I need to be at soon. Jesus.

She gets pissed. She's standing there arms all crossed and a huge pout on her face. Thankfully it wasn't busy and there was no one else coming up to the register.

&gt;Tony: Yeah, Pete said he didn't get any phone call. He said he wouldn't okay a return over the phone until he saw it in person.

&gt;Grumpy: He's lying. I definitely called and talked to him. Just give me the return.

&gt;Tony: Sorry, we can't do that. With such an expensive item and no receipt, we just can't take it back. Sorry!

thatengineeringguy,14,27,1qgole,108,"I just remembered another short, but fairly horrific story to follow up my last.

Recap: I am the manager (technically) of a shop that buys clothes of people to go to the poor. We get some strange customers.

On a quiet day, a fairly upper class looking man comes in with a fairly large amount of clothes, the guy looks clean and well dressed so I expect the same from the clothes he has brought in, so I don't wear my gloves. About half way through this 60KG-ish haul of clothes There's a lot of underwear. I start sorting everything without a second glance, but suddenly out the corner of my eye I notice something. A stain. A BROWN STAIN. A BIG BROWN STAIN. I then see nearly every pair has huge shit stains all over them! Disgusted  I throw them back in the bag.

Me: Sir, these are completely soiled. I can't take any of this.

Him: Well why not! It's all perfectly fine clothing!

Me:  No, it's not. There are brown stains all over these. Frankly, that is disgusting. I will not be taking any of your clothes today.

Him: That is Fucking ridiculous! I'll talk to your manager and have you fired!

Me: Well that would be me, sir. 

He grumbled and grunted then stormed out, swearing under his breath before I could say much else.

Needless to say, the gloves stayed on for a while after several washes with boiling water and soap.

deadstar12,8,8,1qgmwv,38,"Ok so I was a few hours into my shift at the garage. The managers had gone home and I was on the tills with a newbie, so, at that moment in time I was the most experienced person in the building having worked there for a little over a year. 

So it's rush hour, people coming home from work and grabbing bits for their dinner, me having to quickly serve them and with the incompetent newbie tempers can get frayed. 

One customer needs help with something so I go out to help and leave the newbie on the till, she should be okay and I tell her to call me if she gets stuck. I go to the customer the gentleman asks I we have any gluten free whole grain pasta. I apologise and tell him we don't stock anything like that and point him down the road to the nearest super market. 

As I'm telling the customer about this I get buzzed to the till area to help so I finish up with him as quickly and politely as possible and return to help my struggling colleague. 

There were about 10 people in the queue some with shopping and some just getting fuel and I notice the gent I was helping a minute ago join the back and slowly but surly he ends up with me and I begin scanning and bagging his items and ring him up. 

ME: ""OK, that's £12's then please."" money is handed over and he mumbles something

ME: ""Oh, sorry was there anything else?""

Him: ""Yeh, I think you need to work on your customer service a bit""

I was taken aback ""sorry?""

Him: ""you seemed very dismissive and uninterested in helping me, and you were very ill mannered""

Now I have worked in customer service for 5 years at least also I was taught to always be polite by my parents and grandparents. Customers, managers and teachers have all noted how well behaved and polite I am so this statement confused and upset me.  

Me: ""I apologise if that's how I came across""

Him: ""Well that's no good now is it, I'll be letting your manager know about how I was treated""  

Me: ""Well if you are set on this my manager will be in from 8am to 430pm tomorrow""


Then one of my regulars steps into the conversation: 

Reg: Hi, what's up now then?
before I could say anything the rude customer jumps in 

Him: ""Well, I feel I've been very poorly treated by this guy"" and points at me ""he was very dismissive and unhelpful and rude""
  
Reg: ""What? *deadstar* was unhelpful and rude?""

Him: ""Yes, he didn't seem to care that I require a gluten free diet""  

Reg: ""Okay, first thing you're shopping in a petrol station mate, do you really expect them to stock gluten free meals. Secondly I know that *deadstar* here is the nicest and most polite cashier here so your talking bull about him being rude and unhelpful. Just pay up, stop bitching and leave.

She suddenly had the epiphany that she threw it in the garbage and wanted me to look for it in there.

Cincythrowaway2,154,442,1qgjyc,1336,"I worked in a very large supermarket near Cincinnati. This store had everything a Cincinnatian could ever need -- your Cincinnati sports merchandise, Cincinnati-style Chili in cans, Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Cincinnati, etc. 

Enter a lady and her friends. They walk right past all of the Cincinnati-related merchandise and go straight for the electronics. They request the most expensive stuff that we sell, and lots of it. Multiple laptops, multiple tablets, cell phones, etc. It's all in lockup, so the customers must tell the cashiers they want all of those things. Well, when one of them requested $15,000 worth of seemingly-redundant electronics, it caught the managers' attentions because *nobody* ever buys that much. Perhaps she was buying gifts for all of her friends in *Cincinnati*? Who knows?

The transaction was monitored closely by pretty much everyone in charge. The cashier, per procedure, requests ID from the lady. The lady presents it without hesitation. It's scratched up and looks a little flimsy for a government ID -- but hey, lots of IDs look weird like that. Right? So the cashier finally reads the info on the ID, which is as follows:

- Someperson Whatsherface
- 5555 Someplace RD
- **Cinncinati, OH** 45555

To the shock of everyone, her payment was declined. She tried to raise a *biiiiig* stink about it to get it through. She threatened to sue us, threatened to call corporate, made all sorts of threats.

She takes her ID, payment, and leaves empty-handed with her friends.

thatengineeringguy,5,7,1qgjcq,25,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm a 21 year old trying to earn enough cash to support me while I study. I study Engineering as the name may give away, but my job is kind of an odd type of retail. We buy clothes from people by the kilo. Also I'm technically manager (without any perks). This leads to having some really weird or confused people in sometimes, here's a few of my favourites.



First off I had a guy come in that obviously didn't understand what we did from the signs and big posters saying so. We'll call him 'Idiot Gangster wannabe'.

So IGW walking into the store, bear in mind that we have only a desk, scales and posters, no clothes are ever seen. Come up to the counter and asks, with a vacant expression..

IGW: Do you sell hats?

Thinking I misheard I replied ""Sorry, what was that?""

IGW: Do you sell hats? Like snapbacks and stuff

Me: Erm, No, sorry, we only buy clothes

IGW: Okay, do you have any hats other people brought in I can have?

Me: Sorry, no.

Then he left. Not very eventful, but I thought it was pretty weird.




Secondly, one thing I hate is people that act horrendously posh that come in for what seems like bragging rights, again without reading the signs. We'll call her ""Posh Bitch""

Me: Hi! How can I help you?

PB: Oh hello, I have a jacket at home I'd like to sell.

Me: Okay then, just bring it down and we'd be happy to take it off your hands for you.

PB: Well you see, it's a lovely beaded jacket and worth well over £600, what could you pay for it&gt;

Me: Well we only pay by the kilo so I'm sorry we couldn't give you anything near that. (It would have to weight the same as a small car for us to give her the money back!)

PB: But itis a beautiful designer jacket! 

Me: Well I'm sorry but we only pay by the kilo, you may be better selling it privately. 

PB: Well it is quite heavy, I may be back later on.

Needless to say, she hasn't been back.



I also always get a bunch of people unhappy with what they are offered for what they bring in, which is getting ridiculous, if they really want a lot of money for their clothes they should try somewhere that isn't practically a charity and doesn't pay by weight. We do however occasionally get a really nice one who is more than happy with what they are getting or that even refuse money and just let us take the clothes free of charge, those people are my favourite!




Here's another one, Angry Guy.

AG storms into the shop bright red faced and fuming,.

me: hello! How are you today?

AG: RAGING! THIS BLOODY TOWN IS TERRIBLE! (yelling the whole time, whilst an employee I was training was right beside me.)

Me: oh ( I couldn't think of anything else at the time to say!)

AG: AH FUCK IT, MISERABLE PLACE! HAVE YOU GOT JOBS GOING?

Me: No, sorry. (After that, we most definitely have not!)



One day we had a job opening though, and a sign in the window saying staff needed CV ONLY. A lot of people, about 50 maybe came in to apply, only three of them had CVs. Nearly everyone just wrote down there name and number, acted shocked when I asked if they had a CV to hand in, or (the worst I think) Came in to apply for other people!

Hope you guys enjoy these, I'll post some more soon.

4Gotten1,4,16,1qg8c6,89,"I don't really have a ""Big"" story to tell so I'll just post a few of the smaller ones here, and try to make it look half way readable.

To start out I work in a convenience store gas station. It's small and basically built to be easy to get in and out with what you want. For those of you who haven't had the pleasure I'll give a small synopsis of my job. My official title is Customer Service Representative (CSR for short) which basically means I do everything. There is no one person for different jobs (We are the cashiers, cleaners, stock personnel, and as the title suggests we assist customers as best we can). Another thing of note is that managers aren't in day round. My assistant leaves around 2-4pm every day where as the manager is in from 3:30am - 2pm. When the manager isn't present I am in charge of the store, and it's my responsibility to handle all situations short of emergencies by myself. All of this information plays a key role in my stories.

**#1 The Drunken Lady**

It's not too uncommon for someone who is inebriated to stumble through my door. Most of the time it's to hit the head, or grab some sort of food item to help them absorb that last bit of alcohol lingering in their stomach before they black out. But this lady was a bit different. She came in followed closely by the stench of alcohol. Obviously extremely intoxicated, waited in line until she got to the front and asked for a pack of cigarettes. I ring them up and place them on top of our printer (seated neatly beside the register behind the counter) and ask her how she was going to pay. She said debit (which I knew was going to be a problem as it usually was with people who are intoxicated) and I pressed the corresponding button and asked her to wait for the strip to light up before swiping her card.

Intoxicated Lady(IL): -Swipes card way too early- Why is it asking me to swipe my card, I already did?

Me: You have to wait for the blue lights before you swipe.

IL:-shoots me a dirty look and swipes her card again, continues to enter her pin and then stares blankly at me-

Me: -I notice that my side is still asking for her PIN (a common occurrence when you put in the wrong PIN)- Ma'am you need to re-enter your PIN number.

IL: -enters her PIN, still not taking it, continues to enter it 3 more times-

Our machines are built that if you enter your PIN incorrectly 5 times it cuts you off and puts a stop on your card as a theft deterrent. So it gives me that message.

Me: Ma'am you've entered your PIN incorrectly too many times, my machine won't take it.

IL: Ok, where are my cigarettes.

Me: Your card was denied, it didn't go through.

IL: -Stares daggers at me- I'll send my friend in, you need to learn not to be so *rude* to customers.


**#2 The Impatient Asshole**

This one literally happened 2 days ago, as most people who work in my line of work I've pretty much developed a tough skin towards any berating or asshole inclined customers. Instead of getting upset, I have learned the boundaries I'm allowed to work within when dealing with them. As I said before CSR's are the jack of all trades when it comes to the job. As I was cleaning up working a solo shift I emptied the trashcans next to the soda fountain, unbeknownst to me someone had taken the liberty of tossing a half full drink into the trash and it lead to the area behind the register being covered in sticky goop. I mopped as best I could between customers. If you've ever mopped then you know that once a mop has been used to clean up such a big mess the mop head is completely useless. In stead of cleaning it will just spread the mess and dirt all over. So I tossed it, cleared out my customers and went into the back store room (Literally 10 feet from the register area) to make a new mop bucket. I had just poured the detergent in and started the water when I hear a customer calling out. (Not abnormal, even though it's 10 feet away when the water is running it's impossible to hear anything else) So I turn the water off and walk back out. It should be noted the time I walked in to the back room and the time I walked out wasn't even a 30 second time span. So the customer had only been waiting maybe 20 seconds at most.

Impatient Asshole(IA): Finally, I could have walked out of here with these beers by the time you came back out here.

Me: *Ok*?

IA: So it would have been Ok if I had walked out with them then?

Me: Well, that's called shoplifting.

IA: Well I should have just left instead of waiting for your fucking ass to come out here.

Me: -places beer behind the register- Out the door.

IA: Who?

Me: You. You can walk out the door right now.

IA: Well fine then, I'll just take my business to the next store then.

Me: Ok.

**#3 Dipshit**

I would come up with a better title for this one, but in all honesty it's the only way to really describe someone of this caliber. In the 2 years I've been working retail I've yet to have this story topped by anyone I've encountered. Selling age restricted items comes with the routine of checking ID's. We even have a stupid bright yellow button that says ""We ID Under 30"" that we have to wear on our uniforms. Working early morning my manager had come in and was waiting for the safe to open so he could count the deposit for the bank. Dipshit walks in, I had seen him before maybe once or twice but not enough to remember if I had carded him for cigarettes as he was easily under 30. 

Dipshit (Dipshit): I need a pack of _____.

Me: -grabs them and rings them up, placing the pack on top of the receipt machine as always- And I just need to see your ID.

Dipshit: Seriously? You've seen me before.

Me: I need an ID to make a sale.

Dipshit: Seriously? If you don't sell me the cigarettes I'm going to call the cops.

Me: Uhh, go ahead.

Dipshit: Alright.

So he leaves the store, and my manager had overheard everything. He calls the cops (and just to make sure you know, the cops love me. I give them free coffee and fountain drinks, and on top of that they all know I'm cleaner than HoneyBooBoo's moms plate) and when Officer McAwesome shows up he just looks at me. My manager tells him what happened and even pulls up the video for him. He used the anonymous tip line and told the cops I was selling pills and snorting them on the counter. He currently has an arrest warrant out for misuse of civil help lines, and diverting police forces because he was stupid enough to come back and give my boss his ID.

Backstory: I work at a pretty well known chain that sells novelty t-shirts and adult items in most major malls in America and Canada. 

So I'm standing behind the register ringing up a customer. When I finish my manager rushes over to me and says ""There's a naked guy in the store."" 

 I look around and can't see what she's talking about. I then look to my immediate right which is towards the front of the store and there is this frumpy looking older Hispanic guy with only a button down shirt on. I'm immediately taken aback by this sight. My first thought was that he was probably drunk or high.

  As my manager is fumbling for the store phone to call mall security I see the guy start to squat and strain like he's trying to take a dump in the store. I immediately run out of the store to try to get security here faster. As soon as I leave the store I see a security officer standing by our window talking on his talkie to someone else describing the situation to them. 

   I tell him that this makes guy in my store is trying to take a dump on the floor. He just looks at me then goes back to staring. I walk back into my store frustrated trying to figure out what to do. A few seconds later 3 security officers walk in with gloves on and the woman that was supposed to be watching him.

   Apparently the guy was with a group of special people and got separated from his group. The officers told my manager that he had just finished taking a dump in front of the store right next to ours. His pants were in a corner not too far away from my store.

Note: I did not say proud of where I work, but proud of my work.

I usually work the cash register my whole shift, but when the lines are short and there aren't enough cart pushers, cashiers can get sent out into the parking lot. So when I got the call, I went to the break room and got my jacket, then walked out into the parking lot and started retrieving carts. 

After about half an hour of working with one of the full-time cart pushers, talking and making progress clearing out a couple of the fuller corrals by hand, he said to me ""I'm glad they sent you out, though.""

I was startled for a moment, ""Why's that?"" I said.

""Because you work.""

I smiled, and said ""and I'm proud of it."" 

And it's true. I found something to hang my pride on. I see many people who take jobs they feel are below them and they do a halfhearted job at them. Either they're making sandwiches and they put no effort into distributing the ingredients, or they're pushing carts and they spend the whole time on the phone. 

I do feel that I'm above the job I have, because I worked hard for a degree and a skill-set that should be paid better. 

But if I can't do well at a job I feel I'm above, what would that say about me? 

I don't want to be working where I am, but I do what I do well. At least I have that to hang my hat on.

KaterWaiter,8,11,1qfswc,65,"*Quick Background Information:* I work in management at a rather sweet convenience store/gas station combo where we make and sell deli sandwiches, hot side items, and specialty drinks in addition to your usual grab-and-go snacks. The drinks are made to order and currently on promotion, so we've been selling quite a lot.

Last night I was covering at register for a girl on her break, and I rang out a grumpy woman (GW) for a specialty hot chocolate. The deli was pretty slammed, but I couldn't get back to help them out until the girl returned from her break. A minute later GW comes up to me in a huff.

**GW:** Is Anyone making drinks back there?! There are two people making sandwiches and nobody is making my drink!

**Me:** I'm sorry for your wait, the deli associates make the orders as they come in. They're working on the food items other customers ordered before you. They will be to your drink shortly, I'm sure!

**GW:** But I only got a drink, can't they just get that out to me first? Why should I have to wait longer?

**Me:** I'm sorry, but that would not be fair to our other customers who ordered first. I do apologize for your wait!

GW stormed off to wait for her drink right as my coworker returned from her break. I popped back into deli, washed my hands, and snagged GW's ticket off the line, thinking I'd placate her. I steamed her hot chocolate (gourmet style and delicious!) and poured it into a cup, but I did not realize I'd filled it a little too high and when I put the lid on, a bunch spurted out the top. I quickly grabbed a sanitized wipe and cleaned off the sides and top, glanced up and saw GW watching me with a scowl.

**GW:** Just stop, stop! This is ridiculous, that's overflowing, it's going to pour out all over my hands and burn me. I waited so long, and now you screw up my drink?

**Me:** (smiling apologetically) Sorry about that! I tried to give you as much hot chocolate as I could, best bang for your buck, but I guess I got carried away! It shouldn't spill out any more, it was just the top bit, but I can pour out a little extra for you if you like.

**GW:** Just make me a new one.

**Me:** I'm sorry, you want me to make you an entirely new drink?

**GW:** (condescendingly) I don't know, you're the ""expert"". Whatever you think is best, at this point I just want my hot chocolate now.

**Me:** Well honestly, ma'am, there's nothing wrong with this one. I can make you a whole new one if you like, but it will be exactly the same. 

**GW:** Fine. Whatever. I don't know what kind of idiot can't make a hot chocolate, it's not rocket science.

**Me:** (trying to joke) Well, I am an English major, and not an engineering major!

**GW:** Well, if you were an engineering major, you wouldn't be working at a place like this, would you?

breezy727,11,26,1qfs9m,121,"Remembered another story from my patriotic teen clothing store days. 

This was during the summer when everyone was out shopping and enjoying the nice weather. My store was part of an outdoor mall, which in the midwest is the dumbest idea ever, but clearly nobody asks me my opinion on real estate. 

Now we had 12 fitting rooms, and one room that was handicap accessible at the end of a long, narrow hallway, which was a stupid design for anyone with a stroller or wheelchair trying to navigate that way. On a normal day we wouldn't use the big room unless someone was handicapped or had small children with them because it was further away and people tended to make a bigger mess there for some reason. On busy days though we would put people in the big room as soon as it emptied, never saving it specifically. 

I was working fitting rooms during one of these busy days and all of our fitting rooms were full when a woman came up to me pushing her child-aged daughter with a clear disability (I'm thinking cerebral palsy but I'm not an expert) in a wheelchair. Woman shall henceforth be known as Ridiculously Entitled or RE. 

RE: I'm so sorry to bother but my daughter has had an accident and I need to change her really quick. Could we use a dressing room?

Now normally you can only use a dressing room to try clothes on, but in this particular outdoor mall the bathrooms are quite a ways away and the woman looked desperate. So I told her she could use the next open fitting room and she settled in to wait. About two minutes later someone came out of a regular room, and after I cleared the clothes out I gestured to the woman that she could change her daughter in there. It would be a tight fit, but these rooms were still large enough to bring in a stroller and fit a bench and try clothes on. 

Me: Here ma'am, you can use this one. 

RE: That's too small, I need the handicapped room. 

Me: If you'd like to wait for the handicapped room, that's fine, but a mom and daughter went in there right before you came up so they'll probably be a while. It might be faster just to walk down to the restrooms. 

RE: That's ridiculous, I need that room, you need to ask them to move to the smaller room. 

Me: I'm not going to try and move them and all their items to a different room, if you would like to use the larger room you'll have to wait for it. 

RE: I can't believe you're discriminating against my family like this, this is illegal and I can sue this company for you refusing to serve us. 

Me: Ma'am, I'm doing you a favor. The fitting rooms are for shoppers only so if you're not willing to use the open room or wait for the big one, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. 

She threatened to call and have my job and sue and etc. etc. I told my manager what happened at end of shift but never had any followup so I can only assume the lady realized that refusing to kick actual customers out of the fitting rooms wasn't infringing upon her civil rights.

Background: I work in a large garden store in Australia, and I've enjoyed the work there so far. Its pretty quiet most days, but I hadn't been working there long when this woman came in.

She wasn't too large a lady, but she was certainly not small by any means, and she would have been in her mid to late thirties. She came into the store, and passed the registers at the front. I wasn't serving anyone at the time, but she didn't seem too out of the ordinary so I carried out my job. 

Just outside our 'indoor' section, she attracted the attention of a trolley boy, and asked him where the toilet was. He pointed and gave her directions towards the garden centre's cafe. She took a step towards the cafe, hesitated, then turned back around.

She walked over to a spot where we had piles of mulch stacked, unashamedly dropped her pants, and began defecating on the damp concrete floor. When she was done, she pulled up her pants, and walked inside, past the registers, ignoring the shocked looks of myself and the other employees, and exited the store. 

The trolley boy came over and uttered something along the lines of ""Did she just..."" to which I replied, ""I think so?"" Hesitantly, we kind of just stared in the direction of the mulch until I decided to investigate.

I walked over to the mulch. I could already smell it. Interestingly, she had found a random plastic bag and used it to 'hide' the poop... and when I say 'hide' I mean that the plastic bag was transparent and the poop was in no way hidden. 

So then I did what any good employee would, I cleaned up that strange woman's poop. And then I went on my lunchbreak.

I've had my fair share of mind blowingly amazing customers to the ones that make me ill when I see the start to come in, but today being Veteran's Day here in the States, I was reminded of this particular story.

We had a older couple that came in about once a week. The wife was a nice little old lady, always came into look for clothes, never said much. The husband, however, was a nightmare. He would come into the store and float about the front in the men's section and tended to be very rude. Didn't matter if I was on the phone, talking to a customer, in the middle of a transaction, all the way in the back of our store, he would just start shouting if he had a question. 

Husband: ""EXCUSE ME. HEY. EXCUSE ME. I HAVE A QUESTION. HOW MUCH IS THIS. THE TAG IS MISSING. WIFE, WHERE ARE YOU. EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. HEY. HEY. HEY. HEY. HEY. EXCUSE ME. QUESTION. I NEED A PRICE."" 

This would go on until one of us gave him attention. This would happen every time he came in. I don't believe he had a hearing problem, because he could hear us perfectly fine, and didn't yell when he was in line and cashing out. 

Now, this particular day the couple came in, and he was using his walker and all bundled up. Oddly enough, he just stayed by the door, quiet. I looked at him as I was helping customers, curious why he wasn't being obnoxious. Another little old man, wearing his Marines hat, is looking in my case, checking out some stuff.

Me:""Hey H, how's it going?""

H:""Oh you know. I'm getting old, my body isn't what it used to be. I don't sleep, my back hurts, I can't walk..."" he drones on about all his aches and pains.

Suddenly, the other little man turns around and just looks at him. H stops talking, and the other man says.

Man:""How old are you?""

H:""Just turned 73.""

Man:""Well, I'm 75. Did you go to Vietnam?""

Earlier that day, she bought her furniture, and went home just fine.

She was telling me that she needed this piece replaced because when she was putting it together, a drilled hole manifested itself on the side of her nightstand (she insisted that she didn't drill anything). I told her sure, we replace parts like this all the time, no problem.

She was so upset because this happened, that she wasted so much time buying this piece of furniture, that she had to make the very looonnnnggggg trip to and from the store today (she doesn't live far, the city she told me she lived in is about 20 min from our store). She told me that our store should pay for her gas bill, because she wasted money having to drive back to the store to replace a part she destroyed herself. 

I just told her that I didn't have the power to make that call, so I just brought my manager over to deal with it. She gave this customer a $20 gift card for her ""troubles.""",You should pay for my gas bill!!!,37
Chalkius,8,10,1qffwr,34,"First post on here, hopefully my job doesn't give me too much cause to post here much more!

Basically I work in a grocery shop in the UK. I'm sometimes I'm off the tills doing other stuff like tidying the shop, putting out stock, etc. But most of the time as I'm the newest staff member I'm usually on the tills. 

I've gotten quite adept at processing items quickly. And the shop I work in has quite small areas for me to place the processed items. So if they're still unloading items, I'll usually start scanning their first items through until I can't safely/reasonably put any more through, and I'll sit back and wait for them to finish loading up. I don't put any pressure on them to speed up, I like having this chill time especially when it's busy. 

One day though had a customer who as soon as I touched the first item, shouted(not asked) at me to leave it, and not to process anything as she didn't want to rush. I stopped, and tried politely to explain that I wasn't trying to pressure her and as far as I was concerned she could go at whatever pace she liked, but I wasn't allowed to get a word in. Anything I tried to say got shot down. 'I know you're meant to do do this at a certain pace but I'm the customer so you do what I say'(not exact words, was a few months ago, I'm paraphrasing). 

So I waited until she was done, and then started processing items. At one point she knocked a yogurt off the till. I wasn't looking at her so didn't know if she'd seen it, but went to pick it up and said politely something along the lines of 'Oh, something's fallen off there', to which I got the response 'No, you don't fucking say', in a sarcastic and quite hostile tone. I gave up trying to help her at that point, finished scanning the items. Asked her for payment without saying please(about as far as I could get away with getting back at her), she paid, and went on her way, muttering about terrible service. I was quite bemused by the whole thing and wondering if it was something I'd done wrong. The next customer started off by saying what an awful woman the first customer was though, and my deputy manager caught the tail end of it, and was about to step in before I gave them a look and mouthed that it was ok. 

Was fairly early on for me as an employee, so I wasn't used to rude customers at that point, still haven't had many. We get a few though. One shouted at my colleague for not being able to locate an item which we didn't even stock because the ad in the paper was for a different shop, before chastising her when she served her on the tills, and called our manager incompetent(which he's not, he's a really good boss, works hard, knows his stuff, is fair and reasonable). And we get the odd customer who comes in, gets a lot of stuff, before attempting to pay by credit card, which we don't take(and there are signs for this at the front door and before you get to the till), and then decides to walk off in a huff or blame the cashier for what is store policy......leaving them to put back all the items, before anyone has time to point out that there's an ATM about 2 mins walk from the shop that they could get money from.....

Anyway, if you've bothered to read through all that, thanks for reading it. Let me know if your experience is similar!",Being shouted at by a customer for being quick at my job...plus other comments from someone new to retail,44

FoUfCfK,14,19,1qfeiz,41,"I work at a used sporting good store where people buy and sell all sorts of used sports equipment. If I'm helping someone pick out a pair of shoes for whatever sport their looking for obviously my first question is what size they are looking for. 

People give a wide range of answers. Some know their shoe size. Others have to check the inside of the their shoe. But the worst people are the ones that demand to have their or their child's foot measured.

Unfortunately we don't have a foot measuring device as it would be completely pointless to have one when it comes to used shoes. Some shoes have been worn less, some are broken in more or stretched out. The information a shoe measuring device would give us would be completely useless. 

So I had a customer the other day and the conversation went something like this:

Me: Hello, can I help you find anything?

Customer: We're looking for wrestling shoes.

Me: Sure, right this way. What size are you looking for?

Customer: I don't know, they're for him. (7-8 year old)

Me: Oh ok, what size are you wearing bud? (to the kid)

Kid: *shrugs*

Me: Well we can just check inside your shoe and see what you're wearing right now.

Customer: No, just measure his foot, those shoes don't fit him anymore.

Me: Oh, sorry we don't have a foot measuring thing. We can just get a rough idea from these and have him try a few on.

Customer: What do you mean you don't have a shoe measurer?

Me: Well we don't really use one because all the different brands fit differently and can be many sizes apart. 

Customer: You should really get one, how are people supposed to know what size to get?

Me: (starting to get a little annoyed because we were busy) Well you just try them on. If they fit those are probably the ones you want to get.

Customer: Fine. (wanders off while I help the child try on shoes) 

Took me about 2 pairs of shoes before we found some that the kid liked and fit him well. I ring them up, thank them, and tell them to have a nice day!

Customer: Yeah, you should really get a shoe measurer.

shitty-photoshopper,5,5,1qf5cf,40,"**TLDR: Cow tits, cow of coworker, no I won't override something that is obviously stolen.**

**Also, obligatory wall of text warning**

Background:I work on the front-end of my grocery store on the customer service desk. I get a lot of odd jobs, because technically we have two people that can work the service desk most of the time (service desk person and a person with the keys to the safe, usually referred to as ""the office""). Opening consists (usually) of a self-checkout person, (who is supposed to run a register, too) service desk, and the office person. 


Today, I had an annoying coworker (she also knows how to work the service desk) on self-checkout, (let's call her AC for annoying coworker).  I start my shift (7a-11a), (opening) the first thirty minutes is uneventful. 

At around 7:30, I notice the store manager (quick! Look busy!) walking up to the service desk (he was on vacation, so this was kind of surprising). The MoD called him in. 

He asked me to help the dairy/frozen dept., so I dutifully trek to the back and ask the dairy/frozen guy (DG for dairy guy) what he needs, and he informs me that the coolers lost power and we had to pull EVERYTHING from the shelves (we don't have a particularly large dairy/frozen dept. but it is still a ton of stuff). A person from pricing was helping, too (let's call her PG for pricing girl).

So we start piling stuff into milk crates, and stacking them on pallets. After we made 3 pallets, we ran out of milk crates. 

At about 9:00, I get paged on the PA system by AC. So I grab the nearest intercomm, and tell her to pick up.

Me: What do you need?

AC: Can you come cashier?

Me: are you backed up?

AC: No. I don't want to do it anymore

Me:umm

AC: You have a line *click* 

Me: WTF??? 

So I walk up to the front, and sure enough, I have a line. Now I told her to call the office person if she needed anything, and she was standing right there when the store manager told me to go do dairy/frozen. 

I take care of my line (as any good retail slave does).

Me: Please don't call me up here anymore, we have a ton of stuff to do. Ask the office person first, I can't run up here every five minutes.

AC: Okay.

So I trek to the dairy dept. and continue pulling items.

About 9:10

AC *over the PA* ""Shitty, your needed to the front""

Me *Over the PA* ""Ac, line one, please""

AC: yes?
 
Me: What do you need?

AC: I need a cashier

Me:*store manager* told me to do this. I can't come up front.

AC: But who will cashier?

Me: aren't you available to do it?

AC: Well I'm busy

Me: but you have been talking to me for the past minute? So I'm confused. Could you ask *office person* to clarify? 

AC:okay

*I hang up*

AC *over the PA* ""*store manager* your needed to register one""

MoD *over the intercomm* ""AC, line one""

-thirty seconds later-

AC *over the PA* ""cancel *store manager*""


All of my coworkers start laughing, because we all know the MoD told her to grow up and do it herself. 

Back to the dairy dept:

We filled up the pallets and ran out of milk crates with a bunch of stuff still left. So we start grabbing carts. 14 carts total. 

So after we pulled everything, the frozen manager (FM for short) (dairy manager was out of town on vacation) shows up. Me and PG went on lunch while DG and FM figured out what they were going to do.

After lunch, we set about cleaning the dairy cooler (it was nasty). I went to go find a step ladder while everyone else cleaned the lower shelves. I walk up to the service desk and guess who is behind it? None other than AC! She is helping a customer, and calls me over. So I dutifully walk over, dreading the interaction. 

AC: I need an override

Me: for what?

AC *gesturing wildly*: this! 

Me: ... I need to know what is going on before I override

AC: He is returning this

AC shows me a brand new looking box of toothbrush brushes (the really expensive electric ones). I check it over to see if it had been opened (no). (red flag 1)

Me: How much is it?

AC: I don't know

I do a price check, it cost 46 dollars. (red flag 2)

Me: do you have the receipt?

Customer(who looks shifty): No. (alarm bells)

Me: Without a receipt, I need a manager's approval to complete the return. 

me *over the PA: ""*MoD* your needed to the service desk""

I grabbed my step ladder, and started to walk back, on my way, I ran into MoD and told them the situation (later they told me they looked at the video and found the guy stealing it). 

After finally scrubbing down all the shelves, we started stock with back stock, so we knew what we needed for the ""emergency"" order (The warehouse was going to pull and ship the order first thing, since we would have 0 stock on some items). At around 4, we finished the back stock. PG left at 3, and DG left at 4 (they had gotten there at 6, so FM let them leave earlier than me). Leaving me and FM to do the normal dairy/frozen stuff (stocking the coolers that didn't break, stocking  cheese, checking rotation, etc, etc.) FM writes me a list and explains everything I need to do, so he can put the order in, so the warehouse can get it ready. 

I finally left at 6pm.

I have to be back at 6am to help with the truck.

The FM said the order has 600 boxes.

**Story**: This one's from the service desk. Our shift managers came up to cash a check for $300 and change. I come to find out that one of them bought something for the store-rented something for a promotion and this is the reimbursement. Whatever. It's made out to the one who types in his social, so we're good. Run it, done.

kaggzz,23,46,1qf10t,235,"This is a really old story.  I was working for this company that is currently considered a fossil.  It was like a Redbox that you could walk in to, but with a ton more movies.  Oh and most of the movies were on this format called VHS (DVDs were just really becoming a thing).  We had a lot more movies, especially old ones, compared to Redbox, and we were more a fan of blue than red.

This particular store was in a fairly well-to-do neighborhood.  The plaza has one of the worst parking lots of all time.  Not a day went by without some sort of almost accident, and sometimes there was no almost about it.  I got backed in to about once a year.  Many people would park in the fire lane (about the only safe place to park) to throw a movie in our drop box, to pick up or drop off a passenger, or to grab a to-go order from one of the many restaurants.  If you were there for thirty seconds, nobody cares.  If you wanted to be there longer... Well it didn't help the flow of traffic for one and it's a general evil thing to do.  

Enter Richie McLatefee.  

RML is a regular sort of customer- the one who is too important for the rules to matter to them.  RML is hand-returning a movie he was suppose to have back a week ago, but because he is so important, he is not going to pay the late fee.  All too common a thing.  Dr. McLatefee, MD, DDS, PhD, PsyD, ESQ., DDT, EX CT., has their brand new limited edition Mercedes parked in the fire lane outside of store.  To make this understandable, he has a car that costs six figures parked illegally to yell at a couple of register jockeys over a $5 late fee he knows he owes.  Now if they had been cool about it, we'd probably have cut the fees in half, instead he is on the ten minute mark of a tirade that has more curse words than I thought was possible about how Richie McLatefee is a better breed of human being compared to us scum who are forced to wear a polo with a corporate logo and a collar that's a completely different color from the rest of the shirt, and that it is somehow our fault that he did not return his movie in a timely fashion.  Our hero, the Mall Cop we shall call Awesome enters.  He would breeze by every so often, basically just making sure that everything was OK and maybe to hang with us as he was wont to do.  After listening for a minute, Awesome comes up to the register, interrupting DML mid stream of vulgarity. 

**Awesome** :Excuse me, sir, is that your car outside?

**RML** : Yes- It is.  Now buzzoff (I've edited this by removing the cussing, also we're talking about an incident over a decade ago)

**Awesome** :OK, just want to tell you it's in a fire zone and you might want to move it soon.

**RML** : Whatever you wage slave.  I can't believe I have to crawl in this putrescence and lower myself to deal with scum like this.  That man in the polyester shirt and tin badge almost touched me!  I could buy every one in here ....

RML pretty much stopped for breath never.  Awesome left.  At this point the entire staff was so desensitized to the whole entitled customer thing that we pretty much let him wash over us like so many nagging doubts about life.  I happened to turn to watch Awesome leave, in part because I was hoping he was going to stay and save us all.  He went right out to stand in front of RML's car, his little cart was behind.  Giving DML only half an ear (it was usually a good idea to ignore these sort of customers as we'll be sending him to collections sooner rather than later), I watch Awesome count down one minute, the go back to his golf cart.  He grabs this giant orange square from his cart, plastering one on the driver's and passenger's side of RML's over priced car.  Calm as you please, Awesome comes back in to the store, grinning.  As am I.

**Awesome** : Just thought you should know the tow truck is about 5 minutes away.  I got the info, so bye!

**RML** : And the polyester blend is back!  My god do you have any idea who I am?

Awesome stayed in the store, and the three of us block Richie McLatefee's view of his car.  Hell we even got to the point where we gave him some sort of hope that we would waive the late fees to keep him there.  We even manage to keep his attention till the tow truck operator puts a hand on his car.  In this state, that means he is officially towed.  RML's car is hooked up, we send his account to collections, and Awesome is out there laughing and yelling at RML for parking illegally.

I was three minutes away from the end of my shift when I see an elderly mother and her middle aged daughter getting really expensive sheets.  
My eyes turn into cartoon dollar signs while I finish ringing out my current customer.  
They have chosen the most expensive sheets in the store, but before I can start ringing them they pull out an ad.  
Daughter: This says, ""800 thread sheet set for $99.99, I want the flat, fitted, and pillowcases for $99.99.""  
Me: Uhhh, I don't think this comes in a set.

Daughter: Well the ad says it does, so I want these for the price. Call your manager, this is false advertising.  
Me: Ooookay.  
I call the manager and he shows up. Feigns ignorance and starts looking for the sheets that don't exist.

Alright, no big deal.

It wasn't mud. 

There was yellow orange shit (probably c. diff) all over the entryway, including the placemat, the handles, the windows, outside on the doormat and door, etc. All of this is tracked down the hallway (that is directly next to the front door) towards the bathroom.

My colleague is only a teenager,  and this is her first voyage into this wonderful world of customer service. I've seen her cry, I've seen her take insults personally, I've seen her frantically apologise for things completely beyond her control, but I knew that once upon a time I was just like her, and that developing a thick skin takes a while. Today, she finally stood up to a customer!

He had been screaming at her for five minutes and more, doing the typical angry customer spiel of demanding the moon on a fucking stick, and initially, she dealt with him as usual - apologise, sympathetic noise, and repeat. This was to no avail, he just wouldn't stop screaming. Finally, she manages to tell him that this really isn't something she can deal with.

Customer: ""I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY NO-ONE WANTS TO HELP ME?!?""

And now comes the point when I wanted to burst into spontaneous applause. She set back her shoulders, looked him square in the eye, and said:

""Well sir, when you come into a shop, and decide to scream at an advisor, refusing to listen to anything they say, and generally abusing them, it's not exactly surprising that the advisor may be LESS INCLINED TO HELP YOU, sir.""

Betelgeuse2040,69,117,1qekfj,552,"So I used to work at a Retail store that for the purposes of this story we shall call ""Paper Clips"".  This story will take some minor setup just to describe how the store is set up.  We have one main desk that is at the front of the store and works like a customer service/checkout/Tech Support combo pack.  To the right of the Front Desk is a ""one-way"" enter door that only opens to people entering the store.  To the left side of the desk is the actual door that allows you to exit the store.  Right in front of the service desk is our selection of tablets which as you can imagine is quite popular with they young kids and sort of allows the adults to shop in peace as their kids play games.

On this particular day a Mom comes in with her 3 kids(we'll say the oldest was about 8 and the youngest 6) and starts shopping.  The oldest of course immediately goes to the tablets and starts playing games, oblivious to the rest of the world.  The mother starts to finish her shopping and warns the kids to stop playing games and get ready to leave.  The 8 year old boy of course ignores her completely absorbed in a game of Angry Birds (or whatever he was playing).  As I am checking this lady out her two youngest get ready to leave with their mom and abandon their games like good kids.  She gives the oldest two more warnings by the time I finish up her order, but he keeps playing and shrugs her off.

This is where her Epic Parenting kicks in.  She looks at me, says thank you for ringing me up takes one last direct look at her oldest kid still playing the game frowns and and then leaves the store.  I look at the oldest kid for a minute and watch her load up her bags and kids into the car.  At this point I get worried cause I really don't want her to leave the kid behind (too much paperwork).  So I turn to the kid and say ""Hey kid!  Your mom is leaving you behind.""

Now then at the same time he turns around looks for his Mom, she is actually slowly driving away in her car (essentially looking like she is leaving him behind, but not really).  Kid goes into FULL PANIC mode and runs the wrong way to our door that only opens for incoming customers and realizing it isn't opening starts trying to pry it open with his bare hands like he is about to be killed by zombies or something.  Kid also starts yelling for his mom and is almost in tears (I am too but it's because I am laughing so hard).  Now our doors aren't really heavy but for a 8 year old it would probably be like trying to pry open a steel trap.  The mom meanwhile is slowly driving away along the front of our store.  I'm in tears laughing so hard and was about to help the kid, but my Manager got there first and managed to flip the reset switch at the top of the door which made it open for the kid.  The mother sees this happen and stops the car to let her kid catch up and jump in.  I catch her gigantic smile as she drives off probably knowing he will never do something like that again.  My manager looks at me confused as hell wondering what was going on and I tell him ""she was going old school parenting on him"" which gets a nod and smile from him as he goes back to the office.

Tldr: Kid plays games and doesn't listen to mother and gets fake ""left behind"" to teach him a lesson.  laughs were had.

They make jokes with me, some cheesy and some honestly laugh-out-loud funny, and all in all are a great bunch of people.

But there is always bad side to every good. There is one regular that comes into my store that I dread seeing. She seems to be autistic in some way and she never has any caretakers with her. However cares for her just lets her roam the store and it's not like she doesn't understand what's going on but she yells at people and is so rude it's unbelievable.

Backstory: Last week I rang up a person that was just an absolute miserable cow. 

Justice: I encountered said cow again on Saturday when she stopped me as I was walking by her with another customer to show them where something was. The Cow shoved her take-a-number-ticket at me and said in front of the 10 or so other people that were also standing around with their numbers, ""I'm in a hurry. Can't you just take care of this for me right now?"" 

 I was momentarily stunned that she would say this loud enough for other people who were also waiting to hear her. Then I shrugged and said, ""Sorry, you'll have to wait in line like everyone else."" And I walked away with the person I was helping.

melkaynun,5,11,1qeg7r,34,"During high school I worked at a department store in the mall. 


For a while we had quite a few attempts at people returning things that they hadn't bought. We had just went through a change in store policy and our return policy now stated that you could return any item, any time. You didn't even need a receipt. 


What customers would do is steal things from a different store a few towns over, come to our store and try to return them (without a receipt since they didn't need them) for either cash (which we technically could do) or a store voucher that they would then go sell to someone else for cheaper than the amount it had on it (since they were still making money).

I have two separate instances.

The first instance a lady came in with about TEN different dresses. All rang up over $30, some even hitting $70. Right off the back I was suspicious that they were stolen.


I asked her if there was anything wrong with them and she said no that she just didn't like them. The problem was that this women was probably a size 6. She had dresses, all different styles, ranging from size 2 all the way up to 18. Of course she would have known not to buy a size 18 because that is not even close to her size, same goes for the 2.


I told her since it was such a big order that I was going to call my manager so that he could look for her receipt in the computer (which is something that can be done by the manger but really its just a way to scare them from trying to scam up). She then said that it was okay she would be fine if I just gave her a store voucher. I said that I  needed a manger to look it up because of its price no matter how she gets the money back.


As my manger is walking over she decides that she doesn't want to return them anymore and that she'd go home and look for her receipt. Unfortunately she left with the dresses but at least she didn't end up with money in her hand.


The second story is basically the same except the lady said that she was returning some jeans that she bought her young son. Again, the jeans were ranging from 4T to a young boys size L. These are even close in size, they were also Levi's one of our more expensive brands. my manager had seen her upstairs carrying a plastic bag that was EMPTY and when she came downstairs it was full of jeans. She actually got caught by our LP and got in trouble.


I just don't get it... If you're going to try and return something that you ""didn't like"" or it ""didn't fit"" at least have all the same size or sizes that are similar. I get it if you bought a medium and a large and the large was too big so you are returning it but if you are stealing things that obviously don't fit you....

HeloRising,39,46,1qe567,226,"At the behest of another redditor, a story from my pottery hawking month (I didn't really like the job, what can I say?).

A couple of years back I worked at a store that you buy unfired pottery from and you are provided with paint to decorate it. We then take the piece in the back, fire it in the kiln, and give it back a few days later.

We had a customer come in who had far more money than sense. She spent almost $1,000 on plates and cups that she decorated (rather unoriginally) herself. Whatever. It's her dime. One week she came back and was so pleased with the plates she wanted to do a cup, a very special cup for her morning coffee.

This piece she took some time with and I have to admit it looked pretty good. After several hours of fairly painstaking work she gave us her masterpiece. That's when it got...interesting:

Customer: Now, I understand these take a few days.

Me: Indeed they do. We only fire them when we have a full load for the kiln. The back is almost full so I'd say swing by tomorrow and we should have it ready in the morning.

Customer: Oh, I was hoping to be here when it was fired.

Me: We usually do that at night. The owner comes by and actually turns the kilns on but we'll load them tonight after closing.

Customer: Well...could I come in extra early? I *really* want to be here when my cup gets fired.

Me: That's not really my call but there's really nothing to see. The kilns look like big bricks with some metal bands on them and they just heat up.

Customer: I remember last time you told me there was a chance the piece would be destroyed in the firing process.

Me: Yes. It's rare but it does happen. A fault in the bisque (un-glazed pottery) that we can't see.

Customer: Alright, well I'd like to be here when my piece is fired in case something goes wrong.

Me: Uh...There's not much you can do if it does. Actually there's not *anything* you can do. The inside of the kiln is extremely hot and opening it would most likely be...unpleasant.

Customer: Oh...but I want to be sure my piece is alright.

This goes back and forth for about ten minutes. Eventually I agree to call the manager and ask permission, to shut her up if for no other reason. The manager's response verbatim; ""Tell her to stop eating the fucking paint, get rid of the lunatic."" 

The nice version of that response was not well received so I decided to break down how the kiln worked. I didn't want to just scream ""**because of reasons!**"" in her face as she was apt to spend large amounts of money there and my boss, unhelpful reply aside, would have been sore if she'd gone away unhappy.

The technical response initiated an exchange most parents are familiar with; ""The pieces need a lot of heat to set properly."" ""Why?"" ""Because of the glaze we put on them."" ""Why do you use that glaze?"" Eventually we cycle back around to the fact that opening the kiln while it was running would likely kill her.

She took that warning with all the dignity and acceptance she'd bee-no actually she asked why. Again. I sank into the chair behind the register and in the most defeated tone I could possibly put together, I replied;

""Because...fire? Flesh good. Fire bad."" 

She clearly didn't understand what I was talking about but she did at least see that my patience was running low and she nodded, said she'd be back in the morning, and left. ","""...Because fire?""",272
IronyJudge,30,24,1qe3i9,85,"This is going to be very long. Sorry, but damn was it an interesting day.

I can't really speak for all of retail, but there's a very certain way corporate animal based stores work. We have very separate realms for animals we're taking care of in the store, and products we sell. We've got the fixtures and setup for the animals we have in back, and then the tanks which we have the animals up for sale in. Nowhere in this process is things we have on the floor for sale to customers. Separate SKUs, separate ordering, even separate managers who take care of them.

It was a relatively normal Saturday. Saturdays are easily our busiest day, and we're well staffed. We had recently brought on three new people who were on the floor mostly in the “I'll help you find it!” capacity. All three were working this day, and had taken a liking to me since I was roughly their age and in their eyes know what I'm talking about. Beyond them it was the manager, who has a functional but not specialized knowledge of animal care, and the cashier who refuses to be anything but a cashier.

I go on lunch. Eat my sandwich. Play around on my phone. Delightful. I go to the coffee shop across the street, and talk to the people at the Farmer's Market for a while. Everything was great. No grumpy customers so far during the day. No technical glitches. All peachy.

As I'm walking up to punch back in from lunch one of the new girls comes up to me and goes “We've got an issue.”

I'm expecting a dead mouse or something, which is a very low key affair. After I punch in the manager tells me to talk to another one of the new people who saw the events transpire. I find her and she wordlessly brings me over to the main desk in the animal part of the store. There's a cart, with an opened bag of cat food in it. Inside the bag of cat food (which had a different food inside it than the bag actually was, strangely) were two extremely large turtles. Somebody had decided the best way to get rid of the turtles was to abandon them in the store without telling anybody.

I feel I've gained a reputation on this page for stories about turtles. This reputation has to include the fact that turtles are very cost intensive animals. They need massive tanks, massive heaters, massive filters, massive places to sit and bask under their massive basking lamp. A pet turtle is not a cheap endeavor, and will easily set you back 400 to 500 dollars. Do not get a pet turtle, unless you're into really cool animals you can't snuggle. I love feeding the ones we have in the store, but beyond that you can't really pet them and play games. 

Keep in mind we can't exactly pull all of the necessary equipment off the shelf. We easily possess this equipment, but considering I'm apparently in charge of this operation I'd get my ass reamed for doing so. No matter how necessary, you can't take $500 off the shelves then do it twice.

Two full grown turtles sitting in a small bucket situated in a bag of cat food which has been opened and replaced with a different brand of cat food. By this point I wasn't even trying to hide the fact I'm a foul mouthed cynic. With customers perfectly within earshot I was giving my true thoughts on the situation. After I was done swearing I sat in the office spinning around in the chair trying to come up with a plan.

We can't put them in with the turtles we have on the floor because they're nearly three times the size, and come from god knows where with god knows what pathogens. We have to set them up independently. 

1: Get all of the biggest tanks we have for our overstock animals, and re-purpose them to house turtles. This required taking the largest tanks we had currently in use, setting up new smaller tanks for the overstock hamsters (hamsters are assholes and are one-per-tank, eating a lot of room), and then cleaning out the 'big' tanks to within an inch of their life. 

2: Set up these tanks (half the size of a real setup) for turtles. This went by with many problems, as one tank full of water (8.3 pounds of water per gallon, times 20 gallons) wound up on the floor. Requiring extensive cleanup to get all the shards of glass off the ground as well as 15 gallons of water. Down one 'large' tank we had to get another one and evict the poor hamster from it. 

3: Place turtles in tank. This meant we had to get a tank set up for them the best we could. We had the lights ready to go in store-use, but had to grab filters off the shelf. Taking things off the shelf and putting them to store use is one of the most annoying red-tape filled things you can do. The MOD at the time had to call up the GM at home to get approval for it. It was fun listening to the Yosemite Sam cursing on the other end of the line. We got approval for two twenty gallon filters. 

4: Have one of the new people sift through the bag and find a third full grown turtle buried in the cat food.

Wait …......... Mother. Fucker.

We're out of tanks at this point. We can't just take a $115 item off the shelf to re-purpose for store use. As much as it pained me to do it I took the two smaller of the turtles and housed them together. We then took some of the hidey-holes for the guinea pigs and converted them into basking spots inside the tank, weighed down by bags of aquarium gravel. One of the turtles decided to shred one of the bags and pour gravel all over the place, but that is relatively unimportant to the saga. 

Then we encountered the astoundingly foreseeable problem that we didn't have enough outlets in our back room. We needed 6 outlets for this operation, and there were 2. This required me to leave the store, drive to the nearest hardware store, and purchase a power strip for as cheaply as possible. I'm still a little afraid that the $3 power strip I got will at some point burn down the entire strip mall. Why we didn't have a power strip available for the task I've yet to get a good answer on.

We finally got the turtles set up in back. With 5 people working on the job it took us 3 hours when all was said and done. Then somebody asked the question on everybody's minds. What now?

Turtles are the slowest selling animal in the store. They're not too expensive themselves, but the $400 birds go faster. Three full grown turtles, each requiring a $500 setup are absolutely impossible to move no matter how you look at it. We called around the specialty stores in the area, which all flatly refused to take them, most likely for space reasons themselves and I bear no hostility towards them. So we're left with three very large, very resource intensive turtles in our back room which have no hope of going out the door.

One further problem we ran into was the filter cartridges. I wound up coming in every other day despite working or not and replacing the carbon in the filters with carbon I extracted from the spare filters for our aquariums, and then rinsing out the cartridge itself. I'd head into the store on the way home from school. It was a pretty routine thing for a while.

This went on for a month and a half. Meanwhile the MOD the day the turtles came in was also working to get rid of them for the time span. This went far up the chain of command, to the VP in charge of the 8 state region. After hearing how big our turtles were, a commercial breeder 1500 miles away agreed to take them in. We didn't care at this point if we got any money out of them. We just wanted them gone. The three turtles are now living out their days at a nice farm in bayou country.

If you go into a store that sells these turtles, there's a small but real chance that they may be descendants of these three.",Another Turtle Story,109

Finally they headed up to the cash and wrap where I was working to check out. 

I'm ringing them up making small talk (that's how I found the girl was starting college) and trying to push accessories and credit cards like a good working drone. I rang up one really ugly sweater for $49 and the mom reached across the counter and grabbed my arm. 

MOM: ""That's on sale.""

ME: ""I'm sorry ma'am, it didn't ring up on sale, let me go check the signs to see what's up.""

I walk over to the table and see a sign that says ""TANKS 2 FOR $20"" and there are both tanks and sweaters on the table. 

ME: ""Ok, I went and checked and it's actually the tank tops that are on promotion right now, not the sweaters""

MOM: ""Well that's false advertising, you need to sell it to me for the sale price""

ME: ""You mean $10? It's a $50 sweater ma'am, we would never have a promotion giving 80% off a new item, and the sign is clear that the sale is on tanks""

I worked, up until not too long ago when I got fed up with it, as a shift manager for a bowling alley. Great customers mostly, still friends with a lot of them. Nice co-workers. Crappy boss. Cheap corporation. 

One Saturday afternoon I was running the shift. We had several birthday parties scheduled. As soon as she walked in I recognized one of the birthday girls. Nice enough kid. Then I started to recognize her party's guests. I realized somewhere along the line that I was recognizing each and every guest of hers. I knew some of them quite well from coaching baseball and helping at their elementary school.

Finally I figured out what was going on. She'd invited all of her fifth grade classmates. Save one, that is. The one she didn't invite was my son. For some reason--and to this day we haven't figured out why--her mother hates my wife. She didn't allow her daughter to invite my son. When I figured this out I was really, really perturbed. 

As manager, I need to check on parties' hosts to make sure they're happy. Naturally I did. In my best customer service voice I said to dad that we were glad they were there and since little Hermione (not her real name) was in my son Ron's (not his real name) class, if they ever wanted to come in again they should call me first and I'd give them a discount.

It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve. This story has absolutely nothing to do with that.

**STORY:**  My daughter and I spent the day in an Orlando theme park yesterday (not run by a mouse). Not the best idea, since it was a holiday weekend, but she loves Harry Potter, and I love here, so daddy will brave the crowds when she really wants to go.

While we were browsing in one of the stores, I saw some crazy lady going off on a poor cashier. I made my way near them so I could hear what was going on, partly because I felt like I should say something to the shitty customer, but mostly because I’m nosy as hell.

The customer was ranting about the price of something, and was basically accusing the cashier of trying to rip her off for charging so much. I honestly didn’t catch what item she was upset about, but apparently whatever it was, justified screaming at the poor female cashier behind the counter.

The female cashier had to be in her teens, and she honestly looked like she was about to break down and cry at any time. I REEEEEALLY wanted to step in and say something to the loudmouth, but I was worried about getting into an argument with some stranger in front of my daughter.

Enter the store manager.

The guy comes rushing over and plants himself between the screaming lady and the cashier. He did it so smoothly, I was jealous. He walked behind the counter and with a quick movement, used his arm to gently move the cashier back while placing himself in the line of fire. While he was moving the cashier back and stepping in-between them, he was looking at the screaming lady. By stepping in, he broke the customers’ eye contact with the cashier, and took it over for himself.

Smooth brother, smooth!

Then, even more impressively, he told the ranting customer that if she was unhappy with the price SHE SHOULD LEAVE! 

For those of you unfamiliar with theme parks in Orlando, this is definitely not the way it’s usually handled. Too often, the screaming guests get away with just about anything. Watching the outcome definitely made me feel good, and I was glad to see a manger stand up and put an unreasonable customer in their place.

Ten minutes later I was spending $117.65 for an “Authentic Ravenclaw Robe”. Maybe the lady was right.

jdpatric,8,23,1qdpao,113,"I used to work at a small hardware store that got all sorts of people who would try to scam us. The most common was ""it didn't work."" I understand sometimes an object you buy simply does not do what you had hoped it would. This happens, and when it did the store would take back almost anything...within reason. Example: we had a guy trying to cut a large lock. It was a beefy lock that he'd put on the roof hatch of his trailer and lost the key to it.

Needs bolt cutter guy (NBCG) - I need bolt cutters (duh).

Me - Here's the one's I'd use for a lock of that size (I went out and looked at the culprit for him first).

NBCG - That's way too much; how much for that smaller one there?

Me - Less (I forget exactly), but it's not rated for the size you're looking at...it probably wont cut it. The lock's also probably hardened so it will be even worse.

NBCG - I'm after cheap, give me the little one.

An hour later he tried to return the bolt cutters because they didn't work. My manager kindly told him no.

The above was simply an example though...the real one that gets me is as follows.

There was an Asian food place in the same complex as the hardware store. They used to like to dump their trash (incredibly foul smelling) into our RECYCLING dumpster because they were too stupid to illegally dump in the right dumpster : / so they were on my shit list to begin with.

The old manager had once gone to their store to help them fix something and they had been using hot water heating elements to cook food and had extension cords draped across vats of boiling oil. Not good. He left, wouldn't even take a look at it for fear of his own life/liability.

Well, there was this one guy who worked at that store who was either the owner or a manger of some sorts. He'd come in periodically to buy new water heater elements. One day he comes in looking for a new heater element and a pair of pliers to install said element.

He'd scammed us before, once he had switched the packaging on an item to try to save himself $4. We caught him. So when he walked to the back with a $20 pair of pliers we kept an eye on him. I was cashiering that day and after a few minutes he comes up to purchase the pliers and a new water heater element. I ring him up and he leaves. OK?

Later in the day he comes in to try to return the item. The manager looks at it and see's that it's obviously been used. The guy claims ""it didn't fit."" Which could have been the case...except that he'd been in the back trying it on all of our water heater fittings to make sure it fit ALL of them. He only used the ones from our store to cook his food. One of our guys HELPED him even. The manager tells him ""no,"" and he leaves without putting up much of a fight.

This would have been the end, but this guy had to take it the extra mile. About half an hour later this guy's **7 year old son** comes in and tries to return the item that his dad had told him to return. The kid had with him his two younger siblings as well...maybe 4 and 5. The guy tried to get his little kid to return the item. We were really nice to the kids, but we told them that their dad would have to return the item. He'd given them his credit card and everything for the refund.

I never saw the guy again (he wasn't a regular, but only bought his ""supplies"" from our store because we were close), but the manager did a few times and simply refused to help him.

Scriblon,12,11,1qdnb7,49,"Might be a bit long winded and boring compared to others, but it is my first. Plz, be gentle :P .

**Background:** I work in a grocery store as a cashier, which has an acronym when said aloud makes you sound like you just had a moment of enlightenment. It is a nice shop, great team. The area this store is located in is not a bad one. It got problems, but relatively speaking I do not have to deal with a lot of BS on a daily basis. Until one day a middle-aged, heavy-set, man gets to my register about 15 minutes before closing on a Sunday. Along with him he had a few foodstuffs on the belt. However, he also had a plastic bag. Not a strange sight in stores like these, but this one was clearly not empty.  

**The Story**  
M: Me  
BM: Bag man

M: ""Can I see your bag, please?""  *I ask as required by protocol.*

BM: ""No. There is nothing in it anyway.""

*A red flag popped up, but I was convinced this man would not do such a thing. Most of the time it is just a wallet, or an other bag. Other times people get something from the neighboring drugstore, or something from our competition across the street. But the first didn't even open today and our competition closes a few hours ahead before us on that particular day. Even then I would not have made a big fuss about it whenever they got a valid receipt, even against better judgment. Either way, I always finish with a friendly reminder to leave the bag at our help desk next time around, as it is one of our house rules and prevents them from this situation occurring again.*

M: I insist I need to see the bag, reminded it is our house rules and said: ""If it is nothing, I will make nothing from it.""

With great hesitation he finally complied and showed the contents of his bag to me.

*The moment he opened the bag, alarm bells were ringing. There were clearly products in them out of our store. Some even had our store brand and our pricing tags on it.*

M: ""Sir, do you have a receipt for that?""

BM: ""No, I thought I didn't need it as it is just a few things.""  

*Indeed, it was about 5 products. Cheese (store brand), toothpaste, and some other small stuffs. Not something I would have considered 'worth stealing'. But still. Next up, ringing the on-shift manager. Even though we were already in the 10 minute mark before closing, he could still be able to look through the security tapes. Even though it would not prove if things were added to the bag during his stay in the store, it would at least mean I got his permission to either hold him or to just let it go. But at this hour it would mostly mean he was free to go anyway. Even if it is against better judgment.*

So while I was on the intercom calling the on-shift manager. BM is starting to make a bit of a fuss: ""It really comes from another store."" *We have multiple in the city.* ""I just realized I forgot some things, thats all.""

M: I really wanted to leave it with that, and believe that story. I initiate my small talk subroutines as I didn't want to make that call, though. So I just assured him that it was a formality. And let him know that I could not finish the transaction like this, now the on-shift manager was already on his way. But then this question got out: ""When did you buy it before?""  

BM: ""Just now."" 

*'Ok', I thought. He could have been here or at the larger (XL, really, really, huge) store at the other side of the city as we were the only markets open at this hour of the Sunday. As I was the only cashier on the clock the entire evening (it was a slow day), I would have remembered him clearly.*

M: ""And where might that be?""

BM: ""The one under the viaduct.""

*This was a big red flag. Even I was baffled for a moment. That store closed way, way before us. Hours, that was not 'just now' even with my warped sense of time where a 'moment' could really mean 'up to 3 hours'.  
But I guess it showed a bit too much on my face.*

M: ""Ok, well. Let my manager get to you."" *I say as the manager finally showed up in the ally to my register.*

*Now, here I made the mistake not keeping an eye on the costumer. I was... well, looking at the manager approach my register. And there the costumer took his chance.*

BM: ""I think I have a receipt in my car, just a moment.""

M: ""Ok, it would simplify things. Just leave the bag here please.""

*But he didn't leave the bag. He took it. I was trying to make my manager hurry up as he was clearly stalling a bit with a slow walk. The costumer left his stuff he had on the belt. As soon as the manager caught on, and actually saw what happened while I faced him. He was already gone. And the roar of a car, spinning away, made me realize how stupid I had been.  
The fun part afterward was that I had to stay a bit longer to register this as theft. Keeping the whole team in the store longer than needed.  
Welp, lesson learned.*

troubleinpink,25,24,1qdgrh,130,"I applied at this lingerie store because a) my friend (I'll call her M) is the assistant manager (we omitted this fact when I was applying- 'hiring friends' is usually frowned upon) and b) I need something flexible as I'm also a student. This has been my experience thus far:

-Get to interview, manager is running around unprepared because she has forgotten to call in the midday numbers.

-2 weeks after interview, manager calls and tells me ""I forgot that I wanted to hire you, I've been really busy. Can you work tomorrow?"" I tell her no, I can't work with that little notice, but I would be happy to start the next day. She tells me that's fine (I think she just wanted someone to cover her shift on Halloween) and she will call me monday to arrange a schedule.

-Friday: M calls and excitedly mentions that we are working together on Sunday. I find this strange because NOBODY HAS INFORMED ME THAT I EVEN WORK THERE. Remember that the manager has no idea that M and I know each other. She has no way of knowing that I have been informed of my being scheduled, and I wouldn't have ever known if M didn't call me.

-I showed up today and worked for 4 hours, mostly just to hang out with M and because I was curious to see if the manager would call at any point and realize her mistake. She didn't. None of this looks very promising for a stable work environment...

AshieeRose,52,24,1qd3xy,85,"So, for some background, I'm in a long distance relationship. We had planned to get together in December and spend Christmas together, after half a year of not seeing each other.

I was diagnosed with depression last month, so adjusting to coping mechanisms and antidepressants has been real hard. I haven't gone to any therapy, been trying to tackle it on my own. 

I let my boss know about this in August, and they said it was fine, so my SO and I start to plan things out, I save money up, and we get excited. I mention to them about filling out a leave form, this week, though, since I was going to buy tickets tomorrow, and it's all suddenly changed. 

First, they told me I had to break my part-time contract and step down to casual. That means I'd lose my sick leave, annual leave, and guaranteed hours. 

Today, I said I would break the contract to go. Wrote out that I would break the contract, signed it, and we left it at that. Five minutes after I went back to work, I'm called back in. 

And told that if I visit my SO in December, I'll be forced to resign. They have made me choose between my job and my SO, and said I need to hurry and make the decision because Christmas rosters are being worked on now.

All of a sudden there is a blackout period over December, and the only things that can grant you leave is pregnancy, a death, or serious injury/illness. Even full-timers who want to go away for Christmas using their annual leave, are being denied, 

My SO has told me that he will wait... so all plans for Christmas have been destroyed. I'll be busy as hell with work, he'll be busy with college, and now we don't have anything to look forward to. 

I'm... so. fucking. angry. They said yes in August. Now if I leave I have to quit. I've been saving up for months, getting money together for what we had planned. I was so fucking excited to see my SO again.

And now it's all come crashing down. I hate my life, I hate my job, fuck it all. I can see myself rage-quitting if a customer pushes me too far. 

I don't even know if they can do this, but this is what they told me today. I was so distraught that I had to go home early, I almost lost control of my car driving home in tears, and I'm having to rely really heavily on yoga to stop from relapsing.

flying_cup_club,16,11,1qcs41,33,"I worked on this big clothing retail store (they have stores all over the world) and I recall how obsessed the assistant manager and sales associates were about shoplifting. They were always suspicious of customers. It was very contradicting their actions, they either were brown nosing customers, asking if they needed any help, etc, or they would be watching certain customers very closely.
Since we did not have security, the SAs were in charge of rushing to the door whenever the sensors beeped. Even when people just got inside the store, if it beeped, they would be requested to show their bags.
Once there was a customer wearing one of our tops, which was from a recent collection. This SA went crazy on the store following the poor woman and announcing on the radio that she ""stole"" a top. I told her I SAW the woman entering the store wearing that very top, yet she kept following her.
This same SA would drop all of her go backs on tables when the sensors beeped. It was so embarrassing, for all the involved - the SA and the customers being harassed by her. The other customers just watched amused at her dropping everything on every beeping.
They also would sell clothes that were ripped, stained, with missing buttons or broken zippers during the sale season. Actually they would sell clothes like this even when they were full price.
I recall a customer calling and complaining that she just noticed when she got home, the same day she made the purchase, that the top she bought had I hole. I no doubt it might be true. I have seen so mane garments with small holes that, if you don't inspect very well, it might pass unnoticeable. When I went to ask the assistant mgr if it was ok to let the customer make the exchange, she said ""Oh, how convenient"". Mind you, this manager was a complete bitch who would tell you to cater and brown nose the hell out of customers but when was time for the post purchase - a very important step to retain customers-, she's dismissive and arrogant towards them. 

I also recall many times when the cashiers forgot to take the sensors off the clothes after and then it would beep on the door. The customer were forced to go back to the register and have their bags checked and show their receipt, so the cashier can make sure that whatever has the sensor on - which was HS/HER responsibility to make sure to take off-, wasn't in fact somehow stolen and thrown in along with the legit purchases. I noticed that most customers don't have the guts to actually complain about it.

The mentality in this retail store it is that customers are actually trying to deceive and trick them at all times and that you have to always watch them. 

Does anyone have similar experience?

As I've stated before, I work in a fairly well known and popular women's clothing store.
Surprisingly, I actually DO love my job and one of the reasons I do is because I get to help women feel pretty and put a smile on their faces. This can take work. As women, we each have our hang ups: big arms, big calves, a belly roll, a chunky butt, etc. I get a chance to show women how to dress to flatter themselves and show them that no matter what we are each beautiful in our own ways. I actually take that really seriously.

I grew up with eating disorders and low self esteem due to being chubby. I starved myself and made myself throw up more than I like to admit to. I also survived an incredibly emotionally (and a couple time physically) abusive relationship. To make a long story short, my appearance was something that he got on me a lot about. 

I've finally come to love myself, my body, and who I am . Flaws and all.

But I actually lost my cool on a customer once. 

Back before I was promoted and transferred to a new store, my primary job was selling. I have the gift of gab if you will and I can sell anything to anybody. So I was left to my own devices with customers quite often. Enter Skinny and her mom. 

Skinny needs shorts, but as a woman over forty she wants boyfriend shorts (think Bermuda shorts). We have a few in that style so.i pick her out some colors (and tops and accessories, because, yeah, I'm a salesperson). 

Here's where the trouble starts. Skinny went up a size. She was a size 00 and is now a size 0-2. Remember she is over forty. She looks great and is not unattractive. I assure her that she is not fat, that lots of women would kill to be that size, and her mom jumps in on the positive bandwagon as well.

Skinnny keeps complaining. Of course I wonder if she may have an eating disorder. I do my best to comfort and assure her. I style her, put together outfits, and compliment her. Not just to sell either, I genuinely want people to have the confidence that I worked so hard for. It doesn't work. All skinny sees is that 0 instead of a 00.

She says she is too fat about once a minute. 

Now I start to get annoyed. Ladies and gentleman, I am not a small girl. I'm attractive, proportionate, and dress well, but I'm NOT tiny. 

So, on my 2828383838 trip with her to the sales floor to puck out more shorts, she starts complaining again. She calls herself fat and how she can't believe she put on so much weight.

I lost my cool. I looked Skinny dead in the eye and said ""If you think a size ZERO is fat, then what must I look like to you at a size sixteen?""

She went very quiet. ""You are gorgeous and you look great, do you want some shorts or not?""

She didn't speak much the rest of the time, but she bought the shorts and more and she stopped complaining about being fat. 

I was probably too harsh. I felt bad that I lost my cool but in the end, I think she may have realized that her complaining about being fat to someone who IS in the overweight spectrum was... Not in good taste.


Edit: please don't take this and turn it into a skinny v. fat debate in the comments. That is not at all what this is about.

I get out four rolls, two of them are 10 dollars worth of singles, and the other two have two tens and four five each. I make the change from that so she can at least get a few tens. I count the change in front of her to make sure it's correct, and hand it to her. As I hand her the change I am met with a face of pure disgust. 

Lady: um, excuse me, but I need big bills. I can't carry all of that around with me.

This morning I had a meeting to discuss basic things like the loyalty cards, accessories and general operations of the store. My full time manager Danny was doing all of the talking while Regina was just agreeing with him. Throughout the entire meeting I was nervous because he told me yesterday we were going to air out the problem with all the managers and Amway. When it was finally brought up he didn't even have the balls to mention the name.

Danny : There's been a lot of issues lately and Regina I just want to get it out in the open. 

At this point Regina had sat in a chair, opened up a binder and was sheepishly flipping through it while avoiding eye contact at all costs. I have no problem with conflict or eye contact with who I'm speaking to for that matter, so her doing that was very sheepish to me and pretty funny. 

Danny : Regina, this is the stuff I'm talking about. You have an attitude, I'm talking to you and you don't even care.

Regina : I don't have a problem! I don't like it when people go around and talk about things that aren't their concern. They need to keep to themselves.

Danny : I know there's been some problems between you two girls. I thought you were friends. I really need you to put the past behind you and move on from the problem.

Me, looking at Regina directly in her eyes : I have no problem with you personally. I have no problem with anyone having a business. But the way you're going about it isn't ethical at all.

So basically, Danny made it seem more like a personal problem between us and Regina went along with that. I didn't want to say anything else, but the entire time I wanted to get up and walk away. I did however record this entire conversation about the ""personal problem"" we apparently have. 

I have work this afternoon and will update this tonight about the conversation I'm going to have with Danny today when we work together. ",Manager is unethical and brainwashed. (Update #2),186
When_Ducks_Attack,39,69,1qbcko,309,"Nearly 20 years ago, I was working for a very large electronics chain, the place where you could get everything from transistors to computers to radios for your shack.  It was right around the holiday season, and a man came in with his four or five year old son to look at a computer.

I walked up and started to chat with him about it, and it becomes clear that he's seriously interested.  Remember, 20 years ago, computers weren't the everyday thing they are now... this would be quite the sale, and yet another feather in my cap at this store, as computer sales were few and far between.

After evaluating the customer, I drop into ""Car Guy Description #1"" and start to explain that the processor in the computer is like the engine, and RAM is the car's transmission and so on.  The guy is diggin' it, he's getting what I'm saying, and he's becoming more and more interested.  

Then his son starts saying ""Dad.  Dad!  Dad!  Hey, Dad!""  Bored, obviously, and wanting attention.  Dad quickly shushes the son and turns back to me.  We start talking software, and monitors, and the kid starts up again.  Dad shushes him once again, and asks me a question about the computer.  I start to answer... ""Well, the hard drive is where the computer stores informaAIIIIGHHHH!!!!!"" and I fell over.

The son, correctly deducing that I'm to blame for his dad not being attentive to him, had hauled off and punched me in the side of my knee.  The knee that had been damaged playing football, and that I needed to wear a brace on for anything more athletic than climbing stairs.  

Of course the knee collapsed like a house of cards, bouncing my head off the display unit for the computer in the process, and sending me sprawling into a stack of RC cars.  I tried to get to my feet, only to discover that I couldn't put any weight on my leg, and that I had blood streaming down my face.

Dad stood there, shocked, berated the kid for a second or two, then dragged him out of the store...  he never apologized, and he never came back.  Turns out he bought the computer from another one of our stores.  

I learned to keep an eye on kids from then on.  I wound up being given a choice: I could either have surgery to fix my knee, or spend six months using braces, wraps and a cane at all times.  I went the braces/wraps/cane route, and now I need surgery anyway.

elphabaisfae,33,69,1qb48i,299,"Hey TFR. Haven't made a post because I haven't worked retail in a few years. Fortunately, I'll be joining the ranks again at a veryvery part time gig at a favorite store of mine for the holidays. Yeah, that whole delusional part hasn't come back yet, and the thoughts of a discount are dancing over my head like a sugarplum.

Anyway, yeeeeeears ago I have worked for a company selling electronics and appliances. No, not that one. Nope not that one - yep that one. A few things to note:

1. I look younger than my age and always have.
2. I'm female and there are guys who hate that females would sell electronics (to be fair I'd rather sell a vacuum cleaner than a TV, the commission was yards better)
and
3. once you've sold electronics on a commission v draw basis, the Hunger Games is not that scary to you.
4. I sold electronics prior to 2004, so it's ""outdated"" technology now.

So, one Super Bowl Morning, I was the lead opener assigned to TVs. I was the lead opener assigned to vacuums... actually, on a Super Bowl Sunday, I was the ONLY electronics associate on the floor from 9a-2p. Appliances was overbooked so they sent some of them over. Most of what they did was just show people around and then wait for me to close the sale, so i would get those sweet sweet commissions.

In walked Flannel Shirt Man, and his sidekick, Jaw man. (Seriously, the guy had a jawline that was prominent).

Flannel Shirt man wanted a new big screen. But he didn't want just any big screen, he wanted a fancy giant projection TV. At the time the best we sold was a Mitsubishi. They were not cheap. They cost more than Sony (which at the time had the highest markup). But at $2000+ per TV at the lowest, and the most expensive (70"") heading out somewhere around $5000, you wanted to sell the Mitsubishi. 

And FSM wanted it, too. It was pretty, it was big, and it would have been perfect to watch the big game on.

Problems arose. FSM wanted to barter. We at Big Box store could not barter (it was on sale for $1500 off, tbh). We didn't have the power. He then wanted us to sell the floor model - since we had one in the back, we could not sell the floor model. We then tried to do a discount by him signing up for the Store Credit Card, but he was denied.

He was rather pissed by now, as it was only a few hours until kickoff and he was supposed to be having a ""big ol shindig with booze and good lookin women, not like you"".

Big Jaw snickered and whispered something in FSM's ear, and I was waiting to figure out what they wanted to do. I repeated the total, and asked how they wanted to pay.

""Naw, we gonna go somewhere else, stupid bitch."" and then he shoved me. 

The way it was set up in our store, the register was directly in front of the big screens. There was less than 4' walking space between the Mitsubishis and the register.

As I wasn't expected to be shoved, I flew backwards, and I went through the screen of the biggest big screen. The 70"". The very expensive one. I missed hitting the (very hot, very sharp) lenses on the inside by about 6"". The two guys high five each other, start laughing... until they see security running over. I'm in shock, ass end in a tv, just kind of staring there.

I got help out of the TV, the guys got arrested. Still had to work for a few hours after this shift.

For a view of what the TV I went through was, it was this guy, right here: http://www.amazon.com/Mitsubishi-VS70707-Gold-Series-Projection/dp/B000050FA0

tl;dr: rednecks shove me through a big screen, they have to pay for it, for the repair, and for the maintenance agreement afterwards that the TV had to have. And I got all the commission! ",You want to plug what in where? (Tales of Electronics),368

MayTheSchwrtzBeWithU,28,28,1qap9a,100,"I work in a small 2-person satellite office for a local design/marketing/manufacturing company. My office is right off one of the sleaziest streets in town- a busy road swarming with car lots, strip clubs, druggies, and crazy people.

So yesterday afternoon, my boss ""B"" and I are working at our desks, and she notices a woman wearing SO MUCH makeup (think Mimi from the Drew Carrey Show), with at least ten ""ornaments"" in her hair (plastic dolls, fake spiders, ribbons, and foam shape cutouts), pulled up in our parking lot. She opens the car door and looks around- at this point we can see the rest of her getup. She has at least four floor-length skirts layered on, and a big ornamental blouse with several shawls- like a combination between Raggedy Anne, a Halloween witch, Mimi, and a prairie woman. She gets out of the car, stares at us through our windows, squats down in the parking lot and pisses herself; her skirts are so massive, she doesn't even bother to hold them out of the way. She squatted there for a good 45 seconds, pissing and maintaining unbroken eye contact the entire time. When she's finished she stands up, smiles, sits back in her car, pulls out and slowly drives past our front door and windows, still staring at us with the most terrifyingly creepy look on her face. 

B and I are beyond creeped out, and she had taken down the license plate number. B decides to go next door to report the incident to our landlord and recommend that he hose down the parking lot. She was gone for maybe 3 minutes when the crazy lady COMES INTO OUR OFFICE, DRIPPING PEE! 

Now- this woman is huge and terrifying, and she just gives off the vibe that she could easily cast some spell or curse on me to make my intestines turn into snakes or something, so I didn't want to ask her to leave in case it started a situation I couldn't handle alone... Better to just smile, act polite, and wait it out until B came back. The woman clomps in, dripping a snail trail of pee across our wood floors, and slams her gigantic bag of potato chips and her jug of clam juice on my desk and stares at me. I stand up to back away from her and say ""Hello- Can I help you?"" She shoves a handful of greasy chips in her mouth, creepily looks around, studying the office, then reads the sign behind me, and spews, ""You Advertise, Market, and Promote, huh?"" 
I'm like ""Uh huh... Do you have a project you need help with?"" Blah blah blah... Long story short, she has a 'room' she'd like to promote for sale. I told her we specialize in corporate advertisements, so if he she ever needs to create a magazine, logo, or website, give me a call.. She is now LIVID and starts yelling at me that the sign says ""Promote"" and she wants to promote her room- we need to be more clear on the signage if we don't list apartments for sale, blah blah, chip crumb spewing, etc...  

Finally B comes running back in after noticing the crazy lady was parked outside. She intervenes and very nicely explains that the services we offer don't seem to be what she is looking for, and she offers up directions to another company that could possibly help her, just a mile up the road (those poor bastards). The crazy lady looks us both up and down with that creepy look in her eyes - I swear, casting spells on me in her mind - and finally seems to accept that we aren't going to be any assistance to her. She grins, staring me RIGHT in the eye, leans forward with her clam juice in hand, offers it toward me, and breathes in a husky whisper, ""you ever try clam juice....?"" I stutter and stammer that I'm allergic (I'm not), back away and she laughs the most terrifying laugh, picks up her bag of chips and carries her clam juice out the door, stepping in her pee dribble. She gets in her car, and slowly drives away, staring at me until she was out of sight. 

I almost peed myself. 

TL;DR Crazy woman pees in parking lot, maintains eye contact, drips pee on office floor, yells at me, then offers me a drink of her clam juice- all while casting spells to turn my intestines into wriggling snakes.","Crazy lady pees in parking lot, maintains constant eye contact, comes inside, offers me a drink of her Clam juice, and casts spells on me.",128
Toni-Cipriani,24,18,1qao2b,68,"Any fellow cashiers know what I mean? Sometimes after you finish ringing up a transaction for a customer and then they either fiddle around with their bags or stare at the receipt right at the register without saying anything or even acknowledging you any further. 

It doesn't even bother me at all, it just feels super awkward because I never know what to say to them. I can't really call another customer forward because I don't want to seem rude and rush them or if they are the only customer in my line I don't want to just walk away in case they want to ask for something else.

Greenwallets,81,219,1qacao,934,"So at the tail end of my shift I had a couple walk in trying to buy an iPad we had on sale priced at $368.

I have the flyer in front of me but can't override a price over $20 (company policy). 

I wrote to the customer that they can take the iPad to the front and deal with it with the customer service managers. Then I get a call. 

CSM: hey.. Did you just send a couple here with an iPad?

Me: ya.

CSM: you can't do that. 

Me: k. 

CSM: uh, why do they have all these little notes on them? They don't understand what I'm saying...

Me: uh... Because they're deaf? The iPad is in the flyer for $368 but it's ringing up at $468. Why?

Thexare,38,28,1qaa32,42,"A few months ago, the retail chain I work at started carrying cigarettes. I knew from the start it'd be a pain in the ass, and these types of people are why. 

**The inadequately informed**

An older woman came in to buy cigarettes one day. We did not carry the type she wanted, or perhaps we were out. So she asked for my recommendations. As a mildly-asthmatic non-smoker, I don't know shit about them.

""You should know more about what you sell!""

This would almost be a valid argument if it were a store specializing in tobacco products, and we do have one of those in town. However, this is not one of them. It's not my job to help you find the right cigarettes for your uniquely-damaged palate. That is in fact not the job of any employee of RedactedCorp.

""Give me a pack of reds.""

""What kind?""

""A pack of reds.""

""... *which reds?!*""

Actual quote from today, and the one that pushed me to posting. Approximately a sixth of our cabinet is assorted red-packaged cigarettes. 

Similarly irritating are the people who only specify that they wanted a soft pack or a box *after* I come back with the wrong one, or worse, after the order's been finished and I can't do anything about it (returns on tobacco products aren't permitted.)


**The overly-specific**

You know exactly what you want. That's great, that saves us a lot of-

""Second shelf, third row.""

Not even the brand? Just telling me a location like we're playing Battleship and you're trying to find my patrol boat? I will admit that I don't know where everything in the case is, because some things are very rarely sold - specifically, everything in the bottom cabinet. But please don't skip to telling me the location and *not* telling me the brand and type. If I sell it more than once a month I know where it is by now, and I'm getting used to the ones I only sell every other month.

jre103087,11,12,1qa554,31,"I've worked for a smiley retailer for a while now at two very different locations. The first was in a rural small town where we were the only game in town the second is in a larger city in a middle-lower middle class area. 

Since moving to the city I've noticed a shoplifting trend that baffles me every time I run across it. 

I work in our shoe department and a several times a month I will find a pair of shoes without shoelaces. Apparently our shoplifters have decided that rather than spend $2 on a pair of shoelaces they are better off stealing them. In addition to not wanting to pay for their laces they have also decided that rather than simply pocketing the conveniently pocket sized packages of shoelaces, usually located within 20ft of where they are, they would rather take the time to unlace the shoes and then leave them on the shelf laceless. 

Now, I'm not saying that I'm ok with people stealing from us. And this is nowhere near the worst instance of shoplifting or even the most common kind I see, I would rather deal with 10 pairs of laceless shoes to 1 pair of nasty smelly old shoes put into a box as our new shoes walk out the front door, I just don't understand the reasoning behind this theft. 

For one, and probably the one that a customer would care least about, we're losing more money through this, rather than taking a hit on a $2 pack of laces we have to take it on a $15, $20, even $50 pair of shoes. Second, it takes so much more time and effort to unlace the shoes than it would take to just steal the laces.

helloyo53,20,28,1q9v60,142,"Hello! This is my first post in TFR. I've been lurking for a while and doing some commenting, and since I work in retail and know the pains, I figured I would start sharing some stories (the good and the bad, mostly the bad) as well!


**Background:** I work at a well known, Canadian electronic retail store in the Camera Department. This story took place last year when I was new there. I still remember exactly how it went down though as it was my first ever rude retail customer.


**Story:** I was finishing with a customer up at the customer service desk. I was helping her exchange a new camera for one she recently bought.  


When I was done there, I walked back to my department (it's close to the back of the store) and there were two people in there. Obviously, since I was at the front of the store when the two people entered my department, I had no clue which one entered my department first. So I helped the guy that was closest to me as I was walking up. He asked a couple of questions about a camcorder he was interested in. I showed him a bit about it, and he went on his way. Took probably about 5 minutes.


Then I went to the next man. I suck at making creative, relative names so we'll just him Angry Customer (AC).


**Me:** Hello, can I help you find anything at all?

**AC:** Oh piss off

**Me:** Sorry?

**AC:** I was here before him 

Now here's where things went wrong. I thought AC had said ""I was here before"" and I took it as he was at the store earlier in the day and he is back looking at some product. So here's where I made the mistake:

**Me:** Oh okay, well let me know if you need anything

**AC:** No, that's not what you're supposed to say. You're supposed to say ""oh, I'm sorry sir"". Fuck, you kids (I was 17 at the time) have no respect these days

**Me:** Sorry sir, I didn't realize you were here first. I was up at the customer service desk and I had now way of knowing who came first

**AC:** WELL YOU BETTER FUCKING LEARN FAST BECAUSE I'VE BEEN FUCKING STANDING HERE FOR 20 MINUTES WHILE YOU HELPED THE WRONG CUSTOMER

**Me:** He wasn't the wrong customer, I didn't know who came first so I helped the first person I saw, I'm sorry it wasn't you.

**AC:** Wait until your manager hears about this, I'll have you fired right now you disrespectful shit.

**Me:** If you want to speak to the manager I can call him right now, I'm sure he'll love to hear what you have to say

**AC:** No, I'm leaving now, GO FUCK YOURSELF!



Called my manager over after AC left and told him what happened. My manager was pissed and was ready to punch the guy out for talking to me like that. I told him he left and this is what my manager said to me:
**M**""Ah damn. Well if I were there I would have told him 'sir, you are talking to a 17 year. He still attends high school, has homework every night, and then comes into work. Just WHERE do you think he would find time to fuck himself?'""


So we shared a laugh over that and he told me if the guy came back to call him over right away. He never came back (I kind of wish he did).


**TL;DR** Guy told me to fuck myself because I didn't help him first. Manager can't figure out where I would find time to fuck myself.

Fast forward to the crazy lady and her husband, We'll call her CL for convenience. She comes up to my registered after being called over from the massive line, tells me how many tickets she needs for the movie she wants and hands me her card. I swipe the card and it's declined.  

Immediately the transaction stops and a prompt on my computer says ""declined"". When a card declines it doesn't say insufficient funds or anything just says ""declined"". (this will be important for later) Also I check the date see if it's an old card she accidentally left in her purse, No it's has a valid date.

**Me:** ""Well, I'll try and type the card in manually, the mag strip may be damaged or my Card swipe may have be having trouble reading the card."" As I'm saying this I can see her frustration so I try to hurry and type it in, but the prompt comes up again and says ""declined.""

**Me:** ""Once again it says declined and I cannot process this transaction for your tickets, do you perhaps have cash on you?"" She has Bitch face right now and I""m completely dreading what she has to say.

**CL:** ""NO I DON'T HAVE CASH ON ME. WHO CARRIES CASH ANYMORE THESE DAYS?!"" Her husband turns his head to look at the arcade acting like nothing is happening.

**Me:** ""Well ma'am unless you have any other form of payment I cannot give you any tickets tonight, I'm sorry"" At this point I'm trying not to laugh at this lady.

**CL:** Why won't you take my money, I have money on this card. There should be no reason for you to not be able to give me tickets! Were you not trained to use a cash register? I want to speak to the manager"" 

As you can probably anticipate, this is my favorite part of the situation.

**Me:** ""I am the manager.""

**CL:** ""Well I want to speak to someone who's above you. And don't try to say there's isn't someone else, there's always someone else."" Husband is still just kinda chilling.

**Me:** ""There is no one else, Other than the owner whose not here at the moment, I am the one in charge.""

**CL:** ""I want to speak to him then. Call him or go get him I don't care.""

**Me:** ""It's 9:30 on a Friday evening, he's enjoying his evening at home and will very upset with me if i were to call him and interrupt his Friday. Unfortunately there is nothing he can do as well seeing as this is an issue with your bank and not us."" Her face is as read as an apple it seems that there is steam fuming out of her ears with that cartoon train whistle.

**CL:** ""I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU JUST SAID THAT. HOW DARE YOU TELL I DO NOT HAVE ANY MONEY IN MY BANK. THAT IS JUST RUDE!!!"" Husband is now walking back out the door. I felt so bad for this dude.

**Me:** ""Ma'am I never said you didn't have money, I have no way of knowing that. I was told by the computer that it was declined.""

**CL:** ""Whatever I'm going to give your boss a call or email to tell him how rude you were to me. You will be fired, I guarantee it!.""

**Me:** ""Be my guest, here's his business card. He'll be very happy to speak to you. But for now I'm going to need you to politely move over so I can help other customers.""

Now this lady is ballistic and just storms off. She swirls around looking for her husband and realizes he's already left her ass in the Theater. I never saw her again but the next day I was called in to my Boss's office. He asked my there a crazy lady called him at 10 P.M. on a Friday. I told him the situation and he watched the video of the whole situation. (Our Camera's have microphones in them). He had a chuckle and said I handled it well.

It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Most of my employees are teenagers, and have real jobs during the rest of the year, just like me. Even so, they jump at the chance to work for me, since I pay better, feed them, give them free fireworks, and always try to make my store fun.

Last 4th of July, I had a couple of new guys helping out during setup. One of the news guys dropped a beam while setting up some rack shelving, and it almost hit his foot. He turned to one of the teenagers, Colby, and joked that he would need workers comp.

Colby has worked for me for several years now. Without looking up or stopping his work, Colby perfectly explained our workers comp policy, just as it had been explained to him years before.

“Craig doesn’t have workers comp. If you get seriously hurt, we have to kill you and hide the body”.

**TL;DR:**  **Workers' compensation** is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employee's right to sue his or her employer for the tort of negligence. The tradeoff between assured, limited coverage and lack of recourse outside the worker compensation system is known as ""the compensation bargain"".

While plans differ among jurisdictions, provision can be made for weekly payments in place of wages (functioning in this case as a form of disability insurance), compensation for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical and like expenses (functioning in this case as a form of health insurance), and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment (functioning in this case as a form of life insurance).

General damages for pain and suffering, and punitive damages for employer negligence, are generally not available in workers' compensation plans, and negligence is generally not an issue in the case. These laws were first enacted in Europe and Oceania, with the United States following shortly thereafter.

**Statutory compensation** law provides advantages to employees and employers. A schedule is drawn out to state the amount and forms of compensation to which an employee is entitled, if he/she has sustained the stipulated kinds of injuries. Employers can buy insurance against such occurrences. However, the specific form of the statutory compensation scheme may provide detriments. 

Statutes often award a set amount based on the types of injury. These payments are based on the ability of the worker to find employment in a partial capacity: a worker who has lost an arm can still find work as a proportion of a fully able person. This does not account for the difficulty in finding work suiting disability. When employers are required to put injured staff on ""light-duties"" the employer may simply state that no light duty work exists, and sack the worker as unable to fulfill specified duties. 

When new forms of workplace injury are discovered, for instance: stress, repetitive strain injury, silicosis; the law often lags behind actual injury and offers no suitable compensation, forcing the employer and employee back to the courts (although in common-law jurisdictions these are usually one-off instances). 

Finally, caps on the value of disabilities may not reflect the total cost of providing for a disabled worker. The government may legislate the value of total spinal incapacity at far below the amount required to keep a worker in reasonable living conditions for the remainder of his life.

A related issue is that the same physical loss can have a markedly different impact on the earning capacity of individuals in different professions. For instance, the loss of a finger could modestly reduce a banker's professional facilities but ruin a pianist.

In 1855, Georgia and Alabama passed Employer Liability Acts; 26 other states passed similar acts between 1855 and 1907. These acts simply permitted injured employees to sue the employer and then prove a negligent act or omission. (A similar scheme was set forth in Britain's 1880 Act.)

After Germany's 1884 Act, workers' compensation laws began to be reformed to reduce the need for litigation, and to mitigate the requirement that injured workers prove their injuries were their employer's ""fault"". For example, The 1897 British Act replaced the 1880 Act.

In the United States, the first statewide worker's compensation law was passed in Maryland in 1902, and the first law covering federal employees was passed in 1906. By 1949, all states had enacted some kind of workers' compensation regime. Such schemes were originally known as ""workman's compensation,"" but today, most jurisdictions have adopted the term ""workers' compensation"" as a gender-neutral alternative.

At the turn of the 20th century workers’ compensation laws were voluntary for a couple of reasons. Specifically, an elective law made passage easier and many felt that compulsory workers’ compensation laws would violate the 14th amendment due process clause of the U.S. Constitution. Since workers’ compensation mandated benefits without regard to fault or negligence, many felt that compulsory participation would deprive the employer of property without due process. 

The issue of due process was resolved by the United States Supreme Court in 1917 when in New York Central Railway Co. v. White it was held that an employer’s constitutional rights weren't affected. After the ruling most states enacted new compulsory workers’ compensation laws.

In the United States, most employees who are injured on the job have an absolute right to medical care for any injury, and in many cases, monetary payments to compensate for resulting temporary or permanent disabilities. Most employers are required to subscribe to insurance for workers' compensation, and an employer who does not may have financial penalties imposed. 

If you’ve actually been crazy enough to read through all of this text, you should seriously consider seeking some type of professional help. The entire TL;DR was meant as a joke, and the short story was actually above the TL;DR. I do appreciate your persistance and, to show it, please allow me to bestow gold on the first 5 of you that obviously have nothing better to do than surf reddit, and can follow my instructions. Please add a comment to this story that starts with “Candygram for Mongo!”. Feel free to say whatever else you’d like in the comment, since you seen to have some free time. Of course the first five have long come and gone if you're reading this now, but what the hell.

Texas employers have the unique ability to opt out of a the Workers' Compensation system under the original state law written in 1913. However, those employers, known as nonsubscribers, are exposed to potential liability in the event of an employee injury. 

Though the employee must prove that the employer was negligent in causing his or her injuries, the employer loses its common law defenses of contributory negligence, assumption of the risk, and the fellow employee doctrine. If successful, the employee can recover his or her full common law damages, which are far more generous than workers compensation benefits. 

Yeah, this story is about that. Thanks Wikipedia.

I ended up going to talk to the department store's HR first because we were technically on their property. The woman that's the head of their HR department was flabbergasted and pretty angry that this was going on. She thanked me for letting her know what was going on and photocopied a three page report I wrote regarding the entire situation with Regina's business card. 

I went back to my store and told one single person I spoke to HR, and he works for the department store right next to me. I mentioned him to the HR rep so I gave Pat a heads up in case she needed to speak to him.

After our little interaction I called up my company's HR immediately but was sent to voicemail to leave a message with my name and number.

Towards the last hour of my shift I had a meeting with both the women's assistant managers. It was mainly to speak about Regina and her managerial tactics. They were trying to play devil's advocate so I asked them ""If this was an associate doing this, would they still have their job right now?"" Both of them looked at me and agreed they would've been fired already.

They also brought up that she's making the schedule according to who gets the most loyalty cards, which is fine but she hasn't gotten any in two weeks, while one of the assistant managers got twelve in one day. She also knocked an associate back to eight hours a week because she thinks he's a frustrating person to talk to. Yup, she's somehow still employed.

Anyway, the HR rep from my company got back to me Thursday and I told her everything that was going on; from soliciting on company time and property, to peddling her Amway crap to potential employees. 
She was VERY happy I disclosed what was happening. It made me feel better that I was able to talk to someone and them actually agree that it was against company policy and a waste of hours and employment of Regina, not her exact words but she was disappointed and angry to say the least. I also told her I have a handful of the department store's representatives that would be able to verify if they need more proof. 

I have to wait now for my regional HR representative to contact me and possibly my DM about the situation. Like I mentioned before he's been shady about the loyalty cards so I'm not very excited he might get involved. 

There's a meeting on Sunday morning for the store and I'm guessing it's going to be spoken about. I actually hope it isn't because I don't feel like I need to justify myself if they think this is all acceptable to do on company time. I'm not excited about that either but I'm just going to sit back and say absolutely nothing or possibly show up late. This is all HR's problem now.

chromesparks,9,24,1q9azp,62,"I've worked for an electronics retailer for 3 years. I live in a pretty redneck area, suffice to say most of our customers are older and have no clue how technology works. I'm pretty adept at dealing with customers such as this, so when an old, late 50's looking gentleman with long grey hair and a beard approached me and the first thing out of his mouth was, ""I want a camera, but I'm technology illiterate"", I was ready to explain like he was 5. The conversation went as follows:

Him: ""Okay, so I want one where only I can see the pictures and videos."" 

Okay, odd way to put it, but I understand - most people take private pictures and videos, nothing wrong with that. I wasn't going to let my mind wander to what he was taking private pics and videos of. Let me try to explain this the best way I can.

Me: ""Well, sir, unless you are sharing the camera with another person, you'll be the only one to see the pictures. Once you upload them to the computer, you control whether or not they get posted to the internet, and you can then delete the pictures from the memory card after placing the files on your computer. You could also buy multiple SD cards and put private pictures on one and all your other photos on another.""

Him: ""Hmmm, okay. Now which one of these cameras has the best zoom lens?""

I pick up one of the cameras on display with a decent zoom.

Me: ""This is the cheapest one we have with the farthest zoom range. This is a compact system camera that doesn't have the ability to interchange the lens. However, if you want to look at our DSLRs, they all have the option to change out the lens for ones that zoom in farther.""

Him: ""Alright, well then my last question is: Do any of them come with an infrared lens?""

Okay, at this point I'm wondering what the hell this guy is taking pictures and videos of that are private, require a far zoom range, and an infrared lens. Apparently my suspicion showed on my face too, because he then looks at me and says -

""Now don't get the wrong idea, I'm no pervert or anythin'.""

BUT WITH NO EXPLANATION AFTER THAT. He wants me to know that he's not a pervert but didn't care to explain exactly why he needed this camera to do these things. I know I shouldn't assume he was doing something dirty - but wouldn't you? I didn't press further. He thanked me for the information and walked out the door.",Old man wants a camera for questionable reasons.,86
CurvedStraightLine,20,30,1q9aex,99,"This story isn't about a BAD customer, just a strange one.

I've mentioned before that during my career working women's clothing years ago, we'd do personal shopping and do things like serve snacks in the fitting suite.  One day I get a call from a woman who wanted to arrange an appointment for this.

She was perfectly pleasant, and as I'm taking down her information, she's telling me that she hasn't been shopping for a while, but most of her clothes don't fit anymore.  It seems she got sick, and it caused fluctuations in her weight.

But worst was that she couldn't walk properly anymore.  She dropped her voice and said that I wouldn't believe what had happened to her.  While she was in the hospital sick they accidentally did surgery on her leg meant for someone else, and now she couldn't walk.

I of course reacted in horror.  That's a worst case situation for anyone.

Jump forward to the day of the appointment, and I assign an associate to her, and fill her in a bit on what she told me.  The associate was a really sweet woman who had great rapport with customers, so I trusted her.

The taxi gets there, and the woman gets out in a wheelchair.  She had crutches and could pull herself up, but mostly stayed in the chair.

I was, honestly, curious (read: nosey) about the surgery, so I popped by a few times to see how she was doing, maybe to hear more of the story.  And boy, was she forthcoming.

The first strange thing was that she was upset her kids weren't letting her persue a lawsuit.  Which, accidental surgery sounds like a sound reason for a lawsuit, so I was confused.

Now, she was a totally pleasant customer to work with, really a dream customer, but every time these little details about her leg would sneak through.  She couldn't wear pants, because of her leg, and she needed skirts that would be ankle length to cover up the horror that was her leg.

Then she tells the whole story.  She was sick, she went to the hospital, and she woke up in a nursing home to find that she had been grafted with someone else's leg.  Furthermore, she knew they had her leg, but they WOULDN'T GIVE IT BACK.

This is a well spoken, polite woman, so the crazy just came out of nowhere.  I was glad I had a good associate assigned to her, and we just all sort of rolled with the punches.

We get her to start trying on her clothes, and she comes out of the fitting room on her crutches.  She eyes up her associate and I and asks ""do you want to see it?"" and, like a magician pulling a curtain back, she pulls her skirt up to her knees.

It was obvious she wasn't bearing weight on one leg, but otherwise, there was no issue.  I mean to say her leg looked perfectly fine, and just like the other one.  But she is looking at it in the mirror commenting about how horrible this strange leg is, and how she can't believe they gave her this leg.

We just sort of changed the subject back to the clothes and she left seeming really happy.

I did some research that apparently this is something that can happen as a result of a stroke--you just don't recognize a part of your body as your own, and people come up with fantastic stories to justify why it isn't ""theirs"".  (This is actually how I started reading Oliver Sacks books)

The problem is, later on, this customer came in during off hours and went back to the fitting room with a random associate, who wasn't warned about any of this and wasn't quite as good with people.  Next thing you know she's running back into the breakroom in a fit that apparently a customer had a corpse's leg and WHAT SHOULD SHE DO?

Meaning one of my stranger manager training times was to convince someone not to freak out, that it was a normal leg and that we have to cater a bit to eccentricities.  ",Not My Leg!,129
SwinginCrabWhacka,35,42,1q8u4f,203,"This just happened last night and I'm still pretty annoyed with it.

So I work at a chain store that sells groceries, food, automotive, all that good stuff. I'm a cashier, but sometimes our managers will have cashiers bring carts inside. I usually volunteer because I enjoy getting outside after standing all day.

Our store is closing so I'm clearing the lot. I've already cleared my two rows and I'm working on my last one. I have to drive my cart pusher through the fire lane in order to get back into the store and there's a minivan sitting in the fire lane. I walk up to the minivan and wave trying to get the woman's attention. She's on the phone, turns to me, looks me up and down and then rolls down her window. 

She yells ""WHAT.""

""Hi ma'am. Could you pull your car foward a little? I just need to-""

""I'M WAITING FOR MY DAUGHTER. IM MOVING IN A MINUTE.""

""I understand but I really need to get the carts-""

""I SAID IM MOVING IN A MINUTE. IM WAITING FOR MY DAUGHTER.""

Now I'm raising my voice a little because I'm getting pissed off.

""Look, I need you to move your van. We're closing the store and I need to get the carts inside. You're not supposed to be in the fire lane anyways.""

""OH MY GAWD FINE. QUIT FUCKING HARASSING ME.""

So she pulls forward and I think we're good, but then she proceeds to drive around the parking lot, pull up really close to my cart pusher and honks continually! She did this for a minute. I just ignored her while I put the carts inside.

Anyways her daughter came outside, apparently grabbed the wrong thing and tried to come inside but the store was closed and my manager already locked the doors. The only doors open were the ones I was using to get the carts inside. She tried going through there but I told her she couldn't and had to come back tomorrow. She went back to her mother in the van and told her what I said. The mother rolled down the window, while driving, and flipped me off while she drove.

So, last night was pretty uneventful to say the least.

By the time I left I had become a bitter asshole (side effect of being in retail too long for some people),  but when I started I was the nicest six foot five behemoth you would ever meet. Now I am an atheist living smack dab in the middle of the heavily Christian area of my state, never had much of a problem keeping to my self about my beliefs or lack thereof however you want to put it and I did my best to never get in anyone's face about their preaching.
  Now it's been a month since I started and I'm at the point where I'm super bored during every break, so I read a lot, probably three books a month, the book I'm reading at the time is Letter to a Christian Nation by Sam Harris, and I'm minding my own business, reading my book when one of the older cashiers walks by and sees my book and starts screeming at me how I shouldn't brink that Satanist trash to work and I need to put it away, I attempt to explain how she is mistaken (never works, older me wouldn't have even tried) and she screams that I'm creating a hostile work environment for believers by having that book. She walks out and I assume we're done with this.

Now at this point I would like to point out that our break room had a community book shelf in it. There were probably fifty books on it at the time around 20 of which were either heavily Christian themed or falt out religious books and texts, there were three copies of the bible for fuck sakes. Associates forced to work Sundays could be heard praying loud enough to hear and a few times some of the older gals played a local church's broadcast of their sermon! All of this is important too know for the ruthlessness that happened when I got off my break.
  
 As I clock in to resume work I get a prompt from the time clock to report to the store manager's office. Seeing as how I'm newer I freak out and practically sprint to the front of the store to the office, knock on the door and am greeted by the man himself, he smiles and asks me to come in and take a seat. I do and see the shift manager is there too, nothing is said for a solid minute before the store manager breaks the silence and asks me about the book. 
B = store manager J= shift 
 
B: so Ender, we had a report that you were reading some offensive material in the break room today
 
 Me: I want reading anything offensive, it was a book that I kept to myself and read silently during my lunch

 J: someone sad that the book you were reading offended them and they asked you to put it away, it's against company policy to disturb the break room. And we're going to have to give you a coaching and send you home for the day
Me: for reading a book!?

 B: for having an offensive book at work and causing a seen

 Me: really!? Because last time I checked there's bibles on the book shelf, employees play church sermons every Sunday and more offensive to an athiest than me reading a book! The break room might as well be a church! And if you write me up your going to have to do so to about 15 other people cause I will lodge a complaint as well!

B and J look at each other and cringe knowing that I stopped just short of saying I would call corporate as well

B: we... we're not aware of this and because of this we're not going to write you up and we will evaluate the policy of the break room, we would still like to send you home but you will be paid for your full shift.

Cashier looks at her and goes ""No can do, I need a receipt."" Customer walks out with product. BINGO. We called the cops and filed a report. She *will* come back, thieves are usually pretty stupid. We've caught a lot of them in the last few weeks. 

EDIT: forgot to mention we knew she was stealing fish so we would only take them to the register, she ended up buying them that time. But she walked out with a $34.99 bottle of stain remover. Ugh.

The other night, my aforementioned manager (Who we'll call T for Toolbox) calls me over... loudly... to where he is taking peoples' orders. He points over to a younger woman, maybe 25 at the most, who is standing with her boyfriend and says, ""She not have dog in here! You go ask her if it's service animal! See if it has vest!"" Mind you... he is capable of speaking perfect English. He's just unnecessarily short with me and I'm not sure why. He just always has been. So I go over to her and, beginning of course with an apology, I ask her if her little dog is a service animal. She was very understanding, and the conversation went something like this:

Her: Yeah, she is actually... she's my emotional support animal! *she smiles*

Me: Oh, alright! I wasn't sure cause she didn't have the vest on.

Her: Oh, yeah, we didn't put it on her tonight but she's got her collar.

I go back over and relay this to T, and he is not satisfied. ""NO! It has to have vest! The law says so! You tell her she needs to go outside on the patio!"" I'm mortified, hoping she can't hear him (thankfully it's usually really loud in there) and I go over to her again.

Me: So um... I'm really really sorry... but my manager asked me to tell you that... by law you have to have a vest on your service animal.

Her: (Still really nice and really calm, surprisingly) Actually, by law he can't do anything more than ask me if it's a service animal, because that becomes discrimination. (She smiles, I think to show me she's not mad at me, because I'm just apologizing over and over)

Me: Oh I see! That makes sense.

Her: Which one is your manager? I'll talk to him. We're going to be really quick, I just didn't know what I wanted exactly.

Me: (I point him out, still apologizing.)

Her: (She reaches over and... I'm normally not okay with this, but this time it was appreciated... puts her hand on my shoulder for a moment.) No no, it's fine! It's not your fault at all! (She smiles again.)

Me: (Smile awkwardly, at this point fed up with T. It's almost more like I'm baring my teeth.) He... he asked me to have you go out to the patio (going through the motions) but...

Her: (She laughs a little) Oh yeah! We were planning on it. Just wanted to order really quick. Don't worry, I'll talk to him!

So I go back to T, throw up my hands and say ""I did what you asked. She says that you cannot make her to leave for that. I'm done."" and walk into the back before he can respond. I busy myself for a while then go back out to clean tables, thinking it's all over... until she comes inside without her dog. and asks me for his name.

Me: Oh... it's Toolbox. (She asks for his last name, which I didn't know but offered to go in the back and check because it's on the weekly schedule. She smiles again. My god she was like a freaking angel sent down to rescue me from the seventh circle of minimum-wage hell.)

Her: Oh no, that's fine... I just don't think he handled the situation very well. He could have politely asked me to wait outside when I was coming through the line, he didn't have to tell me to hurry up and get out.

Me: (I'm fucking dumbfounded. This is a new low for him. I decide to be up front with her. I'm leaving in a month, so what do I have to lose?) I'm so sorry that he said that to you. I'm going to be honest... you didn't hear this from me, but he has a big attitude problem that needs addressed... but no one will do it. I personally am going to look up the laws regarding this so that I can educate the staff here because obviously it has not been done. I'm very sorry again.

Her: Oh, it's okay you don't have to apologize! I just wanted someone to know... because of the ADA, that's the kind of thing you guys could get sued for. (She says it as a statement, mind you, not a threat.) Like I said, he just didn't handle it well, but you did! What's your name?

Me: My name is Ruby (no it's not lol) and I really hope that this terrible experience doesn't change the way you think of this company (pff like I give a fuck.)

Her: Oh, thank you Ruby, and don't worry it's okay. You have a great night! (She pats my shoulder again and walks out, still smiling.)


Sorry it's so long, I just wanted to do justice to how incredibly sweet she was while he as basically being harassed... I've known people who have ESAs and it's no joking matter. To be questioned about it is even worse. I seriously anted to tell T to fuck off, but I want spending money while I'm in the bay area in training for my new job that pays about 3 times the amount I make here...

TL;DR: My toolbox manager tries to get me to gently harass a girl with a service animal, just because the dog didn't have a vest on. I handle it the way I know I should, but he tells her to ""hurry up and get out"" and she ends up asking me privately for both of our names and informing me that she could sue us if she wanted to. She is an angel of kindness (not being sarcastic), and I have zero fucks to give about my job.

TimesNewEnglish,50,44,1q8hwg,212,"Long time lurker, first time poster, bear with me on this wall of text.

Background: I work at the service desk/money wiring transfer of a big box retail store, where customers Save Money and Live Better. My job includes cashing paychecks, transferring money around the world, processing returns, and making sure cashiers are in their proper places (In terms of scheduling for breaks/lunches, not hazing.)

Every Friday all of the pipeliners and construction workers come into the store in order to cash their rather large paychecks (Anywhere from $700-$4,000+) because we charge a flat rate to cash checks, as opposed to several other places that charge based on percent. A lot of these workers become regulars in the store, and are often on a first name basis with myself and the other co workers. This story involves one of these ""regulars"".

Story: On a brisk October evening a few weeks ago, we were dealing with a huge rush of workers due to the fact that the main worksites were all on our side of town, as opposed to the other store about ten miles away. This changes from week to week, as jobs get completed and other jobs open up. Anyway, insert Redneck Douchebag Deluxe (RDD from here on out). Imagine Bret Michaels sans bandana and an ~~even larger~~ beer belly. He casually walks up to the desk and hands me his check and his ""driver's license.""

The reason for the quotes is because I could barely recognize the plastic blob he had just handed me as an ID. The card had literally been BURNED to the point that the only visible parts of the ID were the picture and the name of our great state (where the winds come sweeping down the plain...). Now, normally I would never take this as a valid form of ID, but I recognized RDD as a regular, and decided to cut him some slack. The following conversation ensued:

Me: ""Alright, sir, I recognize you as a regular, so I am going to give you a pass this week and go ahead and accept this, but if you want to come here again next week to cash your check, I will need you to bring an ID that is not damaged to validate your signature.""

RDD: 'Well what's wrong with this ID?""

Me: ""Sir, the ID is almost completely singed to the point that I cannot make out the information that I need to verify your identity. You can get a replacement lice-""

RDD: ""What crap school did you learn THAT from?!""

Me: ""The [name redacted] policy handbook, sir.""

RDD: ""I CASH $10,000 JACKPOTS AT THE CASINO WITH THIS ID!""

Me: ""Congratulations, sir, but this is not the casino, and I need to be able to verify your identity to cash your check. I've already said that I'll do it this one time, because you're a regular, but after this you will need a new form of identification to cash your check here.""

*Note:* This entire time I have been processing the transaction, and was waiting to hand him his money, which was already counted.

RDD: ""Well, I think you've got too much schoolin', boy. You need to get outside more.""

As I handed his money to him and began processing the next customer, a coworker of RDD, RDD whispers to the customer that he should ""watch out for Harry Potter, he won't take your ID."" I shrugged it off, and continued working.

Fast forward six days, to the following Thursday. RDD and his friend from earlier make a return trip to my desk, with check and brand new driver's license in hand.

Now, when I cash a check, there are several things I need to verify before I can continue the transaction. The issue with the check that RDD had given me this week was that the check was not dated until Friday, which was not until tomorrow. This means that I could not cash his check without getting fired. And so it begins again:

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, but this check is dated for tomorrow, and we cannot cash it until 7:00 AM when we open tomorrow.""

RDD: ""THIS IS BULLSHIT! THIS IS TWO TIMES YOU'VE TRIED TO SCAM ME OUT OF MY MONEY, WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER!""

Now, could I have just said that I would go get one and have been done with it? Yes.

But that wouldn't be very fun at all, now would it?

Me: ""Alright, sir, let me just open up the Chamber of Secrets and try to find you a manager.""

By this point he was fuming, to the point that I thought he was literally using all 12 of his brain cells to come up with a response, but he just stood there, getting more and more angry with himself. I walked into my manager's office, explained the situation, and when she came out with me, he was already gone. 

As of today, he apparently has never come back to cash his checks here. Can't say I miss him much.

TL;DR: Florida man tries to pay his water bill with cocaine.

palebluedott,7,48,1q8hbd,191,"Sooo this happened when I was a senior in high school, but its my favorite job story when dealing with psycho customers and I thought you all might enjoy it.  So back to 2005 we go.

I worked in fast food as the drive through intake for a really busy chain.  We were understaffed due to call in's so I was jumping around taking care of a variety of jobs even tho inputting and taking money is essentially full time work.

So SUV pulls up and orders something like 4 meals and I ask if the lady wants cheese on her burgers, she snaps at me they're fine how they are.  ""ok pull around, total is x amount of $"".  So she pulls around, I take her money and pass her up to the pick up window.  I go about my business when my manger calls me up front to catch up on handing out orders and filling drinks.  So I hand SUV lady her drink and her order and close the door when I hear a knocking on the window.  Its SUV lady.

""Yes ma'am?"" Thinking she wants ketchup or napkins.

""I ordered cheese on these.""

Of course she didn't, I took her order and even asked her specifically as well as repeating the order SANS cheese.  I have my headset for the drive through.

Me: ""No ma'am, the receipt says there is no cheese to be put on this order""

Suv Lady: That woman in the drive-through screwed up then, I TOLD her I wanted cheese""

Me wearing my headset:  ""Ma'am I specifically asked you if you wanted cheese and you said no, would you like me to put complimentary cheese on these for you?""

SUV Lady:  ""NOT NOW, HOW DO I KNOW YOU WON'T DO SOMETHING TO MY FOOD!?""

Me irritated and not giving a shit anymore: ""How do you know I haven't already done something to your food?""

SUV lady freaks the fuck out and starts screaming about get your manager NOW!!!  NOWWWWWW!

So my manager, I huge black man who looks like a linebacker comes over and asks calmly, ""whats the problem ma'am?""  She recounts the story as she see's it.  

SUV Lady ""And do you know what she said to me?!  How do you know I didn't already do something to your food??!""  She looks at him waiting for sympathy.  He pauses and looks at me.

Manager to me ""Did you say that to her?""

I nod.  He turns back to her.  ""Well ma'am how DO you know she didn't already do something to your food?""

Bossman was waiting on a huge table, and I was helping him.  A taciturn old man at the table complained that they had been waiting *forever* for their burgers.  It had been about 10 minutes.  Bossman informed him that burgers take 15 minutes to cook.  The old guy got huffy, proclaiming that 15 minutes was too damn long.  Bossman cocked an eyebrow at him,

I think it's great that this is a thing, but it is sometimes miserable dealing with these people. Here's a story from today that blew my mind.

A woman comes in with her three children and checks in with me at the service desk. The whole time I'm explaining the rules to her, one of her daughters is screaming. Not kind of screaming, but at the top of her lungs, murderous screaming. The lady can barely hear me, but we power through it and she goes off with her children to shop.

A little while later she comes back and the same child is still being loud. Her brother is teasing her which isn't helping. He then mentions her teddy bear that she lost somewhere in the store. The little girl loses it. I mean, total meltdown. My co worker and I are trying to calm her down and suggest having her brother go and look for it, which he does.

He gets it back, which stop the fit, but she's still being awful. Screaming names at her siblings, yelling at her mom, just awful. Her mother does nothing. I'm almost done ringing the woman out and all the sudden one of the shelves falls off the wall and hits the ground, all of the merchandise going with it. I look behind the mother and what do you know.. it's the screaming little girl.

Her mom goes over to her and says, ""Oh, stop doing things by accident."" The little girl replies with, ""It wasn't an accident. I did it on purpose."" I was baffled. The mother laughs and picks up the broken pieces of the shelf of the floor and hands them to me. ""Your shelf is broken."" she tells me.

gokc69,14,34,1q8d1o,116,"This goes back 30 years to my teens, but I still remember this jerk.  In high school I worked at a traditional men's clothing store (think Sansabelt Slacks, if you remember those).

A Pakistani dermatologist was a regular customer (I have no prejudice, but his social skills were not adapted to small-town midwest living).  He wore these strange 4-pocket safari-looking shirts and often stopped in to see if we had any, which of course we did not.

Every time he came in, he had a handful of sunflower seeds that he spit on our carpet and ignored our offer of a cup or bag.  And each time he saw me, he berated me for having acne and demanded that I come see him so that I wouldn't have to be so ugly.  I had the usual couple of zits that a 16 year old has, nothing serious.

I wanted to crawl into a hole every time he came in, but my manager covered me as best as he could.  We ran 20% off almost as a regular deal, but the manager rang him up full price every time.  This guy smashed my self-esteem every time he came in.  Jerk.

The shop is quite small (the store only has 5 employees minus the owner) 

Anyways tonight on Friday I was busy making sure all the craft beers were full and putting up seasonal ales. I was trying to keep an eye on the front to make sure it didn't get too busy since it was just me and my coworker who we'll call Sara.

 I start to notice a line of about 8-10 people building up so I rush over to the front to give Sara a hand in ringing people up. Literally the moment I get up front to help a man looking at the lottery tickets he says to me ""No, I don't want you to help me. I want her"" and he said it totally straight-faced and glared at me slightly. If someone was joking around and said that or cracked a smile, I would've joked with them back and taken it differently but I just sort of smiled at him and waved the next customer to step up to the front so I could help them and let Sara ring up that charming stud.

Nothing huge, just struck me as sort of rude. Sara even looked at me once he left and said she thought that was pretty rude. Plus Sara was totally busy with other things and with another customer, it's not like I was cutting in on their conversation or like they knew each other

 The story Im about to tell you happened on the dreaded weekly saturday 7:30 to 4:30 shift. 

So it was 7:30am I just clocked in hungover from the night before. The dealership had a large department for service and saturdays were always a busy day. By the time I clocked in there was already a line of four or five cars waiting to get their cars serviced. This was normal but we dont begin servicing cars until 8:00. After clocking in I begin to go about my daily routine but stop when I see a man standing at the front door of the service shop. I go to the door to open it and ask if I can help him. Once I get to the door I notice that he, flaccid dick in hand, is pissing all over the door. What.The.Fuck.

regalvizzerdrix,9,54,1q81xa,182,"Here's a few short and simple rants I have about my own freaking coworkers. 

For context, my friend (M) and myself work as morning stockers. Recently our hours have been cut from nearly 40 a week to not a minute over 25. Suddenly, after 2 people being fired, they decide to enforce a policy that states that any freight on the floor by 10AM must be taken to the back room. This leaves us with a quarter of the truck on pallets in the back room every day for the past month. We are not in high spirits.

Then we find out that a department worker has been making complaints about us in the ""focus group"" meetings (a group of people from each department, except receiving, that talk about efficiency and whatnot) on how we never help her out and we leave her to do all the work. Even though the last time she was there two of us did 6 pallets of freight in the time she did a half pallet (about 2 feet high), and topstocked her leftovers for her. 

AND THEN, a guy from the other side where we sell lumber starts complaining about us because the breaks we take outside next to our cars are waaay too long (even though he usually shows up as we go inside) and are waay to loud. Outside. in the back of the parking lot. the farthest away from the building. He shows up at 6:15AM and in the 30 degree weather, rolls his windows down and parks next to us. So anyways, we can't help but notice that a manager has been watching us from the doors and looking down at his wrist for a few minutes. Then we see our complainer show up and we decide to be a bag full of dicks about it.

note, we're standing about 2 feet from each other and caps lock does mean ""as loud as we can""

toxlab,1,17,1q81nl,52,"When I worked at the pretentious place (I keep coming back to it, so I'm gonna call it Les Pantalons Fancie  from now on) the restaurant was located in the ground floor of a very spendy condo block. Many of the residents were regular diners. Old Rich Lady problems abounded.

There was one old bat named Mrs Schitt who seemed particularly fond of disemboweling the help. She was often critical of changes she requested be made.

""Well why on Earth would you do THAT?

..umm, you just asked me to?

Her frequent dining companions were her husband and daughter. Her husband had a near crippling stroke and had only partial control of one arm. The daughter had severe MS and aside from poor motor control was like a twisted Shrinky Dink copy of her mother. Every visit was a nightmare. So many servers had been reduced to tears. The first time I got stuck with them I was shitting myself. Schitt gave me the stink stench eye and belittled me. I found out later she gave my boss hell about my haircut, but didn't have anything bad to say about the service.

I was now assigned to them. Oh God.

They would nickle and dime everything on every visit but as long as they coughed up full fare, the boss didn't give a shit about how nasty they were. They could have two free half ounce sides of every sauce on the menu for free, but any more and he demanded a few quarters. So you would have to bring them a whole tray of assorted ramekins.

The husband and daughter required food cut into bite sizes. Special drinking ware was used. The daughter was dismissive and hateful and liked to fling things onto the carpet.

I once brought out a salad with a slice of cucumber on it to the husband. He began to quiver. His mouth seized and drool leapt out. His one good hand was fluttering wildly at the wrist. He hated cucumber like people hate Hitler and his broken body was the only thing stopping him from going apeshit. Mrs Schitt put it together and began screeching as I darted across the restaurant with the offensive vegetable.

That night I was confabing with the bartender when I imagined the life that this woman had. Her needs were met, she was being kept well, but those closest to her were severely disabled. Her husband, her partner, this captain of industry, reduced to this quivering mass that shits itself. Her daughter, twisted physically and emotionally with a bent soul that bears it's mothers fingerprints.

I would be desperately controlling as well. I would be relentlessly angry because I would see the pity in other's eyes and I would rage at the indignity. I could empathize.

Then the barman dropped the science on me.

He had been there for ages. They were always shitty people. The husband had been the shittiest, throwing food that displeased him and once pouring coffee on a server. He did so much shouting that when a gasket blew and he stroked out everyone kind of saw it coming. The women were always needlessly cruel and demanding.

They were just shitty people being shitty.

There were bitchy ones, drunk ones, messy ones, and yes of course there were entitled ones. But with how many there already are on this sub who wants to hear another depressing story about a shitty customer? Instead I thought I would share a story about sweet, sweet, petty justice. 
 
Alright so about 6 months ago I was working at the ice cream shop that advertises with commercials featuring those god awful giant red lips, you may recognize them. It was me and my sister on for an evening shift during which I had the displeasure of encountering a rather whale like woman with a bad attitude and a voracious appetite for tartar sauce, we'll call her Tartar Whale (TW for short).

So TW walks (waddles) into the store and asks for an empty bucket of strawberry sauce. After checking the back of the store we politely tell her that we don't have any to spare. Tartar whale is displeased with this but still decides to order a fish sandwich meal. We fill her order within a few minutes, as it was very slow, and bid her good day. As she opens the to-go box, TW's eyes bulged out of her head in disgust and diabetic rage as she snarled that she did not, in fact, order a fish sandwich but asked for a shrimp basket! We apologized and began to cook the ""shrimp"" (we live a thousand miles away from the ocean) in the deep fryer. As we do TW requests 4 additional cups of tartar sauce. Now the cups are about 5 ounces each so that's roughly 20 ounces of tartar sauce she planned on clogging her arteries with. As we go into the kitchen my sister says something along the lines of ""well shit, we're out or tartar sauce (we had very little left, not nearly enough for 4 cups) what are we going to do now? I don't want to get bitched at again"" I thought about it for a few seconds and my mind hatched a petty, childishly evil plan to get back at TW. ""We lace it"" I say ""we can mix a little tartar sauce with mostly mayonnaise"". So we threw together our Trojan tartar sauce and offered it to TW, thanking god she asked for it to-go. As TW speed-waddled out of the store and into her car we made bets over whether or not she would come back to bitch but she never returned and we had a good laugh.

So I suppose the moral of the story is if you have to be polite to people you can't stand every day you can at least take joy in small petty jabs when you can get them.",Tale of the Tartar Whale,38

&gt; C: ""Would you wear khakis with them?""

I'm thinking, ""Seriously? I just answered this."" I reply, ""Probably jeans.""

&gt; M: ""No, ma'am. There's nothing I can do about the shipping charge. If we put that cardigan on hold for you, and you didn't call back within the time you said you would, then it was put back on the selling floor. You do realize this is a retail store, right?""

&gt; C: ""But I called the next day, and then it was just gone. You had two left, and then it was gone. That's so weird, right?""

I have a lot of self-harm scars.

We're not talking hundreds, we're talking *thousands*.  Some more noticeable than others.

I work in a business where I'm lifting heavy equipment daily, so if I wear long-sleeves under my work uniform, I'll overheat  very quickly.  So, to spare myself the heat exhaustion, I just wear my regular short-sleeved uniform and pants.

I work with customers face-to-face and have to interact with them on a daily basis as well as help new employees with equipment from time to time.

Now, it's not *everyone* that writes me off as an angst-y young adult with issues, but I get at least one customer a day who just doesn't seem to understand that I have a soul.

One particular day, I wasn't in the best frame of mind and was just kind of clocking in the hours.  Typical and not a huge deal.

Well, a customer comes in and starts to joke around with me, saying things like ""Oh, I heard you had a lot of complaints today.  I'm going to speak with your manager.  ...just kidding!""

Now, I have a form of Asperger's that makes it hard for me to understand course joking sometimes, so I took every ""joke"" literally.

I tried to laugh it off after a few minutes, but then he goes off and says ""What is your problem anyway?  It's just a joke.""  

I casually explain that I don't understand those jokes all the time because I have autism and he goes and says ""Oh, yeah, I could see the likes of you having autism."" as he glared at my arms.

...Fuck you, dude.  Fuck you.

Then, another time, a woman came by and started to insult how I looked and dressed.

Now, I have long bangs that cover half of my face because I'm missing an eyebrow on my left side.  I don't do makeup on it, so I wear my hair this way to cover it up.

Our uniforms are black and grey with either black or kaki pants.  I don't wear kaki because I (knowing my tendencies to get hurt) would somehow get bloodstains on it or muss it up with dirt and grime.  So, I stick with black pants and a black shirt.  To dress it up, I wear wide, colorful wristbands and a rainbow lanyard.  

So, given my look, she goes off and starts to make fun of my hair.  ""Why do you wear your hair that way?  You don't even look like you have a face!  Get a haircut.  And why do you wear wristbands anyway?  Are you homosexual?""  

All very casually, like she was just talking about normal stuff.  I brush it off, because I get comments like that all the time.

*Then*, she leans into my ear and says ""You're going to rot in Hell.""

Out of the fucking blue.  What.  The.  Fuck.

I cannot comprehend people.  I really can't.

Head office decides the plans and we have to stick to them but this rep just could not grasp the concept that we can't help her at store level, she must contact head office.

After she had given her sales pitch i tried to tell her this but she kept interrupting me saying how her products were the best in the market and we would make so much more sales if we took them on. I tried to remain calm but one thing i can't stand is pushy people who just won't listen, so i just said no thanks, made my excuses and said goodbye.

I hear her call me a prick under her breath and i turn round to confront her. She quickly grabs her stuff and goes into the toilet before i had the chance to say anything. I Fully intended to wait until she came out so i could give her a piece of my mind(what little is left) and tell her that i will be contacting her company to complain about her conduct.

Beatleboy62,13,40,1q7jts,136,"Last year, during October, I was working at a big name Halloween store. It was nice, my co-workers were nice, and it was a bit of nice extra pocket money before Christmas. 

Anyway, one afternoon, my brother and I were on the sales floor helping people, when we hear our co-worker requesting our help. We walk over to where she was, the dressing room, and see that she's attempting to stop two women from going into the dressing room (as more than one person, unless it's a parent and young child, in the dressing room is a big no-no). This is because, for the most part, more thna one person in there ends with people stealing things. Since we were unable to do anything besides politely asking them to leave, we called our boss, whom I'm calling to call Bob. 

Bob came over, and flat out told the women, ""Unless you leave right now and empty your (large) hand bags, I'm going to call the police.""

Bob is a great guy. He's nice to everyone, and brings food in for his workers, and he's overall just a swell guy. He's also flamingly gay, as the two women noticed.

As they backed towards the door, they started yelling to each other, ""WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT THIS FLAMMING FAGGOT OVER HERE?""

""I'M SORRY (name), I COULDN'T HEAR YOU, I WAS TALKING TO THE FRUITY HOMOSEXUAL.""

But Bob didn't do anything to provoke them more. He just stayed calm, letting them slowly walk over to the door. By the time they got there, there was a cop waiting for them.

What did they end up being arrested for?

Attempting to steal two packs of costume makeup.

Afterwords, I talked to Bob and asked him, ""How did you deal with them when they kept yelling those names at you? I would have yelled right back.""

Now the tale!

The women's clothing store I work for is part of a larger corporation. There are two main stores and then both of those stores have their respective outlet stores. Occasionally my store and another will be located in the same shopping center/s.

It was a slow day and I was busying myself placing new product and rearranging the various parts of the store in accordance with our latest store set. I have a new girl on staff that night and an associate that I had tasked with other odd jobs that needed to be done. 

Our bliss was interrupted by a customer walking in and telling us she had called from another store and had put an item on hold. I will call her Raddish because that's what her name sounded like at first (she had a small accent). 

I look in our holds closet and find nothing under her name. I ask when she placed the item on hold, she replies that she had called Monday night. I had closed Monday and none of this was familiar, her name, a call from that particular store, none of it. 

She is firm that she had placed it on hold here and that we had taken her credit card information and everything. This is a HUGE red flag. We never take credit card information unless we are sending the item out to be delivered to the customer via FedEx. 
I explain and ask if she misunderstood that she had actually placed an order. She becomes increasingly frustrated and adamant that she had called us, put the item on hold, and had given us her info. She describes the item (is unfamiliar to me and the stock woman I describe it to later) at which point it occurs to me ""Oh, she probably means the other store!""

I ask, and again I am met with frustration and aggravation and a renewed fervor that no, it was here, we have it, and we took her info and she knows that it is here. I even offer to call up to their store and give them Raddish's name to double check.

This goes on for a few minutes before she decides that she is going to get her receipt from the store that she called from so that I can call and ask for the associate who supposedly called us and try to work the situation out. On her way out she states ""I'm going to go upstairs and make sure that it is not up there!"" in as huffy a manner as she can.

She leaves and never returns. Guess I know where her shirt was at.

She is at the age where she is on her last year of high school and will eventually be going off to college. She has been working for the company for about two years and no one has ever really had a big complaint about her.

Hope: I have some really exciting news the 2 jobs that I applied for hired me! 

Me: Well that is great.

i talk to her about the jobs she was hired for and everything like that.

Hope: I am afraid what the head manager would say though. She got really mad when she didn't know one girl got another job and didn't tell the head manager about it.  

Me: Hope, one day you are going to leave this company and someone is going to have to take your place. You are moving on and taking a job that you think is better for you. I am really happy that you have taken those two jobs. You have many options on how you want to leave this company. You can transition smoothly or give your two weeks notice, etc.

Phishmcz,27,56,1q6t0f,174,"This story is pretty long.
I work in the bakery at the flagship store of my company, where our bakery and deli department are connected, this will be important later. In our bakery, we have a large refrigerated case with a lot of very nicely decorated cakes and cupcakes that customers can request we get for them, then write on. Normally no matter how late it is in the night, I'll still pull a cake from the case and write on it for someone.
So yesterday it was raining out, so I wear my raincoat to work. I get to my store and go straight into the back of the bakery to hang it up, rather than bundle it up and shove it in my locker. Most of the girls in the bakery do the same.

So my shift goes by, everything is great. No problems. The end of the night rolls around, I close up the department, and I head upstairs to the breakroom to get my purse out of my locker. I realize I had forgotten my jacket in the bakery, so I grab my stuff and head back downstairs, sliding my time card to clock out as I go.
(This is where my super awesome shift is ruined)

There is a woman standing in front of our cake case on the phone talking about how she ""can't wait to try it"". I know, of course, she's talking about one of our cakes. Now the lights in the case are turned off to indicate to customers the department is closed. I do my best to slip into the back hoping she won't see me, but alas, my efforts were useless because the next thing I hear is ""Oh hold on! Someone is here to help me. I'll call you back! *giggle* ok byeeeeee"". I come out from the back with my jacket and purse in hand, avoiding eye contact with 
Annoying Cake Lady.

ACL- Can I get this black and white torte? And can you write ""Happy Birthday Sophie"" on it? I have to go grab some flowers from the floral department. Thanks!"" *she starts to turn around to walk away*

Me- Oh I'm sorry the bakery actually closed for the night, but you're more than welcome to come back tomorrow morning to get one! Someone opens the bakery at 5.

ACL- But I need it for tonight. Isn't there anyone here that can do it?

Me- No I'm sorry there's not. The last person is off at 7 and the bakery closes at 9, which is when I clocked off as well.

ACL- Then why are you back here?!

Me- I forgot my jacket in the back

ACL- Can't you just make this on exception?

Me- Miss I'm already off the clock. Even if I wanted to *(which I very clearly didn't because  by this point my jacket is on and I'm ready to run out the door)* it would be illegal for me to work off the clock

ACL- So you're not going to help me?

Me- No I'm sorry. Like I said, you can come back tomorrow bright and early to get a cake for your friend. We're here as early as 5am.

ACL- What about her? Can't she help me?

I turn to see my co worker Maria, who works in the Deli, walking through our department to leave as well. Now Maria is from Russia, her english isn't great and neither is her english writting skill, so writting on a cake would've been kind of difficult for her. Plus she doesn't even work in the bakery! It's, in no way, her job to help this woman in another department where she has no training. And Poor Maria is just staring at us because she has no idea what's going on.

Me- She doesn't actually work in the bakery. She works in the deli, so she wouldn't be able to help you either.

ACL- UGH! So WHO can help me?!

Me- No one. Most of the other departments are also closed up. You could potentially ask a courtesy clerk *(someone who bags groceries and pulls in shopping carts, they normally stay till 11)* but again, they're also not trained over here.

ACL- I don't even know why I shop here! This place is terrible! *she storms off*

NotableNobody,70,53,1q6n77,280,"I worked for two years at a chain video-rental and entertainment store. It was my first real retail job, and offered a lot of customer service experience that I was lacking. For the first year or so, my manager was a fun, loud woman named Rose. While she was unpopular with some customers for her unapologetic, forward nature in dealing with service issues, she remains one of my favorite bosses to this very day.

On this day, I witnessed a play in three parts. Here is the story of the Job Applicant.

------------------------------------------------------
In our relatively small city, our store was very attractive to high-school kids looking for a job. Every day, Rose received between five and twenty phone calls from students checking up on job applications or asking to see if we were hiring. It was kind of annoying, but usually we'd just tell them they'd get a call back if we wanted an interview. These were often kids who'd been drilled by their parents to call over and over again to ""show incentive"", speak to the manager, etc., and they were very persistent.

One morning, coming in to work, I stopped by the coffee shop to grab a little pick-me-up. As the barista was making my coffee, the phone rang, and she answered. That early in the morning, we were instructed by Rose to give applicant calls the usual spiel rather than forward the phone call to her. 

The barista is right in the middle of saying, ""Rose will give you a call back if we accept your application, in the meantime it is active within our system for the next 90 days, and-"" when suddenly the other line erupts with screaming. The girl on the other end actually shrieked so loud that for a moment I thought one of the espresso machines had broken - the line cut out, and then picked up again on the caller demanding to be forwarded to the manager. 

The barista made a face, held the phone a foot away from her ear, and said, ""I WILL FORWARD YOU TO ROSE PLEASE HOLD"" before holding the call and dropping the receiver.

""Oh my *god*"" she muttered. ""What a crazy asshole."" She finished making my coffee before paging the office. As I left, I heard her say, ""Hey, Rose? The caller on line one is asking for you. About a job. Yeah, yeah, I know, just wait. You're in for a treat.""

I made my way back to the employee room to change. When I got in to the office to check my schedule, I caught the very end of Rosie slamming the phone back onto the hook. She was wild-eyed when she looked back at me and said, ""Who the FUCK did she think she was!?""

What she told me, I'll relay here: After the barista told her how she'd been threatened and screamed at by the girl on the other end of the phone, Rose took the call. When she began talking to her, the girl was very sweet.

""I just wanted you to know, I love your store, and it would be an honor to be a part of your team,"" she oozed. Rose asked what her name was, and offered to review her application right away. The girl offered her name and sounded excited.

""Okay,"" said Rose, ""I just deleted your application."" To the sound of sputtering, festering rage, she scolded, ""You do not get to treat my employees the way you just did and expect special treatment from me. We're a team here, and you just demonstrated to me that you're incapable of treating another human being with respect. I'm marking your application and blacklisting your name, and as long as I'm manager here, you will *never* be employed with me.""

The girl screamed. Wordlessly. Rose told me that the line cut out again, and when I walked in she hung up without another word.

I took my till out to the register, and as I prepared for another busy day of cashiering, the phone rang. Without even thinking about what had just happened, I answered with the customary company greeting. A girl with a sulky voice responded.

""Hello...? Uh. I'd like to speak to your manager.""

*Now* realized who I was probably speaking to. ""Okay,"" I said, ""I'll forward you to Rose right away."" I waited a beat, and sure enough she said,

""Uh. No. I'd like to speak to Rose's manager.""

""Rose is the store manager,"" I told her. ""There is no person currently present with more power in the company. If you have a customer service issue, we have two counter managers present today.""

""No, uh. Look, how about you just send my call to your corporate manager?""

I almost laughed out loud. Our CEO is down in Texas, and more often than not, he's traveling abroad, fishing. The District Manager, while more accessible, isn't just a phone-transfer away. I had no idea if he was even working that day. I explained this to the girl. I also, at this point, had absolutely no incentive to provide her with that information - she'd harassed two employees within the store within five minutes of our opening.

""Yeah, except, see, I just had a. Uh. A really... *emotional*... experience with Rose. And I'd rather not talk to her. So you should probably just send me to your corporate manager.""

""I just told you, that's physically impossible,"" I said. ""The highest-up person I can send you to is Rose herself.""

""I think you're lying,"" said the girl. ""In fact, I'm pretty sure you are. So, uh, what's your name? Because I'm going to get you fired, too.""

Brilliant. ""My name's Kendra."" (SPOILERS: My name isn't Kendra)

""Well, Kendra, when I get a hold of your manager-""

""Which one?"" I said. This was too good an opportunity to pass up. 

""Your CORPORATE manager-""

""Oh, well good luck with that,"" I said.

""Hey,"" the girl yelled, ""I DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP W-""

I hung up. We never heard back from her, or any evidence that she ever called our headquarters. More likely than not, if she ever did, someone with a lot more power and gumption than I had made a few more minutes of fun out of her.

tl;dr: Don't scream at the people you want to hire you. It probably won't pan out in your favor, and you'll probably wind up a story on Reddit.","Scream Louder, Get Job!",333
unmined,15,22,1q6lpx,91,"Tales From the Financial Company - Somewhat retail, since we accepted cash in exchange for paper. Really expensive paper.

My retail experience began with a shitty taco shop in San Diego (oddly terrible, since it was so close to Mexico). As I grew older, I upgraded to grocery stores and book stores. Finance was my first “big boy” job where I got to wear a suit and tie.

Odor Week Entry 3:

I posted a brief version of this as a comment to a similar story a few months ago. This is the special enhanced version with bonus scene and director commentary.

We begin … Have you even wandered into a public restroom, only to find it has been destroyed by a feces-spewing demon from the bowels of hell?

I have. Frequently. So had many of my co-workers. It began one random day, then happened every single day going forward. Always a men’s room, but the attack varied between floors (we had one large restroom for each gender on each floor. Four floors in all).

The M.O. was always the same. 

1. The shit bandit would enter a stall, grab all the paper ass-gaskets, wad them up and drop them in the bowl. 

2. Then he would unleash a bowel movement so large that it seems unlikely to originate from a human (not a voluminous as a horse, but close). Medically concerning: he was able to produce this pile of turd every.single.day.. I can’t imagine how much food would need to be consumed in order to pull this off.

3. He would top-off his fecal archipelago with a dusting of the toilette paper required to cleanse his anus from said dump.

Once his “art” was complete, he’d give the toilet a few “fuck you” flushes to ensure that there was a least a minor flood, and a couple of nuggets on the floor.

Based roughly on the times it happened, it was deduced that it was an employee and not a customer. The customer lobby had its own restroom, and an employee would have to exit the office area and “badge in” to the reception area. So a record would have been produced.

How do we solve this problem?

Stakeout.

A brave employee staked out the restrooms. He would enter when nobody else was inside and verify the state of each stall. Then he would lock himself in the furthest stall and hang an out-of-order sign. He would sit on the tank and rest his feet on the bowl, so there was no outward sign of his presence.

Then he waited.

I can’t imagine what it would have been like to sit like this in the restroom for hours at a time. (Okay, I can … after eating at Applebees). But he did. And it paid off.

The Shit Bandit was caught. He was trailed far enough away to keep the observer anonymous.

All the evidence was taken to HR. HR consulted our attorneys, who approved the termination, but decided to not press charges or seek restitution.

The next day, the Shit Bandit was intercepted on his way in and escorted to HR. We kept a security guard outside the door in case there was a problem.

Oddly, there was no problem. He admitted it, would not offer an explanation, and simply left.

The “strange” part was that this was a good employee. He did his job well. His customers and coworkers liked him. There was exactly zero times he ever expressed any animosity toward the company, job, or peers.

The speculation was that he was either sociopathic or suffered from coprophelia. Regardless, nothing excuses this behavior.

He left that morning, and the bathrooms were never destroyed again.

Techsupportvictim,9,17,1q6if3,77,"Background: Okay before I was a fruit picker, I worked at one of two big bookstore companies. I was a supervisor and it was company policy that only supes and managers could do returns so I have many great ones, especially of return fraud

So this one was not long after my store opened to a new bigger layout. I had a guy come up with several new releases saying he wanted to return them. DVDs and CDs these were. 

Now here's the thing. It was the day they came out and we'd been open perhaps an hour. But they had our sticker on them (not really that unique so they could be faked) etc. 

Guy has no receipt. So I do as policy says and check for the sales history. Try to find the receipt that way to see how he paid etc.

Catch is that there were no sales on any of this titles. He's given me some sob story about buying them and right as he left he got a call his brother was in a car wreck and he needs the cash, etc. 

I shrug and suggest perhaps the transaction was so recent the main system hasn't updated the history. He's being really nice but asks if we could just do it etc. I explain to him that without the transaction number I would have to do it as a no receipt and he'd get a store credit that can't be cashed out (in our state gift cards must be cashed if asked but if you label something a store credit or reward, nope). 

I volunteer to go back and ask our general manager to check the transaction journal. Shouldn't take long since it's been only an hour since he was there. And we haven't been that busy.

Of course there is nothing in the journals. 8am opening no shock. Exactly two non cafe transactions and their system can only take their stuff and newsstand. 

So the GM runs back the front door security feed. We see the guy walk in for the return. Nothing before that. GM walks with me back to cash wrap and tells the guy he's not getting refund. Why? Because he didn't buy them there. Guy insists they came from us, they have our sticker etc. GM is like, maybe you got them from here but you didn't BUY them. 

Tells the guy to leave and never come back. He's banned for life. Here's the kicker, he won't give the guy the stuff back. Guy demands it and GM says when he can produce a receipt he can have the stuff back. Guy yells that is theft, GM tells him to file a police report. Actually hands the guy his business card to make sure the name is spelled right. 

Three years that shop was open before the company went bankrupt and we never figured out if he stole them from us somehow (partner slipped them out before they were security boxed), stole them somewhere else and faked out stickers or what. But that stack of stuff was sitting dusty on a shelf in GM office up to day we closed",Tales of returns. #1. You didn't buy that here,94

I was given about a week and a half of training, and then left on my own for whole 8 hour shifts without any help.  Also, I can't have caffeine, otherwise I get dizzy and nauseous.  This means that I had little experience with coffee drinks.

Me (having a heart attack at this point):  ""Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!"" -quickly get her water, all the while apologizing profusely- ""I'm really, really sorry!  I'm new here, but I should have known better!  Here, let me remake and refund your drink, and I'll give you a coupon for a free drink next time you shop at our chain.  Again, I can't apologize enough!!""

TB:  ""THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!  Get me your manager, NOW!""

Me:  ""Yes, ma'am, of course!""

I call up my manager and explain the situation to him, and he makes his way over, apparently taking *way* too long for this lady, who is huffing and puffing about.  She then yells at him for about five minutes about how incompetent and stupid I am, refuses to take another drink from me (but does take the refund and coupon), and goes back to shopping.

Later, still a bit shaken from my first ever crazy customer, and slowly realizing that that little sip of caffeine would never send *my* body in a spin, I see her just 15 feet away at self check-out.  She's yelling at her husband on the phone, because apparently the TV won't work and he can't fix it.   All the while, she is standing at a self-checkout kiosk and is obviously too angry to swipe her groceries.  The person manning the self-checkout area has to come over and swipe and bag her groceries for her.

She tells her husband she is going to call the cable company, and a few minutes later, I hear her yelling into the phone:  ""GET ME YOUR MANAGER ON THE PHONE, RIGHT NOW!""  

I broke down laughing, and learned that day that some people are just assholes.",This has caffeine!? OH GOD I'M GOING TO DIE.,465
FredFltStn,189,499,1q6h7l,1273,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Someone else had posted a good [story](http://redd.it/1q5rop) about a shopper showing up at closing time and just browsing. It reminded me of this story.

As you can imagine, we get crazy as hell the closer it gets to the 4th of July. I try to staff accordingly, but of course things never go as you plan them.

July 2nd should have been a very busy day for us. What it actually turned out to be was a madhouse, and we did almost twice the business I had forecasted.  I’m not complaining, there were a lot of high fives given that day, but after being on my feet for 15 hours, I was damn tired.

We had closed the store at 10pm, an hour after we were supposed to. I had sent home the cashiers around 9:45pm, since they were supposed to be back at 7:30am the next morning, and the only people left were, my dad, one of my employees, and me.

We turned off the lights, lowered the sides of the tent and locked up the fence. I was walking to my car with the cash drawer when a car pulled up.

The guy was a regular customer and a friend. He was having a party and wanted to grab just a few things. I felt bad for him, so we unlocked the fence, and walked back inside. He started running around and grabbing the stuff he wanted while I put the cash drawer back in the register.

Of course, two minutes later, a group of 5 people walk into the tent. I told them we were closed, and that they had five minutes to shop, figuring that’s about what it would take my friend to finish.

And then the human tsunami hit…

I don’t know where the hell they were coming from, but people started pouring into the tent. This is a tough situation. First, I’m there to make money, but I was tired as hell, I still had to swing by the bank for a drop, and I didn’t really have the staff to handle the crowd. I sucked it up, and started ringing in sales as fast as I could. Around 10:45pm, I announced to the few remaining shoppers that they had 10 minutes left.

At 11:10pm, I’m trying to get the last two people out of the damn tent. They’ve obviously been partying, and they’re just taking their time browsing. At 11:20, they’re holding maybe $10 of stuff in their hands, and just laughing and stumbling around. I finally can’t take it anymore. I walk up to the couple and tell them that we’re closed, and that they need to check out now if they want to buy anything.

The guy immediately gets an attitude, and tells me that they’re not done shopping yet. I get an attitude and explain to him that yes, in fact they are. He drops his stuff on the floor in front of me, and heads for the door. As the couple is walking out, a truck pulls up.

I’m tired, hungry, and ready for a shower. As the guy is stepping out of the truck, I don’t even bother to look up, and just call out, “We’re closed”. 

**GUY:**  Come on man. I want to pick up some stuff.

**ME:**  We were supposed to close at 9pm. It’s 11:30, and I’m ready for bed. You’ll have to come back tomorrow. We open at 8am.

**GUY:**  Yeah, but it’s going to be busy tomorrow. I don’t like shopping when it’s crowded.

**ME:**  It’s going to be a madhouse tomorrow. I’d get here early if I were you.

**GUY:**  Can’t you just let me get my stuff now? A friend of mine told me about your place, and said you guys could just put a package together for me. I want to spend around $1500.

**ME:**  Welcome to &lt;my company name&gt;. Come on in, we’re open.

ravencrowe,32,28,1q6f44,66,"Back in high school I worked in a popular Game Store. I was lucky to work in the smallest, and therefore most relaxed, store in the district (and, based on my experience with transferring, in the entire north-east). My boss was lenient on the dress code, and as such I was allowed to keep my blue hair and wear whatever jewelry I wanted. The funny thing is, most retail places are strict about facial piercings so you would have thought my nose ring would be the issue, yet the only thing that caused me trouble was my necklace.

So one day I'm working behind the counter with my boss, it's just the two of us working the store and we're both on registers. I was dressed even more casually than usual that day (I came in wearing a t-shirt. My boss said, ""You're supposed to be wearing a collared shirt,"" to which I tugged on the neck and said ""This is a collar.""), and I was wearing the pentagram necklace that I wore every day. For anyone who doesn't know, pentagrams are a symbol of Wicca, which is about nature spirits and not devil worship. 

Near the end of our shift a middle-age white suburban mom came in. She grabbed an Xbox controller and approached the register. My boss was busy doing inventory at the moment, so I smiled and said ""Can I help you?"" She looked at my boss, then back at me and said ""I'll wait."" My boss looked up from the work he was doing and said, ""I'm actually busy right now. Is there a reason she can't help you?""

To which the lady looks at me reproachfully and says:

""I don't like her necklace. It's satanic."" 

I was so surprised that I couldn't think of anything to say, so I just turned around, sat on the floor behind the counter and went back to putting away trade-ins. My boss stopped doing inventory so he could help her. As soon as she left, he turned to me and said, ""What the fuck! What a fucking bitch!""

I thought the whole thing was hilarious, but my boss was legitimately mad (at her, not at me). He went on a tirade for the rest of the night about how stupid people are. 

I mean seriously, does she think she's going to get struck by lightning for passing money with a devil worshipper? Or maybe she thought that her controller would be cursed if I touched it. If only I had the power to do that.

MrN4T3,13,17,1q62fn,45,"background: I work at a big box retail electronics store. They like blue and are famous for a yellow tag.
*sidenote* why is everyone so vague about where they work? I feel pressured about it...

anyways I was working ap/lp/security guy that day. Towards the end of my shift the sales support manager had double covered us. I asked the store manager if I could leave, they asked if I could do some inventory stuff. I agreed, went to the ""warehouse"" to analyze and begin. decided that gaming and mobile phone accessories should be put on the floor first since they would make everything a hassle had I not. This is where 1.5-2 hrs of confusion and annoyance began.

I had just finished stocking gaming was quickly powering through mobile accessories. A coworker approached me and asked if I could help a customer with an Xbox so that a Youth Group Fundraiser At His Church may take place. (personally a PC guy but whatever) this guy seemed fishy. He matched a description a PC/tablets manager(CBG for short) had run into the night before. Everything was there, CBG described a middle eastern man with a fake tax exempt card, shorter and bald. He was kinda fat too.

while walking over to gaming to show him the different bundles we had ($50 gift card is issued with the purchase of one)this dick head(DH=scammer) started to make fun of my boss that caught him earlier, everyone likes CBG. DH called him fat and stupid and said I looked smart. DH was doing everything he could to get on my good side and to try and hurry the process. DH wanted all the bundles with a kinect or a minimum of a 250gb hdd. DH asked how many I had of each bundle. I knew off hand that it was two and proceeded to tell him that. DH asked me to double check on our system on a particular bundle. Without me noticing to much he grabbed a kart and just began loading them and asked me to get a ladder to grab more off top stock. This was my chance to bust him. Hopefully my sort would see some justice because this guy was an asshole.

I gave some fib that I needed keys to get the ladder, so while I was putting distance between me and him I was sort of yelling in the radio that we were about to have a scam attempt. Whimpering to get a manager or someone to help. he wanted to check out in a dark corner of the store near by, I knew 100% that this dude was so full of shit by now. I redirected him to customer service and just after that someone finally responded with help. I let them know that DH was on his way to customer service and he was intercepted by one of our many managers(GS is the manager this time). DH was not happy.

DH was limited from ~10 to 5 after some argument. then GS continued to check him out with only the knowledge that I smelt a scam. CBG did not fill in GS about his previous attempt. His faulty card showed, and GS told him to apply for a real one.

it was actually approved, I had to check him out. each bundle was checked out individually, with his tax exempt and points card, so he could get money of the next purchase(remember $50 gift card promo?)*anger*

internetmexican,3,14,1q602p,76,"Yo, InternetMexican here again.

Now before I worked at Red and Khaki, I worked at the mall inside a popular ""brand"" theatre. Although I was inside the movie theatre I did not work for it, I worked for a market research company which had people take surveys on upcoming hollywood films. You know those guys with the clipboards that come ask if you have maybe 5 mins to spare, I was one. Now I know this is not exactly Retail, but I still had to deal with the theaters  customers. The job was not too bad, 8 per hour plus a $5 commission per survey, and we were expected to do 2 per hour. 

**Story**
White lady comes to the movies, but does not buy a ticket, instead she stands by the door and stares at us. I notice her staring, and feel weird. The thing is we have had people come in, and stare at us before, usually they are secret shoppers. When it is a secret shopper, they usually come in, and take a survey...this lady....she did not do that, she just stared at us so finally I ask my coworkers 

**the cast**
Me: Me
Will the manager: W
Mohawk the asian guy: M
Rico suave the alright looking mexican dude: RS
and bowl cut stressed guy...our manager: BCSG
and finally the crazy lady: CL (ever watch grown ups? you know the old lady that is that one dude's wife in the movie...yeah she looked like a sloppier version of her...)

Me: WTF is up with that lady, she has been staring at us for like 30 mins


M: AWW! she is back hey BCSG, CL is back

BCSG: as long as she stays outside it is not our problem, just do your job.

Me: wait...she has done this before?

RS: dude...she has been here ALL WEEK

Me: what happened?

now this is what happened: CL went to watch horrible bosses, and was offended by Jennifer Anniston's character, but why? She was offended because HER name is Jennifer, and according to her now people will think SHE is a whore, and she would like to let the ""people in charge"" that they have ruined her life....yeah...i know

So CL went to complain to the theater's management, they dealt with her for a while, but because they just wanted to get rid of her, they told her that she should come give her opinion to US. The reasoning being that since we conduct surveys for the movie studios, we could help her out. So she came to us....I was not there on the days this happened though, but I am told it went like this

CL: I would like to give my opinion on a movie

M: great, I will just need to get your name, age, email, and ethnicity please. Then we can get a trailer for you to watch.

CL: No, I want to put a complaint in about horrible bosses.... (she then goes on to tell her what I explained already, about why she is so upset)

M:uhhm...

W:Yeah, see...we just do surveys for movies that have not been released...like we show you a trailer and you tell us what you do, and dont like....

CL: You work for the studios right?

W: well, not us personally, but our com-

CL: THEN TAKE MY COMPLAINT!

W: (grabs a form from behind our kiosk which we use to get opinions from people just after they watch a movie) Here, fill this out, and we will send it to WB right away.

CL fills out the form, turns it in and leaves, but continues to come back to the movies for a whole week since she has not heard back from the studios and wishes to know what the studios plan to do about her situation..... After being stared at for about an hour the manager of the theatre finally gets tired of her and goes to tell her to leave, tells her she is freaking out the guests, and if she does not leave then he will call security to escort her out. After that she left never to return. 

I have some more stories, but I must sleep now. ",The Kiosk,90
slandeh,21,29,1q5w5v,122,"As stated before, I've done a lot of returns, and had a lot of ""arguments"" with customers, and some still take the cake as the dumbest things I've had to do in my career. I've become seasoned enough to enjoy ""arguing"" with customers. I had a particularly upset guy try to tell me point blank he didn't care how much ""fraud"" he could be committing, he just wanted cash for his purchase.

A man comes in with a tool kit (we'll call him Tool) he purchased from us (the name brand is store specific, so it's not possible to buy from somewhere else) and tells me that it didn't work for the job he was trying to accomplish. So I ask for a receipt (to begin with, policy is first that a receipt must be available, or can be looked up in order to issue a proper refund, if no receipt is available, a manager can approve of a return, but it would be issued on gift card and only for lowest amount the item sold for within the last 30/60/90 days of purchase, depending on item.) The man states he must've thrown it away and didn't have it. No problem, we start to look it up int he system.

I first ask him for his phone number, since it's the easiest to look up, type it in and look for the item, not found. No problem, let's try another phone number, still no luck. I'm starting to believe he may have bought it long after the return policy, but ask how he paid for it. He says by cash, which eliminates being able to look it up by his credit card. I tell the guy that because I can't find his receipt, I can't issue a refund. He complains that he knows he bought it from here, since the brand isn't anywhere else. I explain that it's not necessarily where he bought it, but when he bought it. The return period is pretty specific. He wants to talk to someone else, so I get him my ASM.

My ASM is a little too busy to come deal with a return, and agrees to just do the refund without a receipt. Alright, fair enough. I turn to the guy after hanging up with my ASM and tell him that my manager approved for me to go ahead and do a return without receipt. As I start processing it, I inform him that per policy, I can do it, but I would have to issue him a gift card and it would be at the lowest selling point the item has been at since within the return period. This is the breaking point for Tool.

Tool: Are you fucking stupid? I said I wanted my cash back for that item, I won't take a gift card. You know why? Because I can't use the gift card anywhere else, and I have to go somewhere else to get the fucking set I need to do my job. I won't take a gift card.
Me: Well, I can't override the system, since we are already doing an override and giving you a return without a receipt anyway. At least I can give you $24 back for the item.
Tool: You're joking me, right? I paid $30 for that, and I want $30 back, and in cash! I want to talk to someone else.

So, I pick up the phone, and call back my ASM, who says he'll be right down. When ASM shows up, I begin helping a different customer, but overhear the whole conversation, which started with my ASM going through the same routine I just finished: looking up the receipt. While he is going through that, I notice that Tool is trying to pretend like I didn't look up his wife's number (which I did) and while he is explaining that I must be stupid for not asking it, I interrupt and point out that I looked up two numbers, which neither were explained who they belonged to, so I had no idea I was looking up his wife's number. Tool gives me a dirty look, and tries to explain that I wasn't saying what I was doing during the whole transaction, so how was he supposed to know what I was getting phone numbers for, even though I ASKED for them and stated I needed them to find the receipt.

After my ASM finally clarifies that I've already attempted to look up the item, he tells the guy that he can't do anything more than return the item for a gift card at the value I've already given him. So Tool asks if he can show my ASM something and walks him down the aisle where the item is located. I assumed it was because he didn't want me interjecting more comments to make him look bad. When he comes back, it seems my ASM has convinced him to somehow accept the gift card. So he runs the transaction, and finally gets his gift card. On his way out, Tool crumples the receipt and throws it on the floor. All my manager had to say was ""That's how he lost his first receipt."" for me to be unable to move for a whole two minutes because I was laughing so hard.

Once I got over myself, I finished the transaction with my next customer, and they told me ""I can't believe how much of a jackass that guy is. I'm sorry you had to deal with that.""","""The Return Policy is pretty clear...""",151

It's holiday, and to a seasoned (Ha! Puns!) retail employee we all know what that means. People are extra..frugal? I'm a manager for a flagship store in a major city, so we're always busy and always under a service microscope. I come to assist a cashier with what seems like a tense transaction, I'm not even three words in before I realize this is going to be a doozy. The issue: she was attempting to use her pre-paid CC for a $70 transaction. She only had $68 on it. She did not have the remaining ~$2, so she wanted to remove an item to pay fully for the rest. Fine. We suspended the transaction, which means we did not charge her (No pin number. No signature. No receipt. Nothing.)  She goes to pay. Declined. Three times. She is pissed,calling me a thief. A liar. Calls her bank complaining about me. Demands I speak to him. He goes to explain that with her card it's pre-authorized for $x, which they release to us,if we accept it we get the money. If in 3-5 days we dont accept it, it is accessible by her once more. Sucks, but thats the CC company, not our store. She keeps yelling ""Refund me my money"" I keep repeating ""See this 'suspended transaction' receipt!? Where it says ""not a proof of sale""!? We didn't get this money. I can't refund money we did not receive!"" She did everything from claim I don't know the difference between debit/credit/cash, to insist I was pocketing the money (Is that possible? Like in an ""Office Space"" way?), to telling the other people in line we steal money. This goes back and forth for twenty. Damn. Minutes. Demands I get the manager. I love this part. ""I am the manager."" Finally the guy from the bank breaks it down, insists it wasn't me..but them... she slinked off with a mumbled ""I'll come back in 3-5 days then.."" Sweet as pie.

CaptainDan,48,51,1q5rop,298,"We all have those closing time stories, a lady tonight really pissed me off.

We open at 9am and close at 10pm. We all work from open to close, so at the end of the night we are fried from our 13 hour shift. Tonight I had that straggler that we all dread.

9:59 and getting ready to pull the chain on the closing sign and a car pulls up. Oh well, I figure I'll be nice and help this one last customer real quick. Usually they just want a pack of smokes or something quick. Not this one it seems. She comes in and proceeds to wander around ignoring us asking if she needs assistance. After about 10 minutes of this I remind her that we closed 10 minutes prior and if I could help her find anything. 

""That's very rude of you, I know what time you closed and I got her before you closed."" 

I'm a bit perturbed at this point so I ask her again if she needs any help. She ignores me and walks around for another minute or so. I then proceed to continue with my closing and turn the case lights off and some of the store lights. 

At this point she heads to the door and says to us ""I just wanted to look around."" Then walks out the door. 

We close up, laugh and leave. 

Apparently it's rude to tell a customer you are closing/closed, but not rude to keep store personnel past their closing time so you can ""look around"".

",Closing time is flexible I suppose.,349
internetmexican,7,9,1q5ngm,37,"hey, TalesfromHayward guy here. I still work with my Dad from time to time, like when I am on break from school. I decided I wanted to get a job closer to home, so it would be a little easier on me while I go to school, so I got a job at the red/khaki retail store. 

I work in the backroom, and I have to say... I really like it back there, I can listen to music, fart, be away from guests. We are also one of the top stores in our are ranking 1/58 for backroom location accuracy or whatever. This is made possible by having a very strict, and no nonsense team lead....but there are times when I just want to scream, and tell everyone to fuck off. This is one of those days.

I show up to work, I am working closing-shift today. I think I came in at around 2:30pm that day, and I closed at 11:15pm. 

How our team lead usually schedules the backroom is that starting from like 4:30am we have guys bowling out the backroom, and back stocking until like 12:45pm at which points those who started at 7:00am take over back stocking, and other duties until 1:45, which is cool since the mid-shifts come in at 10:30am so when the openers leave mids handle the back until 4:30 when is usually when the closers come in. 
This day though, they made me come in at 2:30pm-11:15pm. I did not think much of it though, the way I saw it ""I was going to make more money"", but goddam. 

I walk into the backroom as one of the backroom guys was leaving, he tells me to get the backroom keys from the Leader on Duty, and then he leaves. The backroom is a fucking mess...there is back stock EVERYWHERE! both open and case stock. It is like no one did shit before I showed up...

Now we at the backroom have to pull what we call ""Scheduled CAFs"" where we have to pull all this merchandise for the sales floor people to push onto the sales floor, the thing is...the tubs we put this shit in were all taken up by backstock so if I was going to get anything pulled I would have to back stock shit first...the thing about this is... Scheduled CAFs start at 11:00am and end at 6:00pm, they start at every hour and have to be finished by the end of the hour, but no later....I had 20 mins to finish the 2:00pm batches..which had 40 batches...so obviously no one had started them.

Me: Fuck this noise **get on walkie** LOD, DO YOU COPY? I am going to need help with these CAFs if you want them done on time. 

LOD sends me 5 guys from the sales floor, the day is saved. However the 3:00pm CAF starts.... I blast through them, finish in 30 mins. I begin to back stock until 4:00pm when the next CAF starts and so goes the day. I work like a fucking dog all night trying to make the backroom clean... my efforts are futile..... there is too much back stock, and I have to begin pulling manual CAFs at 8 (also called simply ""manuals"") manuals are like scheduled CAFs except that you drop them onto the PDA and they tend to fill at a higher volume meaning you have to pull way more shit.

I make a decision though...I will skip manuals and clean up my backroom if it kills me. 10:30...backroom is looking better, but it is still a mess, and we will be closing soon so I have to go set the line and the sales floor for the team that comes in at 3:30am.

11:15am...I am off, but the backroom is still fucked up. There is less back stock, but there is still back stock, the floor is dirty and unswept, tubs are occupied with so much back stock that I can't even set the sales floor for the morning, but my time is up and I have to go home and rest only to come into work at 4:30am.

4:30am....walk into the backroom.... It is a fucking mess still

7:30am....I am getting yelled at for not completely cleaning the backroom the day prior. I tell them that I was the only guy there all day, and that between back stock, scheduled CAFs, backroom calls, setting the line and the sales floor, there is no way I was going to finish. I get told I was not alone that there were 3 other back room team members the day before... I tell them NO! FUCK THAT I WAS HERE ALONE, ALL DAY...they tell me no, that they were probably at lunch...I again tell them they are wrong I was alone.... from 2:30 to 11:15 I was ALONE!..they say I am wrong..and to top it off I get called lazy......

Cruezer,16,27,1q5nem,153,"Many moons ago, I worked retail selling cosmetics. It drove me crazy and I hated it, so I left to go work in a call center. Finances got tight, so I decided to take on a second job doing something easy and that I'm good at: selling things. I now work part time in a beauty supply store with an average price point of about $5. The chain in general has a pretty poor reputation and is usually only found in not so great areas. My store's located in a very ritzy area, so it's a bit off from the others. But the clientele is much the same.

I was working one night when a girl came in and asked for help with hair extensions. Pretty common, usually not a problem, and she was friendly and nice. She had another lady, who had a young kid, maybe about 5 years old, with her. Those two go wandering off and the kid comes up and asks me if we have a bathroom. I tell him we don't, but ask his mom to take him to the store about 20 feet away because they do. He nods and walks off.

About half an hour later, his mom comes up and asks me if we have a bathroom. Again I tell her we don't, but she can take her boy to the store just over the crosswalk and they have public restrooms. She smiles and walks off. We get a big rush of customers, about 12 people in the store and only two of us working, and I lose sight of this kid and his mom. No big deal, they're browsing.

My coworker comes out of the back room and gives me a funny look. ""Is that guacamole?"" she asked, pointing at a squishy green lump on the floor. Her face slowly melted into revile and despair as we walked closer and the smell hit. Being much more resilient than I, my coworker grabbed some gloves and a mop as I tried my best to keep people away from the register that pile was in front of.

The rush leaves, but the girl with extensions, her friend, and the little boy still haven't left. The boy's mom comes up with a ton of things to do nails with and I start ringing her up. Her total's about $50, so I let her know that. She's shocked at the price and instantly says she doesn't want it, while starting to chat with her friend in Spanish.

I'm white as a sheet and blonde as blonde can be, so I don't blame them for assuming I couldn't understand their conversation. She was going on and on about how glad she was that her boy pooped on the floor of a place trying to rip her off like that.

one time, i got this lady.  i shall refer to her simply as C, for a certain four letter word i'd use to describe her.  it was one of those miracle days i wasn't alone, so for once calling another store wouldn't have bothered me.

C: ""i can't find this product anywhere!  can you call x store for me?""

me: ""sure, give me just a minute. *calls x store* sorry ma'am, they don't have it.

C(getting angrier): ""then will you call y store?""

me: ""sure, give me just another minute *calls y store* sorry, they don't have it either.""

C: ""then what about z store?""

me: ""alrighty, just another minute.  *calls z store* yes, looks like they have one for you.""

C: ""ok good.  this was ridiculous.  i can't believe we had to look at this many stores.""

so all of this was pretty standard angry customer, nothing that surprised me or affected me.  it was what she said next that really got to me.

C: ""i just wanted you to understand my frustration in having to look.""

it would have been one thing if she had asked for corporate's number to complain instead, or even if she had simply asked if i understood why she was so frustrated, but she chose to put me through what she deemed to be a large frustration, just because she too was frustrated.  gotta love those punching bag moments, right?

Kellynn,12,11,1q5igw,74,"I worked in your friendly neighborhood fabric and crafts store, and gave my notice last week. Last night, I was working my second overnight in a row. The first was supposed to be 9 PM - 5 AM, and then my manager proceeded to keep us until 6 and try and keep us later because ""guys, there's still stuff to do, come onnnnn!"" as she disappeared the entire night and left us to do all the work. Last night was my second overnight. We asked to leave at one, which resulted in my manager pouting, death glaring us down, and refusing to speak to us the rest of the night. But that is not the purpose of this story.

Fuck overstock. Fuck it so hard. My best friend and I both worked at the store and both planned to leave. After last night, we both decided it was our last shift there, no exceptions. Imagine this. Somewhat medium sized store, but it's very crowded. Lots of narrow aisles, overstock is on top of the shelves as well as on special shelves along the walls. But these shelves are all very shallow, so there's a questionable amount of room. Sounds crowded already, right? Now fill the aisles with boxes stacked as tall as you physically can. Welcome to my hell.


So the first night, we were stocking seasonal. Glitter everywhere. I took my shirt off when I got home and an honest to god cloud of glitter exploded out. There are stacks of huge boxes for all the overstock, and we add to these as we stock and find that things don't fit. There are probably five hundred overstocked candles, giant boxes on both sides of the aisles filled with crafts, boxes, and cards and gifts. Every aisle has maybe a third of it available to travel through, if that. When we left at 6 AM, my manager whined that she'd get someone else to help her move the overstock. When my best friend and I came in at 9 PM the next night, none of the overstock had been moved.

Step one. Clear enough of the stock room to actually be able to move in the overstock because our stock room is, shockingly, also piled up to the ceiling with no room to move. My manager explains what ""we, hah, I mean you two"" will be doing. We load a flatbed of foam and fiber, take it from the stock room....and we can't get the cart down the aisles. We literally cannot move it more than a foot from the stock room because the overstock boxes are filling the aisles. It takes us nearly fifteen minutes to get from one end of the store to the other because we're shoving giant boxes out of the way as we go.

Finally get to the foam, which has two rooms of overstock of its own. We stock the three or four things we actually can, then have probably four huge boxes of overstock that needs to go in the foam overstock. We throw open the first door.

Floor to ceiling full of overstock.

Open the second door. Take a guess what that one looked like.

My blood pressure is quickly rising. By the end of the night of desperately trying to get through shelves while being berated by my manager about how we're not doing enough despite the fact that she's been sitting on her ass the entire night while we're working like crazy we were both out of patience. I started just shoving overstock out of the way with as much force as I could to avoid screaming in frustration. Everything I try and stock is overstock. There is no room for the overstock. My life has become an overstock nightmare. 

The funny part? My manager continues to yell about how we need to have clearance down every single aisle because ""WHAT IF A CUSTOMER WITH A WHEELCHAIR COMES THROUGH?!?!"" My best friend responds by stopping down an aisle that you have to literally turn sideways to get down to get past the boxes, stops, looks at my manager, and just gestures to the lack of space before walking off. We had no words for the stupid anymore.",There is a special place in hell for overstocked overstock.,85
thompsontoons_art,19,11,1q5ao4,70,"I work in a bedding outlet store that sells mainly discontinued merchandise from our catalog company. Our stock is rarely complete to make full sets because we receive what's left over from our catalog's sales. If something sells out in the catalog, we never see it. We also have very limited overstock space, so we try to squeeze everything we can out onto our selling floor. 

My coworker shared with me an interaction she had with a customer yesterday: This woman saw a particular penguin printed flannel duvet cover in our clearance section. 

She asks my coworker, ""Do you have any other sizes available? I only see king size here.""

My coworker responds, ""No, I'm sorry. We only have that duvet cover in king size. We've sold out of the other sizes.""

""Do you have any other sizes in your stock room?""

""No, that's a discontinued style. We only have king size left.""

The woman becomes short, ""Well, could you look out back anyway?""

""... Sure."" My coworker walks to our stock room and just waits there for a few minutes before going back out to inform the customer that we indeed only had that duvet cover in king size.

IronyJudge,61,133,1q54dq,560,"Back before I was the store's know-it-all guy I was a lowly cashier. I took pretty quickly to dealing with our archaic system and found out many of the system's rather unfortunate quirks. The system will block you out if you're at a certain screen. If you hit the wrong button at a particular time it'll discard data and make angry noises. One of the more unfortunate problems is how there is a screen of no return. Once you reach it it is impossible to go back no matter how much you try.

I was still pretty new so I was in the panicked ""They're going to fire me for doing something wrong"" state. Any time a customer made a complaint I'd shit myself in fear, until one fateful night. I've previously stated my store occasionally serves people who inhabit the most notorious snob suburb in the metro area.

One rather nice old lady comes up with a few cans of one particular brand of dog food. I start scanning the cans, then the customer behind her in line starts screaming.

PR Lady (decision for the initials to be revealed later): THOSE ARE MINE.  
Me: Sorry, they were the same brand as her's. 

I then remove the two cans I scanned from the first customer's bill then close out the transaction. She pleasantly thanked me and went on her merry way. PR Lady was now at bat and she plopped a bag of dog food face down (UPC up) on the counter. I scan her 3 cans of dog food then the bag of food, ask her for her rewards card information, announce the price total. She swipes her credit card willingly, then I hit the button that brings you to the screen of no return. It's the screen to sign for the purchase.

PRL: ""Did it give me my dollar off?""  
Me: ""I'm not entirely sure, but we're past the point of no return. Once you sign and the receipt prints out I'll see and if it didn't I'd gladly fix it if it didn't.""  
PRL: ""I'm not signing for it.""  
Me: ""The transaction can easily be fixed. If you sign and there is a problem we'll simply cancel it out and do it again.""  
PRL: ""Just go back and tell me if the dollar came off.""  
Me: ""I can't do that. You can't go back from this screen.""  
PRL: ""YES YOU CAN. GO BACK AND TELL ME IF MY DOLLAR CAME OFF.""  

I'd been working there for a few months by that point, mostly on register, and she knew the system better than me apparently.

Me: ""Once the receipt prints out I'll be able to tell you. If you could just sign really quick, and if it's wrong we'll be able to fix it.""  
PRL: ""NO.""  

Here's where I make the fatal mistake. I reach over to the credit pad, and hit the cancel button. This has the effect of immediately time-outing the machine and popping out both the receipt, and a little paper slip for the customer to sign.

PRL: ""YOU JUST SIGNED FOR ME. WHAT THE HELL. YOU LITTLE BRAT. THIS IS FRAUD!.""  
Me: "".... manager to register one. Backup cashier.""  
PRL: ""I WILL HAVE YOUR HEAD FOR THIS. YOU ARE GETTING FIRED TONIGHT YOU PUNK."" 

Manager then arrives. In the few months I'd worked she's proven herself to be among the most level-headed in the store. She also has the poker face of a champion.

AGM: ""What seems to be the problem.""  
Me: ""She was unsure if the sale price ran...""  
PRL: ""There was a coupon on the front of the bag, he didn't ring it up. I refused to sign for the purchase, then he signed my name. This is fraud. This is legally fraud!""

I had no knowledge of this coupon. She put the bag face down on the register. There was no way I could have seen it.

Me: ""I hit the cancel button to make the mach...""  
PRL: ""YOU SIGNED FOR ME.""
AGM: ""I'm sorry about that. I will cancel out the transaction and I will personally ring it up and make sure the coupon gets in.""

The customer behind PRL pipes up and says to me ""You did nothing wrong. This lady is just crazy."" That made me happy, and PRL just kept on with any possible insult towards me she could. AGM finally finishes the transaction with the coupon applied, PRL signs, then walks out the door.

I go back to ringing the nice lady who called PRL crazy. The customer behind her also gave words of consolation. The other cashier (now a manager) told me that was one of the worst she's seen.

Then AGM comes up behind me, gets on the PA and calls another cashier up.

AGM: ""She wants you to apologize.""

I turn around and PRL is standing at the front of the store, still fuming. The other cashier gets there and I walk over to issue my formal apology. 

PRL: ""You high school punk. I want you to apologize for committing fraud!""

I will admit, I look about 6 years younger than I am. It's reasonable for her to think I'm in high school by appearances, but at that time I was cracking open LSAT study books. I also decided to whip out my big-boy vocabulary.

Me: [""I do most solemnly apologize for any transgressions. If you could kindly enumerate every one of them so I may appropriately respond to my failures.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7mIy97_rlo&amp;noredirect=1)  
PRL: *rants on for two minutes without realizing just how much my apology was dripping with sarcasm* 

I tune her out. I don't care. I'm going to let her yell, and when she stops yelling for a few seconds I'll give her a canned response.

PRL: *stops yelling*  
Me: ""I understand your concerns. My intent was not to defraud you, but to make the machine print out a receipt to see if your dollar had been properly removed. I fully apologize for the misunderstanding and wish to assure you it was in good faith.""  
PRL: ""YOU BETTER APOLOGIZE. THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD ANYWHERE I'VE GONE. I'M THE HEAD OF PUBLIC RELATIONS AT A MAJOR BANK. I KNOW WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOULD BE LIKE.""

And what a good job at PR for your bank you've been doing. All of the banks headquartered in town are reviled nationwide. 

Me: ""I assure you these mistakes will not be repeated.""

PRL then starts shouting for another couple minutes at me, which I again tuned out. AGM finally steps in and tells her she'll take care of it. PRL smacks into the door, and gets pissed until I open it for her. 

Once I get back inside AGM motions me to go to the office. At this point I'm shaking freaking out that I'm about to be fired. We get into the office and she instructs me to sit down. She sits casually on one of the tables and starts laughing her head off.

AGM: ""What a goddamn bitch! I didn't stop her because I was stunned at just how wretched of a human being she was. Sorry, but oh my god I've never seen anything like that before.""  
Me: "".... so I'm not in trouble?""  
AGM: ""I'll pay for some therapy if you need me to.""

Idr2013,6,15,1q53tl,51," Hey TFR! I was requested in another thread to post some stories about my old Assistant Manager. [Original Comment here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1q4aod/you_dont_need_a_break_or_to_leave_ever/cd9486e)

  I had a quite like or hate relationship with her, because she could be nice when she can be but half of the time she was a massive bitch.

 Let me start of with my favorite story. 

 It was one random night in 2011, maybe a good 6 months after I started my Cashiering job. The Assistant Manager (we'll call her 'S') comes storming to my register and forcefully shuts my light off and takes my tray away, and tells me to head to the Front End office. I'm dreading this, she didn't seem happy. 

  I head over to the office and she's there waiting for me. S mentions that a customer called the Service Desk saying that I didn't give her the right change (or her change in general) I told her that there was no possible way, that I'm very good when it comes to my money. S didn't believed me, and she proceeded to count my tray. To her shock, My tray was even. Not a penny over, not a penny short. She decides to RE count the damn money, and it still came up to be exactly even. S begins to get angry, saying ""how is this possible??"" and then goes to curse out my coworker V who was working the Service Desk that night, she had called him a ""fucking idiot"" and a ""piece of shit"" for lying. I was shocked, and I could say was ""Can I go ?""  and I walked away from that.

 S didn't like me ever since I failed the Secret Shopper (I was the Cashier who got him, and I forgot to check what was under his cart) She had even threatened to demote me to a ""Cart Pusher"" right before the start of fucking winter 

 There was one day I was coming into the store, and I still had  a good 30 minutes before my shift, and I had my headphones on listening to music, S had noticed me and was trying to get my attention. Since was I apparently ignoring her, she told me that I was no longer allowed to wear headphones in the store. Didn't care, brushed it off. 

 She once told me that I needed to cut my hair because my hair was now covering my eyes, and that customers had complained about my hair. (Which was bull because my hair wasnt that long, and eyes were completely visible)

That's all the stories I can think about right now, but if I ever remember more I'll post it up. Thanks for reading!",'That idiot!' (stories about a Assistant Manager),66
Thethuthinnang,38,70,1q4s5d,344,"I used to work as a day spa receptionist at the tender age of 16. My boss was Korean and I didn't speak any Korean. This was also my first job. 

**Background:** I was scheduled to work after school every day except Wednesday and all day Saturday. I loved my job, but hated my boss. Being a naive 16-year-old and a bit of a pushover, I didn't know that my boss was legitimately crazy. She used to have me polish the cutting chairs with a toothbrush, and wouldn't let clients put their feet on the bar part, lest they dirty it. Sometimes the clients would tip me, especially when I had to assist with things like hair extensions or washes. She would take it from me, saying that she paid me enough to not be tipped. Again, naive 16 year old me didn't know she was nuts. I would often go home crying, but I thought this was how all jobs were. I also didn't want to quit because my dad said I needed to know ""the value of a dollar"". Until this happened. 

**Story**: As I said, I worked every weekday except Wednesday, and then Saturday. Well, one day, crazy boss lady (CBL) pulls me into the back and says she can't afford to have me work on the weekdays anymore and just wants me on Saturday. I was actually relieved, because this gave me an excuse to quit my dad would accept. So, I put in my two weeks' notice, and then went into the color closet, where the hairdye was stored. 

I was pulling down hair color for next clients, and my hands were full of little boxes. I turn around to see CBL standing in front of the door like a creepy ghost, and nearly throw them at her in fright. 

Me: *jumps* Sorry, I didn't see you there! 

CBL: IT'S DISRESPECTFUL TO YOUR ELDERS TO QUIT YOUR JOB! YOU ARE DAUGHTER I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE! I HAVE ONLY 2 SONS, NO DAUGHTERS! I RAISE YOU LIKE MY OWN DAUGHTER, SET YOU UP TO TAKE OVER BUSINESS WHEN I'M DONE! YOU VERY DISRESPECTFUL, YOU CANNOT JUST QUIT JOB! WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WHEN I WANT TO RETIRE?!? BOYS CANNOT TAKE OVER SHOP! YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO QUIT! I FORBID IT! 

Me: O_O

CBL then takes the boxes from me for the client in her chair and leaves the closet, closing the door behind her. I'm shaking a little bit at this point, but am more confused. I finish pulling the color for the other clients that are coming, and go to leave the closet. 

Me: Huh, I can't get the door open with all these boxes. 
*puts some boxes down*

...

Huh, I can't seem to turn the doorknob. 

...

The door won't open. ...Why won't the door open?? OMG THE DOOR IS LOCKED, CBL LOCKED ME IN THE CLOSET. 

I proceed to knock/pound on the door for about 5 minutes and then give up -- the closet is in the back of the back room, so even if she wanted to let me out, she probably couldn't hear me. 45 minutes later  (the processing time for client 1) she comes back for the next client's hair color. 

Stepping in the doorframe to block me, she reached for the hair color. I quickly put it on the shelf behind me, shoulder past her, and left, only to return 2 weeks later with 2 friends to get my paycheck.

My dad was fine with me quitting.

TL;DR: Crazy Boss Lady forbids me to quit and locks me in the backroom to make me work forever. ","Huh, I can't open the door...tales of a crazy boss lady.",414

One day i am in the beginning of my shift and a customer in his mid 40s carrying a tote bag comes up to me and asks me if we have bottled water. I show him to where the bottled water should be and it was not there. I Tell him that the person from the previous shift did not refill the refrigerator so the only bottled water I have will be room temperature. He says hat he does not want it. I reply with a plethora of options including that I can get him tap water in a to go cup free of charge, there is a water fountain down the hall and a deli across the street. 

Not liking any of my suggestions, he asks if he can have a seltzer for the same price as a water. I told him that unfortunately I wan't allowed to make price reductions as a similar situation had come up before and I had gotten in trouble. I apologize again. He starts raising his voice saying that he doesn't even want the bubbles in the water so why should he have to pay for them. All I can say is that i'm sorry and repeat the options that I had previously stated. He obviously doesn't like this and starts yelling in the middle of the library saying that I do not have any sense of business at all and that I will never be successful later in life. At this point I stop responding and go back to my chair to sit down hoping the situation diffuses. it does and the guy eventually leaves after making a scene and everyone staring at me.

Two weeks later I'm at the train station waiting for my train when I see the same guy changing his clothes form that tote bag in the rain shelter there. When he's done he walks past me and we make eye contact.

IAmNotHarryStyles,23,22,1q4gp9,65,"The story about the man with the burned chicken got me thinking about my time at the grocery store I worked at when I was 16/17.  This grocery store was in a well-off area in Wisconsin.

Since I wasn't 18, I couldn't be a cashier (we had a very large alcohol section, and minors can't touch alcohol).  However, they got around this by putting me on self-checkout- I didn't actually have to touch the alcohol as customers scanned it themselves, but as there were cameras, I did have to physically see their ID and type in their birthdate on the screen.  Company policy dictated that we ID EVERYONE on cigarette, alcohol, and lottery purchases, regardless of age.  Didn't matter if you were 97, we had to see ID.  You'd be suspended if they caught you not looking at an ID.

One day, an older gentleman came through self-checkout and had a few bottles of wine with the rest of his groceries.  He scanned the bottle of wine, and I went over to enter his birthdate/clear the ""help"" message.  Cheerfully, I asked to see his ID for the wine.

Man: You don't need to do that.  
Me: I do, actually, unfortunately.  
Man: I'm 67, you don't need to see my ID.  
Me: Unfortunately, company policy says that we have to check the ID of everyone who purchases alcohol, regardless of age.  
Man: Can I just tell you my birthdate?  You'll copy down my address from my license and rob me.  You can tell I have a lot of money can't you?   
Me: What? I- No.  If it makes you feel better, you can cover everything on the license except the picture and birthdate and that'll be-  
Man: I don't understand why you're making this a big deal.  
Me: Sir, I just need to see your ID.  It's company policy.  
Man: GET ME A MANAGER.  I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS.  

So, I call over my supervisor, K.

K: Sir, we do need to see your ID.  Security is constantly checking the cameras to make sure that we checked ID of all of the customers making restricted purchases.  
Man: THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.  
K: I'm sorry, sir, but there's nothing that I can do in this situation if you do not show us your ID.  
Man: My birthday is November 9.  
K: I'd need the year, too, first off, but I can't sell you the wine without an ID.  I know that this is a bit of a silly policy, and you're welcome to talk to corporate about it.  I can give you a complaint card.  But for today, I need the ID. 

The man stares K down for a second, and then, in a manner very fitting of a well-to-do man in his 60s, he takes his basket and swipes it onto the floor.  Luckily the wine wasn't in the basket, but produce and some raw meat went tumbling to the floor.  

The man then gave us a ""What are you going to do about this now?"" look, and stomped out of the store.

I got to sanitize the floor from the raw chicken breaking open, and defect out a bunch of product because it touched the raw chicken juices.  All over an ID.","""I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS!""",87
setapartthisdream13,47,51,1q4aod,227,"In a reference I made in another story, I had some issues when I decided to finally quit my most recent job.

**Background** I told my job that I was quitting in a very formal note, and even offered to stay a day or two after my two weeks was up since I wasn't going to start my other job yet and wanted something to do (plus more money). One of my managers, whom I have never had a problem with before, told me that night exactly how little I meant to the company and how replaceable I was. 

**Story: That Morning** So this happens two days after turning in my two weeks, making it Saturday. I worked a double that day (opening at 10 am, break from when I'm cut (at minimum 4pm) and again at five to 9pm), and was a host in the morning and my specialized position that night. During the morning we had a little rush, but then died off at around one, to getting maybe two tables an hour. There was another girl (nicest girl ever) and I at the host station, and I was first cut since I had opened. Well my GM was managing that morning, and refused to cut me since he ""didn't want to screw her over"". Okay, I get it. I'd be mad if I was being screwed over in her position too, so I calmly did my work.

4 pm rolls around, and I'm still not cut. So I go up to him and ask ""do you want me to leave when the next host comes in?"" He told me no, I could be cut now since there was only 15 minutes to four and that's when the next girl came in. Deal. So I start doing my outs and notice no one did silverware that morning like they were supposed to. Then, the other girl is cut right after me (before the other greeter gets to work), which is fine since I need help. She casually mentions how she doesn't have to do any outs. I question her and she tells me how the GM told her SHE didn't have to do any but I did. I was annoyed and when I confronted him and he told me it was true, she didn't have to. She must have overheard how upset I was that I wouldn't get a break if I had to stay and roll all of it, so she decided to be an amazing person and stay to roll. This was also when I found out that two coworkers who had been hired after me (where I worked seniority is the staple for promotions) became servers randomly (I was glad I had quit, but people who had been hired with me still were being refused to be moved to servers (one of them now works with me as a server at my new job even)). So needless to say I was mad as is, when my GM comes in the back and tells me I might as well not even take a break since I'm going back on at 5 and it was 430. I flipped out at him, told him I was taking my half hour break whether he liked it or not, and left. I considered not going back, and honestly shouldn't have.

**Story: That Night** When I returned to work, I found that the GM had left and the night manager was on. Super duper. So I get into working and we were slam pack ass busy. It was fucking crazy (I'll tell you more about it in a bit). Halfway through my shift (no problems) I am told the other person doing the same thing as me is cut and I'm the only one doing my job now. When I question the manager, she tells me how he was also a double (he really was, he had been in the back so I never saw him) and that I was now closing. That took my out time from 9pm to 11-12 that night. Great. So I suck it up, and at ten after 11 (my new scheduled out time) I walk up to her and the mid shift manager and ask them if they want me to stay later. This was the exchange (M=me, CM= Closing manager, MM= mid manager):

M ""Hey, so do you guys want me to stay on for a bit later?""

MM ""Stay on for a bit I think, okay?""

M ""Sure, just not too much later!"" This was in a totally joking manner.

CM ""You know what's REALLY annoying? When people, especially you specialized people, always ask to be cut. Maybe I still need some damn help around this place. Did you think of that?""

M ""Well, CM, I just want to clarify that I did not ask to be cut, but if you perceived it that way, I only asked once.""

CM ""Well if I know you had done your damn job maybe THEN you'd be cut!""

M ""Excuse me?""

CM ""I know for a FACT that you haven't talked to ANY tables out there! That's your damn job!""

M ""Okay, well first off, I haven't talked to any of them since they have been here since we got busy (we had a two hour wait. It was crazy) and I was too busy with Jared* (*name change (other guy doing my job)) busing tables (which we aren't supposed to do), washing cups (bartender's job but he was busy too), seating and doing other work. MM was running around cooking, busing, and doing everything we did plus her managerial jobs while YOU just fucking stood around, allowed customers to be extremely over served and went out back to smoke from your 'stress'. I'm the fucking lazy one? You have to be joking. See if I do any god damn work for the rest of the night.""

She had to call out bc she was in the hospital and for some reason that makes other shift managers and the store manager a little annoyed. I don't bc I feel bad for her about it.  So when I walk in last Friday before my shift starts I see her working the espresso bar and she's got a mad look and I ask her how she's feeling she says in a grumpy mean way, ""I'm fine I just...ugh fine what do you want"" I go oh ok well just let me know if you need anything and I walk away.  So I clock in talk to the mid day manager and see what he missed or forgot to do so I know where to start and help take over and another one of my closer clocked on to so my first action was to take off the girl who was sick( well call her feel better FB) and so when she heard me say that she looked at me and I pull her to the side and go, ""I know you don't feel good right now I'm sorry so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna let you float around, stock us up with milk and I know how you like to clean so don't worry about a single customer just clean, stock, and do your thing and if you need to sit down do it I won't ask where you are or anything and if ican get my major closing duties done I will send you home early.  But first go take your ten minute break.""   You could see the stress and pressure go off her face she didn't stop thanking me.  She came back from her break and I asked how she felt and FB says, ""thank you for actually caring about how I feel bc no one did today and the smell of the gingerbread made me feel worse and it's so busy and I'm just...""  She started to cry a bit so I gave her a hug and said hey it's ok were gonna have a good night.  After that she had a smile and was laughing and joking and was working hard.  It just made me feel good that someone went from being in a bad bad mood to happy and with all that's happening in my personal life it just makes me happy to be able to put that smile on peoples faces.  I hope y'all enjoyed my feel good story for the day :-P",Feel good story,32
Techsupportvictim,17,31,1q443l,179,"Normally the kids are terrors and we want to smack the parents into infertility. 

But last night one happened that made me want to hug the kid and just slap the parent. Thankfully someone else basically did it for me. 

Background: I work, if you haven't already clued in from other stories, at a very very popular American based retail company that sells our own brand of very very popular electronic internet connecting stuff. 

We have recently released a couple of updated models of some hot items. So our plain clothes LP guy has been around A LOT. Basically we have him every day. On weekends we get him, often a partner and sometimes a uniform. It's that crazy with the sales on these popular things. Let's call him Thor, cause he's like this magical god of LP. 

So no shock I'm coming back from my last break yesterday afternoon to Thor dragging a guy back into the office area. Literally dragging the guy. Fellow is about half Thor's size and trying to break away and run for it. Thor gets him into the hall way little fuss, zip cuffs him and takes him into our office to call the cops, pull footage, write report. As he takes the guy away I hear caught guy say something like 'but my daughter is here' to wit Thor replies 'you should have thought about that before you stole.'

Now comes the sad part. I find out on the floor that the guy lifted several of a very expensive brand new health wrist band and was caught dead to rights crossing the threshold without paying. They are like $150 a pop and he had like 8 or 9 stuffed in pockets etc. 

About twenty minutes later, a mall cop walks in with a 10-12 year old girl who had been hanging with some friends in the food court.  Turns out its a single dad situation. I'm in the back getting something for a customer a few minutes later and I see the girl through the open office door and she looks mortified. I felt so bad for her. 

Cops show up and do their thing with getting reports etc. Takes another half hour after they show up. Meanwhile social services agent shows up. Dad is dragged out the front per custom but the girl and the agent get walked by a manager through the stock area to the receiving door where the agents car is waiting. 

TLDR: guy steals $1000 in stuff gets caught. Gets arrested and walk of shame, daughter gets turned over to juvenile care. ",I feel sorry for that kid,210
IronyJudge,123,82,1q43i5,376," work at one of your standard big-box corporate pet stores. My general function is the ""know everything about everything in the store"" guy. If you have a question about iguanas, they call me. If you have a question about dog allergies, they call me. If you have a question about which minerals are in reptile sand versus standard aquarium sand, they call me.

Saturday afternoons are by far the busiest time of week, and we're usually staffed with a few people over on the animal side of the store to help out customers who are taking the plunge into a new pet. One of those people called in this day, so I'm just about the only person to help all the customers who end up in long interactions as I go through the entire lecture about how to maintain an animal.

Then comes in a family all wearing sweaters indicating they were from the ""snobby"" suburb immediately west of run-down suburb my store is in. I like these customers because usually they've got money and are willing to put in more than the bare minimum. I also dislike these customers because they tend to always know what's best, and reek with the smell of undeserved entitlement. The mother of the family flags me down.

Different Turtle Lady: *in hysterics* ""I need stuff for a turtle!""  
Me: ""Alright, where are we starting. Do you have a tank?""  
DTL: ""No! Get me the right tank!""  
Me: ""We have two options, either a 40 gal...""  
DTL: ""Just get me the best one for it!""  

I grab one of our bigger carts and then proceed to load a 40 gallon tank into it. This is never an easy task. They are 50 pounds of extremely fragile awkward clunkiness. 

DTL: ""Are you sure that's big enough!""  
Me: ""It's the most appropriate tank we have for a full grown turtle.""  
DTL: ""I want that one!"" *points at the tank we keep our turtles in*  
Me: ""Well, the 'tank' part of that is 120 gallons. We don't carry those.""  
DTL: ""What do you mean you don't carry those, there's one right there!"" *points again to our turtle habitat.*  
Me: ""I can't sell you that. That's a store fixture.""  
DTL: ""Why do you have it in the store if you don't sell it. Every other store sells their floor models! I want that one right there and I'm not leaving until I get it.""

Her family has abandoned her at this point.  

Me: ""Ma'am, this is where we keep our turtles. The ones we intend to sell. Giving you this would be like selling you the shelves or the safe. It's not going to happen.""  
DTL: ""Where can I get one?""  
Me: ""These are $4000 commercial installations. If you really want I can give information on the manufacturer.""  
DTL: ""Why don't you just sell me that one?""  
Me: ""Not only is it not for sale, it is directly attached to our store's water system. It would require hiring a plumber to take it out. If you were to go home with this we'd have 6 turtles without a proper habitat.""  
DTL: ""Then call a fucking plumber!""  
Me: ""I don't know how many times I have to tell you this. *I can not, by any stretch of the imagination sell you this. It is impossible for at least a dozen reasons.*""   
DTL: *hyperventilating* ""THEN WHY DO YOU SELL THE DAMN TURTLES IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO SELL THE TANK THEY NEED. WHAT SORT OF CRUEL COMPANY IS THIS? THERE WAS A POOR TURTLE IN MY BACK YARD AND WE NEED TO GET IT OUT OF THE COLD. WINTER IS ONLY 4 MONTHS AWAY THIS POOR THING WON'T BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THAT.""  
Me: ""There's a reason that turtle was outside. He can withstand the winter. We never suggest taking in an animal you found outside.""  
DTL: ""SOMEBODY MUST HAVE BOUGHT HIM AND PUT HIM IN OUR BACK YARD. HOW IRRESPONSIBLE ARE YOU -*shoves finger in my face*- FOR SELLING THESE IF PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO GET RID OF THEM""

Apparently there aren't turtles in Minnesota. The only possible conclusion is that somebody bought one from a pet store and dumped it in her back yard. Also, she obviously wasn't going to appreciate the fact she just logically destroyed the entire pet industry. It was at this point her husband comes over and escorts her out of the store giving me a look that read ""I'm so sorry.""

About 15 minutes later she comes back in and tells me she'll take the 40 gallon, then all the gizmos actually needed for it. When she was leaving she sneered ""Thanks for nothing.""

aixelalexia09,20,19,1q437w,49,"I work as a cashier at a breakfast place in a college town, but we get a few regulars. One guy comes in on occasion and is always extremely rude, but usually he just gets two toasted plain bagels, so no big deal. 

Today, however, he decided he was going to make up some sort of meal that whet his palette. The one thing that messed up his fantasy meal was that it was, in fact, not on the menu. He proceeds with his usual demeaning tactics: short answers, grimacing, rolling his eyes every time I ask him a question (to ensure his meal is to his liking), etc. However, when I tell him his request isn't on the menu, this proceeds:

Jerkface: I want one of my bagels to have a slice of cheese on it.

Me: Okay, that'll be $3.60 with tax.

JF: WHAT?!!? It should only be $2.10!!

Me: Well, that's what it would be if you just got the two plain bagels, but the cheese is $1.50 extra, since it's an additional condiment.

JF: So you're telling me, I have to pay extra for a piece of cheese, when I spend my money here everyday?? This is on the menu, I get it all the time, it should only be $2.10!!!

Me: Actually, sir, it's not a meal option on the menu, therefore the cheese is extra. This is your total.

JF: *scoffs and rolls eyes* I can't believe I got the incompetent bitch cashier...fine. (tosses his credit card on the counter)

At this point, I'm pissed because he not only was being rude, but also insulted me, all over a measly $1.50. I finish his transaction and gave him his precious cheesy bagel, all the while seething inside.

TL;DR: Apparently, when something isn't on the menu, it's my fault and I get called incompetent because a customer can't read. SMH.","Because if it's not on the menu, clearly we can make it.",68
FayzerDayzer,7,9,1q40in,35,"I'm a shift supervisor in a 24 hour restaurant that often has a wait list for at least a few hours on weekend mornings. Having just bussed and set up 5-6 tables, I went up to the hostess stand to help get the next few tables, but both hostesses were away seating others.

 I read the first name off the top of the list and sat them, only to realize moments later that ""Nell"" had been skipped on the list (she had been the last name on the prior page). Note: It took me only moments to seat the table as it was near the hostess stand, I was back within 15 seconds. 

ME: ""Oh no! Nell! Do we have a Nell, table for 2?"" 

Nell stood up, scowling, her rail thin body wracked with the evidence of years of exposure to the sun and alcohol.

ME: ""I'm so sorry Nell, its seems like we skipped you! We already have a table for you though"" *big customer service smile, picking up the menus*

Nell: ""That was very rude of you!"" 

ME: ""I'm so sorry, We'll get you sat right away!"" I'm already walking towards her table, I don't have time for bullshit, I've got a million things to do. 

Nell: ""It was VERY INCONSIDERATE. I don't appreciate it!""

Me: ""Nell, it is a very busy restaurant. Mistakes happen. There is nothing I can do about it now. Here is your table."" (I love the ability to calmly tell customers to fuck off, especially entitled ones.) 

Nell took a seat, glaring at me. She was upset, so against policy I offered to retrieve her drink for her, which she ordered in the bitchiest voice she could muster. I made the drink, warned the server about what they could expect, and had them drop it off. 

I then watched as Nell waited for over 40 minutes for her joiner to arrive. She was so fucking upset about getting skipped on the list, when in reality the table I sat before her ordered, ate, and left before Nell's friend arrived. Call me malicious, but despite the fact she took a high demand table from being flipped (lingo meaning getting the old customer out to get a new one sat) I wanted more than anything for her to be stood up. 


TL;DR: Bitchy lady wants to yell at someone. I don't care. 

*P.S- OK, its not that exciting. The amount of entitlement she displayed annoyed me greatly. Normally I forget about this kind of stuff as soon as I clock out, but I've been thinking about kicking Nell since Saturday.

lilcountrygirl17,2,3,1q3ycg,26,"I used to work retail and I left to be an STNA for a while, but am back to retail so I can have a less stressful (yes believe it or not) work environment so I can focus on nursing school. That being said I work for a Midwestern retail company that has an opportunity to send in MAIL IN rebates. Recently we had a promotion where when you made a purchase you get 11 percent off you're entire purchase. I may be wrong but I have never seen a rebate that happens right there on the spot. I forgot during my retail break how RUDE people can be! Sane people, I have had my share of old people being rude, but it's usually from dementia.

Some of my favorite lines are:

**Them**""SO, that took off my 11 percent right?""

**Me**""I'm sorry *insert gender here* but that is a Mail In rebate, and the slips can be found up by the desk to send in.""

**Them**""That's a rip off! False advertising, and who actually sends those in!""

**Me**""I'm sorry *gender*""

**Them**""Yeah, this is why I hate this place.""

**Me, inside my head**THIS IS WHY I HATE YOU.

Speaking of ""This is why I hate this place"" 
Our store has a set up of where the In and Out doors are on opposite sides of the building, however the Out doors can be used as an In door for efficiency. Most people know that.

deltora,54,34,1q3vxg,115,"EDIT: wow, sorry this is so long, i didn't realize until i saw it posted   


okay, until a few months ago i worked at one of the two large retail pet supply stores(i don't know if i should say which one). i'd worked there about 10 months at the time of *the incident*.

scene: it was late, i was one of three people closing that night, i was the cashier, my coworker was in aquatics/ small animals and my manager was counting the day's money, it's about an hour till we close. [i can seriously feel my heart beating in my chest while i type this just thinking about it]   
(also i need to preface this tale with something, to truly appreciate this story you need to read it how *she* said it, so (not to offend anyone but..) everything this woman said is in a heavy, angry ghetto accent, anything you said to her was a personal attack. to plainly describe her: she was a short, round and evil, black woman.  
[the writer of this story does in no way mean to imply that all short, round or black women are evil, or that all evil women are any of those other things, this woman just happened to be all of them]   now, read on true believers..  
 **act 1: the beginning of the end**   
*she* enters, my register is right by the door and it's my job to greet people as they come in so i say ""hi, welcome to ___, do you have any questions?"" she says a short no and wonders off, no big deal, that's my usual. then a little but later, she comes back and says ""yes well maybe you can try to help me, i need a cat dripper, mine broke and i need a new one."" (now i don't know if any of you work in a pet supply store, but a cat dripper is not a thing.) so i say ""hmm, a cat dripper, do you mean a refilling water bowl or a water fountain type water bowl?"" ""***sign*** *no*, a CAT. DRIP;**P**ER, you know what it is, it drips out water when they lick it"" ""oh, like a rodent water bottle?"" ""show me those then"" so i walk over a little ways to small animals(looking back, i really should have just paged the animal guy and then killed myself so i'd never have to talk to her again) and showed her the bottles. ""well these are too small! and they have pictures of rats on the package, i wanted one for a CAT. C.A.T. CAT."" ""well, they don't make these for cats, are you sure you bought your's here?"" ""i haven't bought it anywhere yet, you can't seem to find it"" ""no,"" i said, ""i mean the one you have at home, the one that broke?"" ""i never said that, a friend told me about these and she said you might have them"" at this point some other customers were making their way to my checkout, so i excused myself with ""well i'll leave you the think about your options"" or something like that, and checked them out.

**act 2: part 1: the transaction**  
after i finished with those customers she got in my line with just a small fish net for an aquarium, kind of strange and hopefully not a cat dipper but whatever. then i made the slight mistake of asking, on retail reflex, ""did you find everything you were looking for?"" (i could just beat myself over the head sometimes i swear) and she said ""no, YOU couldn't find what i was looking for, i'll come back another day and maybe then you'll learn where things are by then, are you new?"" now, i didn't intend to make her any angrier so i just said ""yeah, i'm one of the newer ones here"" (which is kind of true, they'd only hired 4 new people after me) ""oh i thought so"" was her delightful reply.  

**act 2: the transaction part 2: things go from bad to awful.**  
the next thing in my list of automated retail questions is ""are you a ____ member?"" she says she is and proceeds to get out her purse and start digging into it, she's looking and looking and looking and right as i'm about to ask if she wants me to look it up by her phone number she says she found it, it's in a card slot that is built for maybe 3 cards and she has like 9 or 10 jammed in there, so she's fighting with it and fighting with it and i'm not saying jack because i don't really want to interact with her anymore. as she finally gets it out with an ""uhg! i ruined my new nails!"" she glares at me, as if waiting for an apology, an apology she was never going to get.
she holds out the card and i scan it. ""i bet this wasn't even on sale was it?"" i check. ""it looks like it's not today, no..(uh oh..)"" ""well why didn't you tell me that before?!"" she continues to glare. ""doesn't the computer say if something is on sale??"" (and she's right, it usually does, but that day was our big take-down-the-old-sales-and-put-up-the-new-ones day, and our computers sometimes take a bit to catch up, so something that's sticker says it's on-sale might not really be or vice versa) and i told her as such using as few words as possible (i do not mean i was short with her, through this whole story i was very polite to a point beyond reason or sanity), because by this point a line had formed behind her, so she huffs and pays, of course, with all small coins, i ask if she would like it in a bag and she's just putting all her things back in her purse completely ignoring me and when she's finally done she says ""well put it in the bag already!"" so i put it in a small bag (because it's small) and hand it to her and she walks down toward the end of my line.  
and you'd think that would be it right? end of transaction, she leaves and i must be over reacting, well..

**act 3: she doesn't leave...**    
so this *lady*, she takes her item, and walks away *3 feet*. she is now standing at the end of my register. why? i have no idea, but there she is. (now, to be honest this did happen some time ago so at this point (i've also been trying to black it out) things get fuzzy, bare with me) i believe 4 customers came though my line in the time she stayed and it was a *slooow* night so my best guess is she stayed for 20 minutes or so, i think the first to come through was a boy and his mom, they were pleasant and uneventful, the kid asked me if he could get a treat for his dog and then they left, after them another customer i will never forget came into the line..  
**act 3: part 2: he returns**  
{sorry, this is going to need backstory, so a few weeks before *the incident* there was *the guy*, the guy is a fairly regular customer to the point that i recognize his face in a crowd but not much else, i do know he has cats tho, anyways here's his story: he came in to just get literally a handful of catfood cans, like 4. and he got to my register and he was friendly and kind and then he was 40 cents short. he was going to run to his car to dig though the seats for the coinage but i told him i'd cover it, now this was the first time i ever did that (out of i think 4 or 5 time) and his face was the greatest thing i've ever seen, you would have thought i just pushed his cats out of the way of an oncoming truck. i only expected a quick 'thank you' and he'd leave but he was like ""what is your name? *looks at my nametag* *Deltora*, i'm going to pay you back"". after he left i really never thought to much about it, until..} he got in my line, looked me straight in the eye and said ""i think i owe you a dollar"" i told him if anything he only owed me 40 cents but he put a dollar in my hand and said ""no, i owe you a lot more than 40 cents, thank you."" (now, this is where things get fuzzy because all while i was having customers *she* kept talking at me, and the things she said were not compliments, i don't remember what she said when, but she must have said something as my new best friend stepped into line because he almost glared at her for saying whatever it was she had said at me, but i can't remember) anyway, after he bought his things and left, he gave me a look like *""i hope you have an okay night""*   
i only wish that came true.    
**act 3: par 3: how's the weather?**  
after he left she leaned forward (she is now sitting on the front window sill, i don't know if she's ever leaving, she could unpack a picnic basket for all i know, she is in this for the long haul) but she leaned forward and says ""what did he get for free?"" i was caught off guard by this and looked around my counter for any clue of what she was talking about, so i just said ""he didn't get anything for free"" and she said ""YES HE DID he asked you if those were free and you said yes!"" then is clicked, the dog treats. ""oh, you mean the boy, those were dog treats, i thought you meant that man that wa-"" ""NO i *meant* the boy now give me some dog treats"" and i did and as i handed them to her i was trying to think of what i could say that meant *GOODBYE*, (by the by, this story take place in the midwest and during the time of this story the weather was 5 shades of odd, it would POUR for 10 minutes then BAM sunny day, like nothing happened, so what i had been telling people is ""be careful for the weather, it a bit unpredictable"" nice right? i came up with it myself, no way on earth anyone human being* could *possibly* be offended by it, right? yeah..) so i said to her, still being the pinnacle of niceness ""be careful for the weather"" ""*EXCUSE ME?*"" (oh, oh no...) ""um, ^^it's ^^a ^^bit ^^unpredictable?.."" more glaring. ""what are you, late teens early twenties?"" i don't know what's happening anymore..  ""yes.."" now at this point a man gets into my line and he heard was lead up to this too, and she doesn't stop either, she goes right on talking at me while i try and ring him up. ""I HAVE TWO KIDS, THEY ARE BOTH GROWN NOW, NOW OF THEM LIVES IN FLORIDA, SHE'S A DOCTOR NOW, I HAVE LIVED IN MINNESOTA FOR FORTY YEARS, *DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER IS LIKE IN MINNESOTA?*"" i want to die.. let me die.. ""*WELL??*"" wow, that wasn't meant to be rhetorical, so i barely nod a yes while hoping a bus would come through the front window killing me and her, i hope this other guy doesn't get hurt, he's not so bad. at this point he leans into to me and whispers ""do you want me to tell you my life story too?"" HOLY SHIT this guy is great!! i give him the weakest of smiles and say ""^^^thank ^^^you.."" then he leaves, and she actually leaves to, but, **BUT** , she stops, half way to the door, and turns. ""*GOOD LUCK* WITH YOUR JOB HERE"" and with that she left   
FECKINBTCHIWILLKILLYOUSDFIAGIHBASDFGBHLADSFGBH!!!

after she was finally gone i just crouched in one of the isles and did some deep breathing/dry heaving/tear-free bawling. if you believe in soul mates, i believe in the opposite of that, i think this *woman's* aura or whatever you want to call it and mine must have been totally different sides of the spectrum, because i honestly felt like she rubbed my soul raw with sand paper. she was abrasive in every sense of the word and while i would take a bullet for a stranger she is now one of a handful of people on the planet i would shoot in the stomach.

anyway, that's my story, it took my 4 hours to get down because i needed breaks, a lot of breaks, but here it is for all of you, if i remember anything else, i'll add it.

she also came back twice, one of those times to accuse me of theft.



TL;DR she knows what the weather is like, and needs her cat dipper, but bad

setapartthisdream13,32,20,1q3v5v,62,"So I have finally quit my terrible sports bar job (see any of my other posts for any questions) with the promise of a new serving job! Yay! But the time came to put in my two weeks, and I went into the manager's office with a slip that read:

""(Date) setapartthisdream13 is turning in her two weeks effective (date). Please contact at (phone number) with any questions. Signed, setapartthisdream13.""

Very formal, and while giving it to my GM I told him I was more than willing to work that Friday and Saturday if needed (my two weeks was up on a Thursday) since I had nothing better to do (start new job on Monday). He agreed and we made some jokes, all around he wasn't mad and was very understanding.

After he left for the night, the closing manager came in and told me she wanted to talk to me when we were closing. I agreed and did my day of work, then went into the office to figure out what she needed (I figured she wanted me to work the two extra days and was telling me my schedule). So I walk into the office to find her sitting there angrily holding my two weeks.

""What is this, setapartthisdeam13?""

""My two weeks. I got a serving job finally."" (She had told me I could put her on applications as a contact, fully knowing I was applying for other jobs)

""I see. Do you think you are actually ready for a serving job?""

""Yeah, I've been taking Chris* and Julia's* (*names changed) sections for a while now since they get overwhelmed, and I find it's pretty easy to handle a five table section during a steady flow."" This was me thinking she was actually sincere about my welfare. I learned not so much.

""No do you think you can actually serve? Because sometimes I know you don't talk to people nicely."" I thought this was referring to the previous incident (story is posted) with another coworker, so I tried to explain.

""Well, I get really frustrated with coworkers, but I have never had a complaint from a table I have served before. 

Why? Has someone complained?""

""No. But I don't think you are going to last long there. You'll be back.""

""No, I'm going to serve now. I plan on staying there.""

""Well, you're replaceable. It isn't like we can't replace you.""

This was followed by a ten minute rant filled with lies about how no one at work was going to become a server until March (the next day this same manager moved up two of her friends at work to servers), I was the next to go up if I waited (the company has been telling me this since February when I first asked to be a server), etc. etc.

TL;DR My manager tells me I'm a terrible worker for getting a new job, and lies through her teeth in the end.

My retail experience began with a shitty taco shop in San Diego (oddly terrible, since it was so close to Mexico). As I grew older, I upgraded to grocery stores and book stores. Finance was my first “big boy” job where I got to wear a suit and tie.

Odor Week Entry 2:

The worst seat in any setting is next to a man who ate too much Indian food about an hour ago.

That’s right, I’m talking about farts today. Is that a trigger warning?

I’m lucky to live in a diverse land with many cultures and many excellent restaurants. I have yet to find a culture who is not represented by an excellent restaurant in my city. I try to force myself to try something new when visiting restaurants. And I know my gastrointestinal limits, and plan accordingly.

Others? Not so much.

A supervisor sent out a mass-email in response to food odors and the potential for resulting flatus. Here are the two best bullets:

-Please be considerate when using the microwave in our area. There are some types of food that produce a very unpleasant smell when reheated. This is especially true for any dishes containing fish. If your food is going to produce a smell that might be offensive to your coworkers, please use the microwaves in the central cafeteria.

-From time-to-time, everyone experiences negative effects from the food they eat. Frankly, this can result in gas. As adults, we expect you to be aware of this and please use the restrooms to relieve this situation. It’s very upsetting for our employees to have to be exposed to gas in their work areas. If you know certain food will be an issue, please leave it at home, or plan your restroom trips accordingly.

Exactly no one heeded this advice. Noontime microwave smells continued until we removed the microwave from the area and required everyone to go to the cafeteria level to heat food.

As for the farts. Yeah, still bad. You haven’t lived until you’re stuck in your cubicle, on an important phone call, and your neighbor squeezes out a pants-demon so rancid that you can kind of taste it.

Mephysteaux,8,19,1q3r79,56,"While I work in retail, one of the rudest interactions between a customer and an employee I've ever seen actually happened while I was shopping. My friends and I had just attended a big metal concert in a different part of the city, and decided to stop at one of our favorite 24 hour convenience stores closer to home afterwards. Well, it seemed like a lot of other people had the same idea. When we got there, it was about 1:30AM and the store was flooded with 18-24 year old males, all dressed in black T shirts and cargo pants. I got in line to pay for my stuff, and there were maybe a dozen people in line - unusually long for this place, but with 2 cashiers on, they were able to get everyone through in about 5 minutes. While I was standing in line, this happened.

Customer: Excuse me, could we get some more cashiers up here? This wait is ridiculous.  
Cashier: Yeah, sure. I'll just go out in the parking lot and find some more.  
Customer: Yeah, you do that. It's not like anybody couldn't do this job.

Sure enough, the guy wasted 5 minutes of his life to get his sandwich and soda, and after he left the cashier said something along the lines of ""The nerve of some people...""","Fellow customer, one of the rudest I've encountered",75
FredFltStn,302,449,1q3l7r,1136,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  I had a customer call a month ago to complain about some fireworks. The customer was hearing-impaired, and the call was being conducted through a TDD device using an operator. If you've never communicated over a TDD through an operator, it can be exasperating, and I feel terrible for the hearing impaired people who have to use one.

Basically, you tell the operator whatever you’d like to say, making sure to speak slowly. The operator types your end of the conversation on a keyboard, and then sends it to the hearing impaired user. The user then reads the message, types in their reply, and sends it back to the operator. The operator then reads the reply back to you. 

Sometimes, it can take minute or two for all this to happen, so you’re basically saying a couple of sentences or asking a question, waiting for a minute or two to hear the reply, and then speaking again. It's like having a conversation in slow motion with someone on the moon.

Apparently, the caller had purchased some fireworks from me in June, and was mad because some of them didn't work.  I give an unconditional money back guarantee on everything I sell, and I always feel terrible when someone has issues with my stuff.

I apologized profusely, and since my store is seasonal and had already closed, I offered to send him a check to refund his purchase. 

Normally, I’d want to see a receipt or have them bring back the duds, but because of the TDD, we’d already been on the phone for more than 20 minutes at that point. I felt bad for the guy, and just wanted to finish the call and make him happy. 

**(Two minutes later - TDD delay)** Unfortunately, that wasn't the answer he was looking for. Instead, he wanted me to replace his fireworks. I offered to meet him somewhere and bring him replacements.

**(Two minutes later)** I was informed that he lived an hour away and couldn’t get over to Orlando. Instead, he wanted me to mail him the fireworks.

Now fireworks are considered hazardous materials, and can't be shipped through the regular mail. Because of the expense and problems associated with this, I don't ship fireworks. I let him know that and again offered to send him a check to cover the duds.

**(Two minutes later)** I was again told that I needed to mail him fireworks, since I had a guarantee, and the fireworks he had purchased were bad. Once again, I explained to the operator that I didn’t mail fireworks, but that I’d be happy to send a check. 

**(Two minutes later)** He’s now really mad at me, and yelling that I can send him a check and he’ll go to another fireworks company to get his stuff. I only know that he was yelling because the TDD operator informed me that he was typing “emphatically”.

That’s right…I was being yelled at by a hearing impaired person over the phone through an operator translating the call.

I asked him to give me a list of exactly what fireworks were duds, so I could figure out the cost and mail him a check. I also told him that I would need his home address.

**(Two minutes later)** It’s a box of firecrackers. A F*cking $9.95 box of firecrackers. I had now spent 30 minutes on the phone because this ass was unhappy that “some of the firecrackers” in his pack did not pop more than two months after he had purchased them.

I immediately sent him a check for $20 through online banking. I filled out the note field on the check. It read, “Please shop somewhere else”. Unfortunately, it can take up to 8 days for the check to arrive when it’s a new entry online.

The bastard called me back every day until he got the check. When the TDD operator would identify themselves, I would just say, “The check is in the mail”, and hang up.

Spooferfish,73,64,1q371d,262,"Little bit of background: I work at a campus IT place, where we're registered with Apple to repair their systems. We do out of warranty repair, too, but that tends to cost money...since the system is out of warranty, after all.

This is good, because a lot of kids on campus use Apple computers - and very few of them know how to fix anything. In particular, given our location, this means a lot of older folks from departments and a lot of greek life. This story is about a very loud member of the latter.

Cast: Twoface, the girl who came in - TF for short. M, the coworker with me at the time. B, my supervisor. And lastly, me.

WARNING: This story contains harsh language, given the language this customer used. (Also I curse like a sailor) My apologies. 

&gt;Me: Hi, how can I help you today?

&gt;TF: OH MY GOD. I'm freaking out right now. I promise you I'm just going to like freak out [I swear I'm actually making this less stereotypical]. My computer is, like, fucked.

&gt;Me: Well, if you have it with you, we can take a look at it. What kind of computer is it?

(At this point, I look her up and down. Workout clothes, bright neon shoes, tight yoga pants, North face jacket, school-branded and sorority-branded JanSport backpack. I know it's a mac.)

&gt;TF: [as she takes out her macbook from her backpack] It's a mac. Do you guys fix macs??? Please help me!

&gt;Me: [staying calm, since that usually helps stressed out customers. Ignoring the multiple plaques and displays showing that we are Apple affiliated, and the two giant pillars behind her with Apple logos] Yes, we do actually. Let me take a look - what seems to be the problem?

TF now goes on a good five minute long rant about how her computer just crashed on her and it totally wasn't her fault. At this point, she hasn't let me ask a single question. 

&gt;TF: So then the computer restarted and it was just a flashing question mark! [at this point, she's noticeably calmed down - I'm thinking I'm in the clear!]

&gt;Me: (this only occurs if 1. the HDD experienced a complete mechanical failure, or 2. the flex cable's bad. It's almost always 2, especially without any loud clicking occuring) Well, luckily it's probably a pretty simple fix - this issue is normally the flex cable going bad. This fix is pretty cheap if that is the case, but there's the chance it's the hard drive that's bad. We'd need to check it in for testing, if that's okay. We'll contact you as soon as we know what the repair options are.

&gt;TF: YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT? I NEED IT BACK TODAY [we close in an hour and a half]. UGH. Okay. When can I find out what's wrong with it? 

&gt;Me: I'll start testing on it immediately. We should be able to contact you in two days by the latest, but could have an answer by tomorrow late afternoon. If you want to and you haven't been called, come in tomorrow at around 4:00 PM or call, and we can give you an update.

Paperwork gets signed, she leaves. She was actually not awful by the end of it, having calmed down a bit. M is confused as to why she seemed so agitated, but was helping his own people and we kind of just laughed it off. 

NEXT DAY:
TF suddenly barges in at 1:30 PM demanding for her computer back. This part is hearsay, but three sources gave me really similar information - I had left just a half hour earlier:

&gt;TF: IS MY COMPUTER DONE YET???

&gt;M: Sorry, but what is your name?

&gt;TF: TWOFACE McCUNTOCTOPUS YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS.

&gt;M: I'm sorry, Ms. McCuntoctopus, let me check the paperwork right now...well it looks like your system finished testing for tier one (I finished it that morning), and it's currently finishing testing in the back. [Begins to radio the back for information on the testing - we don't always have life updates on the system until testing is finished]

&gt;TF: WHY DON'T YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS IS YOUR JOB

&gt;M: [after getting a response from the back] Well, it looks like your flex cable is in need of replacement - your hard drive came up fine and testing with other hard drives showed the cable was faulty. We'll need to order one. That'll be here tomorrow if we get your okay, and it's $35 for the part and $20 for installa-

&gt;TF: YOU MEAN I HAVE TO PAY?

&gt;M: Well, yes ma'am, given that you're out of warranty. 

&gt;TF: WHAT THE FUCK, THE ASSHOLE YESTERDAY DIDN'T SAY I HAD TO PAY.

&gt;M: Actually, right here on the paperwork you signed off on it being an out of warranty repair and agreeing to it being a charge. It also says so in our Work Agreement, which is right above your signature in bold.

&gt;TF: WHAT THE HELL, THIS IS BULLSHIT. THAT GUY YESTERDAY WAS LITERALLY THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD. HE NEVER EVEN TOLD ME I GET CHARGED FOR THIS, I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT IF HE TOLD ME I GOT CHARGED FOR THIS [well, actually, it's on the paperwork TWICE that she was going to be charged for this repair a minimum of $20 for the diagnostic, which is waved if we do any repairs. I read it out to her out loud before having her sign]. I WANT HIM FIRED. HE WAS LITERALLY THE WORST HELPER I'VE EVER MET.

&gt;M: Are we...are we talking about the same person? I was here when you were checked in, and he went through all of the procedure with you. He even pushed you up the queue given you had stated it was an emergency and seemed distressed.

&gt;TF: THAT'S IT, I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOUR SUPERVISOR.

At this point, my super comes out - a bigger guy who hasn't really worked a supervisor's position before this and is EXTREMELY new. Also kind of a huge accidental/sarcastically accidental dick a lot of the time. Poor guy wasn't ready.

&gt;TF: YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE TERRIBLE, THEY'RE TRYING TO CHARGE ME FOR A REPAIR THAT SHOULD BE FREE.

&gt;B: Ma'am, they're just doing your job. And I have it right here on my paperwork that you agreed to paying for the system repairs or diagnostic.

&gt;TF: WELL FUCK YOU FAGGOT [this didn't blow over well, given my supervisor is actually gay] I DIDN'T AGREE TO SHIT. I WANT MY COMPUTER BACK.

Sadly, having missed this, this apparently became a giant screaming match - one sided, really. B kept trying to explain to her that literally no one would do this cheaper, and taking it to the Apple store will net the same result and require driving. He gave up after a few minutes, though.

&gt;B: Well, if you want your system back right now I can pack it up immediately, but it'll still be the $20 for diagnostics before we can release to you. [This caused more of the exact same argument, and then she began yelling about me needing to be fired again, and that he should be fired as well, and that M should be fired. Basically, this girl wanted our whole department gone.]

&gt;TF: [finally giving up] FINE. I'll just take it to Apple then! They'll do a better job. 

After a bit more cussing at us, she finally pays the $20 and goes to Apple. B, having worked at the Apple store, notes that the girl just wasted well over $100 extra - the fix from us would have taken just one day longer (would have been done day after all this) and she would have only needed to pay $35 more for all her issues to be solved.

People are so...odd sometimes.

Sorry for the wall of text!

TL;DR: Some girl doesn't listen to what she's signing to, requests for a whole department to be fired, and then goes on to end up spending hundreds more than needed.

chilehead,3,7,1q35ma,33,"Not exactly sure it qualifies as retail, but I don't know what other category it would fit under:  Way back in the 80s I worked in a video arcade, and was even given the unofficial  title of assistant manager. The job was pretty simple: make lots of change for people, drop quantities of cash into the safe, call the manager when we get down below $200.00 in quarters in the booth, supervise the area to keep shady stuff out, and some light cleaning.

This particular Friday night I was taking one of my quick rounds around the arcade to make sure there weren't sodas left on the floor or the unsavory kids weren't trying to pry the back door off a game cabinet in another futile attempt to get at the cash box.  Something out of the corner of my eye just didn't sit right and it took a few seconds to register just why it didn't belong: one adult patron was standing in the corner at a game, with a couple of his friends facing away from him - usually if people are hanging around a game someone is playing, they are watching what is going on on the screen, not facing away from it.  What really clenched my spider-senses was that the guy in front of the game wasn't really facing the screen and he did one of those double-bounce hops you normally see out in the woods or in front of porcelain appliances....

I saunter over to try and put my mind at ease, (because no one would really do that, right?) and the first thing I notice is the strong odor of alcohol coming off these guys.  Then I notice that while this guy has been playing this game for a few minutes, the music it's giving off tells me he was really only in the first 10 seconds of the game. (you spend enough months working in an arcade, you get to know all their patterns of behavior and the sounds.)

The third thing that struck me was the stain on the wall and the puddle on the carpet.

Me: ""Sir, I'm going to have to ask you and your friends to leave.""

Drunk Bastard: ""an' why wudju hahv to do that?""

Me: ""You're well aware of what you did, and we don't want you in this establishment.  Please leave now.""

DB: ""Are you accusing me to taking a leak in here?""

Me: ""I didn't say that, but yes: that is the reason why.""

DB: ""It wasn't me, it was that other guy.""

Me: ""You three have been the only people in this aisle for the last 5 minutes, and it wasn't there before that.""

About this time, the manager gets back from his 15-minute break, wherein he went to the theater 3 doors down and took in an entire movie - The Wraith, perhaps? (he made an unofficial deal with the ushers: we get free movies, they get free video games.  He also liked his Charlie Sheen movies.)  He tries to make sure the drunk guys don't start trying to think with their fists, but gives me the eyeball gesture that means to step outside and get the attention of the mall security.  I get them.

Not only did they then agree to leave peaceably, but I also had the joy of never seeing them again.  And my manager, streetwise guy that his was, actually got someone else to clean up the wall and carpet with our mop, paper towels, and windex by offering them an hour of all the video games they could play.

Somethinginthefridge,12,8,1q352x,30,"So hey. My first post on this subreddit shall be one about a country store/restaurant popular in the south and some old dude who eats there a lot.

I'm a host, so I see and hear a lot of things about customers and servers, even dirt on the managers.

This dude comes in once every two or three weeks, whenever the mood strikes him. When he does come in, by luck or whatever, I'm usually the one to seat him, which means he somehow embarrasses the crap out of me every time. Basically, the past couple of times that he's come in, he's had some story about servers and passing hosts being stingy with napkins  the managers or anyone who will listen. This angers me a little more than it should, but hey, he uses it as an excuse not to tip the server.

I pick up his menus and stuff and move them to his table, a little annoyed, but thankful he hasn't started yelling.
He makes another random comment about not getting enough napkins and awful service, though I know he gets some of the best servers when he comes in by luck, and I leave to tell the server that she has a table and to warn her a little. I pick up a two inch stack of napkins and shove them in her hands to give him. He still complained about bad service and not enough napkins at the end of the day and the server, already suffering an anxiety attack about debt, was not left a tip.

VivaLaVodkaa,17,20,1q2txh,55,"I apologize for the wall of text, but I'm really not sure how to TL;DR this one.

Alright, this is my first time posting here. This isn't a ""retail"" story, so hopefully you guys are flexible about that, and I hope you enjoy.

This past summer, I was an 18 year old that had just gotten my first job. One of my best friends started his own small landscaping company, and it was doing surprisingly well. As his company was quite small and lacked heavy equipment, we did relatively small stuff: planting trees, bushes, mowing lawns, trimming trees, etc. The jobs were a considerable drive away, so I went down twice a week to help out. As far as first jobs go, the pay was much better than expected, so I didn't mind the drive as much, and this gave me a chance to hang out with my friend afterwards as well.

This was my first day with my friend's company, probably May 2013. We had just finished two lawn-mowing jobs, and were moving onto the third and final for the day. My friend said I could either sit it out and hit the local mall while he took this one on, or I could help him out. I was fairly exhausted, but he insisted that it would be a small job (as described by the owner of the property). The owner was an old gentleman, maybe 80 years old. His social worker hired us to do the job, and she did in fact describe it as small.

So I caved and said fine, because a little extra money never hurts; this job was paying $40, so it would be $20 a person for what was supposed to be an approximately 30 minute task. We arrived at the property, and the front lawn took 5 minutes. I was really happy at this point, because at this rate we would be done in no time.

I opened the door to the backyard, and holy fuck, the grass was almost as tall as me (5'10"") in some areas (album included at the end). Upon seeing this, I shit an assortment of bricks. We were WAY under-equipped for this job, as we only had one lawnmower and a whippersnapper.

We decided to give it a go, since we were here anyway. Mostly because the owner was rather old, couldn't mow it himself, and probably couldn't afford to pay anybody more. The lawnmower continuously jammed, and I do not blame it. What should have been a 20-30 minute job took us a grand total of 3 hours; over those 3 hours, the lawnmower probably jammed 50 times. The strategy was that my friend would whippersnapper as much as he could to reduce the load on the lawnmower, I would mow it down as best as I could, and we would alternate as necessary.

By the time we had finished deforesting the lawn, we were exhausted. Instead of the original $40 we had been offered, the social worker payed us $100 (so $50 each). $50 over 3 hours, still decent. Absolutely exhausting work though.

Here are pictures of the lawn:

IronyJudge,152,85,1q2sps,407,"Hi ya'll. I've been reading this subreddit since I got my retail job, but haven't posted anything because I don't want anything on my main account being traced back to me. My boss is on reddit, so I'll be posting with this one. 

I work at one of your standard big-box corporate pet stores. My general function is the ""know everything about everything in the store"" guy. If you have a question about dog food, they call me. If you have a question about birds, they call me. If you have a question about which sort of cat litter is the best for getting out of 6 inches of mid-November Minnesota snow, they call me. I will also give you the long answer to any question you ask. If you make a statement in conflict with proper animal care protocol I will gently explain why you are wrong and how you can be less wrong. As you will see, I tend to be very long winded.

Aquatic turtles are really popular when people are asking about them, and are the slowest selling animal in the store. A proper set up on them will easily run into $400. They need massive aquariums ($115 not on sale), and all of the fitting aquarium accessories. If anybody asks me about turtles I will go through the costs with them.

Then come in three women. One of them quickly designates themselves as the primary customer.

Turtle Lady: ""I want one of 'em turtles.""  
Me: ""Alright. Do you have a tank?""  
TL: ""No.""  
Me: ""Well, You'll have to get a tank first and set it up. Normally I recommend a 40 Breeder""  
TL: ""I want this one"" *points at 10 gallon tank*  
Me: ""These guys get pretty big. You'll need to upgrade to a bigger tank in a matter of months. It's cheaper to get the fill grown tank and just start from there.""   
TL: ""I'm getting this tank. Just get me the fucking turtle."" *holds 10 gallon*

Corporate tends to want us to bend over backwards and lick the shoes of customers, though I am more than willing to politely tell a customer to shove it. 

Me: ""You can not put that turtle in a 10 gallon tank.""  
TL: ""Well, it's only to get to Chicago. Then I'll get everything. Actually just get me everything I need and I'll buy the tank when I get there""

This is where things start to get weird. I head off and grab a shopping cart and start to piece everything one would need for a proper turtle setup. Out of spite I threw together the most expensive possible set-up. Top of the line heater, top of the line lamps, biggest possible resting spot, fanciest filter. $50 bag of pelleted food. 

I finally bring the cart over to her and she flips her shit. Unbeknownst to me while I was filling the cart she paid for the turtle and the 10 gallon tank. The turtle was legally hers, and I couldn't do anything to stop it. You can't really force a customer to return something against their will. 

TL: ""WHAT THE FUCK IS ALL THIS?""  
Me: ""You asked me to get everything you'd need for the turtle.""  
TL: ""The fuck is this for?"" *holds up lamp fixture*  
Me: ""It's a basking lamp. It helps them absorb calcium.""  
TL: ""Fuck all this shit. I'm just getting this tank and the fucking turtle.""

I just want the lady out of the store at this point. 

TL: ""I'm going to get this tank, put the turtle in it, and when I get home to Chicago I'll get all the stuff I need.""  
Me: ""Let me write you a list of things you need.""

I write the list, and decide to take the 'Yeah, we're all buddies here' tone with her from then out.

TL: ""You're going to fill up the tank, then we'll put it in my car.""  

*you can't be fucking serious*. You are going to take an aquarium, set it in the back of your car, and drive it 400 miles from Minneapolis to Chicago, sloshing around the entire time. *Be my fucking guest.*

Me: ""Uh, okay. How are we going to get it in the car?""  
TL: ""The fuck you mean? I'm going to carry it.""  
Me: ""A filled 10 gallon tank weighs around 90 pounds.""  

For a turtle you only fill it halfway, but I just felt like fucking with her at this point.

TL: ""Yeah, I'll lift it in.""  
Me: ""Sure, I'll put it on a cart and fill it for you.""  
TL: ""You think I'm fucking weak! I'm going to carry it!""  
Me: ""Well, it'd be easier.""  
TL: ""I'm fucking carrying it!""

I just resign myself to facilitating her insanity at this point. Nothing I can do, just get her the fuck out of the store as fast as possible. I fill up the tank, let her carry it all the way out (including when she forgot her keys inside the store and walked all the way back in holding the 90 pound sloshing tank. When she finally got back outside she opened the door to the $45,000 car, set it on her back seat and buckled it in.

The other two ladies make their way to the car, having not witnessed the rest of the interaction, and start screaming at Turtle Lady about how insane it was she would have an open aquarium sitting in the back of her car. I sort of slink away back into the store and start telling my coworkers about what had transpired.

Then she comes in holding the tank, turtle in it, and comes up to me. 

TL: ""So we've decided we need a smaller tank.""  
Me: ""Well, the one you had was probably the cheapest one.""  
TL: ""I don't care about the price.""  
Me: ""Well... uh, I mean, we have a 2.5 gallon fish bowl, but you would need to get a new tank for him the instant you get to Chicago. It's one of our larger markets, so you'll have no problem finding a store.""  
TL: ""Yeah yeah, whatever."" 

She returns the 10 gallon, leaving me to deal with a half full aquarium and purchases the fish bowl and some food for the turtle. It's about then I'm sent to get dinner for everybody working in the store, which I'm usually more than glad to do. As I'm getting in my car I see her walk back into the store with the fish bowl. Not my fucking problem at this point.

When I get back in I find that she wanted a bigger thing for the turtle. She also spent a fair amount of time bugging the cashier about what ethnicity she is (mixed, 1/2 black 1/2 white, apparently black girls can't have hair as pretty as hers?)

Turtle Lady finally left, and we all held a vigil for the turtle. At least somebody made a point of writing ""NO GUARANTEE"" on the turtle's paperwork.

optimusprime525,10,17,1q2ho1,36,"**Background**: I've worked for about two years in a sporting goods store at the front end (sales and returns, etc.) Usually it is enjoyable but every now and then customers don't understand...well, anything.

**Story**: About a week ago, a guy (who we'll call nasally self-righteous customer, or NSRC) walks up to me carrying a bike pump. It is very dirty and clearly used. But we do still accept returns within 30 days if something is broken.

NSRC: ""This pump I got stopped working, I want to exchange it for a new one.""
Me: ""Ok, do you have the receipt on you?""
NSRC: ""No I don't have my receipt, but you should have it saved.""

Now 'should' is a strong word. I get that it is certainly convenient for stores to do this, but he does not actually know our system and nonchalantly assumes we do. Well we don't store receipt information in our store, but our corporate office can look it up through a credit card number. I explain that we can't accept any broken product returns without receipts, but mention how corporate could email it to us if he gives them a call.

NSRC: ""Well I'm getting really annoyed with buying products that just stop working, and you really should just give me a new one.""

I explain to him that of course if we get the receipt to our store from corporate I can grab him a new one, no problem. I give him the number, and tell him that it usually takes about ten minutes on hold. 

NSRC while on hold for 30 seconds: ""They're clearly not picking up and honestly I'm very frustrated with buying broken products, can I just get a different one?""

Me: ""It really should just take a couple more minutes, and as long as you bought it within 30 days we can exchange it for you no problem!"" Still trying to smile, but he's just so nasal.

NSRC: ""Oh no no, it's not gonna be within 30 days, I got this 6 months ago!""

Now I don't know what kind of person buys product X from a store and uses it for many months, then brings this product into a store without any proof of purchase and actually *expects* this won't cause any kind of problem. Well actually I do now, and it's NSRC.

NSRC: ""Listen, you're not understanding. I bought a bike from you guys in December and then I got this pump and now it's not working and it's very frustrating.""

Me: ""I get that. Luckily many of the manufacturers of our products have a one-year warranty on their products, so I would certainly recommend contacting [manufacturer]. They might be able to help, but unfortunately we wouldn't be able to take it back in the store.""

NSRC (incredulously): ""Ha! Come on, I'm not gonna go call them. Why can't you just do this? This bike pump just stopped working!"" 

Me: ""Hey I feel kinda bad about your situation since I can't take it back, but how about I'll get you a coupon if you wanna buy another one of the pumps!"" We sometimes have coupons in the manager's office for situations like this. Plus, this was actually a pretty nice bike pump ($50) so a coupon could certainly make a dent. I really believed this was going to solve the problem, but I clearly did not understand the perseverance of NSRC. 

NSRC: ""No no, I already brought a coupon for other things, I just need to exchange it out. If not I'll just stop shopping here. So...are you gonna help me out or not?""

I didn't want this arguing to go on any longer so I asked one of the managers (J) to come help out and explain to the guy that unfortunately it was against our store policy. After I explain the story to him, he takes one look at the pump.

J: ""Yeah just credit him the $50.""

NSRC to me: ""See, was it really that hard?""

It is very frustrating when managers make you look silly or incompetent in front of rude customers. Furthermore, it just reinforces in the customer that he can continue to complain and break policies with no consequences.

TL;DR: Nasally problem-customers are worse than regular problem-customers. ",So...are you gonna help me out or not?,53
stillalurker112,6,9,1q2g7z,18,"Another story from the big orange home improvement store. This time involving two customers and their contractor.

So I work in deliveries, meaning I pull orders that are to be delivered. Therefore I don't have a department, I just walk around to find the products I need to get ready. In this instance, I found myself pulling a door when I was approached by a man in his upper 40s, he needed some help with a stair railing.

What he really meant to say was that his contractor needed help. I start to ask a few questions and quickly realize the husband and wife have no idea what questions to ask or anything like that. But as I'm listening to the contractors questions about putting together a railing and the spindles that help to support it, I realize that he has no idea how to do it either. And he is suggesting very unsafe ways and materials to putting this railing up.

The customers don't say anything about his suggestions for attaching them, and why would they? Its not their job to know that, I wouldn't expect them to. But here is where I get concerned. What else doesn't their contractor know? What else has he done wrong? Has he taken money from them? Did he take out proper permits on projects that require them? So many things that the homeowners wouldn't even think about because they don't know anything about what he is doing. I wanted to say something. But at the same time its not my place, and it could come off that I don't value the customers opinion (not a good scenario).

This guy, at least fifty and built like a fridge with dreads down to his waist, came up to the cash wrap to ask me about getting a chew toy for his pit bull. I pointed him to the dog section and paged help over for him, then returned to what I was doing. Later he came up to me while I was feeding fish. I asked if he found the toy, and he admitted that he was lying and that he just wanted to flirt with me. At that point I noticed that he was kind of wasted (there's a liquor store next door), and waved him on his way as nicely as possible. 

He left the store but later while I was restocking, he came in again and started telling me how attractive I was, and how I should get contacts to ""show off those pretty eyes"". It made me uncomfortable but I thanked him and attempted to return to my work. Then he started to ask me things like how old I was, and was I in school, etc. His words were pretty slurred at this point but he said something about how I should be a camgirl (excuse me??), and how I was just like him and he knew my secret (wtf). Needless to say I was pretty freaked out at this point and I made excuses about going on break. I did actually take my break, during which I told a couple of my male coworkers about him. I heard him asking one of my other coworkers outside the break room where the ""pretty girl"" went. To my relief he then left the store. 

Later when I was working register, he walked by the store looking through the windows for me, and I had to duck behind the cash wrap so he wouldn't see me. Finally later my (fairly intimidating) male coworker told him to get lost and leave me alone. He told me later that the creep's excuse for bothering me was that my shirt rode up in the back when I bent over, which he thought was sexy and that he thought I wanted it. Sorry, but that's fucking bullshit. I couldn't help it that my spare work shirt is the wrong size. I wish people would just treat me with proper respect and let me do my fucking job sometimes.

 After an hour covering breaks and such, I finally get settled on my own register. I had this Older Lady (somewhere in her 70s) come on through my line. Everything went smoothly up until when she went to pay.

 She swipes her card, and she asks that she wants Cash Back (limit at our store is 50 dollars) She mentioned that she some help, so I go around to help her out, but I noticed that she managed to get it to work. No problem right? Well that's what I thought. Got back to my monitor, and approve the request for Cash Back. Then I noticed she only wanted a Nickel back. This couldn't be right. 

 I asked her if she really wanted a Nickel back, and she had a puzzled look, and mentioned that she wanted to 50.00 dollars back. I didn't know what to do, so I told her that there was nothing that I could do and gave her the receipt and her nickel. Then it began to spiral downward

Old Lady: ""I want my 50 dollars!""

Me: ""Miss, there's nothing I could do about it. You could buy a piece of gum, and ask for 50 dollars again""

Old Lady: 'Why would I buy gum?? I already purchased stuff, I just want my money""

Me: ""Miss, I'm sorry. There is nothing that I could do about it.  Even on the receipt says that you asked for a nickel back.""

Old Lady: 'That's clearly a mistake!!! I need to speak to your manager""

 Oh Boy, here we go. I call for my manager and she gets there right away. I explain to her about the situation. She asks for the lady's bonus card, and press a few buttons on the Computer.

Manager: 'That's what I thought, I'm very sorry there is nothing we could about it'

Old Lady: ""you're lying to me, there is something you can do!""

Manager: ""We can't do anything unless you make another purchase, how about some gum?""

Old Lady: 'NO, I don't need to buy anything else, i just spent money here. I want my money!!!!'

DrEyepatch,82,101,1q1w3a,376,"Backstory: I used to work at a convenience store at a fairly popular tourist destination. This store was one of two convenience stores on the entire island, and we had a prime location within walking distance of about 10 bars. We always have a deputy within earshot of out doors during this time of the year. Night shifts during the busy season were always fun, to say the least.

Sorry for the wall of text.

Story: It's about 2AM, and I was working a double that night because a less-than-reliable employee had called out. No biggie, we get free coffee and I loved working overnights because of the crazy happenings, not to mention overtime.

Myself and another employee (T) were pretty much stuck behind the registers due to the volume of people in the store. We were also getting psyched up to stop selling alcohol at 2:30, because when you tell a drunk person that they can't buy booze, they tend to get a fairly upset. Then, this fairly attractive lady wearing nothing but a bikini caught me completely off guard.

She was obviously drunk, and made her way to the rollergrill to buy some hotdogs. I was working the register closest to the grill, so any questions about it were my problem, not T's. This young lady, let's call her Chili Cheese Girl (CCG), asked me how much the hotdogs were, I informed her, then she asked if the chili and cheese were free, which they were.

When I gave her that nugget of information, her eyes lit up, she gave me the biggest, most genuine smile, and thanked me. It was like I had just sold her a winning lotto ticket, she was so ecstatic. I wrote it off to her bring drunk and hungry, and continued to ring up customers.

The chili and cheese for the hotdogs are in a dispenser where you hold the hotdog under the dispenser and press a button to delicify your snack. CCG goes to town on that thing, pouring mountains of cheese and chili onto this poor bit of meat and bread. I notice, and don't think much of it. After a moment, I hear something that grabs my attention.

CCG: ""It's sooo warm!""

I look over to find that she has smeared this mess of low-grade foodstuffs all over her chest. It's dripping everywhere. The counter is covered, the floor is covered, and this scantily clad girl is covered. I do my best to keep from laughing, but a hearty chortle manages to escape. I am in disbelief. I look at the customer in front of me, an elderly black man, and we share a look of disgust, entertainment, and a slight bit of arousal before chuckling to ourselves.

I get T's attention, and he goes wide-eyed and tries to work through his own laughter. I turn my attention to CCG, who is now squatting down, with her face under a pulsing fountain of golden cheese-product, and rubbing the remnants of her hotdog ALL over her body. I get enough of a straight face to pipe up, after telling the people in my line to ""Wait just one moment""

Me: ""Ma'am, are you alright, do you need any help?

CCG: ""No, I'm good. I just can't get over how WARM this is.""

Me: ""Err... Yes ma'am, I can understand, but you're making a mess everywhere. I think that's enough. Just come up to the register and I'll ring you up.""

CCG: ""Oh, sorry. I'm a little drunk, I didn't think it was going everywhere. Just one second""

I give the ""Sorry, just let me get this bitch out of my store"" look to the customer in front of me and he gets where I'm coming from, and takes a step back. CCG is topping off her meat with some more chili. She steps up to the counter, and I notice just how much of this crap she has on her. She is covered nearly head to toe, and dripping everywhere. I mean, this stuff is coming off in sloughs, she definitely emptied our supplies.

Me: ""Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to charge you extra for all of this.""

CCG: ""But you said it was free""

Me: ""Yeeaah, but you only have one hotdog, and you clearly have more than one hotdog's worth of condiments. Plus, you're wrecking my store. Sorry, it's company policy.""

CCG: ""But you fucking said it was free, how the fuck are you going to charge me for something that's free!?""

She was starting to get pissed at this point, and after a moment of arguing back and forth, I said ""Look, you can give me the 5 bucks, or I can have the big-ass deputy outside make you pay me."" Defeated, she paid me, I finished my line of customers, and proceeded to clean up her mess, all while T was laughing his ass off and sharing the story with everyone who walked in the door.

**Story:** Last night, I was ringing people up like mad just like usual, with that retail smile plastered on my face.  The guy I'm helping (probably in his early to mid 60s, let's call him ""RM"" for ""ridiculous man"") chooses to pay by check, and his total comes to $9.97.  He hands me the check and I ask to see his driver's license.  It's company policy that we have to write down their license number and the expiration date on the check, as well as put down our employee number and the store number.  It's a huge pain in the butt, mostly because some people choose to put up a fuss about it.

**RM:** Why do you need to see my license?  It's not even that much money.

**Me:** I'm sorry, it's just store policy.  

**RM:** I just don't understand.  I've been shopping here for years, ever since you first opened up.  

**Me:** If you would like, I can call a manager and ask him to approve the check so that I don't have to see your license. 

**RM:** NO.

RM looks highly irritated, but hands me his license and I start to copy down his license number.  

He huffs and puffs and continues rambling on about how unfair it is while I write on the check.  

At this point, I only have 2 weeks of work left ( I put in my 2 weeks notice recently) and besides, I offered to get a manager for this guy to approve his check...So I am beyond caring.  I'm not smiling anymore and I just let him rant, as no amount of ""I'm sorry sir, it's company policy"" or ""I'm sorry sir, let me lick the bottom of your shoes for you"" is going to make him understand that I'm just doing my job how I was instructed.  

I could get in big trouble for not copying down his license number and expiration date on the check unless it was approved by a manager, and I would much rather risk having a customer complain to a supervisor about me doing my job than get a warning for being bullied by a customer into not doing my job correctly.  

After the transaction is finished, I decided to ""kill him with kindness"" by smiling and saying ""Have a great night.""

He shot back a very sarcastic ""Thanks for your help.""
He pauses, then says acidly, ""And remember not to EVER ask me to see my license again.""

unmined,21,13,1q1lk4,73,"Tales From the Financial Company - Somewhat retail, since we accepted cash in exchange for paper. Really expensive paper.

My retail experience began with a shitty taco shop in San Diego (oddly terrible, since it was so close to Mexico). As I grew older, I upgraded to grocery stores and book stores. Finance was my first “big boy” job where I got to wear a suit and tie.

Inspired by the prolific and awesome /u/FredFltStn … my adventures:

First theme: odors

I’m a supertaster. It’s plagued me all my life. It’s very difficult to describe what my sense of smell and taste are like. I try to describe it like this: imagine flavors and smells were music. Normally, you don’t want to have music blaring out at 150 dB. But that’s what smells are like to me.

So, I prefer that people don’t bathe in perfume or cologne; that they make a reasonable attempt to get clean before work, brush their teeth, and do some laundry so their clothes don’t reek.

Before I left he world of finance for the world of IT, I spent the last two years as a manager. I thought I would like the job, but I was a fool. The best managers appear to be born for leadership. They have chrisma. They never seem phased by trouble. They remain calm and steady. I’m not that guy. Not even close.

Sometimes managers are faced with situations that are so uncomfortable that even the thought is cringe-inducing.

In today’s case, it’s Stacy.

Stacy only dealt with clients on the phone. She was good at it. Customers liked and trusted her.

Her coworkers hated her.

Stacy smelled bad. Really bad. All the time.

On the best days, Stacy only smelled sour; an odor that arises from clothing that was worn too often before being laundered. Sweat and bacteria make their way into the intricate weave of cotton and polyester fibers. The humble colonies grow across yellowed fields and thrive on Stacy’s effluence.

The worst days were aligned with her cycle. Her naturally sour scent was joined by the overpowering odor of menses. I had never before smelled it on a employee, and thankfully I have never again. It was a fucking nightmare.

I can’t even imagine having so little self-awareness that something like would escape personal attention. And I have no idea how she treated herself differently enough from the rest of the world to make this happen. Was she not changing underwear? Pads? Was this just her baseline odor due to genetic differences? I don’t know.

But there is a fate worse than having to smell her. It was having to address it with her. People complained. And it got to the point to where it could not be ignored.

I probably spent a solid day searching the internet for advice. I even pulled out old college textbooks to see if tho was covered by managerial lessons. There was some advice, but nothing that would make be feel okay about it.

So this is how it went …

“Stacy, I had to address something with you. I’m uncomfortable about it, and I’m sure you will be as well.”

“Okay.”

“I’ve received complaints about your hygiene. People have said that working near you is difficult because of the odor from desk.”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean people are uncomfortable because of the smells when working near you.”

“Are they saying I stink?”

“I’m not blaming the odor on anything specific. I’d like to suggest that you take personal inventory and see if there are ways you can improve the environment around you. Especially in terms of odor.”

“Okay … I guess I’ll work on it.”

I took the chickens hit approach. Instead of being absolutely direct with the “cause” I tried to set her up in a way where she could draw her own (and hopefully correct) conclusions.

She did not.

She gave her cube a once-over with some Lysol wipes and called it mission accomplished. She also asked a few of her coworkers what might have prompted the mysterious meeting with me. They very coworkers who complained to me were not honest with her, even with directly asked. I’m not really complaining, since I was essentially guilty of the same thing.

In the end, we all dropped it. Nobody wanted to address it properly. HR probably should have gotten involved, but nobody was willing to take the compliant that far.

So we suffered the fog of Stacy for another year-or-so until she was promoted to outside sales. I wasn’t involved with this promotion, and I can only assume she did the interview by phone, or on a day when she actually cleaned herself and her clothes.

By the time I left the company, she was back in the office, but working QA.

somenewfiechick,47,34,1q1lg3,105,"I work at a pet specialty store....think the opposite of ""where the pets go"" store. Got the name? Okay let's begin this story from the satisfying beginning. I work in the department that takes care of the animals. Most of my days are spent either bagging crickets or bagging fish. The story here, dear readers, starts when a woman comes in with her 7 year old son looking to get some fish for his recently cycled tank. 

Some backstory: She had bought the 10 gallon tank the day before and let it cycle for 24 hours. After speaking with my co-worker from the day before about the type of fish she could get, they had all these options picked out. Now, this lady failed to understand that the fish that can go into a ten gallon isn't ALL of the ones picked out from yesterday. You can only put it what fits right now (about 3-4 3"" fish pet the store's recommendations). 

She was talking to me about her situation and after picking out a [red-tailed shark](http://www.erdingtonaquatics.com/imagetropical/redtail.jpg) I told her the shark needed a MINIMUM of 29 gallons and even then you could only do one per community because they are semi-aggressive fish. I was not going to sell that to her unless she upgraded cause the return would just end up hurting our store loss percentage which is kind of high compared to the rest of the stores in our district. She and I went back and forth with the recommendations of the fish and everytime I let her look around she was picking another fish that she could only get two of, or she was going to need a bigger tank for. Completely disregarding my help to her.

I show her a few fish she could put in the tank: two mollies, a few different types of guppies, neon tetras, ghost shrimp, something small that could freakin THRIVE instead of DIE from stress. After hearing my recommendations her face turns dark and she snaps at me ""3 fish. ARE YOU CRAZY? No, I don't think so. That's completely ridiculous. I can get what I want, you have to sell to me whatever I want"" and I just lost my shit on her (let's call her SM for Stupid Mom)

Me: ""ACTUALLY no, I'm not crazy. I don't have to sell you something if I feel it's unfit for the animal so you can just leave the store if you don't want my help""


SM: You stupid twit...omg what are you the fish police.


Me: Excuse me? Uh no, you can get out of the store right now. I'm not selling you anything because now you're just being downright rude and I don't have to do anything for you now. 


SM: What's your name?


Me: It's [somenewfiechick] and my manager's name is [manager]. Do whatever you want. 


SM (to another customer): Oh my gosh, did I even ask what the manager's name was? You're crazy...(laughs like she's won the conversation)


Me: Well then what did you need my name for then, huh?

*SM picks up her basket* ""Okay, you know what, we're just gonna go...""


(Manager on duty walks up to the conversation because she heard voices escalating)
Manager: Umm...is there anything I can help you with?


SM: I was just trying to say THANK YOU to this young lady right here I'm just trying to make my son happy and this nice lady over there was saying no to everything I wanted to buy so I'm just going to return the tank and I expect a full refund of everything. 

At this point I've walked away to let the manager talk to her because if I keep yelling I'm going to lose my shit even more. My co-worker is off in the corner just gob-smacked at what just happened and hi-fives me later on saying ""that was awesome. good job for sticking up for yourself"". My manager never gets me in trouble, my co-workers are praising me, and the best part of the whole story.....the customer called the store later on to say she was complaining to corporate and the company that sold the fish tank because they were a lot of fish on the front of the box. Guess she did plan to use my name after all.

endersp,6,15,1q1hf2,0,"So I used to work at a VERY large big box store known for its completely idiotic redneck customer base, worked their for three years all on food side.
 Recently I left for a much better job with better hours, but while I was their I had many frequent annoying customers who while I'm being forced to help them internally I just want to strangle and leave at the bottom of a river.
 
 By far the worst was Stinky Pete, this man came to our store every fucking day to buy $23.50 in junk food and maybe 10 dollars in healthy shit, but he would demand a personal shopper essentially because he track you down and keep asking where the same 40 things were, EVERY GOD DAMN DAY! For some reason SP never understood that I had a job to do and he would ask for me by name, I was once paged back to my area cause he wanted to deal with Ender, and no one else would do.
 
 Now I had tried to complain to my department head about this and how I can't drop 26 minutes a day to deal with one customer every day but to no avail, it's my job to make the customer happy. So I sucked it up for three fucking years, it got to the point near the end where I would pre fill a cart with that days shit and tell him it was just me saving him time when he got in at 2:30 every day.
 
 So as I said I had quit for a different job recently and I'm in my old store shopping and visiting with two friends who still work there and I see SP. I'm aware that I have slight anger issues but I see this mother fucker and it's like everything rushed to head at once. SP walks up to me and tries to start a conversation I try to ignore him he then says hey it's me Pete. At this point I go on the rant I've been waiting for forever.

Me: Yea Pete I see you, just frankly I don't give a damn.

SP: huh? What the we talked every day

Me: you honestly don't see it do you? I hate your fucking guts, your a entitled lonely piece of shit whose only human interaction comes when you purchase something, because if your too stupid to find your shit after three years you may be the dumbest person alive, but that's still better than forcing someone to talk to you every day because no one in the real world can stand.

SP: but you were always nice to me why didn't you say something before

Me: it was MY JOB TO BE NICE AND HELP YOU! How the fuck do you not get that nobody likes dealing with you, it's just a fact of life like taxes! Do everyone a favour and start getting your own shit!

 At this point Pete walks away crying and an assistant manager asks me to not come back but hey, there's another store in the city and it's closer to my house, no loss at all. Did I do the right thing? Fuck no, but damn did it feel good.

Taelzos,48,25,1q18xn,93,"Backstory - I was working for a popular Canadian fast food chain that doesn't have as many restaurants thrown everywhere as the other chains, thus we get a lot of customers to each particular store and a lot of regulars. I was there for four and a half years pending my graduation from college as the closing shift grillmaster (loltitles) for 90% of the time, but sometimes I would also close front of house.

Main Story:

This was one of those days where I was scheduled during the day (because finding grillmasters who will stick around is a pain in the arse, the workload is pretty demanding). I was around for the lunch rush and it was coming to mid-day and my replacement had arrived to do the closing shift. As usual he took my place on the line and I begin cleaning things up to do my part of the closing by taking down the hood vent 'filters' and cleaning them off, restocking all the buns, fries, frozen items etc. for my replacement. 

I was in the back of the restaurant cleaning off the oil filtration pump in the mop sink, when I get slightly distracted by the entire building shaking coinciding with a resounding 'Whomp'.

I blink and stand there for a moment. We have some loud doors which slam when customers use them, so the level of noise wasn't unusual, but I felt the floor and walls wiggle like they just had a small orgasm - I started to head through the staff area and passed the office just as my supervisor for the day popped out, with an equally confused and concerned look on his face.

We came out through the enforced staff door and went out into the lobby, and are met with this scenario:

First - all of the customers have congregated into one half of the lobby.

Second - Some of the customers are recognizably bewildered and rattled, looking around and saying things like 'OMG like OMG' and other nonesense.

Third - There's a f------ car embedded into the side of the restaurant.

Fourth - queue double-take. See number three.

Right. 

Apparently some old lady went to park and hit the wrong pedal and slammed the gas just as she was aligning herself with the parking space. She smacked the fender on a minivan parked in the ajacent parking space and rammed the corner of his front-end into our brick base.

From the inside, the area struck by the vehicle was buckwards inwards into the restaurant - and all the tiles were missing from that area. On impact, the tiles were sent flying in various pieces across the lobby. It just so happens there was a family seated immediately beside the window where the impact was located - but luckily they weren't harmed, more like they just receive the caffeine jolt of their lives.

After I took in the situation at first glance, my supervisor rushed into the lobby to check things out there and I scurried outside. The two men who owned the minivan were inside when the lady had the sudden need for speed and were already assisting her and trying to calm her down. She also wasn't injured but was absolutely terrified out of her mind. She was reaallllly old - think of a hairless cat only albino.

The supervisor refunded everyone their meals regardless if they had finished already or whatever, just to be polite about having their visit to the restaurant disrupted. The manager/franchise owner got called in and stood there for a good 10 minutes staring at his very own new wall zit.

I did have pictures, but I've changed my phone twice I believe since this occured. BUT if I do dig them up from someplace I'll edit them in.

An amusing day for sure.

I get to the front and give the girl my slip, she looks for my package and whispers to some other guy (her manager I assume) and he comes out to talk to these guys. I pretty much overheard the whole conversation, customer is basically screaming at this manager over something it seems the manager has no control over (something to do with paperwork or something he was shipping that got lost I think). Manager finally says he'll try to do something or other for him and walks away.

Aokigaharaa,8,8,1q0oo9,49,"I've mentioned the nationalities of the parties involved because I felt at the time, and still feel, that it played a part as to how the cashier was treated. 
Now this is going to be LONG because Im wordy. Sorry. 

Once uppon a time in Norway, my boyfriend, my brother-in-law and myself (ages 23-30) found ourselves a little drunk and a little hungry after having partied all day at the annual ""town-fest"" in our small town. Basically everyone in town (&lt;15000 ppl) attends. The down town area is filled with stalls and stages, making it sort of a weekend-festival.
As I was saying, we were a bit hungry, so we made our way to the nearest gas station slash fast food-joint. We ordered our food and sat down inside the station to eat, when this guy walks in; norwegian in his fifties, dressed in armani jeans, pink dress shirt, sports jacket, expensive shoes, tanned, groomed and probably stinkin' rich. This guy is just the epitamy of the entitled norwegian man; makes a shitload of cash, lives in one of the richest, most peacefull countries on the planet, and is used to having people doing all the dirty work for him. 
He walks over to the cashier, who is west-african, in his early twenties and just super nice and serviceminded (sidenote: when I payed for my order he gave me back 100 nkr (around 17$) short, and when I brought his attention to it he appologized profusely three times and practically threw the money at me). The cashier (C) smiles and greets the man, asking what he can help him with today. The entitled man (EM) suddenly reveals that he is hammered drunk, and this conversation takes place:

(C has just given EM his order)
EM: what th'fuck is this? This is wrong!!
C: Im so sorry, I must have messed up your order. Tell me what's wrong with it and I'll make you another as fast as humanly possible!
EM: *slurs* it's supposed to be on whole wheat, not white bread!! I can't beleive you couldn't even get that right!! You shouldn't be working at all, are you completely retarded??
C: (is now making a new sandwich, trying to avoid the wave of abuse coming towards him) Im really sorry for messing up the order, Im making you a new one right now. Im really sorry, it's been a long night. 
EM: (ignoring the appologies) this is just fucking perfect, you have to know that when I say whole wheat, I mean whole wheat! You have to do better than this, you just gotta understand.. This is fucking riddiculous!

EM continues his stupid rant, getting more and more personal, like he was genuinly disappointed  in C and was expecting more of him. Like a parent, disappointed in his child. Had it been me, I would have broken down bawling a long time ago. 
C hands EM his food, and EM contiues: ""finally, that wasn't so hard was it? Now did you get it right, or do I need to unwrap it and check it again? *rambles on*""
C has had enough by this point, and has turned away from EM and is just answering him in short sentences. EM rambles like there's no tomorrow. 
Also inside the station were a couple of biker guys, the kind that looks ten times more threatening than they really are, but is still probably pretty threatening. They were getting fed up with EM, and the biggest one (BG) eventually spoke up; ""hey man, wanna cool it there for a minute? I think he got the picture by now.""

EM just looks at him. We all think ""phew, now he HAS to shut up!"" 
But he did no such thing. 
Instead, he walks right up to BG, positioning himself no more than five centimeters from him, noses barely touching and says; ""whatcha gonna do 'bout it?""
You could cut the tension with a knife, everyone in the station had stopped what they were doing and just starred at the pair. All hoping that EM would be leaving in a squad car (or ambulance). BG didn't say anything, just stood his ground, with a stern look at EM, as if saying that you have to go through all of us if you wanna mess with C. EM finally got the picture after a brief stare-down, and backed off as if nothing had happened. He went off to eat his sandwich, in the meantime the biker guys stuck around to see if things got hectic again, and I walked over to C and told him that he was doing a great job and that EM was a complete toolbag. Just when I turned around again, I see EM leaving the station and getting in to his car.

Back up. 
His car?? Did he just get in the _drivers seat_ of his fucking car? Yes, he motherfucking did. 
Now, neither of you know me, but I have a MAJOR problem with drunk driving. I don't give a shit if you kill yourself or end up in a wheelchair, but if you hurt any of my friends or my family I will hunt you down and set fire to everything you have ever treasured. 
So I whipped out my phone and managed to snap a photo of him driving away, lisenceplate included. 
And then I called the cops and reported his entitled ass. 

Seeing as the town fest was still in action, the police probably didn't pick him up right away. But because I gave them the lisence plate number he is now the suspect of a DUI, and will be flagged down whenever the cops see his car on the road. ","Drinking, driving and rambling",57

jumpityjump,10,6,1q0j04,40,"While training/trialling a new recruit last weekend, I told him about some of the weird, wacky and just plain stupid customers and questions we get asked at the cellar door and there were two I thought were worth posting here for your enjoyment. 

Background: I work on the cellar door at a very busy winery in a popular wine region. Basically, my job involves talking people through our wines, pouring wines, selling as much wine as possible, and ensuring customers have the best possible experience. We get all sorts of interesting customers and no shift is without its story...

STORY 1:
At the winery we offer two things for tasting: wine and cheese. This is very clearly advertised out the front. Most people come for the wine, but we do get plenty of cheese tasters. Sometimes we get people who are neither. One day, a young couple walk up to the bar. I greet them and asked if they would like to taste any wines. 

Girl: No. I'm driving and he doesn't drink wine.

Me: ok, would you like to try some cheese then?

Girl: No, we don't like cheese. 

Me: Well, I'm afraid that's all we have to offer you.

They then spent five or ten minutes standing at the bar, reading the tasting notes and looking at me expectantly as if I was going to magic up something else for them to try before getting back in their car and leaving. I really don't understand people some days. 

STORY 2:
We get a surprising number of people who come to our cellar door and ask if we actually sell wine there or if we just do tastings. The place is covered in signs with all of our deals and there are several price lists all over walls in the tasting area. My favourite response so far to one of these questions was our manager earlier this year. He looked this couple square in the eyes and said ""Nope. We have so much money that we just like to give away free tastings. But we don't actually sell the wine."" They bought a case.

Recently, my managers came up with a little contest for us. If we sell items from more than one department to a customer, we get a $5 gift card. Weeks went by and, despite the requirement being met daily, nobody got a gift card.

Sunday night, the assistant manager kept me at the store an hour late because he had to write an email. At the end of the night, he told me that a few weeks ago he watched me sell from several departments to one customer, and gave me a gift card. Even though it's only $5, it still meant a lot to be rewarded for going above and beyond just helping a customer and sending them away.

I got home that night and showed the gift card to my fiance, proud of myself and satisfied. While looking over the card, I noticed that it expired three months ago. I was a little bummed, but I figured I would bring it in the next day and we would figure out some other reward.

I brought it in the next day, and showed it to the assistant manager. He told me to wait a minute and went to talk to the general manager (who came up with the idea to give out the gift cards). Thirty seconds later, he walked out of the office and said, ""You can just consider this a really big pat on the back."" Then he smiled and walked away.

This is not a big deal. I don't end up $5 richer than I was before. I wasn't expecting any kind of reward, but to get my hopes up and to stomp on them is just wrong. I would have been happy with just about any replacement they could have given me, monetary or not.

I worked a couple years ago as a lifeguard at an indoor pool facility. The facility consists of a ""leisure"" pool  that never gets deeper than 4'6"", has a waterslide, etc., a lap pool for exercise, a sauna and a hot tub. IIRC it was a Sunday which means there was no executive staff (""Aquatics Director"") and the Head Guard on shift was on break, he was pretty handsome and off flirting with one of the cute girls working at the front desk. Anyways there were two guards on duty, I was assigned to watch the lap pool, sauna, and hot tub while the other guard watched the leisure pool. While walking around scanning the area I came across a man in the hot tub who had his face submerged in the water for an extended period of time. THIS IS A HUGE RED FLAG, for obvious and not so obvious reasons. So when I get around to the hot tub I tap him with my rescue tube and explain to him the several rules he's violating and he seems cool with it and I return to pacing around the pool rethinking my decisions in life. When I get back around to where he is, he stops me. ""I don't understand why I can't just put my face in the water."" I explain to him, ""well sir, when I see someone laying face first in the water I assume that something is wrong, regardless of how deep the water is. A lot of people like to come in here after they work out and they are prone to losing consciousness, especially in hot water, with steamy, humid air."" ""Yea but I pay a lot of money to use this place, I should be able to do what I want."" ""I understand sir, but these rules are here for your safety and the safety of others,"" that's when I uttered every underlings favorite words, ""would you like to discuss this with my supervisor"" of course he agreed. Now I think it's important at this point to explain that this fucker was MASSIVE like, probably ex marine huge and I am the typical gawky awkward swimmer with a tiny ass waist, no fat and lean muscle. I can barely do a pull up but I have a breast stroke that would knock your socks off, but I digress. So I wait until I am relieved then I go and try and find the Head Guard, let's call him Roman. So Roman is a huge ass motherfucker that left about a month after this incident to become a cop.

beezlebubsnemesis,4,4,1q0c86,26,"It was fall and all of our swimsuits were on the clearance rack. I worked at a cheap department store, and one night, I had an older lady come in to shop this very clearance rack. I happen to be working in the same section and Swimsuit Lady calls me over to ask me a question.

Me: ""How can I help?"" 

SL: ""Well I found this top that I really like and it's $14.95.  Then I found the same style of top but in  a different color. Why aren't they the same price?""

When I worked at this store, I worked two days a week just cleaning and helping customers. I wasn't even allowed to tag clearance or change signs. The best explanation I could offer was, ""Some items go on clearance faster than others.""

So she says,""Well why didn't they just mark them down to the same price since they're almost the same?""

OpponentCorn,1,12,1q0any,17,"Hi folks!

I love this sub, the stories make me laugh, cry, sob over the decline of humankind, etc... They never fail to brighten my day.

So here is the first of my own stories! Or it would be, save for that one that i wrote in greentext... Whoopsies, my bad. Anyway, enough talk, let's fight!

I work at a big box home improvement warehouse, where lowest prices are just the beginning. Specifically in the trade department, dealing with commercial customers, and the odd retail customer who happens to need help with building materials.

This just happened about ten minutes ago, so forgive my venting. But tragically this is a fairly regular occurrence, wherein a, ahem, *valued customer* will come in and... well... embarrass is the wrong word, all they make is a tiny mistake (nobody knows everything) which isn't embarrassing in the slightest! But instead of laughing it off they bristle and get defensive.

So here we are, working, earning them dollars, mostly just catching up on paperwork. It's the end if the day so there's very few team working at the time, and a pair of people come in without anyone really noticing. They are not builders, they have quite clearly been sent in to pick up a few things by a builder though. Turns out they are looking for nails, so they immediately walk over to the small rack of ""builder's essentials"" that we keep beside the trade counter. Pencils, folding rules, marker pens and such.

There are all of three different kinds of nails that we keep there, the kinds that builders always need. So, predictably, it turns out that what they are looking for isn't there, but no stress, we have an entire aisle full to the brim with nails.

""Where are your decking nails? Are you out? That's pretty crap.""

I look up, and a scowling face greets me. ""They will be down aisle 18, we only keep a few essentials here, the rest are in the nails aisle.""

""Why aren't they here?""

I'm not paid enough for this.

""You guys don't know a thing about how to set up your store, all the nails should be in the same place. Now wouldn't that be more sensible?"" Silence. ""Wouldn't it?""

Awww poor baby, is that your girlfriend you brought with you? Well I guess you won't be impressing her today.

Actually, scratch that, just get angry while I stare at you, that'll impress her pants right off of her.

At this point I should probably point out that I can see the nails they need. It looks like someone picked up a box and changed their mind right before they got to the counter, putting their box of nails on the builder's essentials shelf. I guess it's just too hard to try to match up the empty box you have in your hands with a full one on the shelf.

So fuck it, I guess it's petty revenge time. 

Bert stare.

I turn around and just walk away.

hellomini,62,46,1q076f,118,"So I work at a retail location in Canada that provides services such as domestic/international money transferring and money order purchases. Today I had one gentleman come in requesting to purchase a money order for /x/ amount in American currency, payable to his American health insurance company.

As store policy goes, I explained that all money order purchases had a specific fee and that a customer could only pay for it using cash or debit card. He then proceeded to tell me that he had an American debit card and asked me if it would be okay. I asked to see what kind of card it was (I.e. From what financial institution) and saw that it was a  debit card with the MasterCard insignia - a new-ish type of card that allows account holders the versatility of a chequing and savings account as well as the ability to make online purchases in the same way that many use their /credit/ cards, among other things. While this card is relatively new in Canada, it has been introduced much earlier in other countries including the US.

Unfortunately, this type of card is not seen as an acceptable form of payment for money orders in my store because a debit card with MasterCard or Visa functionality would register as either of the two in my register's system, despite being a chequing/savings card. To put it in simpler terms, the only debit cards acceptable for this kind of transaction would be Interac debit cards, nothing else. To use a MC/V debit card would confuse the register and have it show up as a ""credit"" payment rather than a ""debit"" payment - something that I would not be able to carry out to begin with as the ""credit payment"" function is completely inaccessible when undergoing this kind of transaction on my register.

I explained all of this in the simplest terms I could to the customer snd apologized for the inconvenience. Then, I pointed to the nearby ATM machine and explained that an alternative would be withdrawing funds from his American chequing account and pay with those funds. I then concluded that he could choose which option would be best for him and that there would be no pressure to purchase a money order from my store as there are many other providers with this service but that *the same rule regarding MC/V cards exists throughout Canadian stores offering this service*. 

What then happened was probably the most baffling thing ever.

As many of you on here, I'm sure you have at one point felt more therapist than retail worker. At this moment, I had the unfortunate chance of experiencing this at its full extent as he began to explain why exactly he needed this money order and that they (whoever they is) told him that he could do it here and that he didn't want to pay the fees to withdraw funds from his American account and that every other country has these cards and use them properly. But then, get this: he wasn't done yet! No no. According to this fine gentleman he was ""an American citizen and didn't have to follow [my] rules!""

At this point I was really confused. I'm not sure how his American citizenship had anything to do with the rules within Canada. Secondly, I never expected to encounter some kind of /Murcia circle-jerk in real life but lo' and behold, I did. Moreover, I had just explained all of this to the customer in front of him who was a Japanese citizen and had a Japanese MC debit card and required a money order as well. Now, I had several questions:

Does he think being American grants him immunity to the standard transaction protocol?

Does he mean to insinuate that somehow being American is being better than being Canadian (as evident in his over-accentuated ""*I'm* an American citizen!)?

After hearing me speak to the Japanese citizen does he assume that somehow the rule would not apply to him because he was American and the Japanese person was not?

What does he mean he ""doesn't have to follow my rules""? Does he think I pulled a rule book out of my ass and that I'm just fucking with people?

Lastly, does he really think I care about him being an American?

All of these questions ran through my head. I could have shut him down real quick. I could have reminded him that when you enter a country *you are obligated to follow the rules of conduct within that country, especially when it relates to any thing monetary*. I could have also mentioned that it was people like him that gave Americans that stereotype of self-absorbed redneck, an unfortunate stereotype to the many Americans who are anything but. I could have done so many things. But that is not the Canadian way!

I simply responded ""sorry"". And that was that.

ComixBoox,16,14,1q04yx,58,"**Background:** 10 or so years ago when I was in high school I decided that I needed a summer job. I had never been employed before (I had just turned 16 and most places near where I live wouldn't hire someone under 16) so I started looking for work. A friend mentioned to me that the movie theatre where he worked was hiring so I applied and, miraculously, got the job! For a long time this cinema had been the biggest one in town. It was always packed and had the newest movies but within the past year another much nicer cinema had opened only a few blocks away and business had slowed to a crawl. Because of this the staffing at this theatre was pretty sparse. Business was steady in the evenings but during daytime hours there was pretty much nobody in the lobby. This will be important later.

**The Story:** I arrived one weekend for my first day of work a little nervous and not knowing what to expect. I came in and the assistant manager, a super cool girl 10 years or so older than me, gave me my locker and uniform and started showing me the ropes. It was a great first job. I was just the ticket taker and so all I had to do was tear tickets and direct people to their theatres, and then clean theatres in between showings. 

The AM shows me the ropes, and then leaves me in the hands of another Ticket Taker (TT) for the rest of the day so I can basically shadow him and ask him any questions I might have. I ask him questions, try to make small talk and the like but this guy, a big asian guy, says almost nothing to me. Everything is met with a timid 'yeah' or 'no' so eventually I sort of give up. One or two people trickle into matinee showings, but for about 15 minutes its just me and TT alone in the lobby when all of a sudden he starts making strange noises. 

**TT:** ~grunts and sad little moans~

**Me:** Are you ok?

**TT:** ..... urgh.

**Me:** .....uh... 

**TT:** rrrrrrrrrrrrrnghhhh.

This guy is doubling over now, grunting and sweating, when all of a sudden he opens his mouth...

To call what happened next 'puking' would be doing a disservice to sick children everywhere. It's as if his body carried within it a portal to a dimension entirely comprised of half-digested skittles, popcorn, hotdogs and soda and now, burdened with terrible purpose, his stomach had begun to unleash this nightmare-world into our own. I stood in horrified awe as vomit spewed out of this man, this vessel for excrement, for an un-measurable amount of time until the stream became a dribble and eventually ceased. I had backed out of the splash-zone when it started so I was relatively unscathed, but TT looked like he'd just dove into the whale tank after the belugas had eaten a batch of rotten fish. He looked up from the small brown lake that separated us, looked into my eyes, and without a word ran out of the movie theatre as fast as he could.

I am 5' 10' and I am not exaggerating when I say I could have laid down in the puddle that was left and made a full puke-angel. It was the middle of the day, less than an hour into my first real job ever, and I was alone in this huge movie theatre lobby with this puddle of vomit, the only witness to this strange occurence. The radio we had was sitting on the ticket takers podium, splattered with flecks of puke, so I gingerly pressed the call button and radioed up to AM, who came downstairs laughing

**Me:** ""uh... so TT threw up... and then left.""

**AM:** ""haha, oh yeah, sorry about that, It's actually been about 3 months since he did this. He used to do it every day!""

thebarista,3,14,1q04rx,70,"Lots of stories from my store, and I suppose I'll just submit a few here and there. Here's the first installment!

**Background** - I own and operate a cafe/eatery in a small town. The majority of my customers are fantastic, they understand they support a small business. My only competition is a very large franchise whose customers loiter in front of, chain-smoking and feeding their 3 year olds Mountain Dew while they're strapped to a stroller still. Occasionally some of them will migrate toward my store, and therein lie the stories.

For the record, I'm very strict with my hiring process, and I make sure that each new employee has a genuinely nice personality, and sincerely wants the customer to feel welcome and happy. Please assume in any of my stories that the staff are speaking in a pleasant, helpful manner, and trying their utmost to make the customer happy.

**Story** - One of my regulars, Wayne, comes in quite often to sit and write in his journal alone while sipping on a hot chocolate. On this particular day, Wayne brought his wife, Faye. They sat for a while and enjoyed some drinks, then after some time, Wayne came to the till and ordered some food; a large clubhouse sandwich for himself, and a garden salad for his wife. *I enjoy making salads, it's entirely visual so the attention to detail shows more than it would on a wrap or sandwich*.

As I'm finishing off the order and preparing to take it out, another married couple enters the store and sits with Wayne &amp; Faye at their booth. I deliver the food, greet the new customers, and head back toward the counter, however I hear my name being called from behind me after a few strides.

Faye - I'm sorry, I wasn't aware this is what came on the salad.

*Our menu boards are behind the counter, and clearly display the ingredients of each meal, plus I'm fairly positive I'd made garden salads for her in months prior.*

Me - Well, I'm very sorry for any confusion. Would you like something added or taken off?

F - No, I didn't think it came with these toppings, I'd just like my money back.

*I want the customer to be happy, and have no problem when a customer simply wants a refund, but something just felt odd about this. Not to mention we can't re-use the salad, but as miffed as I was, I wanted her to leave happy and satisfied with a meal.*

M - What seems to be the confusion with the order? Is there perhaps a different salad we could replace it with?

F - No, I wouldn't like anything else, I would just like my money back.


I give the money for the salad back to Faye, and when I return to the counter, my co-worker signals they have something to tell me. As the second couple came in, they suggested to Wayne and Faye that they all move to the Thai restaurant down the street for dinner. Wayne informed them that they had ordered dinner and wanted to stay. I suppose Faye chose to return her salad, but I gained respect for Wayne for making her stay until he was finished his clubhouse.

*Even after I've handed you the salad, all you need to do is tell me that you don't want it, and I'll gladly give you your money back, but don't try to take the easy way out and make it seem like an error on our part.*

It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Year’s Eve.
 
**STORY:**  I’m not sure what perverse logic makes some customers think that if they yell loudly enough; they’ll get what they want. If you’re shopping at my store, you’re in for a nasty surprise. The more loudly you yell, the more likely I am to deny your request, even if it was perfectly reasonable.
 
I heard a woman raising her voice while speaking to one of my cashiers, so I walked over to see what the issue was. A well-dressed lady was berating my cashier and cussing up a storm because we didn’t take American Express credit cards. There was a line of people waiting to check out, but this lady was having a great time making a scene. She was obviously playing it up to the people around her.
 
For years, i didn't take AmEx, because they charged higher fees than the other cards and they were a pain in the ass. I also didn’t take Discover cards, because of issues I’d had with my merchant services provider. As it happens, I had actually switched providers a few months earlier, and I now took all of the major credit cards. Obviously, this particular cashier didn’t know about the change (my fault).
 
I walked up next to the cashier and asked the customer if I could be of assistance. She immediately started yelling at me, and this conversation took place.
 
**LADY:**  I can’t believe you don’t take American Express! I’m spending a lot of money here (she wasn’t) and I want my reward points. What kind of shitty store doesn’t take American Express?
 
**ME:**  American Express charges us higher fees. You’re welcome to pay with cash, Visa, your debit card, or Discover.
 
**LADY:**  You take Discover but you don’t accept American Express?!? What kind of discount are you going to give me since I can’t use my American Express?
 
**ME:**  How about 1%? I believe that’s what AmEx gives back for rewards.
 
**LADY:**  That’s only like 45 cents! You’ve got to be kidding me!
 
**ME:**  I know. It’s hard for me to believe you’re standing here making a scene about 45 cents myself.
 
A couple of people in line actually laughed out loud, and I think she got embarrassed. She paid in cash, snatched her bag, and headed for the door.
 
The guy who had been waiting behind her to check out, stepped up to the counter. He was obviously trying to make a joke, and he said, “I was going to pay with American Express myself, but I guess I’ll have to use cash.”
 
I loudly responded, “Oh, we take American Express…just not HER American Express! My cashier didn’t know we had changed our policy. 
 
I have no doubt the loud mouthed bitch heard the entire conversation. The guy paid with a Visa card and was laughing the entire time.

*I will admit upfront, that I was trying to take orders during most of this, so the dialogue is generally correct, but not word for word.* 

I work in a casual, almost fast food but not quite restaurant in Los Angels as a cashier. This older black man wearing a very fine suit came up to me with his salad and said he ""wanted to return it."" I immediately knew this guy was going to be a ""I want to talk to the manager"" deal from his tone, so I just said I'd get the GM. He said ""OK"" as he used a toothpick to get something out of his teeth, and then wiped it on the counter.

GM: ""I told you I'd be right with you sir, there are a lot of orders here.""

WDBM: ""And I'm the only black one huh?""

My GM stops for a second to give him a ""and what does that have to do with the price of tea in china"" look.

GM: ""No sir, you're not."" (There is literally a black woman right behind this guy)

WDBM: ""I hate racists!""

GM: ""Me too.""

WDBM: ""I bet you hate blacks! I hate racists you faggot!""

Not only is my GM gay, but so is my shift leader. She starts yelling at him to leave. My GM grabs his salad and throws it into the trash (it was in a to-go box), and tells hims to leave. The guy shoves my GM, who is probably 15 years younger than him, struggles back and pushes him away. Tells him to get the fuck out, and calls security. At this point, a black employee has also begun yelling at him to leave and shows him the door.

Background: I work in tourism that has excursions as well as a museum attached. There are a lot of school groups that visit, especially in April and May. This story is from one of my friends who works with me. His office is sealed off from the public but has thin walls so they hear everything and we recently installed an exhibit, so they get to overhear some interesting things.

MissInDeceased,16,29,1pzs5r,101,"I had completely forgotten about this story, until someone asked how it was to work at this place.  
  
This was about 6 years ago, when I was fresh-faced to the retail scene. I had previously worked at a movie rental place, but it was nothing like this. When people wanted assistance, they wanted you to essentially be their personal shopper. Which was kind of okay, when it wasn't busy, because this place sold expensive bras, panties and lingerie.   
  
I was stuck to the morning shifts, because I was the only employee not in school at the time. Morning shifts always equaled the shipment shift.   
  
So every weekday, 9am to 3pm, I would come in, put out new bras and whatnot, and help customers when they came in. It was typically me and the opening manager then, maybe another girl if we had the hours.  
  
One morning was especially eventful. We had gotten about 4 boxes of nothing but bras, and it was my duty to put them out. After about 3 hours, I managed to get them all out (or backstocked, if there were too many).   
  
This is when a customer comes in, a bigger girl, about a 36 DD, looking for a certain pattern in a certain bra.  
  
I knew exactly what pattern she meant, as I had the same one, so I pulled one out to verify. She confirmed, and told me her size.   
  
At this store, when I worked there, the drawers had a clear front on them, so all you needed to do was look through the little window in the size you wanted to see if that color/pattern was available.   
  
That's exactly what I was doing. I was leaning down, looking into the windows to see if this pattern was available. Also, I had been there for the past 3 days, putting out new bras, so I already knew what we had out front and in the backstock, so if we didn't have it, I already knew.   
    
But while I was looking into the windows, the girl who was looking for the bra, asked me, ""Do you even work here?""  
  
I was surprised at the question, so I said, ""Of course I do, that's why I'm helping you.""  
  
""Well, it doesn't look like it, looks like you're just standing there.""  
  
I was shocked. I was 18, I had no idea what to say. I told her I would go look in the back and she just said, ""Whatever.""  
  
By the time I came out, she was already at the register, bitching to my manager about how I did nothing to help her, how lazy I was and so on. I walked up behind the counter and busied myself, while she kept bitching.  
  
Finally, she left. I was nearly in tears, this was the first time someone had complained about me, and KEPT complaining about me even while I was there.   
  
After she left, my manager told me, ""Don't worry about it, I saw that you were actually helping her, she was just being a bitch.""   
  
Geez, some people.

NejKidd,38,40,1pzo42,190,"Sidenote: my spacebar is currently broken slightly, so if there's words stuck together, sorry, I'll try to edit it out later.

Everyone knows we have fireworks night on 5th Nov in the UK, right? Well, as a result we've been selling small fireworks boxes and sparklers for the past week or so for cheap, but I don't think they're anything too impressive.

They mostly come in mixed boxes and all have a 'noise rating' of 1 to 5, 5 being the loudest.

I actually overheard this from further away, but got the full story from another co-worker later on.

An Uppity Lady (UL) came in, stood by the fireworks display for a long time (which is pointless because you're supposed to go to the kiosk and ask for them there like you would for cigarettes) and basically huffed and tutted loudly until a random passing staff member (RPSM) noticed her and spoke to her.

&gt; RPSM: Can I help?

&gt; UL: Of course! I wouldn't be stood here otherwise.

&gt; RPSM: Oookay.  How can I help?

&gt; UL: I bought these fireworks the other day and they were far too loud.  What are you going to do about it?

&gt; RPSM: Right, do you have the box?

&gt; UL: No of course not! I used them up so I threw the box out.

&gt; RPSM: What about a receipt?

&gt; UL: NO! I do not have my receipt.  I bought these fireworks, set them off in my back garden last night with my five-year old watching and they scared him! I want to speak to your manager!

&gt; RPSM: [thankful to be shot of the woman] I'll just go get him, if you could wait here.

In the store we have 1 store manager (SM) and 2 deputy managers, one of which is Teddy.  RPSM gets Teddy to deal with the woman and RPSM thankfully disappears.  RPSM briefs Teddy that UL is complaining about the fireworks and doesn't have the item or the receipt.  Doesn't tell him any more than that.

&gt; Teddy: Hello, I'm a manager.  Apparently you bought one of our fireworks and you weren't happy?

&gt; UL: Yes, I bought [type of fireworks kit] and set it off last night and it terrified my five year old. I'm very disappointed and want you to do something about it.

&gt; Teddy: You don't have the receipt or item, I understand.  Unfortunately due to our refunds policy, we have no proof you actually bought the item you say you bought, so I can't give you a refund.

UL blows up about this, the argument continues back and forth for about 10 minutes before Teddy gives in and calls SM  down from the back office.  SM rushes down because if he's been called down he knows it's a problem customer.  We don't get them often.

&gt; SM: I'm here! What can I do? (our SM is a bit disconnected from reality - Teddy briefly explains the situation, his take on it and the lady's story)

&gt; Sm: Okay!  I can take it from here! So, your fireworks were too loud?  I'm guessing you used them all before you came to this conclusion?

&gt; UL: Yes! I bought this box because is has a '1' on your volume control in your leaflets, but later I looked on the side of the box and it said '3'! (First time she's mentioned this) That's false advertising!  I bought it so it wouldn't frighten my child, but it did.  I want my money back!

&gt; SM: Where did you set it off?

&gt; UL: In my back garden.

&gt; SM: How big is your back garden?

&gt; UL: Inside the house looking out a window of course. I don't see how this is relevant.

alexasloan,7,5,1pznyk,55,"The store I work at has these ""scratchers"" that we give out periodically at the registers if you forgot your coupon sent in the mail for either 15%, 20% or 30% off. These coupons are only for people that use the store's card. The scratchers are so dumb because the people that ""forgot their 30% coupon at home"" always get it honored and don't even really need a scratcher.

Anyway, I'm closing POS one night with another newer girl when this customer approaches my her and asks for a handful of scratchers in a whisper voice (like she knows she's being shady). My coworker looks over at me and I explain that the scratchers are for customers that have the store card only and we can give her one, but we usually just scratch them at check out &amp; I ask the customer if she's ready for checkout. She says she has a store card and isn't ready to check out but she says she wants ""a handful"" of scratchers. 

My co worker calls for a manager to see what she can do. When the manager comes over, the customer starts acting crazy -- she's yelling at the new girl saying that she's not providing good customer service and she wants to see a manager. All of this is for show because she knew we called the manager and that she was on her way. I'm kind of giving her the crazy eyes at this stunt she's trying to pull. 

So my manager asks if everything is ok and how she can help and this crazy customer starts yelling that she just wanted a scratcher so that she'd know how much she can spend tonight. And my manager was like ""ok, sure; here you go"" and hands her one, kind of confused why this is even an issue. So I speak up and say that the customer actually asked for a handful and ""do we do that?"" 

This crazy lady starts yelling now and rocking back and forth saying that all the other managers do it and she usually gets like 7 or 10 scratchers when she comes in. Seeing that this lady is crazy, my manager just asks her -- ""Did you have a 30% at home?"" (The perfect opportunity for this lady to just say ""yes"", get the best discount there is, and just move on with her life). But she says, ""I don't know what I got! I just want my scratchers!""

My manager gives her three and says, ""Have a good night."" and the psycho lady gabs them from her and storms back to Customer Service to write a complaint about my manager. 

**TL/DR: Crazy lady is more interested in ""gambling"" for a 30% coupon than just accepting one that is offered.**

rhiskisnoir,50,21,1pzloz,91,"Last night, just before close, a man and a woman approached the register to buy some clothes.

Easy.

They handed over a pair of size '8 - 10' pants and asked why we didn't have a straight 6. I, as the supervisor on duty (who also knows nothing about the clothing department) pulled something straight out of my arse and said ""our combined sizes start with an '8 - 10,' '12 - 14,' and so on.""

Customer: But I've seen '6 - 8' here before in these pants.

Me: Oh, well, we must just not have any at the moment.

Customer: Where do Asians shop? They'll all need size '6 - 8.' You're missing out on a whole market.

Me: *awkwardly laughs, wishing he would hurry and leave.*

Customer: What? Do you only cater for fat, white girls?

At this point I feel very uncomfortable as, in Australia, an '8 - 10' is still a very small size, of which I am definitely larger than. 

His transaction is complete by this point, thank God.

After he and his wife have left the store, I turn my back on them and mouth ""WHAT. THE. FUCK."" at one of my colleagues. 

I look outside the entrance (the store is in a large shopping complex), and they're still both standing about 50 meters away from us, looking through their bags. They look back at us, laugh heartily, and continue on their merry way.

[deleted],24,28,1pzewe,140,"I only worked in retail for about a year (episodes like this partly the reason why), but this story is one I'll probably carry to the grave. 

I worked at a grocery store, in the ""Specialty"" department. We handled wine, cheese, beer, coffee, and chocolate products. You know, all the best stuff. There was even a bar area where we served ice cold drafts, pumpkin spice lattes, and wine by the glass. 

Everybody in the Specialty department did everything - on a given day, you could work the bar, stock wine, or any number of odd jobs related to retail and food production. Our ""main"" area, it could be said, was the cheese counter. 

At first glance, this cheese counter was glorious. Literally hundreds of specialty cheeses from all over the world. One of our responsibilities was to assist customers with choosing the cheese right for them - we posed as cheese ""experts"", but the reality is, few of us knew more than what we could read on the package (words like ""salty"" and ""creamy"" seemed to sell things pretty well). 

At the end of the day, not the worst job in the world - definitely a bit higher-class, as far as retail work goes. Our customers were pretty bearable - I have more good stories about them than bad. I suppose I got lucky.

But that all changed one fateful evening.

I was working behind the cheese counter with two other employees, cutting cheese (all the obvious jokes have been made), doing our thang. It's pretty theraputic work, and we get to shoot the shit while checking out the ladies. 

Then, a woman walks up. She appeared to be about my age - early twenties. She was Indian, and not bad looking, all things considered. Naturally, I took the opportunity to ask if she needed assistance.

""Anything I can help you with, ma'am?""

I could immediately tell that something was off. Her pupils were the size of dinner plates. She looked at me as though I was the most terrifying thing she had ever seen in her life.

""Yes I need help""

""Sure thing ma'am, what can I help you find?""

There was a brief pause, and she appeared to be unravelling some particularly complex puzzle in her head. I got the sense that she hadn't really heard me.

""My friend has cancer!""

I was completely blindsided by this. 

""I need you to help me I don't know what to do my friend has cancer and I need help""

She was gesturing wildly as she spoke, and appeared to be gaining momentum (you know, when people start talking at you and slowly pick up speed as they go). I had no idea what to do - fortunately, I'm pretty good at talking people through things, so I decided to just reason with her. 

""Well, I think that a doctor might be able to help you better than I can.""

""She's been to doctors and they can't help her I need help""

""Ma'am, I work in the cheese department.""

""I don't know where to go I don't care that you work in the cheese department I don't care that you're busy I need you to help me""

At this point, I start to glance around for assistance. Those two coworkers I had mentioned earlier? Nowhere to be seen. Fuckers. 

By now, I had picked up on the fact that she wasn't all there. Fortunately, for reasons entirely unrelated to retail, I'm pretty accustomed to reasoning with people who are drugged up/drunk/less than sober.

""Well, since she's your friend, maybe you're the person who knows what's best for her.""

This seemed to calm her down a bit so I kept going.

""Maybe the doctors aren't helping because they don't know her like you do. You should go and be with her, since she's your friend.""

She seemed to ponder this, and to my great relief, the phone rang. I siezed the opportunity to walk away and answer the phone. It was one of my coworkers.

""Yeah hi I thought you could use a rescue""

""Holy shit dude""

""I know dude""

""Can you try to find Service 90?""

*(Service 90 is code name for our security)*

""You should probably go to customer service and ask them to page them""

Suddenly, I'm interrupted by a plastic fork whizzing past my head. I look up and see this fucking girl *throwing garbage behind the cheese counter*. I hung up and asked her what she was doing. 

She didn't even respond, just started throwing shit at me instead. 

One of the assistant managers finally came out, and asked her to stop. This seemed to distract her, and to my great relief, she walked away. I found out later that she had the exact same conversation with another hapless employee from another department.

Unfortunately, since this particular store is ridiculously pro-customer service, I doubt that she ever got kicked out. Our corporate culture is kind of weird - you could smack talk an employee right in front of them and we'll still give you free shit. But if you even LOOK as though you might steal from us, you get escorted out in handcuffs. No joke - I've seen it happen.

I have a handful of stories from working retail, and I might share when I have the time. This story is one of the highlights - I'll never forget that woman. Although I highly doubt she actually had a sick friend, I still wonder what was actually going on in her head.

Crazy_Overlord,34,7,1pz8u1,36,"With Halloween out of the way, my store (a high-end convenience store) is in the midst of preparing for our next money-making holiday - **Christmas.** Already, some of our aisles are decked with festive tinsel, the seasonal section is almost ready, and a lot of 'Christmas-y' items have been set up near our registers. The only dark spot in our store is that, because it's a symbol of Christianity, we are not allowed to put up our Christmas tree this year. 
  
One of the first items that were put out were the Advent Calenders. For those not familiar with the concept, they are 'countdown' calenders where, for every day leading up until Christmas, you get to open a little window to get a treat. You're also supposed to start counting down on the first day of December. We have a large variety of these, ranging from $1.99 - $11.99. The most expensive ones are the Lindt and Kinder Surprise calenders. These are placed right beside our registers, so customers often pass them when they are cashing out.  
  
On Sunday, a lady was returning one of the Kinder Surprises calenders that she had bought the previous day. It was sealed and she had her receipt, so there was no problem. As I went to return it to its stand, what do I see? Someone has *torn open* the wrapper of one the Lindt calenders and taken the chocolate from the 'Day 1' box. They destroyed the most expensive calender that we had for a tiny piece of chocolate when we had cheaper versions right next to it and a bin of $.99 chocolate *bars* across from it. Not only that, but they did it right beside our registers!  
  
I told my manager and she laughed, saying, ""Someone's a little anxious for Christmas!"" We joked about how, since they made sure to take Day 1's treat, they might come back every day for another. I worked Monday night and, to my slight disappointment, all the calenders were in perfect condition. Either that customer really wanted a treat or they realized that they were a month early for their snacking.

A few minutes ago, I had a ""Bro"" come in to price out some stuff. You know the kind. supertight muscle shirt with underarmor on top of it, Square white sunshades, ""custom faded"" hat with the spiky hair. I don't know about you, but the dictionary should have had his picture next to the definition of an asshat. 

He wants me to price out a level kit for his truck. (for those of you that don't know what a level kit is, it consists of either some torsion bar keys, spacers, or add-on leaf packs, depending on the make and model of the vehicle.)

I price it out for him, and he decides he wants me to price out a specific brand. I comply and mention the price. There is a price difference between the two of about 60 dollars. 

Bro: Why are you charging me more for the X Brand kit? 

Me: Because it is priced more. You're paying for a name brand kit

Bro: well what's the difference between the key kits?

Me: Between the keys? nothing. The difference is in the method of shock extensions. Kit X uses stud spacers, while Kit Z uses a bracket on the bottom of the shock.

Bro: But that doesn't make sense, they should cost the same!

Me: Im sorry, but that's how they are priced, I don't have any control over pricing. We don't have them marked up a lot either.

Bro: But i've been using brand X for years! these kits were never this expensive! These guys make the best stuff, but they are ALWAYS the lowest price!

Me: Well, that may have been true at one point, but there are many more brands and manufacturers now than there were even five years ago. Plus, this is for a new model truck, so it's no surprise that they will cost a bit more than usual. 

Bro:This is ridiculous! I'm not paying more for a premium product! (in reality brand X is made in china, while brand Z is US made)

Me: well, This is what I have available. I could always price you something else. Or would you like another brand?

Bro: Fine, do that. 

I priced him the keys for his truck in brand Z. (the ""Kit"" that I had been quoting him was something I put together. I just got rid of the Shock relocation brackets)

Me: Ok, It looks like I have Brand Z keys, which are keys only 99 Dollars. 

Bro: Give me those instead. I like Brand Z's Quality. 

(inside my head, I wanted to smack him upside his head for being a dumbass, but couldn't. We just spent 5 minutes going back and forth, arguing about how brand X was the best kit and how it was ""Premium"")

I sold him his keys and he left. 

My manager walked by a few minutes later, and he says:

retailthrowaway2013,40,30,1pyrdc,143,"Back story-The assistant manager(Fred) where I work has been at this office for just under 3 months. I've only been there maybe 2 weeks longer than him. This is also my first job. Fred has a habit of not telling me my schedule and just expecting me to know it. He avoids the question whenever I ask what I work the next day. I work outside of the actual office and I clean cars, he works inside renting them. When I get off work, I drop my car off to my mom because she doesn't have her own car. 95% of the time, she will have my car the entire day if I don't work.

Story 1. 
A few weeks ago I asked Fred for my schedule the next day. ""Oh don't worry about it. We'll figure it out."" Umm..okay well that doesn't help but whatever. 

End of the day rolls around and I text the other girl that works with me and ask is she works the next day. She said that she doesn't so that means that I do. Awesome.

Around 8pm the manager(Marshall) texts me. Marshall asks if Fred told me my schedule for the following day. I reply with ""Nope but I texted girl2 and she told me that she doesn't work so I'm assuming that I do."" 

I realize now that I threw Fred under the bus. Oops. 

Marshall tells me ""Alright. Here's what you're going to do. Go in 45 minutes late tomorrow. Wait just long enough so that he calls me and then calls you asking you to come in."" 

You got it boss. 

Next day rolls around, I'm taking my sweet time getting ready for work. I get halfway there and get a call. It's Fred. ""Uhh...hey so can you come into work today?"" I tell him ""yep, on my way"". 

Marshall texts me right after and says ""hey, don't tell Fred the plan, he's about to call you."" Success. I get to work, Fred is freaking out, customers everywhere. I sweep in to save the day. 


Story 2-

This just happened a few hours ago. 

Yesterday I'm at work. We have a new manager. Marshall is now gone so no shenanigans yet. Fred is running around trying to impress the new boss because she's pretty attractive and he is ""totally going to get in trouble for banging the boss"" his exact words. He's even helping me clean cars. 

Girl2 is going on vacation this week so it's up to me to cover some of her shifts. I can't do all of them since we're limited to 25 hours. I asked Fred 3 times if I work today. Every time he blew it off and said something like ""we'll figure it out"". 

Closing time comes and I ask yet again. He says ""I'll text you."" He has said that many times before and failed to actually do it. I look him straight in the face and say ""text me before midnight or I am turning off my phone and I will not show up."" He says okay. He heard me say that and so did another employee. I go home for the night.

Midnight rolls around. Nothing. 1am, nothing. I leave my phone on because I just KNOW he's going to call me before we open at 8am. 

Then it happens 7:22am and guess who is calling. I ignore the call and wait for the voicemail. ""Hey...when you wake up just go ahead and come on in."" I go back to bed not worrying about it. 

I wake up around noon, so well rested thanks to my day off! I have 2 texts from Fred.

Fred-""Come in when you wake up"" 

Fred-""Hello""

Me-""Hey I'm awake but since you didn't tell me last night, I told my mom to keep my car. I don't have a way to get to work today""

Fred-""Ok""

It's literally only his fault. Can't wait to see what happens tomorrow when I go in. ",Call before midnight.,173

So I'm a manager at a pretty large retail pharmacy I've had some pretty wacky customers but this interaction was probably my favorite because the guy got so mad at me. All you really need to know about this story is that our pharmacy closes at 6 on the weekends but the front end stays open until 9. Saturday is our heaviest workload day other than truck days because we have to change all the ad signs for the next week. Business drops off after the pharmacy closes which gives us a good three hours to power through the last of ad. However, some people don't realize/check the front door to see that the pharmacy has different hours than us so it can cause some problems. This is what happened on that fateful night:

It was around 7 o'clock, the pharmacy's closed, and I'm in the back doing ad. We had a new guy up front who was in training to be a shift supervisor but he still needed a manager to work with him in case any problems came up.....like this guy.....he's being so loud I can hear him pitching a fit from where I was in the back. I know this is going to be one of those ""learning experiences"" for my new shift so I start walking up to the front and I hear him pitching a royal fit about how the pharmacy shouldn't be closed:

Angry Grandpa:*rada rada rada*you guys are no better than a 7-eleven right now
Trainee: I'm sorry but I don't make the pharmacy hours...etc.

At this point they're just talking in circles and I'm getting to the front. This guy is like 70 something and he's got a little kid with him whom I'm assuming is his grandson. I ask if there's anything I can help with and he spins around and starts yelling at me now.

AG: This is fucking ridiculous! I have a medical emergency and you're pharmacy is closed.
Me: I'm sorry sir but the pharmacist is gone there's nothing we can do the only [store name] pharmacy that is open is over by the hospital (about 5 miles away)
AG: I don't want to drive out that far! I'll just go to [other store]. Ring me up.

I look down and he's got a box of hair dye in his hands......OK.....medical emergency....right...so my trainee starts ringing him up and the guy swipes his card...nothing...swipes again....nothing...he's getting even more angry now and turning red....one last try...again nothing. He throws his card down on the counter and says, or rather yells,""JUST TYPE THE DAMN NUMBERS IN!!""

At this point I have the biggest shit eating grin on my face because this is absurd how mad he's getting. I simply reply that we're not allowed to which is technically true (for prepaid cards because we can't get our money back if the card was stolen, if it swipes its fine).
AG: FINE. FUCK THIS WE'RE LEAVING!!
Me: *insert sickly sweet CS voice*Have a wonderful night!!
AG: FUCK YOU!!! *as he walks out the door*

There's this huge fad out right now with this rubber band weaving loom. We carry them, and right now they're on sale and so are the individual packages of refill rubber bands. The display they're set up on is RIGHT in front of the door when you walk into the store, with the registers being immediately to the right of the door.

Now, the store *always* has some sort of coupon out. Usually it's a 40% off one regular priced item. If something is on sale already, the coupon doesn't work on it. 

So yesterday, this ornery looking lady comes to my register with a loom, about 15 packages of rubber band refills, and a handful of gewgaws from the clearance bins. There are one or two other small things that are regular price. She presents the 40% off coupon, and another 20% off the whole order. I scan all of her items and put them in the bag while she scrutinizes the screen on her side. When I get to the coupons, they only take a tiny amount off. When I tell her the total, this happens:

Ornery Lady: Why didn't you use my coupons?! That's way too much! I can't afford that!

Me: I did, but they don't work on things that are already on sale. It took the 40 and 20 off of your non-sale items. They were pretty cheap already, so it only took a few cents off.

OL: That's bullshit! This is totally illegal! It's false advertising! It doesn't say ANYWHERE that I can't use coupons for sale items! Give me my damn discount! I need these! 

Me: I'm sorry, but it does say right here on the coupon that sale items are excluded, and on a very large sign on the loom display itself that no additional coupons or discounts can be used on the loom stuff. And all of this other stuff is already on clearance.

OL: (shouting now) WHAT sign?! There's no sign! This is bullshit! You're trying to steal my money!

I calmly walk five feet over to the display and pick up the bright yellow sign that says ""No additional discounts may be applied to [loom] products"", and hold it up to show her.

 She visibly puffs up and bellows, ""You little bitch! I will NEVER shop here again! I spend a lot of money here! You just lost a VERY important customer!""

She storms out, and my manager runs up to me. She exclaims, ""What on Earth just happened? Are you okay?""

TheLostCaterpillar,23,33,1pyl1v,195,"So I visited my buddy in Wisconsin this past weekend. I got there Friday evening and parked in the parking garage. The weekend was a blast, and I left on Monday morning. That puts me at about 60 hours or so parked in the garage. I wasn't *too* worried about the cost, because my friends had parked on Friday evening as well, and left Sunday morning with a cost of only $15. 

I was expecting nothing more than $30 total for parking. 

What happened is different. I pull up to the exit and push my ticket in the machine. The machine takes a second and ""**bing**: ""One hundred Twenty Seven dollars, zero cents"" a robot voice informs me. 

Schwat? $127 bucks? 

I had no idea what to do, I didn't even *have* that much on my debit card. I couldn't even leave the parking garage at this point, and when I did it would cost me an arm and a leg (compared to my income). 

I called the number for assistance on the exit box (not the little call button but the actual phone number) and a really wisconsin sounding guy answers. I briefly explain my predicament and the next thing I hear is:

""Okay just pull up to the exit there and hit the little help button. I'll open er' up for ya."" 

Surprised and confused I pulled up and hit the help button, and it was like open sesame. The gate just opened and I was home free. 

Two seconds later I get a call from the same number 

""Hey there, did ya make it through? Ah you did, fantashtik! No no, you don't have to come back and pay, just try not to do it again."" 

I then thanked him  a million times again only to be told ""Please sir, if you want me to be happy tell this all to my wife!""

Jinxy_Minx,3,19,1pyeyj,35,"This happened a few years ago when I was around 18(23 now). I had my first retail job after attempting to move in with my then boyfriend (Yay for mistakes).

Anywho, it was pretty much admitted I got the job because my then boyfriends step-mother was a manager, but I also had good references from house/pet sitting/baby sitting. My boyfriend also worked there.

I quickly became an employee who worked their butts off. I was(still am) a fast learner, which quickly moved me up in doing more tasks. There was hardly a task I wouldn't do if it was reasonable.

My boyfriend wasn't exactly lazy but he didn't really 'catch on' to stuff easily. He whined a lot, and only stopped being late when we ended up car pooling because I refused to be late even a minute.

Long story short there started to be talk about them having to cut down since the holidays were ending. Since I was hired on because of the holiday season I was quickly made paranoid, until it was admitted by the higher ups they were considering letting my boyfriend go so they could keep me.

Whoops.

FredFltStn,130,284,1py6ce,755,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  My staff is mainly comprised of teenagers, with the guys working on the sales floor and the girls working the registers. I'm not trying to be sexist, it's just that some of the cases can weigh up to 160 pounds (massive assortment), and I don't want anyone getting hurt.

We've seen people show up to buy fireworks dressed in more ways than you can imagine. From formal attire, to pajamas, to clothing that’s basically underwear. Then again, we are a fireworks tent in a parking lot, so there's pretty much no dress code. I thought I had seen it all. Nope.

She walked into the tent in an outfit that left **NOTHING** to the imagination. She had on a micro skirt and a skin tight top that was basically see-through. I swear to God, a noticeable hush fell over the tent when this girl and her friend walked through the door, enough so that I actually turned around to see what was going on.

One of the guys came over and gave me the scoop. The girls name was Brittany, and she actually went to school with Josh. Oh yeah, she also happens to be a porn star now, acting under the name Brittany Sexton. You are definitely going to want to Google that name.

I don't want to say that the men in my tent were distracted, but I'm pretty sure I could have yelled fire, and none of them would have moved toward the exits. I'll be honest here, I may have been momentarily distracted myself.

I’m pretty sure there were several guys who would have volunteered to carry her on their back while she shopped, so she wouldn’t get tired. In fact, I think the only thing that prevented them from offering, was that every time she bent over, her micro skirt combined with her lack of underwear provided a preview of her next feature film.

One of my cashiers has a boyfriend that also works for me. She grabbed him off the sales floor and yanked him back to the counter so fast, I was concerned he may have gotten whiplash.

Eventually, she and her friend finished shopping and they were ready to check out. I rang her up myself, but it was just a coincidence that I ran to the counter and gave all of my cashiers a break.

I can't remember if I gave her a discount (I did), but I can guarantee that when I offered to make her a partner and give her half the business, it was just a joke (it wasn't).

I think when she was finished; she had two bags of fireworks. It took five guys to carry them out to her car.

Before I begin my story I have to outline a few things about the business I work in.

I work at a gambling shop in New Zealand. My company has a legislated monopoly on sports and racing gambling in New Zealand. As most of you are probably unaware on the first Tuesday every November the Melbourne Cup takes place, one of the richest horse races in the world. That was today.

This is by far the busiest day for us. My store made ~$40k in sales and the one down the road in excess of $100k. We are packed from open to close. The shop also has pokies - gaming machines. 18 of them. The Prime Minister even came to put some bets on as my store is the closest to parliament. To add to that I had an exam this morning, so by the time 3 o'clock rolls around we are flat out and I am exhausted with no end in sight for the next few hours.

This is where we meet our customer Homeless Beggar Dude (HBD). HBD hangs around quite a lot. He's not the sort of person we want in/around the store even though he begs about 20m away from our shop entrance. As such, any time he comes into the shop we have to remind him he can't gamble as he has no I.D.

On this particular occasion he had already come in once that day. He handed me some money and asked me to change it for $2 coins, which are able to be put in the machines. I changed the money, whilst reminding him that he wasn't allowed to gamble with us because we can't verify his age. He looks over 18, but we don't want him around so we're tough in him. After me reminding him the first time he left the store.

About 2 hours later he returns, wearing a beanie and tries to sneak past me into the gaming while I serve as long queue of customers. I, of course, spot him. He's hard to miss.

I call him over and the following exchange ensues.

Me: Hey mate, do you have any I.D on you today?

HBD: Nah man, is it ok if I bring it next time? (this is his go-to line every time)

Me: Sorry man, you know our rules, I can't let you gamble without seeing your I.D

HBD: Oh but bro its ok, other people let me go in

Me: I'm not other people sorry. Its my job on the line if the police catch you

HBD: Nah its ok bro, I'm 26 I can tell you my birthday

Me: You could tell me any date. I'm not letting you go in there without I.D

HBD proceeds to spin a sob story about how the police took his I.D one time he was arrested. I couldn't give 2 fucks.

I ask him politely but firmly to leave the store and he continues to try and convince me otherwise. After the cycle loops a few times my temper begins to fray - its been a long day and is only going to get longer.

Eventually I tell him to leave or we will have our security guards remove him (we don't have any). He finally admits defeat and leaves. He'll be trying to sneak back in tomorrow though, and the next day. Some people never learn.

Yeah_Jordy,189,215,1py1fk,782,"**Background**: I used to work at a discount store, and since there was only a handful of workers, we were jack of all trades; I packed shelves, helped customers, worked the register, everything (including changing lights while they were on because my manager assured me it was perfectly safe).

**Story**: Anyway the night in particular that this story unfolded my manager decided to buy myself and the other worker a thickshake while she went and changed some money. So here I am with my thickshake, packing those personalised number plates onto a rack when I see a customer at the register waiting to be served, so I dash over and begin serving. Now I feel it’s worth mentioning that this store is pretty close to a “junky” area and so we get our fair share of painful customers. This night was no exception.

I went back to packing plates and after a while I realised my thickshake was missing. My manager promptly points out that this tattooed man with a rat’s tail and filthy clothes (sorry for judgemental imagery, I’m still slightly bitter) was slurping on my shake. I confronted him, not quite sure what to say and he got immensely defensive, eventually offering it back to me! I just shook it off and kept working.

Half an hour or so later my manager yells out that someone is in our storeroom (she was behind the counter and had seen it on the CCTV; our storeroom is at the far corner of the store and clearly has an ‘EMPLOYEES ONLY’ plaque on it). I sprinted up towards the back and sure enough as I approached this woman (the kind you can confidently assume to be an addict) is walking out of the storeroom and I see her drop something into her bag. I confront her and she avoids eye contact and tries to busy herself with the nearby shelf.


*Me: What were you doing in there? What is in your bag?*

*Woman: There’s nothing in my bag, I’m just looking.*

*Me: I saw you drop something in your bag, show me what it was.*

*Woman: I ain’t done nothing!*


We went back and forth arguing for a while and I was getting frustrated so I left her and ran back to the storeroom, saw my backpack had been unzipped and sure enough, my iPod was missing. I ran back to the woman who had met up with the shake thief from earlier and handed him my iPod subtly. I saw it in his hands and practically yelled “That’s not yours! Why did you take this?!” as I snatched it back and he yelled in return “I didn’t do nothing!”

The next part is a bit blurry from the adrenaline I was experiencing, but essentially the two junkies refused to explain anything to me. Next thing I knew, a lady pulled me aside and was asking me all these questions and I noticed another 3 were talking to the pair of thieves. This lady told me that she and her 3 friends were plain-clothed policemen/women who just happened to be walking by the shop as my manager screamed out about the woman in the storeroom since there had been reports of thieves in the shopping centre recently. She asked me a bunch of questions and after half an hour or so I got back to work as they kept interrogating the thieves.

As I was working, a male policeman (MP) came up and this is the conversation that unfolded:

*MP: Hey mate, how old are you?*

*Me: 17, I turn 18 in a few weeks.*

*MP: *laughs** *Hah, I thought so!*

*Me: What’s so funny?*

*MP: Well this woman finally admitted to stealing your iPod, but she claims that she only did it to get back at you for hitting on her in the club the other night (In Australia you have to be 18 to go clubbing), I knew she was lying…But you wouldn’t go there would you?*

*Me: (thinking that he meant going clubbing) No I wouldn’t, clubs definitely don’t seem like somewhere I’d like to be at all, even when I am 18.*

*MP: No, I meant her.*


We both had a good laugh about that remark and it made me feel a bit better. The police took down my details and then they escorted the junkies out and gave them a lifetime ban from the shop.

I’d like to say that was the end of it, but 10 minutes later the junky woman returns and just says “I know I’m banned, but when I was out the back I left my phone out there, can I just go get it please? Oh! It looks just like that one!” *she points to my manager’s phone sitting near the register* We politely tell her to get lost and never come back. The nerve of some people!

Since then I’ve had to give an official police statement but haven’t heard much else past that, although I know she got charged. Also my brother’s girlfriend works in a different discount store around the corner and she has had some stories with the same woman too, but that’s for another time.",The night the customer stole from my backpack,997

blackaurora,14,19,1pxgsh,85,"This happened about a month or two ago, but I just thought of it now, so here goes.

A lady comes in wanting an iPhone 5S. She looks familiar, so while I'm retrieving the iPhone, I secretly take a look at our log books. Store policy (at least our store, dunno about others) was that a customer could only purchase one iPhone per person every 30 days. Why? Fraud. We get more than we'd like. There are some people that repeatedly try to come in. The guys at LP know who they are (and so do some of us), and will often call us on the department's phone to tell us not to do the contract. Then we usually pretend our computers went down or something.

Anyway, the log book tells me she bought an iPhone 5S just yesterday. I wasn't sure how to tell her that I know she just bought one, so I make up some excuse to go find a manager in the back. I find one who knows our policy, and explain the situation. He says that in a recent meeting, they decided that as long as the customer has the proper ID, we're supposed to let it go through. Nothing else matters. Not our current policy, or how suspicious they are (several red flags went up with this woman), or even if we recognize the person as being fraud.

He even says, ""It probably is fraud. But we have to do it anyway."" I ask why they changed the policy - don't get much of an answer. So I go and do the contract. Or try to, anyway. Luckily, the system rejected it, forcing me to call the carrier, where they told me they can't let it go through (forgot why). I mentioned her to some of my coworkers the next day, and they confirmed that she was known to be fraud.

So basically, if AT&amp;T hadn't stopped it - and they rarely do - we'd have been screwed. I'd really like to know what geniuses came up with this new policy.","""It probably is fraud. But we have to do it anyway.""",104

It's late in the afternoon and a lady and her friend come in. She wants to do an exchange. She has a pair of designer jeans she purchased on sale for 19 dollars and some change. Initially she wanted to do an even exchange for a different size. We don't have her size. As usual. So she says... ""that's ridiculous, then I want another pair of jeans for the same price."" I reply, we only do even exchanges on items that are the same style. She picks up a pair of 89 dollar jeans and says, ""I want these for 19."" I kindly told her, ""Ma'am, that's not our policy. It is out of my control."" Honestly, it wasn't. I have the ability to change prices at my discretion, but this price difference was too large and this woman was trying to play the system. So she says, ""Well, then I'm just going to return them."" I start the return. She begins to explain that she used a $20 off coupon and now she wants her money back for her coupon. At first I thought she meant she wanted her coupon back. I let her know that coupons are only eligible for one purchase and cannot be given back.

jinbaittai,9,16,1px3nf,83,"I work as a dog groomer, and have a pretty regular clientele.  One of my customers (C) has two dogs that she keeps with long hair.  She's pretty fussy about their appearance, which I'm fine with, but she's also kind of petty and passive-aggressive if you make a mistake.  

For example, one time I accidentally trimmed the eyelashes on one eye too short - the dog blinked at the wrong second, and they were a quarter of an inch shorter than the customer prefers, forcing me to trim the other eyelashes just a bit shorter so they matched.  Not a huge deal normally, but ever since then she's made a big point of ""reminding"" me not to cut the eyelashes too short.  

But she brings her dogs back at least once a month each, if not more often, and I usually have no problem squeezing her in last minute.  So she likes me, for the most part.  

Anyhow, for the past week I've been pretty sick, which has led to me losing my voice (pretty much a whisper), and a major sinus headache.  Today I had three dogs booked for grooming sessions, one of whom was Willie (a major barker) and Mika (who was 70 pounds).  The other was C, bringing just one of her dogs.

Well, C showed up twenty minutes late without bothering to call me.  Mika had been dropped off early, and I was in the middle of working on her.  Willie was in a kennel and  barking his fool head off, as per usual, and there were two dryers running at the same time - it was very loud and chaotic.  Always great for a headache, right?

As I mentioned, my voice is almost entirely gone.  I went to go chat with C to confirm what she wanted done for the day.  I told her, in my pathetic whisper-voice, that I would have to finish what I was doing with Mika before I could start on her dog, and that I would need extra time with her dog.  My final question was:  ""Can you come back for your dog at 1:30?""

Out of nowhere she gets upset.  ""1:30?!""  

I was confused, so whisper-said, ""Yes, I know it's longer than normal, but I'm slow thanks to being sick, and I have to start him later.  So I need him until 1:30.""  

At this point, she literally stamps her foot, and says in a huffy voice, ""Oh, just CANCEL it then!""  And then storms away, taking the dog with her.  

I stood there for a minute, and then shrugged and got back to work.  I was feeling like garbage, and I didn't have the energy to chase her down and see what the hell was going on.  A couple minutes later, my manager came back to the grooming room.  ""So, why'd you ask C to come back at 1:30?""  I said, ""To pick her dog up?""  

Well, apparently C thought I wanted her to take her dog home and bring it back at 1:30.  And instead of making sure she didn't hear my pathetic whisper incorrectly in all the chaos, she freaked out and left, bitching out my manager on her way.  She hadn't waited for my manager to come chat with me either, she'd stomped out of the door.  My manager and I shared a head shake, and carried on with our days.

Later that day, C called to complain again.  Apparently, once my manager explained that I had intended to keep the dog for longer than normal, not that I wanted her to return the dog to me later, she changed her tone, and begged to bring the dog back that day.

In a fit of pettiness, I said no.  I was too tired (actually wound up in the doctor's office an hour later to get antibiotics).  She re-booked for later this week, and apologized profusely.

RedRing14,45,80,1px2uj,379,"Hello again TFR.  I'm sorry I missed you over the weekend and by doing that I might have upset some people I promised a theft story to.  So today I rectify that with the theft story that was promised.

This one just as the other 2 I am working at the game store that I loved.  

Let us first set up the fun fact of at this time the store wasn't as staffed as it should have been for the holidays.  I didn't like hiring holiday workers because they just didn't seem to work out well and it wasn't fair to them in some ways but that's neither here nor there.  Now the downside to that was that it caused me to work at lot more.  

For about 3 months I worked everyday and a lot (most of) those days I pulled open to close shifts so that my guys had cover.  I didn't mind the shifts at all though as it was a blast.  If you love your job you never work a day in your life.  I loved being there and even worked whenever I went home trying to find things to make the store better.  However eventually it does begin to wear on you.

So we fast forward to January and I'm going to have my first day off since October.  My guys knew that I was not to be bothered unless the world was going to collapse into a black hole.  I close down the shop for the last day of my stretch getting out of there at around 10:30.  I locked the store up and went home getting ready to lay in my bed and not get up for a long time as I put my day back as being a late close shift.  Get home at around 11 and fall asleep by 11:30 which normally I cant do.  

Suddenly at around 3 am I am woke up by my phone.  I recognize the number as the district manager.  I answer the phone and know its going to be something I will hate hearing.  He informs me that someone has broken into the store and the police need someone to come down and of course that meant me.  I get dressed and go to the store using very colorful language to the nice person who broke in.

The guy managed to steal a bunch of games, consoles, movies, and snacks from the store and rental place connected to it.  He completely destroyed the store in the process of it to.  You would have thought a bunch of frightened dear had been let loose in there.  The nice thing was that he also decided to bleed all over the store because he cut his stomach pretty bad on the top of the fence that separated our stores.  I stood around as the police did their final sweep and answered a bunch of super fun questions from the officer then went home and fell asleep probably around 4:30.

The next morning at 10 I get a frantic call from my opener saying someone broke in.  Apparently he didn't get my text message or anything.  Told him we already knew and he went on to continue working.  Noon rolls around and my dm calls to let me know they didn't get anything that was really useful but the guy who robbed us also robbed the grocery store near by for alcohol and ace bandages.  

Fast forward a week and we have decided we were just sol when it came to the merchandise.  While doing some video editing on my laptop for a promo video I hear a ruckus outside the store.  I look out and a woman who is probably in her late 50's, 5'4, and maybe 120 pounds is screaming at the car.  Suddenly she goes to the passenger door and rips it open to yell at the guy in the seat.  She yanks her 17 year old, 6'2, 250lb son out of the car by the ear and drags him into the store.  We will call her AM for angry mom. He will go by T for thief.  I will be playing the role of myself and my costar will be OSM for other store manager.

AM: Well get on with it lets get this done.

T: No mom please (through tears)

AM: You made a mans decision now be a man!

T: I'm so sorry mom I love you.

Me: Mam can I...

T: I'M SORRY I STOLE FROM YOU GUYS!

Me: Um....

AM: Boy you better do better than that!

T: It was me I robbed you guys. I'm so so sorry.  Please don't call the cops.  I'm really sorry.  You can have the games back I brought them. 

(He had a trashbag of our stuff but at this point I'm trying not to laugh)

OSM: We have to call the police.

T: OH GOD NO!  MOM PLEASE HELP!

AM: No.  You decided to do this so you will face the consequences.

He continued to beg as we dialed 911.  He tried to get up and move towards the door but his mom got in the way of him and smacked him until he crumpled.  The cops came and arrested him.  When they entered the mom turned over the gun he used to rob the grocery store.

Mechanikal,24,55,1px2km,236,"Took my little boy to one of those indoor bouncy castle places like I normally do every Saturday. Since it was raining it was packed to the tits. I was at the counter to get him a drink and a sack of fat was yelling at the manager because her infant daughter had almost fallen off of a little coin operated ride ride like the ones you see outside of grocery stores. Just 2 little cartoon horses that go in a small circle. She was giving the mgr seven shades of shit how there should be a sign and what not. 

When you start the ride up a LOUD recording goes off saying you shouldn't leave the child unattended. There is a sign on the wall saying the same thing. I (louder than I realized) said something like 'open your fucking eyes, there is a sign'. The dumbass turns around and asks what the fuck I'd I just say? I was hung over and not in the mood for BS. I tell her ""the ride tells you to watch the kid, and the sign says the same thing. Your daughter isn't old enough or strong enough to hold her self on there"" (she was less than a year old). Confronted with sound logic, she panics and gets louder to save face. She is livid and starts yelling at me to mind my own fucking business and goes back to yelling at the poor manager who just apologizes. After a few more seconds, she grabs her kid and leaves.

wootitsathrowaway,27,25,1pwxv8,115,"**Background:**

I work at a ""fancy"" grocery store as a cashier.  

**Story:** 

This past Friday, I had a job interview for a baking job.  I've been struggling to get an entry-level baking job ever since I graduated from baking school almost 4 years ago due to lack of experience in the field.  Apparently I totally nailed the interview, because the manager told me during the interview that he would probably pick me-- and a half hour after my interview was over, he emailed me to inform me that I got the job.  I got called into work a couple of hours later to cover a courtesy clerk shift, but I was flying so high on the knowledge that I had achieved a goal of 4 years that I was smiling ear to ear.  (I'm very shy, so normally going to my job and having to deal with a bunch of people that I don't know and could potentially explode at me at any moment twists my stomach into knots).  So anyway, I waltz into work with a silly smile slapped on my face.

A couple of hours into work, it's pretty busy, and I hurry over to finish up bagging groceries for the front end manager (FEM), who is cashiering.  The tall, grey-haired man (let's call him TGC for ""Tall Gentleman Cowboy) FEM was helping had a deep, slow drawl that immediately drew my attention.  He looked to be in about his 60's.  Something about him seemed familiar, but I couldn't quite grasp what it was.  I finished bagging the groceries for him and set them in the cart as FEM is cheerfully telling him about what employees in the store had dressed as yesterday for Halloween.  

**FEM:** And wootitsathrowaway here was dressed as a fairy, with wings and everything!

**TGC:** Well I wish I could have seen that!

**FEM:** She was pretty adorable!

**TGC:** She's pretty adorable even without the fairy wings.  

I giggled at that and blushed quite a bit (as I've said, I'm pretty shy).  FEM finished up the transaction, and when TGC was almost out of the door, we realized he'd left his wallet sitting on the counter.  

""Aw, shoot!""

I grabbed his wallet and hurried after him, saying ""Sir?  Sir?""
He turned, saw me holding the wallet and said, ""Oh, well I need that, don't I?"" A slow, warm smile spread across his face.  

""Yep!"" I squeaked, before flashing a bright smile, waving, and heading back to my destiny of bagging groceries until I dropped.  

When I got back to FEM's check stand, she said, ""You know that was Sam Elliott, right?""
(For those who don't know, this is Sam Elliott: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000385/)

My eyes widened.  THAT is why he'd seemd familiar.  I'd heard that he occasionally came in when he was in town (I guess he has a house in the area).  

TL;DR - Sam Elliott is just about as nice and charming as can be.

Thehealeroftri,15,35,1pwrjv,145,"So yesterday at the place where I work we were out of almost everything.  No trucks have come in for 3 days that bring produce (which is the department I work in) and me and my coworkers have had no choice but to deal with it.  We've been out of most things for the past few days...but that's another story.

One of the things we were out of is Jalapeno peppers.  Yesterday we had just put out our remaining case of jalapeno peppers and as usual the peppers were mostly gone within 3 hours.

About an hour before I was set to clock out (About 9 PM) a lady comes in and walks up to the jalapeno display.

Now, the displays are set so that some displays rest on other ones.  The jalapeno display held up the red pepper display so if the jalapeno display was removed the red peppers would fall down.

Anyways... this lady asked if we had any more jalapeno peppers other than the few that were out then.   I politely told her that we did not have any more jalapeno peppers in stock.

She then gave me a look that said, ""I don't believe you."" 

I don't know what caused her to be this fucking stupid but after she gave me the look she attempted to lift the jalapeno pepper display to see if there were anymore underneath the display.

Of course based on our set up this caused the red peppers above the jalapenos to come crashing down spilling red peppers all over the floor.  

There were no jalapeno peppers under the display.

Knowing she had done something wrong she looked at me then walked quickly out of the area leaving me to clean up her mess.

Taelzos,14,7,1pwp2z,49,"Backstory - I was working for a popular Canadian fast food chain that doesn't have as many restaurants thrown everywhere as the other chains, thus we get a lot of customers to each particular store and a lot of regulars. I was there for four and a half years pending my graduation from college as the closing shift grillmaster (loltitles) for 90% of the time, but sometimes I would also close front of house.

This so happens to be another day that I'm closing the front of house rather than the kitchen (the drama always happens at front of house, obviously). This particular day we had a very hard working mother closing the kitchen, myself closing front of house, our supervisor to do the end-of-day buggery and the daughter of said mother taking the place of the extra slot we keep one hour until closing to help us tidy up and get things done in time.

I don't remember words exactly, but I'll so my best to transcribe. Usually I'm against putting transcriptions in my stories but this takes the cake.

We had one customer up front, whom I was serving and there is an argument in the back between the three remaining co-workers. I'm am -not- happy about this as I am doing every part of this transaction, which isn't a big deal because I know every part of this restaurant from its floor tiles to its greasy kitchen roofing - it bugs me because they're jerking off in the back having a spit while there's a customer in-house and in hearing range.

The 'conversation' went something like this:

Supervisor (S): Why don't you see that I'm better than you?!

Daughter (D): That's not fair, if I had spent as much time here as you I could very well be a supervisor as well

S: No way - I am a supervisor and that clearly makes me better than you in every way

Mother (M): Why are you so angry at us? We did nothing to provoke you in any way

S: She thinks she is better than me!

D: You think that being a supervisor makes you immediately superior than us and treat us the same way - you're impossible to work with

S: I have to tell you what to do at every turn, you obviously can't think for yourself

At this point I looked up from what I was doing to face the customer, asked him to excuse me for a moment, and took a waltz to the kitchen. Didn't want to miss out on the fun, you see.

Me: Alright that's enough. We have a customer out front right this moment who is hearing every word of this. Are you -all- children or just acting like you are?

S: Exactly! That is what I'm saying.

Me: Shut up S. You're being an arrogant and defensive twit to the point of stupidity. I was including you in that statement.

S: Excuse me?

Me: No. All of you clear out, take a walk and clear your heads, and get back to closing the restaurant and serving the customers. 

Queue myself returning to the customer, after making sure they all walked away from one another. I was exasperated to the point where I just took a moment to stare at the ceiling for a moment before returning to finishing the customers order. They took it fairly well and weren't put off by the delay in serve time.

D quit soon after but the mother stayed and worked for a long while after. We worked together quite often and were good friends. I was also friends with S but I know he is too defensive for his own good, even to customers. I've let him know his shortcoming in that regard before casually and politely and he acknowledges it and such, so we have that at least.

S knows me well enough and took my comments at face value, after work we had a cigarette together and went home. Back to normal the next day.

cegolden,54,68,1pwnl6,295,"I work for as an assistant manager for a sneaker store and I love my job. Or at least I though I did until my manager and I had a shift together. Along with retail I run my own business but don't like to mix the two together for obvious reasons.

Regina and I were just talking about our lives and catching up on because we used to be employees for the same sporting goods store. I mentioned in passing during our conversation my own business that I had really taken the time to establish since we last saw each other and didn't go into any more details. As soon as I finished speaking she immediately dove in to how she owned her own company selling beauty products, energy drinks and supplements. It sounded weird to me and she handed me a business card on cheap Vista Print cards and I instantly knew it was for Amway. 

I went back to my section laughing to myself about how ignorant and wide eyed with excitement she obviously was, even pitching me the prospect of the entire business almost attempting to recruit me but I think she knows I'm not stupid.

After that I night I had found out she was recruiting other employees in the mall we work in and she was recruiting my own associates on company time. We found out three Amway representatives came in within one week to ask one of the sales leads to join Amway after he initially turned down Regina. One night when I was ringing out a customer during closing after the sale she gave them both her business cards and told them if they ever wanted to make money, call her and they'll set up a meeting.

Now here's where the unethical comes in. She's been going through the hiring process for seasonal workers. I was listening to the interview because he'd be my employee as well. She started asking him questions about him being able to make individual sales goals. That struck me as odd because at my company it isn't ever about individual goals, it's only about team goals. When she escorted him out, she came to the back giddy that she had just asked him questions to interview him for Amway and recruited him for her ""company"".

Now I can't help but think she's using our new application manager which lists potential candidates names, phone numbers and emails along with their resumes. She can be using them as potential recruits for her scam. 

No one wants me to go to HR and report her.

blarglznoflo,24,7,1pwmru,50,"I had a customer come through my grocery store cashier line with her basket of items. As soon as she starts putting stuff on the belt, even before answering my ""Hi!"", she immediately says, ""I need to speak with your manager.""

Every time I hear that from a customer, I don't ask any questions or argue in any way, I just do exactly what they say and page a manager to the front for customer assistance. The store manager that evening comes up to my line, and that's when it got fun.

C: (interrupting him) Why can't he use a mop?

M: Um, no, ma'am, it's that the vent is continuously leaking water, and it's going to for about an hour. He'd be sitting there mopping constantly for an hour. The paper towels are the best way to--

C: Then if it's not a broken pipe, a mop will work just fine. You're wasting trees.

M: Ma'am, we can't have one of our sackers just stand in the aisle for an hour mopping up a slow leak. We need him doing other jobs.

C: And that's more important than the *Earth*?

M: Look, ma'am, if you have a better idea, I'm open to hearing it, but for now we can't sacrifice him for that long and this is our best solution.

C: You should be mopping it.

M: Ok, well I need to get back to work, but I'll remember that and see if we can figure out another solution. (and he walks away)

Taelzos,19,39,1pwj2p,156,"'Allo TFR. First time posting in this particular subrebbit but I have a post or two in TFTS as that is where I work now.

Backstory - I was working for a popular Canadian fast food chain that doesn't have as many restaurants thrown everywhere as the other chains, thus we get a lot of customers to each particular store and a lot of regulars. I was there for four and a half years pending my graduation from college as the closing shift grillmaster (loltitles) for 90% of the time, but sometimes I would also close front of house.

This particular time I was working front of house closing shift on a Sunday, which is usually the slowest time of the week for us. It was fairly late and there was only one customer at the time, so we were chatting away as I filled out their order and garnished their hamburger for them. 

The customer happened to order a bottle of orange juice with his order instead of a fountain drink, which is what springs this little story. The company bigwigs has recently decided to slice the size of our bottled juices (Apple and orange) to approximately 50% of their original size and lower the price by a whopping 20 cents. This sort of thing doesn't sit well with me, as I am the type of person who has pride in their work and always put in their best effort regardless of what 'society' likes to think - so this little gimmick of theirs was on my mind recently. The customer was not a small gentleman, and when I gave him the bottled juice with his order, he gives it a kind of sad, bemused look and drains it in one gulp. That man just paid $2.30 canadian for a single slug of orange juice.

I grabbed another from our convenient little fridge located at the front of house and slapped it on his tray, telling him to just take it.

The gentleman reaches into his pocket to try and take out his wallet to pay for the additional bottle, but I refuse and explain to him the recent change they made to gouge customers and what I thought of it. We had a quick discussion about it, about 30 seconds because his meal was ready and I let him sit down and enjoy his food.

Later on, I browse out to the sitting area to wipe down his table and retrieve his tray.

And there on the table, is the second empty bottle of orange juice, sitting smugly atop a $20 bill laid out on the table.

Glorious.

thisiswhyihatemyjob,14,6,1pwiqn,22,"This happened at the beginning of October. I had worked the closing shift and was getting ready to go home. I turned in my cash bags, gathered up my belongings, and headed downstairs to the door to leave.

I was the first to make it down there. All of my other co workers were still upstairs. I get to the door, but I'm stopped by our LP woman, N.

N: I have to search you before you leave.

Now, I find this weird, but I'm not too bothered by it because I figure it makes sense. I work in retail and sometimes people DO steal so I wasn't going to argue with her or anything.

Me: Oh, okay. How come you have to search me?

I honestly was just curious. Like I said, I wasn't going to fight her. First off, I didn't mind and secondly, if I did fight.. suspicious much? Well, N flipped her shit.

N: You want to know why? Well, well, because I can! I'm allowed! I can do this!

Me: Okay. Um, I was just asking.

N: I can do this! I can!

She goes on and on. She then tells me to put my purse on the counter and take everything out of it. She has me line up everything so she can go through it all. Just then the elevator opens and people start to come out.

N: Okay, put everything back in. I'm done. Hurry up.

Confused, I quickly put everything in my purse. She also tells me she has plans to search everyone. My co workers get to the counter and she PEEKS into their purses and says 'Okay, you guys are good. Have a nice night.' Some people she doesn't search at all! I was livid at that point. My co worker, T, drives me home that night and I tell her what happened. She is in disbelief.

A few weeks after that, N ends up getting transferred to another store. My co worker, P, who I also told tells me it's because our Store Manger, J, found out about what N did and they fought about it. I also was told by other people who I never told was that J wasn't mad about what happened to me, but that I could possibly get them in trouble. That hurt my feelings a lot, but I wasn't surprised. N  supposedly also admitted to J that her search was racially motivated because I'm of mixed race.

I don't know if all of that is true, but I do know that is why she was transferred and I know I didn't get an apology or anything like that. I did try to get a hold of HR, but was not able to. The more shit that happens to me at work makes me want to try to talk to someone again because it's like they don't even see me as a person there.

My question for this part of my story is, is it too late to file a report? Should I have another job lined up first? I also now realize N knew what she did was wrong because of how she rushed me when other people came around. If she was going to search me, she should have searched everyone else the same exact way.

He says nothing. He looks nowhere. He just looks at the case.

I wait.

He continues looking.

At least a full minute later, he walks away without a word. FUCK YOU, TOO.

""Oh, I didn't get it here, I just figured you'd know how to cook it.""

No, I don't. We do not nor have we ever sold those. I do not know The cooking instructions for products I've never encountered in my life before. Maybe ask the person you bought it from...? 

**Ham Jackass:**

Guy wants two hams sliced. NO- not sliced- *Shaved*. This means either *as thin as humanly possible* without falling apart, or *even thinner and falling apart.*. Either way, it. takes. an eternity. And is a toll on your arm and a huge waste of time.

Took 15 minutes to do both hams. It takes that long.

The whole time I just have this feeling like he's not gonna say anything when I give them to him. I hand him the hams and tell him ""There you go, need anything else?"" and he takes them and turns around to his friends and their cart.

Fuck that. ""You're welcome!"". Hopefully he felt like a jackass after I told him you're welcome. What's he gonna do? Say ""I didn't say thank you""? Or complain to a manager that I said he was welcome?

Old guy rolls up on an amigo. Those two things combined mean I'm about to deal with a complete fucking idiot who thinks he's king of everything. He asks when I'm gonna have fresh oysters available. The fresh seafood is ordered from a little book of UPC codes- if it isn't there, I can't order it. I tell him Id on't think I have ANY shellfish in the book and I check- I do not. That means there's no way for me to get them, either out of season or just plain discontinued.

I had a very odd thing happen to me the other day and I wanted to share. 

For some background, I work at a shoe store as a sales lead. I'm Asian... don't worry this becomes relevant. 

It was a Saturday afternoon and the store was pretty busy. Lots of traffic and not enough employees. You know how it goes sometimes. I'm running back and forth from the cash registers to the sales floors to the stock room. 
People seem to come and go pretty quickly. Nobody really made an impression except for this one lady. 
She comes up to the cash while I'm putting a customer through and says ""You are so pretty!"". 
I'm pretty awkward when it comes to compliments but I say thanks and laugh nervously. 
She then proceeds to say ""You girls are always so cute and I've always wanted to adopt one of you!""
Her tone of voice was almost as if she was expressing her wants for a specific pet...

The first one happened about a week ago. I'm putting my own food together and handing it out the Window. We're fairly slow, so the drive-thru isn't backed up at all. I bag this lady's food, and as I'm walking to the window, I watch her pull up. After giving her the food, she asks, ""Since I had to wait so long, do I get a free cup of coffee?"" 
""No, I'm sorry, I can't give you a free cup of coffee, ma'am.""
""Why not?""
""Well, I just watched you pull up and you waited no longer than 10 seconds for me to give you your food.""
She then gives me the look of satan and says, ""Wow. You are so rude."" And drives away.

This next lady blew my mind. 
She orders her food, a meal and some apple pies. She says she wants the pies fresh.
""Ma'am, just so you know, the apple pies take 13 minutes to cook.""
""Oh, that's fine. I don't mind waiting.""

Troubleyes,48,45,1pvs6e,137,"I worked in a large clothing store attached to a mall. Fun job: managers were friendly (not the store manager, she wasn't friendly), and most of us had a good time. 

A year ago this new manager was hired to replace the mens department manager. She was young and very, very attractive. Since I was an ""unofficial manager"" (I was there for a long time), I was given the job of helping her. Emily and I we spent a lot of time together, and we grew close. We started dating about a month later.

big mistake. Once I really got to know her, I instantly regretted ever dating her. She was clingy, and emotionally immature and our love life was horrible.

About 7 months into the relation I began to seriously question it, I wanted out, I didn't enjoy it. I go into work one day and everyone is patting me on the back and congratulating me. Apparently Emily told everyone I proposed to her. It's over, that was the last straw.

I confronted her after work, and basically gave her the heads up it was over. I tell her ""lets just keep everything professional, please"", but, she breaks down in tears and tells me she'll never forgive me and I'll regret what I just did.

After that moment my life at that store became a living hell. She did everything in her power to screw me, to make me look bad and finally she got me fired. Apparently I was ""stealing time"", by taking an extended break. She was making a log and sent it to the store manager.

There was a brief 6 months of my life where I was simultaneously employed in a ladies clothing shop during the day, and a nightclub by night. I rarely slept, and being a glutton for responsibility, I found myself working full days in that bloody shop working for a hellish boss on a zero hour contract.

The shop in question is owned by a huge UK company with specific rules, but being in a fairly backwards small town, interpretation of the rules was highly creative.

One day, a woman walks in with a dress with a tear in the seam (our first red flag) and no receipt (our second), saying the dress is faulty and wants a refund. Shockingly, our policy is no refund without a receipt, which she was not thrilled to hear. My repeated insistences and her refusal to accept the exchange or store credit the rules dictated ended in a summoning of the manager from hell. She entertained this woman's story, making me call the original branch where it was claimed the dress was bought.

At midday on a busy Saturday, this did not go down well with the other branch. They had to search their entire transaction history for a dress in that size, and there was nothing that matched it entirely. The conversation went as follows:

Me: She says she bought only that, and paid in cash, around 4pm last Saturday

Other branch: The only dress in that size was bought around 10am, and they also bought a bracelet. We have had a number of that item shoplifted recently though

I took my manager to one side to tell her this, who then in a ridiculous display of idiocy, walked up to the woman and told her exactly that, to which of course the woman replied:

""Oh yes I forgot! I bought a bracelet too, and I must have got the time wrong!"".

The manager from hell then proceeds to give her a full cash refund, flagrantly disregarding store policy, all whilst I stood there incredulous whilst having to listen to the woman complain about how uninformed and inept I was.

FredFltStn,204,383,1pvl00,1031,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  As you can imagine, we get a wide range of customers in my fireworks store. One of my top priorities is customer service. That priority goes away when you start acting like a creeper.

Most of my staff are teenagers, and most of them got the job because I'm friends with their parents. In general, I have a staff of teenage girls who work the registers, and guys who work out on the sales floor moving boxes, stocking shelves, and doing sales. I tend to spend most of my time on the floor talking to customers and selling fireworks.

Occasionally, the girls behind the counter get hit on. Pretty sure that happens almost everywhere. What happens even more often, is that the teenage guys who work for me hit on girls that come into the store. I’ve had to step in a few times, mostly when the guys start following around some girl like a puppy dog instead of working, but overall, we don’t have very many issues.

One evening, one of my cashiers grabbed me and pulled me aside to talk to me. There was an older gentleman who had been hanging around the counter and made a few inappropriate comments to one of the cashiers, and she was getting uncomfortable. I walked back to the counter to see if I could help.

I walked up and pleasantly asked the guy if he needed any help. He was casually dressed and looked to be in his mid-50’s I would guess. He told me that he was just about finished shopping, and said he didn’t need any help. I hung out near him at the counter, hoping that he would get the message.

Apparently he did, and he started to put his stuff up on the counter for the cashier to ring him out. I stayed until she was finished ringing in his stuff. She gave him the total, and I started to walk away to help another customer. I was probably about 5 feet away when I heard him ask, “How much to see those tits?”

I called over to two of the guys on the floor, and then stepped in front of the creeper.

My staff and I carefully escorted the gentlemen out and helped him into his car. I also explained to him that he was no longer welcome at my store. That’s my story, and I’m pretty sure my staff will tell you the same thing.

Ali812,1,6,1pvk5b,12,"(WARNING: long story ahead) Long time reader, first time poster. Figured this story was worth sharing as this is the first time I've lost my patience with a customer.

Background: I work as a customer service supervisor in one fo the largest grocery store chains in good ol' Canada. I'm essentially the person in charge of all of customer service and the cashiers and am responsible for closing the store at the end of the night. Part of my responsibilities include dealing with customers where my employees are unsure of a resolution or unable to resolve an issue without authorization from a supervisor/manager.

So this particular story takes place just a mere 2 days ago. One of my coworkers who was running the self-scan machines that most people love to hate. A customer had requested $40 cash-back (in case anyone is unaware: cash-back is adding a specific amount to your total charged on your bank card that you get back in the form of cash) at the end of her order, at a usual register with a cashier it is the cashier's responsibility to hand over the cash to the customer. However, with the self-scan machines, the money is automatically dispensed and it is solely the customer's responsibility to collect the money the opted voluntarily to withdraw.

The initial thing I was told over the phone by my coworker before I went to speak with the customer was that the customer asked for $40 cashback but she forgot to take her money. This happens quite often, customers are human after all, I don't blame people who forget their money behind but at times we can't do much about it. The usual procedure is that I take down the customer's name and number along with any relevant information about the transaction (time, date, amount, which register was used, etc.), then the cash office staff in the morning will check to see if the store still has it or if the next customer in line saw free money lying around and pocketed it themselves (at which point we can't really do anything).

So I make my over and start talking to the customer (we'll call her RAB for rude ass bitch). Anyways, CAB makes the claim that she took her cashback out but the machine never dispensed the cash and she said the machine was slow during her entire transaction. No biggie, I open up the machine to see if her cash was stuck somewhere in the middle, no dice. So I run diagnostics on the machine to see if the dispenser if working properly, it's working fine so now I'm getting a bit skeptical, the fact that she could have taken the $40 and is now trying to get another extra  $40. At this point I've done all I can, my hands are tied. So I had to explain her the situation.

Me: Alright ma'am, your money isn't in the machine and the dispenser is working fine so I can't confirm if the money is still in the machine or not.

RAB: What?! No, I'm telling you, the machine never spit out the money, and it is your coworker's job to make sure I have my money and sign off on my receipt! You people aren't doing your jobs correctly! (Not the first time one of my employees has been blamed for attempting to steal the customer's money, at this point I knew resolving this wouldn't be easy).

Me: I understand ma'am, I'm not saying I don't believe you  but at this point there's nothing I can really do. We don't sign off on your receipts at self-scan stations there is no cashier handing you the money, the money you take out is 100% in your control so it is solely the customer's responsibility. I can take your information down and they can check things over tomorrow morning and if your money is here you will be getting it for sure.

RAB: NO, I NEED THIS MONEY NOW FOR MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY (she was holding her 2 year old in her arms the entire time), JUST GIVE IT TO ME, BOTH YOU OF YOU GUYS ARE LYING AND TRYING TO TAKE MY MONEY, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE SURE I GET MY MONEY AND SIGN MY RECEIPT, THIS IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE!

At this point her child starts crying because her mother is yelling at me, she's pretty much making a scene and all eyes are on us.

Me: Ma'am I understand your frustration and I really wish there was an immediate solution. That way you'd have your money and we could continue on with our other tasks. I guarantee you neither of us are trying to steal from you, we wouldn't want to as the risks of getting fired are way too high to even think about attempting something like that.

RAB: LISTEN I DON'T CARE, I KNOW YOU HAVE MY MONEY JUST GIVE IT TO ME. YOU TERRORISTS AND CHINKS (I'm South Asian and my coworker is Oriental Asian) ARE NOTHING BUT BAD NEWS TRYING TO RUIN CANADA'S IMAGE. YOU'RE TOO CHEAP TO MAKE AN HONEST LIVING SO YOU'RE LYING TO MY FACE TO TAKE MY MONEY. I'M A REGULAR HERE SO I KNOW I'M TELLING THE TRUTH (I've been working in the store for 3 years, this is my first time seeing her)

At this point, I've had enough, she's louder than ever, her husband doesn't seem interested in calming her down, so I lose my patience as well.

Me: Ma'am, you're going to have to calm down, you're causing a scene, I can't help you if you're going to be yelling the entire time, and I definitely do not appreciate the remarks and allegations towards my coworker and myself, being a ""regular"" does not give you the authority to make racist remarks and accuse us of theft. You'll have to be a bit more rational if you want a resolution.

RAB: EXCUSE ME?! I AM THE CUSTOMER, YOU ARE THE EMPLOYEE, DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT! YOU'RE WORTHLESS AND I DON'T LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE!

Me: With this attitude, you're not getting any help either. I'm contacting my manager she can deal with you from here on out, like I said, my hands are tied, if I could do anything I would.

At this point, I page the manager on duty to my location and walk away in complete frustration and just pure rage that I've never felt before. The manager dealt with the customer, took down her info so the morning staff could check to see if we had her money and check the cameras to see if she actually took her money and tried to harass us for another extra $40. I don't know what ended up happening in the end, but I really hope she didn't get her money.

TL;DR customer claims self-scan machine did not give her the $40 she asked for, I tell her nothing can be done until tomorrow. She doesn't like what she hears so she makes a scene, makes racist comments and harasses me and my employee hoping to get her money right away. We both yell at each other and stuff.","No ma'am, you don't get to have the right to berate me or my employees.",18

Jpr0x0rz,16,24,1pv4ex,157,"**This is the story of my favorite entitled customer experience.**

I work in a shiny electronic store with much coveted shiny things. Half of the premises is for Sales and the other half is for Support. Currently we have one person stationed to the check-in area who is relieved of duty every two hours or so, it is their job to determine where we have extra space in the day to book people for appointments. I told you that to tell you this. 

So I am currently said check-in person, our store, which gets a lot of traffic anyway, is utterly packed with people, courtesy of the launch of some new products and operating systems. I have no appointment space left, and have thus been turning every person away, with a polite explanation that I did not physically have a technician to help them, and there was no more walk-in space available. Enter grumpy middle-class white guy, (My favorite type of customer, because they cannot conceive that money does not in fact, buy everything) now know as GMCWG.

&gt;Me: Hello sir, are you checking in for an appointment.

&gt;GMCWG: The person at the front sent me to you, I drove 35 miles to get here.

(This is an answer we get a lot, people feel the need to tell us that came some ridiculous ways away. The amount of miles they drove is never far enough away for them to have, say, call ahead first.)

&gt;Me: Yes sir, we're happy to help you. As it turns out, we are out of reservations today, so if we don't already have one for you, I'll be happy to make you one for tomorrow morning.

&gt;GMCWG: You've made a lot of people unhappy. My computer is broken and someone is going to look at it now.

&gt;Me: I understand the frustration, again, I don't physically have a technician for you. 

&gt;GMCWG: This is ridiculous. Do you just expect me to walk away? I want help! I drove 35 miles!!

After much grumbling, and similar arguments, a little flustered, I persuaded one of our ""Trainers"" that were suddenly free, to try and help this guy out. He was still yelling and had sat himself at a table to yell to tell anyone who would listen about our terrible customer service.

&gt;Me: Good news sir, I have [PERSON] here to assist you, if it comes down to a repair, we may still have to go through our technicians, but maybe if its something smaller, we can try to help you now. 

The dear sweet, wonderful trainer introduced himself, and asked the customer if he could take the computer he wanted repaired out.

&gt;GMCWG: WELL I DIDN'T BRING IT! just tell me how to fix it.

And then I laughed out loud, he called a manager on me, and I excused myself to take a 15 minute break, because the audacity was too much. Just too much.

joshl22393,18,12,1pv0ee,97,"Sup TFR, Long time lurker, first time poster. This happened a few days ago and thought I should share this one.

So I work in the deli department of a large supermarket chain in Australia, situated in a pretty low socioeconomic area, quite a lot of sketchy looking people. 

So I'm working the close shift one night and about 25 minutes before we close/I go home, I hear someone whistling at me (so I'm already annoyed, because people whistling at me pisses me off). So I go to serve the irate chicken douche, or ICD as I shall call him. 

**ME:** Hi, what can I help you with?

**ICD:** Yeah can I get a cooked chicken?
(You would think the chicken warmer being turned off would be the first indication)

**ME:** I'm sorry, we have had a busy night and have sold out, I can give you a voucher for one and you can get it a bit cheaper next time.

**ICD:**No thanks, I just want one for dinner.

**ME:** Well I'm sorry there isn't too much I can do for you.

**ICD:** Well you can go put one on for me.

**ME:** I'm sorry but I can't, for me to do that I would have to put a box of chickens to cook (which is 8) and they would take an hour and 15 to cook and we would be closed by the time they finished cooking.

**ICD:** That's fine, I can wait around until then.

**ME:** Uh....we will be closed by then, you won't be able to purchase anything, everyone will have gone home.
(This is where he loses it, quite frankly, I'm surprised he didn't snap earlier.)

**ICD:** ALL I WANT IS A FUCKING CHICKEN. IS IT SO MUCH TO ASK FOR A FUCKING CHICKEN!

**ME:** Look there isn't anything I can do for you.

**ICD:** MATE GET YOUR FUCKING MANAGER!

**ME:** No problem, anything else I can help you with? (probably not my best idea, he was pissed and irrational, but I just wanted to piss him off a little bit more)

So the night manager (who is an absolute champ) finally wonders over 5 minutes before we close (he was mega busy this night, so it took him about 15 minutes to get away). He talks to the customer and reiterates EVERYTHING I told ICD and he still wasn't understanding any of it. After this 5 minute exchange, the checkout chicks announced that the store had closed for the night, at which point the night manager (who is about 6' 6'') has looked straight at his face and said ""The store is closed, get the FUCK out"". Well he didn't like that too much and started yelling things like ""pack of morons"" and ""Why would anyone with half a brain want to shop here at [store][location]?"". After the manager let me out he tells me I did good and handled the situation with ICD well. 

Well, ICD put in a complaint that night (on the net) and the boss calls me into her office the next day (she is usually a pain but she has her moments). The night manager is in there and the boss tells us about the complaint. She reads out what ICD wrote and then bursts out laughing (very un-characteristic of her). She tells us not to worry about him and we went on with our job.","That's fine, I can wait",109

It was the Saturday noon rush where everyone decided that they needed  something from our store.  We have a cute girl that I used to have a crush on working on my left, I'll call her A.  On my right, we have B, a large male currently training to become an EMT, hoping to be a doctor someday.  Very likable guy.

We were in the midst of the rush and every single register was open, that means everyone available was called to get people out of the store.

I was cashiering quite merrily, the guests were pleasant and I was enjoying talking to them.  During my chat with a sweet middle aged woman, I hear a THUD come from A's lane.  I turned to see A laying on the floor unconscious.

I tell B, who didn't have a guest at the time and like a flash, he had a perimeter cleared around A's lane.  He had her feet elevated and her head turned to the side while a manager called 911.  I helped the poor guest that A was in the middle of checking out to a different lane.

The ambulance had arrived and B told them all of his immediate observations since he was in training.  She was coming to and they had concluded that she was rather dehydrated and had not eaten breakfast or lunch yet.

They took her to the local hospital for some additional tests to make sure that everything was ok and she ended out up walking out that same day.

Several guests called our corporate office and he received a personal letter of commendation for his actions.  He was promoted to a front end manager due to his ability to think on his feet.

psecody,8,13,1puuda,41,"I work in the rc department at a big box hobby store in the USA, we'll call it hobbyclown.

So we have this one customer that comes in enough and bugs the whole RC section enough that we've nicknamed him ""ghetto gerry"" (from now on known as GG).

For some reason I cannot fully get through his head the extent to which I cannot stand him or his car. I've even went so far as to tell him I ""wasn't f##king touching his piece of s##t car again"" yet time and time again he comes to me asking for me to ""rig"" his truck. 

I should further explain why I would say such a thing to a customer. He bought a used old tmaxx and complained that he wanted it blinged out so left it with us telling us to put $600 worth of parts on it, some of which we had to order because we didn't have them on hand. After a week he was calling complaining about why we weren't done yet. So to be nice we rush to get the repair done as fast as possible but when we tried to contact him to tell him it's done we can't get him... Fast forward six months and he's picking it up (because he's been in prison) then after a week brings it back wanting us to install a picco .26 in it. After that he's done nothing but complain because he's apparently not competent enough to tune a nitro engine on his own. 

None of that sounds bad, but what really grinds my gears is that he brings the car in EVERY DAY with an issue (he can't get it started) and all I hear is how big of a ""piece of s##t"" my co-worker is that installed that engine because ""he don't know what he doin' man, I think he messed it up"". My coworker has been running nitro engines since the seventies so I'm fairly sure he's capable of handling an install of one (4 screws...) 

Another thing about GG is when he breaks his truck out running it or something he just riggs it to get it to run again... He was having trouble with it the other day and when I looked at the bulkheads he had screwed them in with a wood screw and screwed into the diff casing....

Another one he said the other day: His carb was leaking a little so we told him to go get high temp silicon and fix it with that. He paused a second asked ""can I just use some super glue on there?""

His car is a frankenstein car and he just keeps expecting us to engineer a fix on the spot. He tracks me down in the store to get me to help him everytime... I'm so frustrated.

schnibblebob,56,15,1pusay,72,"Seeing [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1psvzu/we_dont_let_dogs_in_anymore/) about people and their dogs reminded me of my dog story.  I also work in a hardware store (think the other guy’s store, only bigger where the employees don’t talk to you).  Now we have a no-pets policy that is (imho) far too lax.  But I follow the policy to a t.  Why?  Because it is a huge safety concern.  We have power tools, and chemicals, and you have no idea how your dog is going to react to coming face to face with a big, beeping, scary forklift. (Obligatory longtime lurker, first time poster disclaimer)

One night I was working the till when a man came in with his hundred pound pit bull.  I was busy with other customers so I just let the man go, not wanting to start anything.  About ten minutes later I see the man again up near our registers with his dog.  The man then proceeds to use our store as his training tool for his dog.  He tells her to sit, drops the leash, turns his back and walks away from the dog.  (with his back to it!)  At this point I lose my cool and politely inform the man that he will need to take his dog outside.  The man flips out saying that he can do whatever he wants and that he has had the dog in the store before.  His girlfriend goes to take the dog’s leash and leaves the store when the man has the nerve to put his hand on her wrist and tell her that she is not taking the dog anywhere.  He is the customer and he can do what he wants.  I inform him that it is a safety issue and that some people tend to be afraid of dogs, that I happen to be one of them.  He wants nothing to do with that.  He says that his dog is fine and that I need to suck it up that he isn’t here to make me happy.  That he is the customer and I should be bending over backwards to make him happy, not the other way around.  (okay asshole, want to tell that to the giant ass scar I have across my face from a dog a lot like yours)  Finally the man calms down and leaves.

It’s all over from there right?  No.  Half an hour later asshole dog man comes back in the store asking for my manager’s business card, and my name.  I give him both as well as the customer care line and hope to never hear of this man again.  Well it turns out he did call my manager, who then wanted to speak with me (he told me I was completely in the right and that he had my back).  Later my manager said he got a phone call from corporate pissed that I fought the man on it.  Apparently I was supposed to give in to the customer like we do every time.  My manager had my back (first time he ever had my back and last time too).  But I was appalled at the nerve of the man to scream in my face when I made a very reasonable request to get his DOG out of my HARDWARE STORE.

meguriau,38,38,1pupen,123,"Hey TFR, I'm back! My thesis has now been submitted and I have caught up on sleep so that leaves me free to divulge juicy anecdotes where my pain is often your gain.

My [""Tales from a Hat Boutique""]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/search?q=meguriau&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) collection began last week, garnering a bit of attention so here I am, back with another one. I had different story planned for you originally but I'm bumping it back in honour of the race that will be stopping the nation, better known as the Melbourne Cup. I'm not sure how big the event is outside of Australia so, in short, this particular racing event is not only famous for its horses but also the fashion. Both men and women vie for the best-dressed awards and what better way to attract the attention of the judges than fancy hats and fascinators! 

**Background**

Two years ago, I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store. Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock, the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals. The majority of the customers I've had have been pleasant, however, there have been interesting characters and even a few ~~nasty pieces of work~~ discontent customers that have come by. This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this time.

**Story**

The first week of November is often a trying week here at the hat store. We experience an influx of women with a perfectionistic streak looking to find that amazing hat to match the dress they had purchased in advance. Today, of course, was another such day.

Amongst the chaotic gaggle of women was an American tourist (AT) in his mid to late 50s. A few confident strides was all it took for him to make his way from the front of the store to the counter. 

**M:** Hi there, was there anything I can help you with?

**AT:** Do you know which hat will win first place at the races?

**M:** I'm sorry sir, I'm not sure I can answer that for you. There are many variables that make a hat impressive. The look of a hat is dependent on the height and face shape of an individual so I can't pick out which one would win... and that's not including the colour scheme and style of clothing that will be worn.

**AT:** Well make a good guess. I want to win the prize. If I’m going to spend more than $200 on a hat, it'd only be worth it if I win. When else am I going to wear it anyway?

**M:** I can attest to the fact that the hats here are of very high quality and that the majority of customers find that the hats can also be worn in casual settings.

Discussion ensued on the properties of different types of hat and what put each hat at a different price point. We finally arrived at a stage where he finally settled on a $300+ Panama hat. The hat itself was nothing short of perfect for him. The ivory white complemented his lightly tanned skin tone and his height and face shape offset the width of the brim. 

The transaction itself was running smoothly and all I needed was his signature when he paused, pen in hand. When asked if everything was alright...

**AT:** I was just thinking. If this hat doesn't win me first place, can I get a refund?

My eyebrow involuntarily morphed my expression from the default handling-potentially-difficult-customers-in-retail face to one of bewilderment.

**M:** I'm sorry sir. We can neither exchange nor refund hats that have been used unless the item is defective. The hat is still perfectly capable of providing sun protection even if you do not win tomorrow's competition.

He did not seem content with this answer but his objections were cut off by his wife. It turned out that she had been waiting outside patiently the entire time and seemed somewhat embarrassed by his behaviour. Apologising profusely, she managed to get him to sign the sheet and guided him away from the store, bringing the transaction to an end. 

We will find out tomorrow if he ends up calling in to ask for that refund.

Edit: He didn't call back! Not sure what exactly that means but I think he's happy with the hat! ","Dear customer, that is not how refunds work. [Tales from a Hat Boutique]",161

Early 30's-ish, short, big, tattoos, iron maiden t-shirt, the works. 

He comes up and I take the first part of his order. I ask him how his day is going just to ease the silence while i'm working on his food. He says its goin' good and I put his sandwich in the oven. As I turn away from the oven and back to him he says ""Actually its goin damn great."" 

""Yeah?"" Im at least a little interested at this point, he didn't seem like a talkative man. 

""Yeah man, I met a girl a couple of days ago and weve really hit it off. Were all talkin and shit and she seems to like hanging out all the time."" 

As hes saying this he is slowly turning from perma-scowl to a weirdly boyish smile. He starts telling me about her hair and how she laughs all in a really surprisingly innocent way. I wrap up his food and start the register when he leans towards me with his hands out.

""The best part is, she has some just massive boobs,"" and holds his hands apart in front of him to demonstrate. 

At that point he looks at me and realizes hes telling the sandwich guy about his love life over a sandwich for the last five minutes. We both start laughing and I hand him his sandwich and tell him Im happy for him. He looks at me and apologizes saying ""Sorry man, I just feel awesome and I had to tell someone.""

I'm overnight maintenance, and normally my job consists of cleaning up spills when they happen (which isn't as common anymore, thankfully), and cleaning various parts of the store, like the bathrooms and the meat/produce walls.

About two months ago, a month after I started at this store, it was announced that our store manager was leaving to be a store manager at a bigger location that also sold general merchandise (we sell groceries, pharmacy, that sorta thing, but very little GM). This concerned me because the store manager was REALLY nice.  In fact, she's the one that hired me. 

Fast forward a month, and our temporary store manager leaves, to be replaced by The Manager From Hell. This woman came from a bigger store to work in this one, and tried to run it like it was her old store.  

I didn't care much about that, we worked around it.  My main issue was her obsession with the floors.  She wasn't just a 'clean the floors really well' type, she was 'walk around with a broom and scraper all night and get rid of any black spots you see OR ELSE'. 

For the first week or so, I was fine with this. The floors were really bad, as they haven't been stripped/waxed or anything since the store opened almost seven years ago. For months before I started, the floors were scrubbed once a week or so.  

It started to get irritating when she would rip my managers apart every morning no matter what I, or myself and the managers, did. You know the saying crap rolls downhill? It did, and I don't blame my managers. They were catching hell, and they were just trying to impress on me, no matter what I did, that we were never going to be good enough but to do my best regardless. They appreciate my work, that's really what matters to me.

After a month of being threatened with write-ups, stressing because I didn't have enough time to do anything but the floors (meat wall, produce wall hadn't been cleaned since the last time I did it, yuck!), we're finally told that The Manager From Hell couldn't handle our store and went to the store our former store manager had taken over, and our former store manager was coming back!  

It's been a little over a week since she came back, and things are great. I enjoy my job again, productivity is up and nobody is transferring (there were requests put in).  Things are back to normal, we survived the Dark Ages.

PasswordIsntClop,34,66,1ptsi4,332,"I used to work in big-box electronics as a salesman. Probably one of the worst jobs I've ever had.

I was working there when the Nexus 7 came out. As many of you probably know, the Nexus 7 was a really big deal. It's a fully functioning Android tablet with impressive specs for a very low price (at the time, only $200). It completely blew away most other tablets. At our store, it was one of the only electronics we've ever actually taken pre-orders for. That's how big the demand was.

All of our promotions were about pre-orders. Big signs in the store about pre-ordering, pick up on release day, etc. These went out of date, obviously, when the Nexus 7 was released, but the prices stayed the same. Corporate never sent us replacement signage.

About a month after the Nexus 7 was released, I was approached by a customer about pre-ordering one.

We'll call her Looking For Argument (LFA), because really, that's what she wanted.

LFA: Hello, I'd like to pre-order a Nexus 7.

LFA: No thanks. I'd just like to pre-order one.

At this point, I'm very confused. I can see noticing the advertisement, and then wanting to pre-order one... but wanting to pre-order one *after release*?

Me: I'm sorry, ma'am, we're not accepting pre-orders for the Nexus 7 because it's *already out.*

LFA: So you mean... the sign is wrong?

I swear to god, her eyes lit up like Christmas trees. She was a discount hunter, and was going to try and claim the signs were wrong, so we need to compensate her for ""wasting"" all of five seconds of her time.

Me: The sign is out of date, yes. If you would like a Nexus 7, I have many available.

LFA: BUT THAT ISN'T WHAT I WANT! I want to *pre-order one!* The SIGN says I can PRE-ORDER a NEXUS 7, and that is WHAT I WANT TO DO.

Me: Ma'am, you can't pre-order something that is released. I *have them in the store.* Do you want to purchase one?

LFA: NO! I want to *pre-order one!*  The sign says I can! LET ME SEE YOUR MANAGER.

I have no idea what happened after she went to speak to my manager, but she didn't leave the store with a Nexus 7, or her pre-order.

We kept the signs up. Any other customer who was looking to pre-order one was happy about finding that they were actually already available!

EDIT: Yeah, okay, guys. I should have taken her phone number and called her immediately. It's been posted like eight times now. I get it.",You can't PRE-ORDER something already RELEASED. It isn't PRE if I have them in stock.,398
Smallwater,15,26,1ptl46,94,"I apologize beforehand for the massive wall of text. I started typing some smaller stories, but they kinda... grew.

I currently work at a small grocery store. It's part of a big, German chain, and I have to wear blue polo shirts as per uniform. People may already know what chain I mean. I work there on Saturdays only, and I'm still in college for the rest of the week. That means I'm basically the bottom bitch, but since I actually try to be as productive as possible, the rest of the team and management trust me enough to let me do things I shouldn't be allowed to (like using the electric palletjack, going into the office on my own, changing prices,...)  
This chain is quite strict about their employees. You are absolutely forbidden to post stuff online, there have been terminations due to facebook pictures. However, I think that TFR is less... public than FB, and I'm quitting there in three weeks anyway. Firing me is no longer a concern for me.  
I will start of my long chain of stories (believe me, in the two years I worked there, I lived through plenty) with a couple of short stories of one of my former co-workers.  
Well, not directly my co-worker. See, we have what we call a ""Flying team"". It basically means that they get sent out to different stores, and usually we only see them when we have a shortage of people due to vacations or when we need a quick replacement due to illness.  
One of those guys' names started with T. So that's what I'm going to call him from here on. T was, in all aspects, a Tremendous Idiot. He was daft, slow witted, and the only reason he was able to keep his job was because of his uncle, who worked higher up in the chain of command. Some of his best escapades:  
  
Every time he had to come to work, T would call and apologize. He would be late for work a little bit, he got stuck in a traffic jam. This happened at every store. Now, would he be late a couple of minutes, or only be late once every 2 weeks, no biggie. We get payed by the minute, it's your money you're losing pal. But no, T would come OVER AN HOUR late, every single day. Because of traffic jams. Without change. He would ""get in a traffic jam"" for over an hour, every single day he had to work. We started to put him on the roster an hour early, as to compensate for his tardiness.  
  
When he eventually did make it to work, he was... different to work with than other colleagues. Not that he was bad at his job, on the contrary. He was a fairly decent worker, he knew what he was doing, and he worked reasonably fast. IF he was working. Note, T is about 30-35 years old. So not only does it signify his competence, being a 30-something stuck in a retail job as a simple clerk, (seriously, you can get promotions at the snap of your fingers. A simple math test, and you're already part of management) but it also means a lot in what I'm about to tell you now.  
T would occasionally (read: all the frikkin' time) flirt with girls. Co-workers, customers, management, whatever. I've seen him abandon his post AT THE REGISTER to run out in chase of a couple of teenage girls to give them his number. Yes, that's a 30 year old dude, running out on his job, to give his number to girls almost half his age. Creepy? Just a little bit.  
The kicker of this bit would be the scolding he got from my manager one day. I was working with T and a female co-worker, F.  
F isn't unpleasant to look at, but not what you'd call smokin' hot. The manager on duty is also female, and she was a bitch. Not the kind of bitch you hate, at least not until you got on her bad side. I've seen her stare down huge, bulking, angry costumers who were easily twice her size. But, she was awesome to work with, as she was fast, intelligent, funny, and generally pleasant, if only towards us. I'll call her M.  
Now, I'm stocking shelves with T and F, while M was back in the office. The shelves we were stacking were quite low, so it involved a lot of ducking and bending over. I'm minding my own business, swearing at some boxes who wouldn't line up right, when I hear a load SLAP and a startled scream. Turning around, I see F standing shocked with her hands on her bottom, and T with a big-ass grin on his face. Guess what happened yet? 'Cause I didn't at that time. I continued cursing the evil boxes who remained just half a centimeter to big, and thought nothing of it. Nothing of my business anyway.  
Suddenly, M comes over to me, fuming. ""Smallwater, have you seen T?"" I see the foam coming from her mouth, and F at the verge of tears behind her. I tell her where T is, and she storms off. ""**T! T! GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE!**"" (I really cannot emphasize how loud and angry she was shouting. It's like a Drill Sergeant met a train whistle and they had a loud-ass baby) T comes over, not really understanding how much trouble he is in, with M nearly reaching boiling point. Before he can even start his first sentence, M completely explodes ""**YOU KEEP YOUR GODDAMN HANDS OFF MY EMPLOYEES, YOU UNDERSTAND!!**"" In my mind it suddenly clicked, and I realized why F was so upset about the loud slapping noise. Apparently, T thought it was funny to slap F as hard as he could on her butt, but F really didn't like that. Again, I should note the creepiness of this. F was barely older than 25, so again that is a man in his thirties slapping a girl, almost 10 years younger, that he barely knows, on her butt, while on duty. The best part? His defense.  
""Ah, I didn't mean anything by it! She isn't even pretty enough for me to really mean it!"" It was like watching a tiny rabbit unknowingly jump in front of an angry tiger. F breaks down in tears (she had some minor self-esteem issues), and M completely explodes, so loudly that he people at the register were turning heads (We were at the back of the store).   
As far as I know, he only got a berating for that incident, to the surprise of us all. We were sure he was going to get fired for that.  
  
T also drove a car. He would have to, since he has to go to different stores. One of the more glorious days I remember, was when T came to our store, but after 3 hours got the message ""Where the fuck are you?"" from another store. The moron went to the wrong store. No biggie, he could have misread his roster, I thought. Apparently, it was not the first time he showed up at the wrong store. It was so bad, that the manager of the store he should have gone to, was already prepared for this, and called our manager to ask it T could bring along a couple of boxes of grapes, since the Other Store ran out earlier than expected. Sure, we had plenty of boxes left, so we told T to bring his car around to the loading bay, so we could load in the boxes. There were 10 boxes, about 70cm by 30 cm big. Not that huge, we though that we could easily fit them in the back of T's old Golf. Wrong.  
He pulls up, and we immediately notice the big subwoofers hanging in his trunk. Now, I must say, for a guy as daft as T, I was impressed by the neatness of the customization. It was clear the Golf had been modified, but it didn't look grotesque or ugly.  
We started to carry the boxes to his car, when he stops us and tells us he will load it in himself. He just had his interior reupholstered, and didn't want it damaged. Fair enough, so I tell him to pop the trunk, and I'll put in a couple in there. He opens the trunk, I put in a couple of boxes, and I notice the trunk won't close anymore. There were too many boxes, as the subwoofers were in the way of closing the trunk. I start pulling out boxes to see how many we could fit in there.  
2. We could put in 2 boxes, 70x30cmx15cm big, in the back of his car, because of his subwoofers.  
Not exactly relevant to his capability as a employee, but I still giggle every time I think of the story.  
  
The reason T was eventually fired was theft. Now, don't get your hopes up on a big Ocean's Eleven type of heist, it didn't even involve money. T drank a lot of energy drinks. Redbull, the store brand piss we sold at 20 cents a can, whatever. However, paying them wasn't high on his priority list. He was sneaky about this, as he would pull out a can from the shelves, tell the manager on duty he took one, and tell he would pay for it later. Now, this happens fairly regularly, with employees taking something from the shelves or from the stock, and paying for it later. It's not a big deal, as we have a system of trust and memory. Basically, it means you either take action yourself and quickly pay for it, or, if you haven't paid for it yet, someone will remember you of it, and you quickly went and payed. Of course, this rule was only valid when T wasn't around. T would grab something, say he'd pay for it, and continue working. When someone saw him drinking, he or she asked him if he'd payed for it yet. He'd simply say yes. For a while we all thought that T was indeed paying for them. Remember we work on trust, so we trusted him he'd pay for them.  
Ohhh boy. He'd pay for one alright. But he drank 5. We continually saw him drinking from a can of Red Bull, and we'd all think it was the same can he paid for. Meanwhile, it was his 3d or 4th can. At the end of the day, we would find a single empty can in the trash bin, and we didn't suspect a thing. T got a can, tell the manager he took one, paid for it, drank it, and threw it away at the end of the day. No problem right? None of us wondered why he went so long with a single can.  
One day, one of the managers looked behind the press we use for cardboard boxes. (we collect empty boxes, and press them into a big bale that would be shipped out to a recycling company) There were a shitload of empty cans there. The guy who found those didn't think much of it, and just reasoned it was someone who was too lazy to take the extra three steps to the trash bin. Until he spotted T looking guilty and quickly turning around when he spotted the manager. The manager started to berate T for not cleaning up his trash, when T's idiocy landed him his termination. When asked if those cans were his (note, the manager still thought he had paid for them, he just threw them there), he quickly said he'd pay for them, he just hadn't come to it yet. ""So, what, you haven't paid for those?"" ""No, not yet, but I forgot my wallet today, I'll pay for them the next time I'm here."" The manager couldn't really believe his ears. T actually confessed to stealing those cans, and was trying to get away with it by trying to pay for them afterwards. 
Now, bad luck for T, a person way higher up in the ranking was present in the store. He overheard the story, and immediately took over. He asked the same questions, confirmed that T indeed took those cans without paying for them, and fired him on the spot. Even T's uncle couldn't help him, theft is an immediate termination of contract.  
  
The best part of this? His direct boss, the manager of the Flying team, was glad to hear T was gone. He said he received too many complaints about him to keep him working, but his uncle kept his head dry. Finally they got him good, and we didn't have anymore of his problems.  
  
Bonus story: he once asked me what I studied. I study IT, and he immediately jumped on the occasion to ask me some questions about his new iPhone.  
T: ""So, how about internet? Do I have to pay for that?""  
Me: ""Yeah, 3G costs money. Based on your provider, how much you pay changes.""  
T: ""Well, what about Wi-Fi?""  
Me: ""Wi-Fi is free, as long as you have a connection point, you can use Wi-Fi""  
T: ""So I don't have to pay for it?""  
Me: ""Nope, as long as you have Wi-Fi""  
T: ""Where do I get Wi-Fi? Like at my phone dealer?""  
Me: ""Possibly. Usually, you get Wi-Fi with your ISP, it's standard on the modern modems"" (it is where I live, there are 2 major ISPs, and both have free wi-fi access points built in their modems)  
T: ""No, no, I mean on my phone!""  
Wait what?  
Me: ""Wi-Fi is standard on your phone. You don't have to pay for it. At all""  
T: ""Ok, thanks!""  
I have a faint feeling he still hasn't used his Wi-Fi.

CurvedStraightLine,82,82,1ptjvr,331,"This is from my days at a craft supply store.  I was a roving Acting Manager.  Meaning if the actual store manager was out for a while, I got to travel in and run the store for a bit.

I was called in for a brief stay, only four days, at a location during inventory while the manager was out.  The store manager is showing me around the layout, and comments that she has some issues with the backroom staff being on their cell phones during shifts, so they are required to turn in their phones prior to clocking in and get them back afterwards.  No problem.

My first full day starts, the backroom staff comes in.  They were horribly understaffed for the backroom at this location, only two people, Mike and Angie.  Angie was a sullen, middle aged woman.  Mike was young, probably fresh out of high school and didn't seem like he had two brain cells to rub together.  He showed up that shift out of uniform.  I mean, completely out of uniform.  I tell him that there would be a write up.  He stares at me, then comments that the store manager was out, he figured they weren't ""really"" going to work that day.

I explain to him that, no, we're going to be running the same as ever, I have the same authority as his manager, and I won't take bullshit.  Mike sort of slouches out of the office, and I call for him to leave his cell phone behind.  He drops it down onto the desk.

The next day, Mike is in uniform, there's two cell phones on my desk, and I figure we're in business.  I walk back to check on how the backroom inventory is coming along early in the shift, and find that Mike is sitting on a box, texting away on a cell phone.

I immediately call him into the office, and he is sitting there looking positively baffled at why he was in trouble.  He left a cell phone on my desk, just like I asked, the fact that it was an old, nonworking one shouldn't matter, he was listening to my rules.

After a moment or two I started to doubt if he was playing dumb, or really that stupid.  Either way, it was another write up, which he seemed beyond upset over.  I spelled out for him that during the time he was clocked in there were to be no cell phones in his hands, period.  

Day three we had computer issues, and we couldn't get any inventory done.  Computers came up later, but by that point I didn't have the staffing to get everything done.  I asked every single employee if they could either come in or stay longer to polish off inventory.  Mike was one of the ones who agreed, and asked if he could have his cell phone to let his ride know when to pick him up.  As soon as he finished, I took his phone back and locked it in my office.

We're busy, but I look around and realize Mike's no where to be found.  I sort of let everyone know to look out for him, and got a call that he was found, in a closet.

I come back and he's still sitting in the closet.  On his cell phone.  He just sort of looks up at me, confused when I open the door, and says that his XBox Live account is messed up and he's working on fixing it.

I march him into the manager's office.  Turns out he had broken into the locked manager's office to get his cell phone, an action he thought was fine because I had given him permission to call his ride earlier.

I'm sort of staring at him.  Now, I COULD fire someone, insomuch as I had all the same abilities as a regular manager.  But it's sort of bad form to fire someone else's employees.  So I tell him that I was having someone else fetch his belongings and I was going to see him out the door.  I would relate this whole story to the actual store manager in the morning, and it would be up to her what would happen.

So I call to Angie to fetch Mike's things.  Now, I had never seen the two interact this whole time.  I don't think I even heard Angie talk the whole time.  She had just kept her head down and worked silently.

But suddenly Angie was flying through the store, crying and freaking out, carrying Mike's things--and her own.  She starts ripping into me that I was picking on ""a boy"" and how I can't fire him.  I say that I'm not, but she's in full hyperventilate mode and not listening.  She says that if I'm getting rid of him I was losing her too, and she flings her namebadge at me and runs out of the store, still weeping.  Mike looked more confused than anything, and followed her out.

The next morning, I handed over the keys to the store manager, and had to explain that she basically didn't have a backroom staff anymore, and I really wasn't sure why.",Remember The Backroom Staff You Used to Have?,413

lodged_in_thepipe,31,301,1ptcjt,985,"First off, I don't technically work in retail, I work in a large city center pub in the UK. This incident was quite amusing though so I thought I'd share.

On the weekends we have live music playing on the ground floor, which means beforehand we have to move all the furniture out the building so there is room for people to watch the band, dance etc. When the bands finish we have to move it back in, which is sometimes made tricky by the fact the pub is now full of drunk people who don't like being asked to move out the way.

At this point me and my coworker had moved about half the tables in, and were carrying another one through the main door. However, when I opened the door I found the entrance blocked by a girl who was dancing for a group of guys the other side of the room. She looked pretty drunk, and was clearly trying to look as sexy as possible. I said ""Excuse me"" politely, but she either didn't hear me or ignored me. I repeated myself louder, and she glanced at me but still didn't move aside.

At this point I was just preparing to push past her but then something better happened. Right behind her was one of the long tables we'd already moved in, and she began to 'seductively' slide on top of it, seemingly attempting a '[Jessica Rabbit on the piano' look](http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/196/2/e/jessica_rabbit_by_amalara-d57e0ay.jpg) for the boys. However, in her inebriation she slid onto the very edge of the table, which straight away sent the table flipping over and her tumbling onto the floor. She wasn't hurt, just drunk and confused and mumbled some apology to me before moving out the way. I said it was fine and went through the door with a huge grin on my face.

&gt; C: ""600? That's all you have?""

&gt; M: ""We do offer a 1020 thread count through our catalog, but yes- we only have the 600 here in store. However, it's the weave and quality of the cotton that gives the sheets their softness. Thread count doesn't matter quite as much since machines weave the fabric.""

&gt; C: ""Oh, I need the highest thread count. I can feel the difference. I have these sheets at home- they must be over 1000 thread count- that feel like silk.""

&gt; C: ""600 is the highest you have?""

&gt; M: ""In store, yes.""

&gt; C: ""Fine. Where are those?"" (I direct the customer to a shelf with 600 thread count sheeting) ""How much are these?""

&gt; M: ""These start at $129 per sheet.""

&gt; C: ""ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE DOLLARS... for ONE SHEET? It's not even a SET?""

&gt; M: ""They are a true 600 thread count. That's why they're so expensive. Most companies will double the yarns and sell that number as thread count, which is false advertising. We sell true thread count sheets. This particular line is also made in Italy.""

NotTobeyMaguire,13,9,1psx7v,41,"I was inspired to relate this after seeing the other similar post from earlier. We always allow dogs into our NYC retail store because they're typically either purse-dogs or big friendly lugs who brighten our afternoon. Unfortunately, this time, one of them had an accident, but we only discovered it from the rank smell and the customer complaints coming from the second floor. We ""investigate"" (used loosely, because it was instantly obvious) upstairs to find that someone's dog had left a soft, wet, stanky one on the hardwood floor and then proceeded to step in it and track it around the store. It was a mess, mostly concentrated around one side of the floor.

Thankfully, all of the other customers, save one who was on the opposite side and said he didn't really care, had left for greener pastures. And let me tell you, this this REEKED. The only problem was, there wasn't a dog in the shop all day, only lots of humans. That's when it struck me: it was probably a child who had the accident. Whatever. It's gross, but it happens. We figured the child left a stinker, tracked it around without a care, and, when the parents realized what had transpired, they scooped up their toddler and fled the scene of the crime, fearing punishment or retaliation. Not an awesome parenting method, but the deed was done and there would be no way to stop someone so far after the fact, considering that they were long gone from the store.

So, a co-worker and I closed off the floor, cleaned up, sanitized everything, and left it at that. After notifying the owner of the store, we decided to request that they look at the security cameras, just for a solid conclusion to the story, even though nothing else could be done about it. Tapes were reviewed and a couple days later we had our answer:

There was never a child. There was never a dog. There was never an accident or a confused adult or a sick person or anything. There was only a woman, middle-aged and rather normal looking for the neighborhood we're in, with a small bag full of excrement. The poo bag leaves the hand bag, the poop leaves the bag with a soft plop, she walks it around a fair portion of the second floor with the aid of several unknowing and unsuspecting customer accomplices, and then she flees the scene.

It was the perfect crime.

Hotdogorpolish12,7,12,1psrzd,40," Hi everyone, I have been reading TFR for the last year since I entered the retail world. Sorry for the wall of text.  I work at a certain big box store that requires a membership, it's located in the middle of a major US city so we get our fair share of interesting and weird members.  I have been a cashier at my store for the last year, and I'm sure like many of, I have developed a certain lines I say to the customer during each transaction such as "" did you find everything alright ?"" Or ( what I say at the end of every transaction) ""have a great day/night"". Well one gentlemen was in my line today and I rang him up the same as I do every other member and said ""have a great day"". Apparently he wasn't having a great day because he quickly said ""You didn't say thank you"". I was a bit shocked because I generally have a good rapport with the customers (but honestly it's not that surprising because many of the people who visit out store feel entitled to threat the employees like shit because they pay money to shop with us). I looked at the old man and replied "" I said have a good day"" and he replied ""that's not a thank you"". At this point I became fed up with the old man because we were extremely busy, so in the most sarcastic voice I could muster I said ""ttthhhaaaannnkk yyyoouuu sir for shopping with us"". He was immediately pissed off and asked where my manager was, I gladly directed him (my managers know I give excellent customer service, and that many of our customers are but bags). All that happened was I was given a short taking too and asked what I could do better next time to which I replied ""nothing, I tell everyone to have a nice day. I guess this guy was just having a bad one"".

RaxonDR,17,26,1psqec,59,"This did not happen to me, but it was related to me by a friend. Oh, this is my first post on TFR. Please, don't be gentle.

My friend was working in a perfume and makeup department store off to the side of a mall. We will call her Crazy 'Roid Bitch, or CRB. How she earned this nickname is another story entirely, involving contact allergies, a box of pencils, a nasty fall, and a problematic teen. We'll not get into that right now, but now that you're curious, I have a guaranteed readership for my next story.

Anyway, our story begins in in the department store. Our intrepid heroine is working behind a mascara/eyeshadow counter, when a young man wearing a backpack runs by, grinning. A short while later, a cry rings out! Macy, the delicate young lady behind the perfume counter, runs to CRB. ""CRB! I was only gone for a minute! Somebody stole most of the perfume at my counter!"" CRB calls security, and is answered by Blooming Dale, a foppish bear of a man. He asks Macy several questions, and a woman we'll call Penny arrives, with her son, Marshall. Marshall is around six or so, but he bravely asks if there's anything he can do to help.

Dale whispers to Penny, a weary looking woman. She smiles and nods, and Dale squats down and pulls a tin star badge out of his pocket. ""Would you like to help in my investigation?"" When the boy nods, Dale pins the badge to Marshall's shirt. ""You'll be my deputy. Come on, let's see if we can figure out who did this."" He takes the boy over to a counter, and gives him a big magnifying glass, to help him look for clues. While the boy is distracted, Penny does her shopping, and Dale radios to have the tapes pulled of the counter for the last hour.

As things are winding back down, a scream rings out. It's Macy again. Dale races to help her, concerned that maybe the thief returned. When he arrives, he finds that her counter has scotch tape all around it, painted yellow with a sharpie. Macy is standing at the entrance to her work station with a look of horror on her face.

Dale pulls his flashlight gets ready to attack. He motions for Macy to back away. She does, and he approaches silently. When he peeks behind the counter, a chill runs down his spine. It's Marshall. The boy has a six or eight ounce glass jar of face powder, high end stuff. There is powder *everywhere*. In cabinets, all over boxes, on the perfume samples, even in the locked cases.

Dale looks to Macy with pity. He knows she has to clean all of this up. ""Deputy Marshall, what are you doing?"" ""I'm dusting for prints! We'll catch this guy, I just gotta find some clues."" The boy is going over every square inch of the work station with the magnifying glass.

Dale is doing all he can not to laugh, while Macy is doing her best not to cry. Dale points to a spot and says, ""Ah hah!"" He puts a piece of tape on a spot, and pulls up some powder. ""A fingerprint! Good work, deputy. This will lead us to the crook!"" He then escorts Marshall back, and they wait for Penny. When she comes back, he offers her what's left of the jar of powder, and commends her on raising such a fine investigator. Penny, red faced, leads her powder coated son out after hearing about his antics and the story behind the mostly empty jar. Dale pays for the powder, and everyone gets a good, long laugh over the incident.

masajmarod,11,18,1pspag,28,"I finally got a new job, thanks for the months of entertainment that kept me sane while working my dead end retail job, keeping my head up until I was able to land something better. 

I have refrained from posting in the past, mainly because I was relating to many other posts about retail jobs and work place hell. This is one of my first reddit posts too.  Work sucks. Deal with it. Everyone hates their job. Be a man and appreciate the fact that you have a job in this economy and enjoy what you have/do outside of work; be happy while being incredibly miserable inside.  There is NSFW language mixed in here, just a heads up.
I work at a Hobby Store in the USA.

How in the hell did I, MasajMarod, end up working at a fucking “Hobby” store in a strip mall selling shit that doesn’t matter? That is a mystery I cannot wrap my head around. I do no not like people, strip malls, or shit that doesn’t matter.  For more than three years have I taken the verbal punishment and abuse of my coworkers, boss, and customers. I hate them all. I am so glad I am getting out of this life depressing rut and a new chapter is beginning. A bit of backstory since this is my first post.  

I did work as an automotive mechanic for two years during this timeframe so this was just a weekend/seasonal job which made it much more tolerable.  The shop I worked for moved locations and I left shortly after to focus on school.  Sticking around at the hobby shop was purely for entertainment at this point. I still help out at the shop when time allows. 

 At first this was a place I enjoyed, a unique atmosphere, cool customers, decent coworkers, worked around my school schedule and the job was placed in my lap. Having been unemployed for a few months I needed a summer job anyways.  Just like any other specialty store (think golf/bowling proshop and the like), we are experts in our field and knowledgeable in many products, equipment, but usually specialize in something specific.  What attracted me to the job was my interest in electronics; radio controlled equipment, unmanned flight, and the customization/freedom the RC hobby has.  Striving to be an engineer one day, this job held a higher interest to me than just having owned an RC car since I was 6 years old.  I have built an autonomous vehicle, fiddled with first person view, and programmed everything using a micro controller before it was ‘cool’. I have since given up all RC related hobbies because this job has killed every ounce of enjoyment it once brought me. Moving on.  

Here is my rant and warning for anyone in the lone star state wanting to fill my shoes.
I am the longest employed worker in my store right now. I have been there for over 3 years and have outlasted 30 other employees, and am on the 5th group of coworkers in my department. I have trained most of the people in my department now, and a handful of others. I know the store better than most, and understand how it operates very well.  I have built up a reputation over the years from being associated with the previous employees and am known as a scapegoat and a black eye for the store and my department.  The first three groups of coworkers sucked, no one was motivated to work or show any responsibility for their actions, called in frequently and smoked weed all the time. Some of the guys were smart and left on their own. We had an employee steal from the store and much of the blame was shifted onto me because I was still there when he quit. The store owner went crazy and doubled the amount of security cameras he now has and he stripped me of my discount and store key to unlock the glass cases/bathroom key. I had to check the key in/out with my manager until the owner’s investigation passed over and he realized I was not at fault. During this time I had to put up with all the customers who were ‘looking’ for the previous employee who also stole from them,  and since I couldn’t provide them with any contact info a lot of them started jumping my ass for some of the stuff that was going down. I told most of those customers to piss off in a polite manner yet during this time the store received several corporate complaint phone calls, etc. I took most of the heat. We were understaffed and no one from management would hop on the floor to help out. People went as far as to write reviews online about it, then come pissing and moaning to the manager about how incompetent his staff was. I might of snapped once or twice due to the stress, acted of of line, or mouthed off to a customer because of the bad situation I was put in. Even the cashiers would apologize for my ‘rude behavior’ and that I must not of been on my ‘crazy medicine.’ WTF? All the signs were there – quit and never look back. Why did I put up with this for so long? Subpar management, customers hated me, boring repetitive atmosphere. I saw the importance of an education and knew this was just a part time job to get me through college.

The reason I stayed this long was because it was an incredibly easy job and having to work around my school schedule was almost always impossible to other employers. I had some new coworkers who shared my elitist mentality and witty mindset.  Hell yeah, I started to enjoy work again.  I decided to stay. The owner was planning on opening up a new store and sending me and another guy over to run it. I was looking at a good raise and new job title, Assistant Manager. “Finally my hard work was starting to pay off” I thought. The other guy who I was supposed to run the store with is a big stoner, lives at home with his mom (he is in his 30s and perfectly capable of being independent.), and he was also a jackass. Smoke on the job frequently, deal drugs while on the job, etc. Do what you want but don’t shit in this shared nest of ours, pal. I reported it, but the owner didn’t bother to listen. He rehired this asshat when he bailed on us last Christmas leaving me working the day after Christmas by myself. That story is for another time. We had a falling out and I was denied my position due to a conflict of interest with the stoner coworker. Fine. I would rather stay closer to home anyways. I at least expected a raise or something since I was promised one, I am still able to be an assistant manager here if the other douche bag is leaving. Nope.  

Fast forward 5 months, some quit, some go to the new store and I am working roughly 15 hours less because of a heavier school schedule. The owner gives one of the new guys a raise and promotes him to manager of my department along with another gentleman in another department. WTF? Okay – they are scheduled for more hours, but they have been here for less than ½ the time I’ve been employed so what gives? At least one of the promotions was legitimate and justifiable, he deserved it – the other guy doesn’t lift a finger most of the day and wears slippers/house shoes to work.  Time goes by – two new guys are hired. Word gets out – they make considerably more than I do.. hmm. So I go in and ask for a raise, I have certainly turned around the previous bad rep I had previously and earned the raise I was asking for. Not only was I denied but I was belittled about what little I bring to the company. LOL right.  Got it. I was going to ride this out until the year was over but not anymore. 
Thankfully I have been networking with others to seek employment, dedicating more time to school and focusing on what is important. The job is mindless and numb to me now.  I’ll be on autopilot and doing the bare minimum until my two weeks is up.

I have considering going out with a bang, no call no showing, or just straight up quitting mid-shift during a busy Saturday.  Perhaps even half-baked style if they push too many buttons. I have enough work experience to not even write this one down on a resume while burning the bridge and flipping the bird. Realistically speaking – they’ll be screwed without me there this holiday season and that is plenty enough satisfaction for me. :)

Removing the slave tunic off my back, bandaging my wounds and whip marks then waltzing out the front door is something I am looking forward too.  

Tl;dr
I have the most education, experience, knowledge and highest level of seniority at my retail job but none of that is worth jack shit to the owner.  Learned some life lessons, got a new higher paying job more related to my field of study.

Gus_Frin_g,24,25,1psnk1,91,"Background: I worked for a movie rental place for a year, back when these were still popular. I never had anything exceptionally out of the usual happen in the store except for this one story.

It is a Thursday afternoon and the store is pretty much empty. I am trying to watch the movie that is showing on the small TV screen at the back of the store when this customer walks in. He is a tall, fattish man in his 40s wearing a shirt and hat (think stereotypical Texan). He looks around for 5 mins, gets some movies, goes to check them out.

I ring him up. I bring up his account. Holy shit. There is a massive debt of 200$ waiting for him. Apparently he checked out 5 movies, returned them but did not pay for them. (customers can choose to pay at return if they want to. I hated that policy, as it always caused stuff like this, especially since customers could always leave their unpaid films in the drop box and drive away). I bring this up to him and he starts acting all pissy.

""I did not check out these films, young man (I was 17). Do not accuse me of something I did not do.""

""I'm sorry sir, but it says so on your account. Without you squaring off the debt the system will not let me check out another film for you.""

""This is utter bullshit! I will never come to this store again! Run these films for me and I'll be on my way!""

""I'm afraid I can't do that sir. The software won't let me. Besides, I think you have bigger issues at hand right now.""

At this point he reaches for his waist. Oh shit. Not this. He pulls out a gun and puts it down at the table in front of me.

""You're a motherfucker! Who the fuck you think you are, telling me I can't check out any fucking films!"" (he is making complete sense at this point)

Eventually, my two colleagues (who were on a lunch break) and my manager (sitting in his office a couple meters from the register) hear the commotion and run to where I am. Lots of screaming ensues with expletives being used by the dozen from the customer side. Eventually he leaves without his films, and without paying off the debt.

I talk to the manager about the situation. He tells me this guy is a big sheriff for one of the counties nearby. The one checking out the films was his daughter (who drives a pink Mercedes and has huge fake boobs) who does not bother to pay since Daddy always fixes things for her when he comes by the store. Great family, that one. After this little scene that ensued, his account got red flagged and prohibited to ever check out anything in the store ever again. I am happy enough and the issue is apparently settled.

After a couple days, the sheriff calls my manager to try and resolve the situation. Apparently my manager, who is a broken bag of tits, decides to forgive this customer's debt and allows him to check out stuff again (he is a regular, who always checks out loads of stuff and brings lots of money to he store). Thankfully I quit shortly afterwards so I never had to look at his face again.

Aaaah but I miss my times of retail. Sitting around watching films while getting paid... priceless.

Idr2013,2,7,1pslvl,29,"  Hey TFR, just wanted to share some stories from my hectic Saturday at a Grocery Store. As must of my stories start, it starts out at the Self Checkout Register where I was scheduled for a Seven Hour Shift.

   First thing I noticed when I got there is that the Self Checkouts are a absolute mess, loose receipts and plastic bags everywhere. I understand that it was busy when I got there (it took 3 of us to help people out there) but there was bags on the floor, and people could have tripped.  it almost didnt help that the person I was taking over the Self Checkouts for was well known not cleaning those up.

(back story for the next upcoming story, my store just recently made a new system where if you don't have a receipt when you return something, the money that was supposed to given to you is stored in your Bonus Card and can be discounted at the register. it requires a pin and doesnt work at the Self Checkout unless the Cashier suspends the transaction and does it on a register, no possible way that can backfire... right?)

  Some time later, I noticed a lady approach one of the Self Checkouts and gives me a nasty look as I helped out other customers. she approaches me saying that some money was supposed to be discounted off her order. So I suspended her order and brought her to my main register to take the money off. The thing is that it required an Manager Override to work, and I clearly dont have one. I cant buzz anyone because my buzzer is broken. I noticed my supervisor 'Chief' and I tried to call him over, he gives me the signal to wait as he was helping someone out. That's what I do, and the customer asks me if she could just go to the Service Desk. So I let her. About 10-15 minutes I noticed my Customer Service friend walk on by, and she mentioned that the lady had cursed me out, telling her that ""you need to train your people""

Relating to the Return Discounts, as I was heading off to my lunch break, a lady approaches the CoWorker was covering my lunch, and she tells him that money was supposed to be discounted off her order due to her returning something earlier. I step in and tell the lady that she needed to tell me before hand so I could have discounted the money off her order. And As I was coming back from my lunch, My Service Desk friend mentioned that  the same lady had a hissy fit because I apparently didn't tell her anything that I had to do it, and she was blaming me that she didnt get her discount. I'm not a mind reader lady.

Sometime during the first few hours of my shift, I had one of my registers break due to it not having paper in it. While that was happening, another register had frozen and the lady on it was starting to get annoyed because she was in a rush, so I had to transfer the order over to my main register. As I'm ringing this lady up, I noticed that the register unfroze, and I thought to myself ""i can still savage this register"" and I'm just realizing that I was getting lines, and start to get to panic a little bit due to me being under the weather and all the lines. I noticed that a Guy start to head over to the frozen register. I try to tell the guy that the register was broken, but he completely ignores me.  Then I had to raise my voice to get his attention

Me: ""Excuse me! Don't use that register I need to fix it, I just told you."" 
Airhead: ""You dont have to scream at me, I would have noticed""
Me: ""I needed to get your attention somehow""

the ladies on the Selfcheckout next to me mentioned that he should take their register because it was next to me and I would yell at him. Seriously butt out.

The last story is, I had an older gentleman come on one of the Self Checkout with ice cream and such. He tells me that why is the ice cream ringing up to be another price. 
 
Old man: ""Excuse why is my ice cream not at the correct price, you guys have signs everywhere displaying it for 2 for 5. That's the only reason I bought brand F, i better be getting one of these for free!""

I checked the store flyer and then I checked his purchases, I noticed that he bought Brand TH instead.

Me: ""Um sir, you bought brand TH instead of Brand F""

He checked his bag and realizes his mistake

Old Man: ""Well damn, all that trouble for nothing""

As I go to clear his order, and he gets close and tells me 
"" I've got 3 words for you, Don't. Get. Old.""

I had a nice laugh, and was happy he apologized.

Thanks for reading!","""3 Words: Don't. Get. Old.""",36
Fissak,24,46,1pslf5,201,"So I work at a southern fast food restaurant that people either love or hate so much they protest. I'm the night manager and right now where he wants us to pick 3 random customers and give them their food for free(This is kinda important here).

They order their food and I tell them it may be a bit and explain the situation while explaining I'll take their food to them when it's ready.


In about 6 minutes it's ready and she actually meets me at the counter noticing it's ready. This is where the conversation starts:

Me: Hey! Sorry that took so long but it's all fresh and ready for you. Any sauces?

SUHA: No, but I would love some fries for my wait (With this weird insinuating but still shit eating grin on her face)

Me:(w/e I can use this as one of my three free meals things to make boss man quit his bitching) Actually ma'am if you bring me your receipt I can refund your food for your wait and I'll even put those fries on your tray for you! (Cue typical service smile from ear to miserable ear)

SUHA: You don't even understand what I'm saying!

Me: Excuse me ma'am?

SUHA: You don't get it. You need to pay attention. You surely don't need my receipt to add to my order!

Me: No, I don't but for the refund I need the-

SUHA: I've had enough of you!

She then stomps off into the oblivion of her booth where she refuses to make eye contact with me until she leaves. I just don't get it. You asked for free food. I offered you free food AND your money back. It's a stingy asshole's dream come true! You finally give them what they want and they hate you for it! I really need to get out of this.

laxt,6,10,1pskou,21,"I'm tired of having to justify my actions to a staff who either don't know any better, or will just flat out refuse to acknowledge my experience over them.

Example: Customer leaves to get change.  I ring the sale as if they paid that extra 4 cents (literally), keep the item they bought, and start ringing the next customer in line.  Coworker who's standing nearby goes, ""I don't let them walk out to get more change.  Otherwise what prevents them from just leaving?""  Well, easy.  I still have their purchase.

That's an easy one that can be proven on the spot.  Most times there are conflicts, they aren't so easily explained why I chose what I did.  But I'm right, nonetheless, because if we stopped time and all the business going on for me to take five minutes and explain why I made such a decision, it makes a lot more sense than their knee-jerk assumption.

vaime,95,231,1psk4k,837,"**Background:** I work as a promotional model doing numerous different things, but probably my favourite job is working at an airside Duty Free store in an international airport. My job is to give out samples, give the customers product info, sell our product and help the customers with any other purchase they want to make. Basically, I'm somewhere between one of the floor staff and the brand ambassadors.

**The Story:** Where I live, we have pretty strict alcohol laws, which all promo models working with alcohol have to know and abide by. One of these includes the requirement to check ID before offering free samples of anything with alcohol in it. 

I'm quite a stickler for this rule, as I know the consequences for the store if we're caught breaking it. And seeing as the local police regularly wander around, it's not worth taking that risk. The problem with this is checking ID is often a pain when the store is busy, mainly because I'm terrible at math and need to count the age of the customer out in my head.

In order to get around this, I don't offer samples to anyone who looks like they could be underage or around our legal age (18). But if someone comes up and asks for a sample, that's fine, I check ID. Not a problem. Most of the time I will only ask for ID if I'm pretty sure they're underage or they're being a douchebag. Either or. But anyway, I digress.

I'd been standing on the lease line (the front of the store, right where people walk past or into the shop) serving a few customers when a group of basketball singlet, baggy pants clad guys came past and started wolf whistling, then walked off. Not too long after one of the group returned - from here on I'll address him as Not-So-Bright, or NSB for short.

NSB nonchalantly walks past the shop a couple of meters away, looking around. I offer samples to a couple who have just walked in, they politely decline. NSB by now has reached the security point, turns around and walks back - a little closer this time but still looking around, looking nonchalant. 

He continues walking past, getting closer and closer each time, but still looking around as if he's just going for a casual stroll before his flight. I recognised the kid as one of the wolf-whistlers from before so ignored him, offering samples to the other passengers walking by. NSB keeps up his casual strolling, getting closer and closer and eventually just staring at me, trying to catch my eye in the hope that I'll offer him a drink.

Eventually NSB gives up trying to catch my attention and walks straight up to the promo bar.

**NSB:** Hey, what have you got there?

**Me:** Hi there! Today we're sampling the different flavours of *[insert alcohol brand here]* 

**NSB:** Oh hell yeah! Free shots? I want one!

**Me:** Awesome! I just need to see your ID first, if that's OK?

NSB doesn't answer, just gives me a blank stare. I figure he may not get it, so I try to reiterate.

**Me:** ...I'm uh, not allowed to give samples to anyone under the age of 18, so I'll have to check your ID. 

**NSB:** *[still with blank look]* Yeah, I'm over 18. So can I have one?

**Me:** I need to see your ID first, I know it seems silly but  we have to make sure we aren't giving alcohol to minors.

**NSB:** Nah, it's cool. I'm over 18. I'm 19.

**Me:** I still need to see ID sorry, or I can't give you a sample. 

The kid is still staring blankly at me - you can practically see the gears ticking over in his head trying to decide what to do next.

**NSB:** Ah, yeah... I forgot my ID, sorry. *[laughs]* I do this every damn time. But it's cool, I'm 19 - I'm not underage.

**Me:** You forgot your ID?

**NSB:** *[shrugs]* Yeah, I must've left it at home.

It's now my turn to stare blankly at NSB. At this point I will remind everyone that we are in Duty Free. Duty Free in an Airport. Airside Duty Free in an Airport... The customs and security checkpoint is literally less an 100m to our left. I'm struggling to comprehend all the stupid that's going on right now.

**Me:** You... don't have your ID.

**NSB:** Yeah.. I just said.. I left it at home. 

**Me:** Your passport is fine...

**NSB:** *[starting to get a bit irritated]* I just told you, I left it at home! Just give me the damn shot already.

**Me:** You don't have your passport on you.

**NSB:** NO.

I really have no idea what to do. One half of me is shocked at the sheer stupidity of this moron, the other half is desperately trying not to laugh. 

**Me:** Then how, may I ask, did you manage to get through customs without a passport?! 

NSB loses all emotion on his face. I'm struggling to maintain my composure and not burst out laughing. He literally just stands there, silent, for about 30 seconds. Then turns and just walks away. As soon as he turned I burst into fits of laughter.

I'd really love to know what was going through his head through that whole exchange.

**TL;DR** If you're going to try and pull the ""forgot my ID"" card when trying to get alcohol samples from promo staff, make sure you're doing it in a place which doesn't require you to have your passport.","Conveniently ""forgetting"" your ID may work on your local bottle store, Sir, but it's a bit harder to pull off when you've just gone through customs at an airport - Tales from Duty Free",1068

kitzkronic,16,34,1psfn4,114,"Hello everyone! This is my first time posting here but I hope you enjoy my story!

**Background:** So I work for a certain store in Canada. Seeing as we have not quite opened yet, I have not had to deal with any guests. However, I'm used to people asking me about the store and when we open when I go on lunch. I have people swerve in front of me in the parking lot to ask me questions about our store. I have to admit it was quite startling at first, but I got used to it.

On one very rainy day, I trekked across the parking lot during my break to get some hot food. Sure enough some guy in a really old, beat up pickup truck stops in front of me. By now, I'm really used to people doing this, and just expected a few questions about the store. That was until Ignorant A-hole (lets call him IA) rolled down his window and started screaming at me.
IA: YOUR COMPANY IS RAN BY COMMUNIST PIGS.
Me: (In shock) I...I'm sorry sir, what are you talking about?
IA: HOW DARE YOU TURN YOUR BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY, AFTER ALL THEY DID FOR YOU.

It took me a second to think about what he was talking about. Seeing as I ref hockey, I don't care about people yelling at me, yet in this context I was totally unprepared for this. 

Me: I'm sorry sir, but I really dont know what you are talking about.

I try to walk past his truck, but he drove in front of me.

IA: DON'T YOU RUN FROM ME! I KNOW YOU WANT OUR VETS TO STAY OUT OF YOUR STORE, IN THE COLD, AND SELL THEIR POPPIES WHILE THEY GET SICK.

After another second of shock, I realized what he was talking about. A while ago, **ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY,** a few news stations picked up on a rumour that our stores will not let our veterans in our stores to sell poppies for Remembrance Day (In Canada, we wear poppies as a sign of respect for our soldiers that are living and lost.) The rumour was in fact considered a lie, and the story was retracted after our company and Veteran's Affairs stepped in to quell the outcry. 

Me: I'm sorry sir, but that was a false rumour and the newscasters have retracted the story.

IA: (Ignoring what I just said) LOOK AT THIS!

He didn't just give me the news story, he THREW it at me. It didn't even phase me at that point.

Me: Sir, that was a rumour and it was proved a lie, We would never do something like that.

IA: You listen to me...

Me: NO YOU LISTEN TO ME! You need to stop being ignorant and listen to the vets. Do you think they would issue a false statement? If our company really did that I would not even bother working here. I have lost many family members in the war and what you are doing is a disgrace to all men and women who fought and died for us. Get your facts straight before you make assumptions. And next time, talk to a higher up, not some kid in a rainy parking lot.

Talkahuano,15,24,1psec3,101,"I sell, among a thousand other items, dog collar batteries. This customer's battery was just 3 small button cell batteries shrinkwrapped together. The shrink wrap was totally unnecessary since the batteries simply slid into the collar. I know this for a fact because I've done dozens of these.

Gave the guy two options: the cheap alkaline version which is likely to run out quickly, or the expensive silver oxide version, which will last substantially longer.

Of course he says ""give me the cheapest.""

Sure thing bro, the cheapest crap for your dog, coming right up! I warn him they'll run out quickly. He doesn't care because it's cheap.

And who else should show up a week later, family in tow, complaining that the batteries didn't last? He claimed I knew they would fail and was trying to scam him. His wife piped in and said the lack of shrink wrap TOOK POWER AWAY FROM THE PACK. She said I didn't even sell her the same thing because it didn't have shrink wrap, so it *must* be a scam.

The man demanded that I warranty his cheap alkalines right away, but there is no such thing as an alkaline battery warranty. There has never been such a thing in any store. You buy your alkalines and if they suck, you're SOL.

I got yelled at about poor service and he raged about going to a competitor, where apparently, in his imaginary world, the competitor *warranties alkaline batteries*.

O.o

Alright buddy, good luck with that. Just spend the extra $4 next time and get the best stuff, ok?","""You have not provided good service!""",125
Lightfairy,29,8,1psdqc,40,"I may ruffle a few feathers with this post but here goes anyway. I have worked with customers on and off for the last 34 years. I started in retail at the age of 15 working weekends and holidays at a garden shop for a lovely gay couple. I might add that my mother was horrified and thoroughly vetted them prior to allowing me to work with them. With what I know now I wonder why. They were gay, I was a girl. Anyhooo!! One of my favourite jobs ever! Since then I have worked in more garden places, small corner stores, supermarkets and petrol stations. I have been a photographer and I have managed and cooked in restaurants. Worked in picture framing and as a handy woman. I have worked in offices dealing with the public by phone and in person. I did snake and crocodile shows for a few years as well, dealing with the public once again. I currently work in an adult shop. In short, I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. (I also fitted in a full time secretarial course, a university degree as a mature age student, a small business management certificate, a chefs apprenticeship (again mature age) and various other qualifications over the years). 

I have been sworn at, threatened, intimidated and hung up on. Nearly got burgled one night in a service station when working alone but that may be a story for another day. 

I have been reading TFR for quite a few months now (OK, I admit it, I am addicted!!) and I started contributing about a month or so ago. All of this got me wondering about the differences I see between America and the land of Oz where I reside. 

Reading TFR makes me think that American customers seem to think that they are the most entitled people ever! Screaming and yelling will get you things that in my country you just won't get! You would be asked to leave. I really wonder how you Americans put up with it?

Drugstores. What do they sell? I see references to pharmacies and they sell drugs. Got me wondering ....

The language used. 'Guests' and 'associates'. Here we call them 'customers' and 'co workers'. Or is the use of 'guests' and 'associates' used with a particular chain of stores?? There is a problem right there. A 'guest' is someone invited to a home or place. A 'customer' is, well, just a customer. Someone who may or may not piss me off for the next however long they are in my store!

So many stories of how often people cry when dealing with said customers. People are going to get out of bed on the wrong side, they are going to be angry that you can only do so much, they are going to scream, cajole, plead and beg. 
Keep this in mind. It isn't personal. I will repeat that. It isn't personal. Nothing is personal. They don't know you. They know nothing about you. They see someone with a name tag or a t-shirt with company name or a uniform for company and they just see company. You become the company they are angry at. OK, they might stand there saying you are incompetent or stupid or whatever but they are not really angry at you is my point. They are in most cases dealing with a company or large corporation and that makes them feel utterly impotent. One man against the machine so to speak. So they take it out on you. Remember that always young minions of large (or even small places of business). They are not angry at you. There is actually a psychological term for it. Look it up people. Displacement. Quote from Wikipedia 'In such scapegoating, aggression may be displaced onto people with little or no connection with what is causing anger'. Remember that one. Don't give them the satisfaction of seeing you upset. In their twisted, warped, angry way, they think they got one over the 'big corporation' they are actually angry at. Weird one, right??? 

I am lucky, in most places I have worked and in the one I am currently in, I can just tell people to piss off and threaten them with the cops if they don't. I tend not to as I get the best stories from the ones that cause the most trouble. Plus I have extremely thick skin from so many years of dealing with bat shit crazy people and don't generally let them get to me. 

Last one. Coupons!! What is it with Americans and coupons? How prevalent are they? Thankfully this is an almost non existent thing in my country. They do exist but on a relatively minor scale. From the stories in TFR the thought of them becoming a common occurrence here absolutely terrifies me!

esmereldas,3,8,1pscee,27,"I was at Party City the day before Halloween waiting at the checkout.  The cashier sniffled just a little bit, not much.

The woman went on and on about how she was buying napkins for her son's class and didn't want them sick.  She said ""I don't believe you just have allergies because I take allergy medicine and it controls my symptoms.  If my son's class get sick, it will all be on you.""  

I didn't speak up at first because I figured the 2 women must know each other for the customer to speak so rudely, but that was not the case.

Andrew said ""Sure, no problem!"". My boss realized that Andrew had Pop Music and also, Latin Pop. He started to laugh and screamed ""Andrew, you are so gay!

Kellynn,39,25,1ps8cg,121,"**Background:** I work at your friendly local fabric and craft store, where the weird customers never cease to amaze me. My stories either come from the weirdness of the register or from interacting with customers on the floor. 

**Story:** A few separate stories today from the past few weeks, all about my inability to control the prices that I do not make.

A customer comes up to the register. She's got a cut of fabric, a packet of trim and about five patterns. I begin ringing her items up, and give her her total. She stares at the pinpad for a long minute, and then declares the total is not to her liking. She tells me the patterns are supposed to be five for seven, and she checked the ad before she left, she double checked the dates are correct, she KNOWS these patterns are on sale. So we get an ad. The sale on those patterns starts in two days. So much for double checking the dates. I tell her they're not on sale. She slams the ad down and yells ""WHY CAN'T YOU JUST HONOR THIS?!"" I apologize and say they aren't on sale. She storms out without another word. 

Now, the office is up a few stairs and at the back of the store, and it opens up to the rest of the store. So as this woman storms out, I see one of my manager's heads pop up over the wall. ""Is that woman mad? Why is that customer mad? Did she just walk out angry? What happened? HOW COULD WE LOSE A SALE?!"" My coworker who is on the register next to me and I start trying to explain as the bitchy customer storms back in, declaring she needs the fabric. At this point my coworker takes over and I leave the register because I am not paid enough for this shit, I have been here since 6 AM, and I have other things to do. My manager radioed after the customer left to chew me out about how I needed to call a manager up the moment the customer seemed even slightly unhappy and how it's very important that we don't lose the sale. Oh, and they honored the sale for her. 

Today, I'm sick. I had a seven and a half hour shift that I made it through four and a half hours of before I was too dizzy and shaky to stand and had to keep going to the bathroom because I thought I was going to throw up, and they sent me home. But in that four and a half hours, I had no fucks to give. I had a customer come up and buy a bunch of fake candles and an extension cord. She begins to rant at length to me about how she hates that the cord is the wrong color, and why don't they make them in a different color, and why is it we're not immediately complying with her demands to make a new cord appear out of nowhere in the color she wants. I looked at her and only said ""I am not the person who makes these, ma'am. I only sell them."" 

Next customer comes up, wants to know the price of every. single. item. before she okays it. She puts up an expensive spool of thread, I give her the price, she freaks out. ""How can that be so expensive?! Why the hell does thread cost that much?! I am absolutely not paying for that, no way, I refuse to pay this much for it."" I looked her down and told her ""Ma'am. I do not make the prices on this thread, I cannot control how much this costs. All I do is ring it up."" She quieted right down and left and I was able to sit down behind my register and take a break before I fell over. 

But it was all okay, because I gave my notice yesterday and I will only be working there one more week. And my tales from the fabric store are soon to become tales from the makeup store. And I can't wait. :)",I do not make the prices around here.,146
thompsontoons_art,50,40,1przuj,144,"*Names are changed.

I'm working the closing shift at our bedding company's outlet store with two of my coworkers. It's about fifteen minutes before we lock up shop when the phone rings. My coworker Lorna* answers the phone, ""Thank you for calling. How may I help you?"" My other coworker and I proceed to listen to Lorna's one-sided conversation with the customer on the line. There are no other customers in the store, and we're pretty much just biding our time and hoping this particular phone customer doesn't keep us past hours.
""I would say it takes about five minutes to get here from downtown,"" Lorna explains to the phone customer. She continues to detail our product options in reply to the customer's questions and adds, ""Well, we close at six. If you're looking to buy a down comforter and aren't sure what you want exactly as far as warmth level and fill, this is probably something you should try to rush through in a matter of minutes. We open at 10am tomorrow... oh, you're leaving town tomorrow morning... Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am... I don't think we can do that... No, I don't think so... We close at six. Okay, have a nice evening."" Lorna looks at us and says, ""That woman's going to try to rush over here before we close. She's downtown at the other outlets. She asked if we would stay open for her...""
I groan and roll my eyes, ""She can try to get here before we close, but who is she to think we'll stay open for her? What makes her so special?""
My other coworker, Abby* looks at me wincing, ""Can we just lock the doors now?"" It's four minutes before we're supposed to close. 

This has happened before in the past: Customers either over the phone or in store just show no regard for the fact that we've reached closing hour, and they continue to keep shopping for up to an hour after closing even if we notified them that they've surpassed our open operation hours. It's been a long day, and the three of us want to go home. We're desperately wanting this evening to NOT be like one of those aforementioned nights.

We wait. Clock strikes 5:59pm, and I look at Abby and point to the far left entrance. ""Get that door first!"" Abby dashes for that door closest to the neighboring restaurant (from which we always get wandering browsers around the dinner hours while they wait for tables to open up). Lorna runs over to lock the main entrance on the other side of the store and shuts off the neon open sign. No sign yet of that customer who called us before. I start to pack up the cash box and close out the registers. I look at the clock just as a car pulls up to the left side entrance. The driver's headlights are blaring through the glass doors, and I see her step out of her car, leave her car door open, yank on the door handle to find that it is indeed locked. She yanks on the door again. I mumble to myself, ""Nope. It's still locked the second time, lady. It's 6:03... we told you that we close at 6pm. You're late."" I watch her get back into her car and eventually drive away. 

Lorna and Abby regroup near the registers after shutting all the main lights out, and Lorna asks if that lady ever showed up. ""Yes she did,"" I reply. Lorna mentioned how the customer tried to explain how our shop was a main attraction while she was in town and that she really wanted to buy some of our products in store as opposed to shopping our stuff online or through our catalog. 
""Honestly, if this was an important stop for her, I wonder why she waited. I would think a priority stop would be the first you make. I think the A&amp;F and the Gap outlets were higher priorities to her if she spent all day downtown.""",We Close at Six.,184
Scratchums,24,59,1pry8t,179,"So I work at a clothing store, pretty well known brand, which has a unisex fitting room.  I was on duty there, unlocking doors, taking unwanted items, processing them, etc.  In one stall we had a mother and her young son, maybe 8-10, and in the next one an older lady, maybe mid-40s.  It's a Saturday, so it's pretty busy.  There are maybe 3-4 other stalls occupied, too.

Suddenly I hear, ""Oh god there's pee all over!""
And all I could think to say was, ""...Wha?""  Because the restrooms are literally also in the fitting room.  And these two stalls happen to be next to the restroom.  This cry, however, was coming from a fitting room stall.

The woman and son run out of the first stall and the kid is going bananas.  I peek in and yep, somehow there is pee on the floor, seeping in from the next stall.  People are staring at me.  I've only been working here for a few days.  I've plenty of customer service experience, but I've never had someone pee on another person... So I knock on the second stall.

""Umm, ma'am?  Are you all right in there?""

I glance under the stall and her feet are moving but she's saying nothing, and the woman and especially the kid are going bananas, so I use my walkie talkie to call for a manager and step outside for a sec.  The first thing the manager asks is, ""Well.. is she dead, or something?""  ""What, no.. she's moving.  Things are getting awkward though.""

And when I got back the door to stall two opened.  The mother, the loud son, and several customers are watching her, and she proclaims to all around her, ""Yes!  I admit it, I had an accident.  But that is no reason to scream and panic and treat me like less than a human being!  Y'all don't know me!  My name is [redacted] and I'm from [other state], I'm not even from here!  Sir, I will clean my own mess if you would get me the supplies.""  I told her that wasn't necessary; a manager was on his way and he'd already volunteered to clean it.  Unfortunately, she insisted and stuck around.  The mother and son decided it was a great time to yell at the woman, kid first:  ""She got pee on me!!""  over and over and over again.  After a very awkward ""Y'all don't know me!"" sort of confrontation, she made her way to the front of the store, near checkout, and began flailing around.  Eventually police were called and demands were made for the woman to be arrested, but I don't believe anything really came of it except maybe some, ""Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to calm down"" because the lady was still with us at the time, in the fitting room.

I kept my cool.  I have a respectable poker face and can remain neutral in retail horror, but what escalated it was how the lady was totally unapologetic.  Obviously she didn't mean to pee in a fitting room and certainly not on someone else's kid, and maybe some people can forgive that because she's right, they didn't know her or her problems, but she went from embarrassed to indignant very quickly.  The peak was definitely emerging from the stall with arms outstretched, as if to say, ""Yes, my children.  I am the piss messiah.  Look upon me, and know me.""","""She got pee on me!!""",238
ginabeena,53,58,1prohx,255,"Okay, yesterday was Friday so it was pretty busy, but I had a short four hour shift so it wasn't all too bad for me. Except all of our ""main"" registers were being used to I hopped on one of the back registers.

Where I work, the farther way the register is from the front door, the longer the line is. I will never understand that logic, but whatever. I was on a register pretty close to the door so even though we were super busy, I had yet to ring anyone out in the first thirty minutes so I was just cleaning.

My supervisor asked me to move to register 16 to help the line at the Speedy Checkouts down. The most hated register because everyone just stops there no matter what.

I didn't turn my light on and I called a lady over from another line. She only had two things so another lady gets in line behind her. Lady #1 tells Lady #2 that I wasn't open, but Lady #2 continues to put her stuff on my belt anyway.

Well, the first thing I scanned asked for a serial number. It didn't have a serial number so I had to wait for a supervisor to come override it. Lady #2 huffed and puffed while Lady #1 apologized. The second thing rung up and the lady said the sign said it was about $15 cheaper than what it was ringing so I call my supervisor over and she calls the department it was from and we wait. Lady #2 goes ""Oh my god! Can't you just skip her?!""

Well, I could...but I was tired of Lady #2, so I say ""No, but there are plenty of other registers open with no line."" She replies ""But I already put my stuff up!!!""

We wait some more.

Lady #2 moves one register up.

The person from the department brings the thing up that Lady #1 confused the price with. Lady #1 is done. Lady #2 turns around and gives me the most shocked/disgusted face. Like if looks could kill, I would be dead.

It was Saturday afternoon at a large supermarket. I had finished my shopping and was trying to drive out of the car park.

A woman was pushing her trolley slowly down the road within the car park. Straddling the white line, so she was blocking both lanes and couldnt easily be passed. Never mind... I just stayed in my lane and hung back, giving her space, inching forward at her slow ambling pace. 

Eventually she looked over her shoulder and noticed me. She turned round and screeched at me, a tirade which I didnt entirely catch but the gist of which was 'what the hell are you doing?' 

I instinctively replied 'Im driving'.

She moved over to one side to shout at me through my driver's window, which gave me the space to pull away &amp; drive off.

But honestly? What was I doing? Giving you space and time to move, even though you were ignoring the pavements, and if you chose one side of the road OR the other, thered be room for both of us. 

I hope she hasnt got kids, it would be awful for them to hear her high pitched irrational head-biting rants. At least I could tell myself that for whatever reason, I was having a better day than her at this point!

Little backstory as to why, Sunday 27th Oct there were heavy storms in SE UK, this ruined the train tracks on Monday 28th Oct and because I live in a tiny village with trains that only go hourly, I could not get into work. I call into work about 3:00PM to give notice to my boss, *who is the manager of the kitchen,* that I can't make it in for my 4-7.30PM shift. The second I call in I say ""Hey [boss], sorry but I can-"" and before I can even finish, [boss] says ""No no no no no, you cannot do this. I've already had [coworker] call in sick so you absolutely have to come in."" I make him aware of the train system, [boss] replies back asking if I could get a lift or even a taxi. I reply no as there wasn't anyone available to give me a lift at this point, and I did not have cash on me to get a taxi (even if I did have cash on me, it's about £25 taxi ride to get to my work, I would've only earned about £17 that shift so it would not have been worth it). [Boss]'s words were ""Alright, we'll talk about this when you're next in"" and immediately hangs up. 

I know my boss well, and when [boss] gets pissed off then [boss] will refuse to give you shifts. [Boss] won't fire you, [boss] doesn't have the required information to do that. However, in my contract it does state that I can refuse work, and the company can refuse to give it to me. 

For the next two weeks, I have received **zero** shifts. Two weeks from the day of this being posted (saturday), there is a shift going from 4-7.30PM that is completely blanked out, i.e. requiring someone to cover. The close-down shifts from 4-7.30 preferably need 3 people to efficiently close the place down in time, I can *very* easily do that shift and have been doing it for the 14-15 months that I've been working there. I did not receive that shift, instead [boss] decided to leave the two workers on that day a man short, thus giving them more work to do. 

I will not take this shit, [boss] is a huge bully and I am standing up to him first thing next week. He has no grounds to do this, especially leaving workers a person short.

TL;DR my boss practically fires me, whilst dragging down other employees with him.

* Junkie visit thestore quite often, at one time two meth heads walk in demanding cold mixed berry passion pop ( a cheap fruity flavoured champagne). They each have cream from donuts on their face and beard and are obviously high has fuck. One of them asks me to watch his stuff by leaving it at the counter. His stuff comprised of an empty can of coke, the latest issue of MILFS, and a half eaten donut. As payment for looking after his stuff, he gave me info cards for local hookers.

* We used to have a homeless man who would come in every now and then, buy some beers sit outside and just drink and cool off. On this one particular day he walks in, buys his booze..opens it up outside, takes a sip and walks back in and says, 'How many have i had?'. I told him just the one, he said 'Good, not my mind playing tricks on me outside'

I go to check what he means, int he car park are two squad cars, 3 undercover police cars, 4 CID (detectives)and 4 street cops arresting and patting down two 13 year old boys. They were the perpetrators of burning down a group of new apartment buildings in the area and were on the way to burn another.

* A customer walked in, high off his face with a hooker he hired for the night. He asks for a case of Jack Daniels and cola and their price, after giving him the price he begins to haggle. He proposes to my co-worker that the hooker will suck him off, if he gives the case to him for free. Refusing him of his offer to be sucked off by a toothless crack whore he then accepts the JD cans for the price, but when the co-worker gets back from the fridge, the customer has left with his hooker. He decides to re-run the camera to make sure he didn't steal anything, the only thing the customer did do was wipe his balls and dick the very computer my co-worker was using to search the camera footage.

*Bikies are the best customers for us, they seem to have an attitude of 'Don't shit where you live"" and treat us rather well, must be a protecting the community thing. One one day two meatheads were giving me trouble, they were stealing bottles of spirits, yelling at customers and ringing in the store which we don't allow.

Hokxj,12,41,1pqru8,150,"Hi Reddit! Long time lurker, first time poster.

Long wall of text:  
Some background information, I sell phone and contracts for a telco. As part of an add on, we also sell phone insurance for a third party company. A lot of customers are peeved that if they make a claim, there's an excess fee (similar to any insurance company) of $150. 

So today I had a customer who had lost his iPhone 5 which had insurance about it. He was understandably angry about it. I swapped his sim card so that whoever had his phone couldn't make calls from it. I sent him to the police so he could get a police report. Now our company procedure states that the customer needs to make the claim either online or over the phone.

**Mistake number 1**: Since the insurance company is closed on the weekend, I pitied him, so I let him use a computer to make a claim. Note: all my colleagues recommend telling the customer to call up themselves. 

When our angry customer returned from the police he was visibly angry since the police refused to track his phone. 

Angry Customer: There MUST be a way to track that phone. Can you guys track it?
Me: Sorry sir, but only the police have that power, it's illegal for us to do it as per privacy laws. 
Angry Customer: That's not good enough, I'm paying you guys for a service, give me some service.

**Mistake number 2** Me: Well if you have Find My iPhone and iCloud, you could possibly try that. 
Note: NOWHERE in our policy/procedures does it say we should/could/have to do this. Half my colleagues probably don't even know Find My iPhone exists. 

So we log into iCloud, and you guessed it, Find My iPhone doesn't work. 

Me: Do you have Find My iPhone installed?

Angry Customer: Why didn't you do this before you swapped the sim? Why did you wait until now? (He completely ignored my question)

Me: Sir, Find My iPhone will only work if you have it installed and set up on the phone. The phone doesn't come set up with it. 

Angry Customer: You're not even listening! You should've done this before you swapped the sim card. As far as I'm concerned you've just cost me $150!

Luckily my colleague witnessed the whole thing and stepped in to put the customer in his place. 

But this whole situation has left a sour taste in my mouth, it only takes one bad customer to change everything. Sorry in advance to anyone I push away to customer care over the phone and not help, from my experiences, all it does by trying to help is create conflict and create additional workload for me. 

What have I learnt from this situation? 
1. Don't suggest Find My iPhone
2. Push the customer away and tell them to make the claim themselves. I could've avoided this whole situation if I hadn't tried being nice and starting the online claim.

I work at a place that has some retail stores and also takes phone orders. We sell lots of old time products and as such a lot of our customers are nice older people who want to get something that reminds them of their childhood. I work in the call center, and one of my jobs is to take phone orders when we're busy or I'm not needed for some of the other things I do. Mostly I get a lot of nice older men and women, and I've heard some awesome stories (one man told me a story of how his ship was sunk in the attack on Pearl Harbor, really cool guy) and I really love my job. However, since we are such a great company, we also have some 'customers' that like to call and take advantage, and I've gotten familiar with many of them. I have some other stories besides this one I'll probably share at some point when I get around to it.

One such 'customer', and I use quotes because he never really buys anything, is 'Toni.' Toni is a man who likes to crossdress, and I have no problem with that - whatever floats your boat and doesn't sink mine. We have several crossdressing customers that like to order clothes from us because the staff is so nice and friendly and we'll help you find what you need. Toni takes advantage of this and likes to call and try to get a rise out of us, and really what he's doing is involving whoever he gets on the phone in his fetish. He's never too outlandish about it, so I usually go along with it because it doesn't bother me. This one particular time was hilarious, though, and I have to share.

Toni calls up and does his usual spiel, I'm a man who grew breasts, I feel ashamed, my cousin told me I should just dress as a woman and people with leave me alone (that totally happened), what do you have for bras, do you think what I'm doing is wrong, will wearing bras make me feminine, blah blah blah. I go along with it, as always. He hangs up, we're done.

Before this next part I'll say quickly that he doesn't like to talk to you if he's talked to you before, because he knows you know what he's going to say. Once when I didn't feel like talking to him and the phones were busy and I needed to help real customers, I just said something like, ""Oh! I think we've talked before! I'd love to help you."" And he was off the phone in two minutes. Easy. I'll also say we have caller ID and I know his number. 

So when I get a phone call again and see his number, I know this is going to be good. We always answer the phone with our names, so he hears mine again and pretends to not be the person I was just talking to and asks some stupid question about a product. I answer, he hangs up. Phone rings again. Him AGAIN. Looks like everyone else is on the phone so all calls are coming to me. He hears my name, just hangs up.

Wait 15 minutes. Phone rings. Him a third time, what are the odds? This time, though, he doesn't simply hang up. He *fakes a lady's voice*, tells me he has the wrong number, apologizes, and hangs up. It was also the cheesiest, most awful fake voice ever, all high pitched with his voice cracking. I have to take myself off the phone for a few minutes after, I'm laughing so hard. Needless to say, that was the last time he tried to call us that night.

TL;DR Customer fakes a lady voice to get off the phone with me.","You could have just hung up, but it's funnier this way.",90
Owl_n_fowl,8,13,1pqkfp,51,"I used to work in a quite well-known fast food store in a shopping centre. As it was in a shopping centre, our main customers were the elderly and the unemployed. 
I had this one customer, who we nicknamed ""fugative lady"" because she always wore sunglasses, a hoodie and carried a backpack, who came in several times a week and ALWAYS had something to complain about. 
Well, this particular store was closing, and in our last week, I was working in the kitchen and managing the store when this woman comes in to complain her burger is cold. No worries, put fresh product down for her, politely ask her to wait, get new (perfect) burger. She comes back again, demanding to speak with a manager because her burger tastes funny. I come out of the kitchen, introduce myself as the manager and ask what the issue is. She says ""I come here all the time and this burger is wrong, whoever made it is stupid, can't to their job etc etc"". I calmly tell her that I infact made this burger, all the ingredients were fresh and it is correct to the best of my ability, I offer her another burger or a refund, when she loses it ""YOU ARE STUPID YOU CAN'T EVEN MAKE A FUCKING BURGER RIGHT WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GIVE ME MY MONEY I AM NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN"". I accept this, apologise again and tell her it won't be a problem as this store is closing tomorrow, have a nice life. 
The next day I see her walking up to the counter, so I stand at the register with a big smile to greet her, she recognises me and quickly changes direction. Sucker.

It's actually pretty slow tonight and not many customers and i'm done with my shift in about 6 minutes. Anyway, she hands me the wallet and says there is nothing else she would like to purchase when she receives a phone call. ""hold on"" she says and starts talking on her phone. I have no idea if she's talking about the item she wants to buy on the phone because she's not speaking english.

EndlessNerd,11,25,1pqgsf,131,"A few years ago at the hobby shop, an older gentleman and his grandson come into the store.  
The boy had saved up money over the summer, and wanted to buy a radio controlled car or boat.  
After showing them a few items, they decided on a higher end brushless racing boat and two expensive lipo batteries.  
They purchased with a credit card and left.
Pretty straight forward right?  
A week or so later, a couple come into the store with the boat and the batteries wanting to return them.  
It was still wet from being sunk.  
The boy had wrecked and sank the boat, and they left it under water for a few days before pulling it up.  
The parents first argued that it was defective, which we weren't buying.  We told them we'd be happy to call the manufacturer for them to help them get replacement parts, as the company had a pretty good customer service.  
They weren't interested.  They just wanted to return everything.  
We again explained, that we don't take back used items, the return policy is printed right on the receipt.  
They reasoned that the boy shouldn't have bought the boat, that the grandfather had talked him into it, but it was a bad idea, and they wanted their money back.  
After a final refusal, and offer to help fix it from the manager, they left.  
About a week later, we get a call from the bank.  
The couple had initiated a charge back, claiming we sold them a defective product, or the like.  
The bank was actually pretty cool about it, they talked to the boss a bit, and he faxed over the receipts and return policies, and explained to them that we obviously can't take back used lipo batteries that had been submerged in water, and if there was something wrong with the boat, they should have brought it back to us straight away, not played with it until it sank.  
In the end, we won the dispute, but it was a pain in the ass.

thisiswhyihatemyjob,16,6,1pqe13,14,"Hello, TFR. I'm currently at my wits end with my job. Retail sucks, of course, but this is me complaining about the shitty place I work and also needing some advice.

I'm not even sure where to start. There are so many little things I'm sick of putting up with. I guess I'll begin with the biggest things that have happened. I work at the service desk at my job and one of the things we do back there is gift wrapping. Now, this is brought back after years of not having it and keep in mind, I've only worked here five months.

I cannot gift wrap. I can't. I've done it before and I did a horrible job because it was for family. They weren't being charged for it obviously. I don't feel right about wrapping someone's presents with my skills and then charging them. I've told my managers this and even asked for training, but nope. 

The other day a lady came to me with a slow cooker and asked for it to be wrapped. I called my manager and asked if she could do it. She told me no, she didn't know how. She told me to call L in furniture and ask her to do it. I called L, L didn't know how. She tells me she'll go get someone from children's. She comes back with D. I liked D and I always thought she liked me as well.

D bitched the whole time about having to wrap that slow cooker. I thanked her over and over, but she was rude to me and complained the whole time. I ignored it and was just happy it was being done. D finished and walked back to her department, muttering insults along the way. A little while later, it was my break time. Now let me explain. There are about three rows of lockers. If I stand at my locker, you cannot see me unless you are beside me.

Well, I hear my name and it went a little something like this.

D: You know, I can't stand thisiswhyihatemyjob. I shouldn't have to gift wrap anything. The thing about her is that she *always* wants help, but *never* wants to help anyone else. She's annoying and doesn't know how to do anything.

Male Voice (I end up recognizing it's my other MANAGER D. I'll call him DR to differentiate.): Oh, I know. You're right. You are completely right.

They go on to insult me further. I also do not know what they meant by I don't help because I help whenever I can and come in on my days off and everything. Without thinking, I come from behind my locker and walk over to them. D's mouth drops and DR has the deers in a headlight look.

Me: Is there something you need to speak to me about?

DR: No, of course not! No. No. Nope.

Me: Okay, I just thought you did. 

Then I walk away pretty pissed off that my freaking manager was talking about me. I think as a manager that is huge no no, but apparently I'm wrong. He also denied everything which pissed me off as well.

This is the first of many things that happened and it only gets worse. My question for this story is can I talk to someone higher up about my manager talking bad about me or should I just chalk it up to gossip? I just think a manager is supposed to be more professional than that and if someone is complaining about me, they should sit me down and discuss it and not just chip in with the shit talking.

Anyway, part 2 coming soon if anyone cares to read it!

PWND_U_IN_MK,24,17,1pqbrs,63,"This is how ringing up a customer should work:

You put your stuff on the counter, I scan your stuff. You give me money, I give you a receipt. You leave.

This is how a transaction normally goes at my store:

I say ""Hello, did you find everything you needed today?""
You place your basket full of stuff on the counter, I remove the basket full of stuff from the counter. While holding said basket, I place the objects from the inside of the basket on the counter. I place the basket behind the register area creating a tripping hazard.

I begin scanning your items. I ask, ""Do you have your store specific Loyalty Discount card with you today?""

You reply ""Yes.""

I make a mental plan to scan your card after I am done scanning your items. I look up after I am finished scanning your items and place my hand on the scanner so I can scan your card with it. I see you with your head down, facing the digital keypad.

""It's not working."" you inform me.

""Oh, you have the number?"" I reply.

You don't respond, so I click the prompt on the computer that let's you enter your phone number to look up your loyalty/discount card.
""It should be working now."" I say, as I place my hand on the largest item of your purchase.

You jab your soft digit into the digital pinpad, making me cringe as the point of your pointer finger bends with each stab. 

You grow visually frustrated as the pinpad refuses to respond to your abuse.

""It may help to use the pen."" I suggest indicating to the stylus that is only millimeters from your hand. You grab it reluctantly, and use it to continue your violent assault.

""Will you need plastic bags tonight?"" I inquire half heartedly, seeing how you only have one item and it is already packaged with a built in handle.

This breaks your concentration, causing you to forget your own phone number. You begin re-entering the number without answering me. I push the item a bit closer to your side of the counter, as a reminder to myself that you did not request bagging.

Finally you win the war against the digital keypad. ""Press No unless you are interested in making a donation."" I inform you. Of course this is not what I am supposed to say here, but I frankly have my doubts about where that money goes. You manage to press No this time.

""Your total will be $XX.XX today."" I say while immediately tapping the credit/debit button, so the card reader will be ready.

Somehow you have already swiped your card and placed it back in your wallet, usually you do this while I am still scanning the items.

""You may have to swipe the card again, I don't think it took the first time."" I apologize as you make the humongous effort to remove the plastic card from your still open wallet.

As you swipe I chime in ""Credit or debit?"" Hopeing and praying that you choose credit.

""I need to get money, which one is that?"" you ask, as you always do, each time you visit.

""Debit, you will have to enter your pin, choose a cash back amount, and verify your total.""

You attack the machine again with your finger, managing to get your 4 digit pin typed in after a few tries. ""Fordee"" you inform me.

""You'll have to enter it down there. And then confirm the total."" I remind you, again.

You click the ""$40"" dollar option with another defiant battery of fingers.

You look back up at me and wait.

Are you fucking kidding me.

""You have to verify the total."" I plead.

You nod your head to signal your verification.

""On the pin pad."" I say pointing toward it.

""Oh"" you respond looking at the total before pressing ""no.""

Really?

""You have to press yes to verify the total.""

We repeat the entire process of processing your payment, beginning with my explanation that you have to swipe your card again.

Finally your receipt receipt prints which I hand to you, along with your cash back, so that you may make sure you got all the sales that were advertised.

""Have a Good Night."" I say expecting you to leave the counter and allow me to help the next customer.

""You too."" You reply...standing in place, staring at me.

I wait patiently.

I look down at your un-bagged item. and then back at you asking ""Did you need a bag tonight?""

""Of course I do, I'm walking."" you respond professing your inability to carry even a half-gallon of milk more than 2 blocks unless it is in a thin plastic bag.

I bag your item, and hold it out to you. ""Have a good night.""

""Thank you."" You reply while giving me the impression that it's actual meaning is that I should go stuff myself.

You aren't even one of the ""bad"" customers just the average one.

Thank god I am not a cashier any more, wooh management.",The process of ringing a customer.,80

Customer: Is there a cure for that condition? o.O",Overheard at the grocery store--is there a cure for that?,174
RedRing14,87,288,1pq91s,990,"Hello again TFR.  Yesterday I posted about the one day I completely lost my cool and went super saiyan.  Wall of text in coming.

Background again just in case.  I worked at a game reselling store that was connected to a movie rental place.  It was one of and will probably be the best job I had.  Started there on my 18th birthday (had to be 18) and was basically (and for a short time was) managing it on and off. 

Alright so at my store I had tons of regulars and got to know them pretty well.  Some of them became a family away from my actual and my work family.  Even today some 4 years later I still see them and we talk like we saw each other just yesterday.  There was one customer named jason who came in often with his grandma.  He never bought anything and was just happy looking.  If he did ask to buy something his grandma said it would be too hard for him.  He would talk to me from time to time and tell me about his sonic game and how he loved to play it but had beat it numerous time (sonic 1 on genesis).  I always thought if he could play that then surely anything he looked at on ps2 was going to be just fine.  One day his grandma pulls me to the side. 

Gma: We come in here a lot and jason has decided to call you a friend.

Me: That's good.  He's a really good kid and I enjoy him coming in.

Gma: I notice you never asked why we never buy anything and I respect that.  Jason has autism so the games are just to hard for him to learn the controls.

Me: Oh I see.  Well I won't say anything to him about it and you know you guys are always welcome in here and we will help as much as we can.

Fast forward a couple of weeks on a monday afternoon where  we are usually dead as all get out.  Day before game releases were very calm.  I only needed one other person and they were already on the clock when in comes jason and his grandma.  They look around and jason sees a game that he wants more than anything I've ever seen him look at.  Legend of spyro for the PS2.  His grandma told him it would be way to hard.  The look on his face when she said that pulled on every heart string I had.

I pulled his grandma to the side while he looked at the game and asked how long they thought they would be in the store.  She said until she got tired and then they would go grocery shopping at the store at the end of our strip.  So I ask if I can put the game into the demo unit.  She was hesitant at first but decided to go ahead and let him.  About an half hour into the game he is starting to get upset and she starts to get tired. I put my office chair near her to sit down and start talking to jason and kinda walking him through how to play.  Another hour goes by and he is getting the hang of it but she decides to go shopping.  I convince her to let him stay and pick him up whenever she is done which she agrees to do.  

He is loving the game and I can see it.  He has a look on his face I've seen all to many times.  While he is playing I tell my coworker to leave him alone and I'll be right back.  I walk over to the grocery store and find her.  I ask her if she has any problems with him getting the game.  She says she doesn't really want to buy the game if he can't play it.  I ask again and she gives the same answer so I tell her not to worry about that I'll take care of it.  She agrees although hesitantly.

I go back to the store and look up the barcode for the memory card he is using and the one for his game and ring them up.  Use my extra store credit from my old non employee account I never was bothered to put on a gift card and finalize everything.  She comes in and he gets really sad that he has to end the game.  I go to turn it off and when I do I eject the game, take the memory card out, and put them together in the case with the receipt.  He doesn't understand at first and starts to put the game back on the case so I go out from around the counter and tell him to open the game case.  In that second I see the happiest expression I have ever seen.  He runs to his grandma who is now visibly choked up about it and shows her.  She is speechless but manages to say ""That's amazing jason"".  He walks over to me and says ""Thank you redring14, I will beat this game just like you showed me"".  He then gave me a hug which made his grandma and I break out into tears.  She takes him out of the store and they left.  Later that night I get a call from her saying he has been playing the game all night (4 hours if I recall) and is loving it.  I explain how happy I am and tell her if it gets to be too much to bring the game in and we can switch it out or I can show him how to progress through that part.   About 2 weeks later he came in and bought the second game and apparently had been doing extra chores to be able to buy it.  

I see them every now and then.  Jason has been doing a lot better in school lately and is still gaming.  Gaming has allowed him to make connections and friendship with people.  He always is happy to see me and always gives me a high five and sometimes still a hug.  This kid is honestly the best thing to come out of retail for me so far and I am so happy to have worked that day with him.  To watch him go from the 8 year old who couldn't really play any games to a kid who is now understanding just about any game you put in front of him.  To see how that experience made something where he could relate learning with his autism and make it basically non existent now.  Every year I get a Christmas card from his grandmother and him and every time I am told what game his is playing and its always got something about spyro on it even if its just the picture of spyro sitting on their fireplace.  They go in my bank lock box so that nothing happens to them.

obscurethestorm,39,19,1pq84g,72,"...sort of. I didn't really ""yell"" as much as give a ""stern talking to"".

I work at the service desk under a blue light.

Normally, we have 13 registers that can be run and used if need be. We have 9 up front (3 at service) and the rest are around the perimeter, like Pharmacy, Electronics, Layaway, and Jewelry. Yesterday, all but 3 decided to go down. As you can probably guess, this gave us quite a day with angry customers and long lines. 

One of our registers that had been down came back up for maybe 20 minutes, which helped us check people out pretty quickly, but didn't allow to get rid the lines, as we were having a pretty big rush (it was about 4 in the afternoon, with people trying to get last minute costumes). As you can imagine, it went down again, and all the people were directed into another (long) line.

Another cashier, we'll call her A, started ringing up people next to me (I was working a line and so was she) while we were at service desk, when this happened. For now, the customer will be NN!, for No Numbers!.

&gt;A: Hello, sorry about the wait. Can I please get your phone number?

&gt;NN!: NO! I don't give that out!

&gt;A: Oh, that's okay. Do you have our rewards membership? That's why I ask, but we can also look it up by ema-

&gt;NN!: NO! I JUST TOLD YOU THAT I WILL NOT GIVE YOU MY NUMBER.

A continues to ring her up, no longer asking questions.

&gt;NN!: Honestly, I don't understand why you just wont leave me alone. STOP HARASSING ME. YOU NEED TO LEARN TO RESPECT YOUR ELDERS AND BEHAVE YOURSELF.

&gt;A: I'm sorry ma'am, we are required to ask about the membership.

&gt;NN!: I DIDN'T ASK FOR YOUR SMART MOUTH, AND I DON'T CARE FOR YOUR ATTITUDE.

This is why I was finally fed up. We've all had a rough day, we have lines of customers out the ass, and you need to shut the fuck up, you crazy hoe.

&gt;Me: Ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to please stop screaming. You're alarming the other customers.

&gt;NN!: I WILL NOT BE TOLD WHAT TO DO BY SOME IGNORANT BRAT!

&gt;Me: Ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to please stop yelling and please respect our cashiers. We're all just doing our job.

&gt;NN!: YOU'VE KEPT US ALL WAITING AND WE'RE SICK OF IT, AND WE DON'T LIKE YOUR ATTITUDES. Honestly, I DO NOT KNOW why on EARTH I SHOP HERE!

&gt;Me: Ma'am, the wait is out of our control. The registers shut down and there was nothing we could do about it. We're working on fixing the issue right now.

&gt;NN!: WELL I DON'T CARE IF YOU FIX THE ISSUE, I JUST WANT TO GET OUT OF LINE. I'M SICK OF YOU ENTITLED BRATS ASKING ME QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT TO BUY MY STUFF WITHOUT HARASSMENT!

&gt;Me: Ma'am, please stop screaming. All I'm asking is that you treat everyone here with the respect you'd want to be treated with.

&gt;NN!: GET ME YOUR MANAGER, I'M FILING A COMPLAINT! THIS STORE IS HORRIBLE, I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DON'T FIRE YOU ALL. I'M SO SICK OF YOU SCREAMING AT ME, DON'T YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO RESPECT ME, I'M THE CUSTOMER! I'M YOUR ELDER!

I had called for my manager right before I started to tell her to shut up, because I just knew that I'd need her. She was coming up right as NN! yelled for her.

A finished out the transaction and NN! paid before going off with my manager, who told her she'd take the complaint, or she could complain online to our feedback survey.

To which she responded: YOU PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO GET MY INFORMATION, I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE MY INFORMATION! I JUST MIGHT DO THAT SURVEY, I'M SO TIRED OF YOU PEOPLE.

Then, basically, she told my manager that A and I had been complete bitches to her and that we were harassing people in the line and goofing off instead of actually working (which was just terribly untrue, as we had been checking people out for a solid two or three hours nonstop).

I checked today online, and no survey from NN!. It felt weird to stand up to a customer like that, but I'm not going to just stand idly by while you treat another human being, who is just doing their job, like a piece of shit because you had to wait a little bit for reasons that no one could control. It's not our fault our store is in a constant state of shut down due to lack of funding.

TheMadCat,12,13,1ppyuz,35," So I work at [party store]. My job during this season is to stand in front of a wall of pictures, aptly named ""The Picture Wall"", and assist customers with getting their costumes for the holiday we just survived.

 The way it works is as followed: 

* **You, the customer, pick out a costume, and remember the number and size you need.** 

* **Me, the ""Halloween Expert"" in the blinding orange vest will use the walkie-talkie attached to my ear to radio back to my boys in the back your number and size.** 

* **You will wait until I say to head over to pick-up. Do not head over there before I say it's ready, otherwise you have a good chance of waiting around for nothing. Sometimes we are out of the costume you want. You will wait and not wander around because I will forget what you look like or that you even existed, because damn it I work with hundreds of people every day.**

I am usually out here alone, unless the line gets stupid long (which happens), then it's just me and one other associate. 
Sometimes I have to run to the back and grab costumes myself, sometimes I have to run special items to the front (this will be explained later).

And at the end of the day, if I'm lucky enough to be scheduled for closing, I have the privilege of going down all 10 huge isles, straightening things, and putting back sometimes 7-8 **FULL** carts of items. (Aptly named ""Go Backs"")

This week I've worked overtime several times, and today is my first day off in 8 days. 

 I have stories of bad customers, hilarious new friends, great customers, catty coworkers, justice (minor, at least), great bosses, disgusting finds on the floor, one case of ""What the actual fuck"" that can't be spoiled, and many more that will probably come to mind later. As well as the story about how I ruined Halloween for this one family. 
 I just thought I'd publish a rundown of how things work because the Wall can be confusing. Especially for customers. 

 It will all become clear soon. 

**TL;DR: WELCOME TO THE [PARTY STORE], GET IN LINE AND FUCKING WAIT**



*What do you mean the costume with the LARGE green sticker that says ""Coming Soon"" isn't here???* 

 The sticker in question means that we are out of stock/do not carry the item yet. It's slapped on so people don't ask for it. Later in the month we had to stop using them for reasons that will be explained. 
Now, for a tidbit to get you started. 

 Let's start with Minions. Minions, as in [these things from the Despicable Me franchise](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111001202713/protagonist/images/8/88/Despicable-me-minions.jpg). 

 We have four designs for these characters. *And they never arrived.* (Actually, that's not true, four days before Halloween we got a shipment in that had 4 infant Minion costumes inside.) 
People went **fucking bananas** over these costumes. Is the movie popular? I liked the first one but never watched the second. 

 But every few minutes I was bombarded by people asking about the sticker and why was it on the Minion costumes and where are the Minion costumes and you don't have Minion costumes and do you at least have the glasses and by the way do you have Minion costumes

We don't. Stop asking. We didn't have it the first time you asked, we won't have it the second either.

 I had a lady come in again and complain that we still didn't have it, and she looked like she was going to hit me. 
(And you must understand, I'm constantly mistaken for a twelve year old, and these are grown parents who probably can't stomach the idea of a child telling them ""no"".) 

So why didn't we get them in? We're not sure. I think there was a distribution problem. No one got enough, some got none.

Minion costume prices skyrocketed online. Someone told me one was going for 140 dollars somewhere. Some people realized the problem early and bought all of them to sell. Smart. Asshole behavior, but good business tactics I suppose. 

This is the first of many. I will return, my pretties, with a delectable tale of..whichever I decide to write first.

**Background**
Among the various customers we get coming into the store for app support, obliterated screens and 1D10T errors, we occasionally get a misguided soul that believes we can track their lost or stolen phone.  

Now it should be noted that several different companies offer apps you can download to track your phone if this happens to you. Then the user can log on to the website at home and perform different functions based on the apps features. However, the cell phone company does not do this for users. The only reason we would trace a phone is in a police emergency. 

**On to the story. **
I'm standing near the door when I see a purple van coming hurtling into our lot and into a handicapped spot next to the door. The passenger is throwing the door open before the cars even in park and is aggressively stomping to the door while the driver slaps up a handicap sign. 

The guy rips out door open and it's apparent from this guys face he is *very* angry. He's at least 6' 200lbs. Before I can utter a word the guy growls out:

Angry Hulk (AH): I need you to track my phone. Someone just stole it! 

AH is visible shaking and panting, I take a minute hoping he'll gain some composure. When that obviously isn't happening I begin to give him the bad news. 

Me: I'm sorry sir we don't have that capability. We only track phones in a police emergency. Unless you installed an app to track it yourself, there's not much you can do. 

I'm holding my breath and trying not to gag. The smell of this guy is unreal. Pure sweat and filth. I'm mentally prepared for the backlash I get from most customers when the guy bolts out the door past his friend who's just now entered the store. As he leaves he lets out a frustrated scream and runs up to the van an proceeds to beat in the front quarter panel with his bare fists. 

The entire store full of customers and associates stop and stare. His friend runs out after him when he starts to move towards the vehicles windows. We all watch in morbid fascination as his friend struggles to pull him away from the vehicle, one of my coworkers is hovering prepared to call the cops in case of an altercation. Suddenly AH runs from his friend and sprints down the street. 

Everyone in the store is now asking me what happened as I repeat the limited information I had. A fee minutes go by and everyone starts calming down when AH starts running back to the store. I have enough time to call for my manager when he bursts through the doors again. 

AH: I had backup assistant and the Motorola app installed to track it. What do I do?

Me: You'll need to login on the website and track it that way. 

AH: **GOD DAMNIT!!**

He then proceeds to run back out and start attacking the passenger mirror, completely removing it from the vehicle. His friend who had made it back in the store apologizes profusely before running out and gets his friend in the van before driving off. 

**TL;DR**

Purpleprinter,7,8,1ppush,22,"I was on the other side of the counter the other day.  I had $100 in fresh 20's and told her that she might want to double count because they were sticking together a bit.  The *cashier* said to me ""Oh, did you just finish printing them?""",In Bizarro World...,30
The_name_is_Fig,15,26,1pps8d,43,"In the second year of my employment at Irish Name Auto Parts, I came to know who the regulars were, and who the out of town travelers are. 
On this particularly hot July afternoon, The temp was hovering right around 98* or so. The sun was shining right through the windows of our store, and the AC units in the store were down. (Apparently you need to change the intake filters on them every so often...who knew?)

On This particular day, the local...uh...girl..troop/cheerleader/church whatever held a car wash in the parking lot. (We shared the lot with a quick lube garage)
 
In walk four pretty, smokin'-hot, and busty girls with their chaperones. Now picture this, You have a bunch of girls out in the sun, washing cars, and some of them have played with the hose, dousing each other with it. The wet Tshirt contest came to us this particular day. Im not trying to sound like a hound dog, but I doubt ANYONE would have had the mental facilities to hold a coherent thought while looking at tanned and good looking girls in front of you. 

I happened to ring this flock of women through and as they walked out, we couldn't help but appreciate the appearances of the fairer sex. It's just a natural thing to do, It's not like women don't do the same with attractive men.

Our district manager decided to visit our store on that day as well. Why? I dunno. (It was pretty convenient though, now that I think about it...) Anywho, after a few minutes of enjoying the scenery, in walks fat bastard patrick. We didn't call him Fatrick for nothing. He was a regular, stood about 6'4"" tall, and weighed about 400 lbs with an empty bladder. 

On this fine day, he decided to bless us with his presence, and his stench in all it's glory. 

Picture a guy, a LARGE guy who can't quite reach all the places on his body when he washes, so he subscribes to the philosophy of ""Meh, Water will get it"". His penis was probably declared dead back in the first Bush presidency, and it's been rotting ever since. He walks with a type of limp that is actually in part due to the crap that doesn't get wiped from his butt when he decides to leave a dump. Have you ever seen a man do the ball-unstick dance? The stench coming from this guy was enough to get you to run to the nearest sanitation sewer and take a deep breath of sweet relief. And this is all on an average day. 

This particular day, he came in to drop off a warranty battery after having spent the day in the local junkyard. Along with the aforementioned smells, there is a hint of decades-old gear oil, grease, dog crap and french fries. He hung out for a little while, and then left. His putrid smell didn't dissipate for about an hour after he left. Opening the front doors would have only made things worse as the ""breeze"" that would have come in may have ignited the smell, making it worse. 

At the end of the night, I got into a philosophical conversation with one of my co workers about the law of averages and equality. We came to this conclusion:

For every attractive, well groomed, and sweet smelling female in this world, there is an inversely unattractive, smelly, and hideous man to balance the equation out.

EndlessNerd,8,30,1ppnb0,132,"This was a few years ago at the hobby shop before I was a manager.  
Gentleman comes in with a slot car in hand.  
""This doesn't work, my 4 year old was upset because we set everything up this car that we bought separate wouldn't work.""  
I look at the car, and it looks like somebody squished it against the track, you know, like a 4 year old push it around by hand instead of letting it drive itself.  
""Do you have the receipt and the packaging?""  
""I don't have the receipt, and why would I keep the packaging, I didn't expect it to not work.""  
""I'm sorry, I may be able to pull up the receipt, but without the packaging there's nothing I can do for you.""  
""You know nothing about customer service!  I'm unhappy, you need to make me happy.""  
We go around like this for a few minutes, me sticking to the return policy, him accusing me of being an amateur.  
Eventually, a manager walks up, takes over, and gives him what he wants.  
I was a little annoyed, but when the customer complained loudly about how useless I was, the manager chimed in

Teslok,43,23,1pp2qg,78,"Once upon a time, in a land far away from my current domicile, I worked at a small, ""Mom'n'Pop"" style video rental store, in the days where clunky, stinky VHS cassettes were slowly vanishing, to be replaced by shiny plastic DVDs.  

I was in a period of unending transition; in my 20's, still living with the parents, if we'd had a basement, it would have been my domain, and with no prospects of ever finding my way out of this miserable situation (spoiler: I got out).  I was in debt up to my eyeballs from a useless certificate program, my car was such a rolling wreck that I should probably post its tale of woe to /r/talesfromsadcars, and I was raised with all of the bad financial habits associated with poor parents who are determined to remain poor, and keep their children poor.  

The one thing I had going for me at this point: I had the kind of work ethic that brought me crawling into the store with raging fevers, hacking coughs, and aching misery.  At any time, any of my coworkers could call and say ""Teslok, we need you,"" and I was there, so long as I had my car or someone to drop me off.  

I was the magical shift-covering genie.  

For the most part, I loved that job.  I've mentioned it from time to time in comments here and there.  It was family-owned, the manager made it clear from the start that she had my back if there were any problems, and I was good at building a rapport with our regulars.  

I knew them, their lives, their families, they came to chat about their days, they came to rent movies, they came to ask me what I thought of the latest new releases.  

Our renters were our neighbors. We'd run into them at the grocery store, we'd bump into them at the library, it was a small town, and we were, at times, a hopping place.  

But I was too available.  I did not know how to say ""no,"" and frankly, I was all too aware I shouldn't, because I was perpetually broke.  

The most shining example of me being too available came one overcast morning on one of my rare days off.  I was babysitting my youngest sibling, just me and him in the house.  The parents were at work--Mom took my car--and the other siblings were at school.  

And I get a phone call.  

&gt; Manager: Teslok, I need you to take over at the store.  

&gt; Teslok: Mom took my car today; I can't get in.  

&gt; Manager: I know. I'm on my way to pick you up now, I should be there in a few minutes.  

... 

So I got dressed (was bumming around in PJ's) and got my brother dressed (he was a regular fixture at the store from the time he could walk), packed up toddler snacks, and locked up the house.  

I wish I could say that this incident taught me to learn to say ""no,"" to stand up for my day off, but nope.  That lesson came much later, long after I was out of retail.  

I remember thinking, at the time, ""You know, I should be bothered by this. That she assumed that I'd be OK with this, to the point that by the time she called, she was already driving to my house.""  

But I wasn't bothered at the time.  Just bothered that I wasn't bothered.

robertr4836,37,33,1pozqg,106,"Back in the 80’s I was a manager at a fast food place located in a mall.  We, the mall, other stores in the mall and basically any place with a public restroom in the area were having problems with pervert(s) who were drilling holes between men’s room stalls to peep on people using the toilets.

My store had two stalls, one regular and one handicapped.  At one point maintenance had bolted a ¼” thick steel plate to the adjoining wall; the pervs pried the plate off the wall.  It was pretty bad.

I got into the habit, with my store managers approval, of doing bathroom checks about once an hour.  I would go in and if someone was in the regular stall I would go in the handicapped, plug the hole with TP, pretend to do my business and wash up but I would open the bathroom door and just let it close without leaving.  I would then check and if the TP I wedged into the hole had been pushed out I would bang on the regular stall door, announce myself as a manager and tell the person they had to leave.

Most people knew the jig was up and would beat a hasty retreat with no questions asked but there were two memorable times when they put up a fight.

1)  The guy in the stall is simply refusing to leave.  I finally tell him that I am going to call the police and have him forcibly removed.  I head out of the bathroom which leads to the children’s section (small merry go round and children’s decorations on the walls) where I run into my SM.  As I am explaining to her that we need to call the police and why the guy bolts out of the corridor leading to the bathrooms with a giant jar of Vaseline in one hand and a stack of gay porno mags in the other leaving a trail of falling porno mags in the kids section as he runs past us and out the door.  My SM stood there in shock while I dove to the floor and scooped up the pornos before the kids or their parents could get a good look at them.

2)  This guy got aggressive.  He was screaming at me that “I HAVE A WIFE AND TWO KIDS AND I’M NOT SOME PERVERT!” along with threats to have me fired and arrested for daring to accuse him of looking at children going to the bathroom (note: I never accused him of anything at that point, I had just done the usual I’m a manager and you have to leave).  Its lunch rush, the lobby is packed and this guy follows me up front still screaming about not being a perv and having a wife and two kids.  My SM meets me at the counter and asks me what’s going on.  The guy is still screaming so I have to yell to tell her what happened.  She tells the guy to leave or she will call the police.  The guy goes BEHIND the counter and gets in my SM’s face screaming at her now.  SM motions me to back off and yells to a manger near the cash office to call the police and lock herself in the office then she starts laying into the guy and he decides to bolt for the door.

About a hundred customers and crew and the place is eerily silent with the guys hasty departure since everyone had stopped to watch the show.  All of a sudden somebody starts to clap.  Within a minute everyone is clapping, people who had been sitting eating are standing up and clapping.  A guy with two little kids comes up and shakes my hand telling me thank you and that he wouldn’t even let his kids use any of the bathrooms in the area because of the perv activity.

So…basically I got a standing ovation from a store full of customers for throwing a pervert out of the store.

TL;DR:  Customers give me a standing ovation for getting rid of a pervert.

The_name_is_Fig,49,58,1powq6,328,"Background: I spent about 3 years working for Irish Name Auto Parts. I saw a lot of strange and wonderful things while on the job, and some stories are better than others.

I had a younger kid walk into the store one day. He tells me that his car is running funny and is outside, and wants me to take a look at it. I mention to him that I cannot offer him diagnostic information as I'm not a finished tech. 

I walk outside and look at the car. It's running poorly, and I can tell it's misfiring badly. I walk over to the driver door to pop the hood and take note at how girly the car is. He feels the need to explain how it's his sister's car. I look it over and tell him that it may just need a tune up, but that he should really take it to a shop to diagnose properly. I walk back inside, and he follows me in. He wants to price out everything I mentioned to him; The spark plug, plug wires and filters. I put everything on a quote for him, and he walks out. 

A few minutes later, he comes back in and says, give me all those parts. I'm going to try and fix it myself. 
I nod and start pulling parts. Once everything is on the counter, I ring it all up and ask for his number for warranty purposes. He gives me the information, and a note pops up on my screen that the customer is a known fraudulent scammer and should not be sold parts.  The note says call police. 

Well, I must have shown my alarm on my face because he asks me what's wrong. I tell him that I just realized that we didn't confirm the model of the Civic and I ask him to bring me the car's registration. He walks out to the car and I flag the Manager on duty and give him the signal to call the cops. The customer walks back inside and hands me the paperwork for the car. I burn time by inputting the Vin number incorrectly into the computer. I tell him I have to call the dealer and verify the Vin number is correct. I can tell he's getting visibly antsy, so I tell him that on close inspection, all submodels use the same parts. I just continue with the transaction, because by this time, I know the vehicle he has, and we have him on camera. He gives me a card and his ID. I knew the ID was bogus, but it gives me something to stall him with. 

This is the ongoing conversation as I remember it:

Me: So that comes to 180 dollars

Customer hands me a debit card: Here, Run this as credit.

I took the card and mention that his name doesn't match the card. I ask him about it and he says it's his girlfriends card. The name though, matches the name on the registration. I'm starting to think stolen car and card.  

Me: Hmmm. Looks like the card reader isn't reading the stripe. Happens all the time. let me try the bag trick.
(for those of you that don't know the bag trick, you stick the card in a bag and swipe the card in the reader to help it read the strip. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't)

Customer : So did it work? 

Me: No i'll try it again. 
I fake swipe it again, and tell him it's not working. By this time, I see the cop cruiser rounding the corner so I stall him a little bit more. 

Me: Here, let me try one more thing. 
I grab one of the magnetic tire pressure gauges that we had sitting behind the counter and run it across the stripe, ruining the stripe. He doesn't see this of course.

Customer: Well, did it work? I really need to go! 

Me : No looks like the card may be damaged or my system is down. Let me get my manager and I'll ask him to override this and enter the card manually.

I walk into the back office area and mention to him that the cops are outside. He tells me that while he stalls the customer, to walk outside and let them know who to look for. 

I casually mention to the customer that my manager will be right with him, and that I would be headed to lunch.

I walked outside to speak with the cop, tell him who to look for, what he's wearing and what car he's driving. He runs the plates and confirms the car's been reported stolen.

I walk back in with the cop in tow and the customer looks at me, and just hangs his head and says ""Oh man...""


TL:DR Customer comes in with stolen car, tried to pay with stolen credit card. I wipe it with a magnet, call the cops.

but_why_is_it_itchy,49,94,1porcp,438,"So, not retail, but a good customer story nonetheless. I worked for a large, national health insurance company for a few years doing customer service, and in that time I spoke to a lot of....uh, special people. 

One day I got a call from a gentleman who was getting a bill from his doctor, and wanted to know why we didn't pay it. Well, the doctor was not in our network, so when that happens we give the customer the option of having payment sent directly to them instead of their doctor, since they often have to pay up front for services. I checked his claim, and sure enough, we had already paid him in full for this bill. It was somewhere around $900. He said he had never received the check, so I looked, and it had been cashed a few months back. I looked at the image of the cashed check and told him his signature was on it and it had been cashed. I told him if he didn't cash it, I could initiate a check-fraud investigation for him. As usual, though, I was pretty certain he had cashed the check and just didn't remember. This is the case 99.9% of time. 
Finally, he realized he did in fact cash that check. He didn't know that it was intended to pay that bill, though, and had spent the money on other things. Now, I feel like I should mention that the checks are sent with a copy of the claim, showing exactly what dates and services the check is for. But sure...he had no idea. That's fine. I'm thinking now that he realizes what happened, this call is done and I can go home (call came in 2 minutes before my shift was over-love that). But no. He then asked if I would be RESENDING a check for that amount to pay this bill. What?
 Um no, sir, we already paid for this. You received the money. That's it for us. 
Him: well, yes, but I spent that money already, and still have this bill to pay. You need to pay this bill. You're my insurance company. 

I was literally speechless for a moment. Wtf kind of logic is this???? I was on the phone with him for an HOUR going back and forth trying to get through his head that this makes less than zero sense. People boggle my mind sometimes. 


Tl;dr: dude thinks we should pay his claim twice because the first time we paid it, he used the money on other shit.","""No, we won't pay you twice because you spent the first check 'by accident'""",532
FredFltStn,153,404,1poo14,978,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Welcome to the week of scam artists. They rarely get away with it, but that sure doesn't stop them from trying. This story is more of a con...and I helped to set it up.

**THE SETUP**   I got a call from a local television station asking me to do an on camera interview. No big deal, I've done lots of them. It seems like when the 4th of July rolls around every year, I get calls asking for comments or interviews with the local media. I’m always happy to publicize my business, and I'm usually smart enough not to say something that would get me in trouble. Usually.

One of my good friends, TC (AKA Drunky the Bear), works on a talk radio station in Orlando. It's actually the top rated station, and I do a lot of advertising with them. He's also the guy I blew up in the Porta Potty in [this](http://redd.it/1m5ca2) video. 

I mentioned to him that the media we're going to come by and interview me, and he said he would swing by to watch the fun and pick up some stuff. TC shows up, and I show him around and point out some of the new stuff I was carrying.

The news station arrives, sets up their equipment, and we do a quick interview. I answer their questions and talk about how great fireworks are, how everyone should be safe, blah blah blah. The reporter then asks me if it would be okay for him to interview people shopping at my tent. 

Of course, who do they walk up to first?!? The guy with the shaggy hair, baggy shorts, and flip flops wondering around my tent, my buddy TC. 

**THE CON**   The reporter introduced us, and we acted like we had never met each other before. I walked away so they could get started. I knew it was going to be a good interview when the last thing TC whispered to me was, “Should I take off my shirt?”

I think TC ranted for a good 3 or 4 minutes in his best stupid redneck voice. I can’t actually remember all of it, and a few times, I had to walk away because I was laughing so hard, I was afraid the camera would pick it up. Here are a few of the more memorable quotes. 

* Fireworks are as American an America, even though the Chinese make em.

* If you don’t buy fireworks for the 4th of July, you’re probably a communist.

* I always come to this store to buy my fireworks because they have better fireworks than China.

* I spend thousands of dollars every year on fireworks. I like fireworks more than I like my family.

and Finally

* When I set off my Fireworks, I want the astronauts to see them from space. I want God to look down from heaven and say that was good stuff.

I think I actually saw the reporter get wood during the interview. Here are some [photos](http://imgur.com/a/vBotR) of the interview. We both made the early broadcast of the news. I think they included maybe 10 seconds of my interview, but TC, he got PLENTY of airtime. I don’t think they played it again during the later news broadcasts. I have the feeling that someone from the newsroom recognized TC, and they realized that they’d been had. 
 Amazingly, I’ve never been called by that news station for an interview since.

----

My friend TC actually does a free weekly podcast with another of my friends, Daniel Dennis (Double D!). I seriously think it’s one of the funniest things on the net, and if you like my type of humor, I’d invite you to check it out [here](http://www.tomanddan.com/).

They also have a premium BDM (Big D*ck Millionaire) membership with bonus stuff. If you do decide to become a BD member, check out the premium Podcast from around NYE of last year. They did a drunk podcast from my fireworks tent. 

I don’t have any affiliation, other than they’re my friends and I think they’re funny as shit. I’ll buy the BD membership for the **FIRST** person that comments and specifically asks for it.

angelicvixen,14,8,1podo1,13,"In our store, we have what's known as q-vision. Also knowns as 1+1 queing. Meaning we have to have enough registers open to have 1 transaction going, as well as 1 more person in line. And like any other store, we're not allowed to check family members.

Well, we had a few lanes open. But all those lanes had 2 transactions in them. I was finishing up one, and had nobody else in my line. An older man walks up to a line, and the front-end supervisor puts him in my line. I look up at her, and in a pretty flat voice said ""(supervisor's name) I can't check him. He's my dad"" 

She turned red, and ended up having to page for a back-up cashier. Hence known as the day i messed up q-vision. ",The day I messed up Queing.,21
frankiethestreetlamp,10,14,1pocj4,35,"Hi TFR! All you lovely, sullen and generally over it people have provided me with such entertaining stories, it's about time I contribute at least a little bit. 

I work at a well known electronics retailer in a rural town. I'm talking farms rural, but we've got a decent university and a famous-ish race track, so the town itself is quite large and has all walks of life. Which means all sorts of crazy, too. This story is from about two years ago, but stands out as one of the douchiest ""customers"" I've ever met. 

On a late night shopping shift, deep into the absolutely pointless to be still open period, I was shuffling around the shop putting stock away while the manager on duty (absolutely awesome guy, henceforth known as AAG) was fixing some window promo fittings near the front entrance. At this point there was an internet kiosk out the front of the store, maybe 30 metres away.

We'd also just gotten in a large and impressively flashy sound system that was playing a few metres into the store, facing out to the shopping centre. Now, we're always careful to keep these to a fairly low volume, but understandably, customers turn it up from time to time. This was not one of those times. It's also worth pointing out that on top of terrible hearing, I get a lot of ear infections and am usually half deaf at any given point. 

So this middle aged guy walks in, he seemed calm enough, and I asked him how I could help. We'll call him... Douchenozzle, or DN.

DN: (what he actually said): I was at the internet kiosk, and that bass is really disturbing.
 (What I heard): that place is really disturbing. 

So, I chuckled, thinking it was a joke. Woops. He immediately goes bright red and rips into me about how he was trying to do important things and kids like me will ruin our ears with music that loud and HOW DARE I LAUGH AT HIM etc etc. I was trying to cut in to say I misheard. AAG had overheard and came over to save my ass.

The guy is a bit calmer talking to a huge, bald, bearded man (AAG generally looks like a bikie minus the tattoos), and eventually leaves while AAG turns the volume down to minimum and gets back to what he's doing in the window. 

I opened my mouth to explain what happened to AAG when he tells me to wait a moment, pulls out his phone and turns the volume up over the network while DN stalks off. He hears it. Stops. Looks around... Nobody near the sound system. 

Oh, the joys of technology (and awesome managers)

I have a few other stories, some involving my lack of great hearing, some involving outright crazy, and a lot involving petty revenge, but mostly just ""I'm a farmer who didn't bother to research anything, spend 3 hours walking me through it again and again"" and ""I know more than you because I have a penis"". And a lot of idiots, ex-coworkers and customers alike.","I'm sorry you couldn't browse your porn in public in peace, sir.",49
[deleted],2,10,1po8wt,25,"During my once in a blue moon shopping spree at my local low price hardware store. You know the one, that has cheap tools, free flashlights, ect... I got the joy of being behind a customer that couldn't read policy on returns.

The guy was arguing with the clerk about how he should just be able to get cash back since he had his reciept. The clerk told him that it is against policy to just give cash back, he could refund the money to the card however. This customer kept going on while the clerk kept calm. After about five min or so, the customer caved in and just whipped out the card and bought the other stuff he needed instead. Upon leaving I heard the guy say ""I will call your corporate office and make a complaint about you!""

I looked at the clerk and said ""I bet he doesnt even know how to dail a phone."" The clerk laughed and we chatted a bit on the kind of crazy customers we get at our jobs.

Before I finished, I asked him what were they supposed to try and sell as a check out challenge and if they got credit for warranties. Once he told me, I bought about four of their check out and got the best/longest warranty they offered. I told him as I was leaving, ""Hopefully that makes up for the jackass you dealt with before me, don't let that kind of shit get to you because there are good people left in this world,""

Dis13,27,15,1po3w4,47,"The bookstore that I happen to work at is near an entrance in what is basically THE mall in the town I live in.  It is the closest thing to ""culture"" that we have - and while it is normally hellish enough on the weekends, it's sometimes downright dead during the week. 

The mall normally holds a Halloween Trick or Treat event that has the stores pass out a fair amount of candy to a fair amount of children.  Usually a decent turn-out, and the mall hosts what is a nice event for somewhere just under 500 young kids in cute costumes.

Well, tonight it stormed like a bitch, and thus Halloween night is, essentially, cancelled for the night for all of the kiddies in the area.   If only there were an enclosed space in which the brats could all beg in a mumbling manner for candy...

Well, as it turns out, EVERY parent - as well as, for some reason, a handful of ridiculous teenagers - got the same idea and turned out to the mall to badger the shops into giving their children candy.   This had become so very huge that when I walked into work, I was immediately told that I was in charge of handing out candy to the children.   Going to the mall side entrance of the store, I stood next to a co worker who had already been there and began handing out candy.  I was under the impression that he would be joining me.   Uh, as it turns out, that wasn't fucking happening.

He disappeared sometime after he got a refill on the candy, and I was left, alone, a few times when I was out of candy and had to handle telling children and their parents that I had run out.   Most people were pleasant about this rather reasonable set back, but then there was the minority of smegma who rolled their eyes and had the nerve to expect something out of the charity that a business is giving to their children.  ""Well, you guys should have expected this turn out, with it raining outside.""

Thirty minutes in - my co worker, who had been sent out for a ""candy run"" to the ridiculously over priced boutique in the mall was no where to be seen, and in a surreal way that you'd think that you'd only see in a movie like *Brazil*, the line of children who were waiting for *a single piece of friggin candy* stretched allllllll the long way down the hallway that separated the book store on one side to the coffee shop and the rotunda.  Holy Christ you would have needed to see it to believe the amount of two-year olds in cheap princess dresses and boys wearing off-brand Scream masks to know what a sheer, children-orientated panic feels like.  

I believe that this must be a good deal what it is like before and after Christmas Day for a Build-a-Bear employee.  Christ are people who work with kids on a day to day basis much more patient than I will ever be.   

My co-worker returned some time later with $15 worth of candy that came directly from out of my manager's pocket.   It was small, fruit-flavored tootsie-rolls that I was instructed to give no more than one to every kid.   This later got supplemented with Halloween-themed stickers and temporary tattoos.   

This, unbelievably, ran out, an hour and fifteen minutes into what was supposed to be a two hour long event, with all of the children in attendance doing nothing more than standing in the sort of line that would only be normal for a Harry Potter midnight release.  Not for a single. Piece. Of. Candy - or two stickers/temporary tattoos.   

Thankfully, the unchangingly looooonnnggg line of people dissipated with little grumbling - although almost none actually went into the store to at least browse.  They took their candy and left, leaving the store a complete ghost town by the time I got back to my actual work for the night.

Was it worth it? - Well, for a child hater like me, I was overwhelmingly surprised at the good manners of most of the children in attendance - a lot of warm smiles, Happy Halloweens and thank-yous - and the most trouble that I got was from parents who thought that a good Halloween memory for their children is to have them stand in line for a single piece of candy, handed out by a sweating, nervous book store employee.  

I loved seeing the homemade costumes, but I kept a mental count of Minecraft costumes that came with big, cardboard-box heads at a magnificent four, with children dressed in the trademark scraggly beard and camo cap of some cast member from the TV show, ""Duck Dynasty"" at a strange ten. 

The ""extra"" buckets that some adults thrusted at me as I tried to give each kid attention made me want to breath fire on the entire event - some of them at least had the grace to mutter something to me about a phantom ""sick child"" who was unable to attend the event.

The moral of the story - do not depend on a mall to give your child all of his Halloween candy.  It's unfair to both your children and to the stores who have to waste time and money distributing it to them.  If it's storming bad on Halloween, maybe just buy them a shit ton of candy and stay somewhere warm with them.

Fun fact - later that night, a group of adults and a two-year old that had gone into the children's section, and later on the mother of the two-year old rushed up to me, holding her squalling child, asking me where the nearest restroom was.  As I was telling her about the store's restrooms, I realized that the child was fucking *bleeding* from out of her lower lip in a steady stream.  As she walked away, I could hear the woman scolding the child about freaking out, when she had hurt herself.  Later on the night, I saw the group leaving, deep in conversation over the prerequisites for their insurance company on getting stitches at a hospital.

**TL;DR** Now, why wouldn't you just read my Halloween story, if you've bothered to click on it at all?  Really?   Well, alright -

**Sometimes parents look at the decision to skip Trick or Treating and the danger of pneumonia and decide that standing in a looping, nightmarish line for a single piece of candy is the logical decision to make.  BONUS - tonight a woman learned that a wounded child will squall.

RedRing14,28,74,1pnui0,276,"Hello TFR I've been lurking you for a while and now I've decided to post finally.  I'm going to start with what was and will be the job I loved the most.  

I used to manage a nation wide game resell store (not the one you're thinking of more than likely) where we were pretty crazy and were usually attached to a movie rental joint.  I had tons of customers and got plenty of stories but today I want to share the one that still boils my blood.  It is around 5pm on a nice cold november tuesday.  One of our regulars who'm I will call barry comes in to do his normal monthly shopping of our bargin bin.  Barry came in quite often and I had talked to him often and though he mentioned his family I never met them.  Today though was different because they came with him but were sitting in the car outside until the mom finally decided for her and them to come in.

Ok quick break in the story.  At this time I am 19 years old and the father of a 2 year old boy.   Customers always compliment me about how nice I am and how good of a father I am when they met my son.  Regulars even bought my boy christmas gifts.  Anyways back to the story.

His wife comes in first followed by his 2 kids ages 5 and 2.  It is november and while its not freezing it is definitely cold enough for a hoodie (probably in the high 40s).  The 5 year old is in a t shirt, shorts, and nothing covering her feet.  The 2 year old is in a diaper...nothing else.  I get aggravated enough that my buddy takes over the transaction for me and I go to the back and start to do paper work.  I then hear him yell for them to get in the car and he'll be back whenever he is done here.  A few minutes pass and I decide I'm hungry so I am going to go get food.  I walk out the door and walk past his car to see that the kids have no children seats at all and that they apparently just lay in the back buckled in.  I see red and storm in.  This is the conversation that happens. Caps means I'm yelling as loud as I can.

Me:  Jack (coworker fake name) stop that transaction right now.  {My associates didn't question me so he did stop}

Barry:  WTF Man I want those games.

Me: Barry I wont sell them to you because of the current situation your children are in with clothes and safety.  

Barry: You can't do that I am the customer.

Me: I don't care.  You're a parent and should be worried about your kids.

Barry: Worry about your kid and not mine. (I lose it here)

Me: BARRY SHUT THE FUCK UP!  I'M NOT SELLING YOU THE GAMES AND THAT'S FINAL!

Barry: You will sell me the games.  I'll call home office on you.

Me: THERE'S THE PHONE SO CALL THEM!  YOU'RE BANNED FROM THIS STORE AND I WILL BE CALLING THE COMPETITION TO INFORM THEM OF THIS SITUATION!  THE FACT YOU'RE MORE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR PIECE OF SHIT GAMES OVER YOUR KIDS IS CRAZY!

Barry: Man it ain't like that I just need to relax.

Me: I DON'T CARE!  YOU WON'T GET A GAME FROM HERE AND THOSE KIDS BETTER GET SOME DAMN WINTER CLOTHES AND CAR SEATS.  NOW GET OUT OF HERE!

Barry left the store knowing I wasn't going to back down.  I called the police and told them about what I saw immediately.  Gave them his info we had from his drivers license(needed for trades) as well as his license plate number from his car.  Afterwards called the competing store and told them what happened (was friends with their store manager and most of the employees) and gave a description of him and was later informed he did try to go there.  I got hand me down clothes from my cousins (they were girls and so were his kids) and got some car seats for them as well.  Ended up with about 10 outfits for both of them and winter gear as well.  Dropped them off to his wife while he was away so he wouldn't have his pride hurt.  Didn't really see him much after that.

The day after the incident I had a call from my district manager who was cracking up about it.  Barry did call in a complaint about me but the DM wrote it off.  Said I can't do that again no matter how bad he wished to have seen it in person.  As a joke I gave him that security tape as a christmas gift.  The manager of a office supply store that was built onto but not part of our building came over because he could here me through the brick walls.

GraySparrow,27,39,1pni7r,181,"For a vast majority of the time, I do enjoy my job and since I've come to the USA almost everyone has been friendly and welcoming - often customers will compliment my accent and make pleasant small talk with me at the cash register that I enjoy very much.

Anyway, as many of you probably know, now-and-again a customer's bank card may be denied. Maybe their money hasn't gone through yet, maybe there's a problem at the bank, who knows. Occasionally it is just our crappy machines, so when a card is denied and the money not taken from it I can try it again. (Our card readers are not hooked up to the old registers so we have to swipe the cards for the customers).

The other day an angry old lady made some purchases. I swipe her card, it is denied. I inform her thus, but say I will try again. I try again. I try again. She's one of those awful people who blame you, as if you're deliberately trying to shame her.

""There is money on it!"", ""Well make it work!"", ""It can't be denied!"" etc, etc.

Eventually she pays through some other method. I wish her well. She leaves. Think nothing more of it. Until a few days later. My lovely (not sarcastic; she's wonderful) co-worker pulls me aside to inform me that an angry old woman has just been in to bitch to her about how the ""little foreigner"" broke her credit card.

I've not had much xenophobia here, but identifying me like that hurt. Mostly because I'm beginning to be known in the area and 'the foreigner who works at such-a-store' is easily identifiable as me, and I like to think I'm a decent worker not someone who harasses old ladies by destroying their credit cards, whether they're nasty bitches or not.

kquatro,9,18,1pneit,73,"Hello TFR! This is my first time posing here. Normally I'm reading the stories all you people have to offer. I think it’s about time I share what happened to me last Friday. TL;DR at the bottom. 

**Background:**  I work at local pharmacy in town. I'm 23 and been working here for 8 years. It’s your typical mom&amp;pop store. We offer cards, candy, toys, gifts, along with various OTC products and our retail, compounding, and nursing home pharmacy. So let’s just say I get all walks of like coming into my store, may it be local doctors to the local homeless guy that rides his bike around town. It doesn't matter who you are or what drug you’re taking I'm going to treat you with respect while keeping a smile on my face. 

**Story:** So it’s around 2PM and both my other clerks went to lunch at the same time (I don't know why, normally we try and have 2 clerks together at all times because we get swamped with customers) so it’s just me, my tech and my pharmacist upstairs. Everyone else is in the basement. Whatever, I'm used to it. I can run this pharmacy with a blindfolded if I had to. But today wasn't my day (we've all had off days). I could feel it. 

One of my clerks and I joke around saying whenever she goes to lunch I always get the bad apples. The ones who want to get in my face because their insurance won’t cover all the RX so they have to pay a $1.10 co pay. Shit, I even had a regular get mad at me for some stupid ass reason because her insurance actually PAID for her RX, so instead of a $40 co pay, it was like $1.56 or something ridiculous. 

But this day was different. My pharmacist is on the phone with a doctor and my tech is stuck on the phone with an insurance company trying to get a claim to go thru. I've got a line of 3 customers I'm helping and 2 more coming in the door, plus 2 others that are ready to be helped. As most of you know after working a business for a while you start to get to know people by their first names and on a personal basis. 4 of the customers in line know me, and know how hard I work and were fine waiting. Fast forward, I have one of the RX's ready for a waiter; I politely tell the people that just came to the counter I have to help this customer 1st because she’s been waiting. I ring her up and she asks for an insurance claim form. OK! I ring up my other waiter (just picking up a special order, quick and easy) then run behind the counter to print out the paper work (we don't have access to certain programs on our clerk computer).

I should point out; all of this is being taken care of in less than 5 minutes. All while this lady I haven't helped yet in GLARING at me. I could feel her eyes burning into my little soul and it was making me uncomfortable.
 
My pharmacist was FINALLY off the phone so I had her call someone up from the basement to help take care of customers. My tech would help, but he is STILL on the phone. Whatever, I'm doing the best I can. While she’s doing that, I get the claim printed and signed, and handed it off to the customer, who thanked me and told me I was doing a great job considering all the work I was doing. As I was finishing  helping her, my coworker comes up, but it’s one of our new girls who hasn't learned how to use the cash register yet. The lady who was staring me down like the Eye of Sauron, just burning into my soul, saw her come up and didn't help her, she lost her shit ""ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS?!!!!"" ""THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!!!"" ""I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!!!"" 
(Again it’s probably been 7 minutes total she’s had to wait now)
 
I finished with my previous customer and went to take care of her and she kept spewing the diarrhea out of her mouth, saying how terrible I'm doing, and ""IS THAT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO PRINT A CLAIM FORM"" (1st of all bitch, there was an update on the system so things changed a little bit so I'm sorry it took 1 whole minute for me to print it off)  I try and defuse the situation by apologizing, telling her I'm the only clerk and I'm doing the best I can considering, there is only so much I can do when my other clerks are at lunch. As she was yelling and I was bagging her shit up my coworker comes up to help the other customers. Cool. She’s still yelling and making a scene and I'm still apologizing profusely while still telling her I'm doing the best I can ma'am, I'm sorry. I think I even said what more do you want from me, but I can't be sure. I was so overwhelmed. (I'm a young female and I'm working on standing my ground and not letting people disrespect me. I suffer from anxiety/panic attacks, so when people get in my face like that in front of other people I get upset, but I try not to show it) By the end of the transaction I was shaking because my anxiety just shot thru the roof, I couldn't even look my other customers in the eyes I was so embarrassed. (Thankfully they all understood and thought the lady was a total bitch and was out of line and I was doing a great job) The icing on the cake though was when I handed her the bag of stuff, she looked at me and said ""you’re doing a good job"" What. The. Fuck. I didn’t even tell her to have a good day like I would any other customer that has a douche attitude.  I had to go into the back of the pharmacy and catch my breath because I couldn't breathe, then I started having a panic attack, then came the water works, so I went to the basement to cool off . Of course my coworker who clerks with me all time saw me all upset and asked, “kquatro, what’s wrong?” I explain the situation to her and she told me I should have called her up and she would have taken care of the puta, but it was her lunch break, she’s pregnant and I wanted to her to relax. I should have called her up though; she doesn't take shit from no one. Thankfully  I didn’t get in trouble, I was told I handled the situation the best I could considering. 

After all was said and done, I cleaned up, went back to work and moved on. I keep going over the situation in my head thinking of better ways I could have dealt with her and her stanky attitude, but its a learning experience I guess. Fuck people like that. I understand some people have bad days or you have to wait in like a few minutes longer than you were hoping, but that doesn’t give you the right to be so fucking disrespectful. In the end people will do what they want and you can’t change them, you can only kill them with kindness. 

**TL;DR** Older lady had to wait 10 minutes before being helped, was a complete bitch to me and put me down in front of regular customers and coworkers. FUCK people like that.

rugbygirl24,7,11,1pnd0y,64,"Wall of text!


**Background:** I work the desk at a high end hair salon and day spa in the USA. A majority of the guests are nice or at least indifferent to the desk staff but we do get a quite a few colorful characters to say the least. 

**Story:** There was a sale going on at the time for 25% off facials, pedicures, and massages. We also offer a teen program with special pricing for anyone 19 or younger, and these prices can never, under any circumstances be discounted because they are already heavily discounted. During sale time the salon is SLAMMED! It seems like everyone in the area knows about it and everyone needs to get in immediately. We have to deal with a lot of short tempered people who don't understand why no one is available to do their pedicure/massage/facial with a days notice. Sorry, your lack of planning is not my problem. 


So it was getting close to the end of a crazy 9 hour shift where pretty much every problem that could happen that day did, and no manager on duty at the time. services printed on it. I was the most senior member of the desk staff which made me the stand in manager so to speak, working with one other woman at the desk who is very nice but a little new and still learning that ropes, lets call her Martha. 


Cue angry Mom (AM). A woman comes out from the spa, she had just gotten a facial and was coming up to the desk to pay. Martha asks her how the facial was, AM doesn't answer her question, just says ""I get 25% off right? My daughter was here last night and she didn't get 25% off."" Martha freezes for a moment, I can tell she is trying to think of a reason that may have happened. I am standing at the register and I smile a bit, thinking to myself I bet her daughter is a teen. People try to get discounts off teen prices all the time even though we tell anyone signing up for the program that discounts do not apply along with it being printed on the form they have to fill out.


I decided to step in and bail out Martha, she's new, she doesn't need to deal with this crap after such a long day. I asked her what her daughters name was, pulled up her transaction from the night before and see that her daughter is in the teen program. I then calmly and sweetly explain that we are unable to discount teen services at any time because they are already heavily discounted. This doesn't seem to register with AM. She scoffs at me and says that its false advertising, how could you be having a sale that doesn't apply to everyone? I use the example of the facial she just received, before the 25% off discount it is more than twice the price of the one her daughter received, since the teen facial price is already heavily discounted we do not allow further discounts. AM continues to tell me how ridiculous it is and how it should say that on the sign for the sale, then she throws cash at me and stomps out of the salon. It took everything I had to not burst out laughing once she left because it does say that on the sign, in smaller print on the bottom, but it is still on there. Not my problem that AM couldn't be bothered to read the whole sign. 


About 5 mins later the phone rings and I answer. ""Thank you for calling fancy pants salon, this is rugbygirl24"" its AM! She asks to talk to the woman who did her facial. I was standing next to her throughout the entire phone call. The woman said I was rude, disrespectful, out of line blah blah blah. The technician who did her facial is doing a good job of calming her down and gets off the phone. She turns to me and says ""She is pissed at you!"" The tech was at the desk for the entire transaction and told me I didn't do anything out of line. I am super grateful I had witnesses for this because my Italian blood was boiling at this point, but I took 5 mins in the office to calm down and finished my day.


Well the next day I come into work and my manager calls me into the office. I was a little nervous, not knowing what I could have done wrong. She has a smile on her face and tells me AM called the corporate office about me. My manager then says ""she told me you laughed in her face, so I know she's full of shit, I just have to follow up with you for procedures sake."" I let out a sigh of relief and told my manager what had happened. The real kicker is my manager was the one who booked the appointment for AM's daughters facial and remembers clearly telling AM that the sale did not apply to a teen facial! That biznotch thought she was gonna get me fired, not today!

Since today is Halloween, and I've been getting a lot of PM's asking for this story, I felt today would be the perfect day to share it. I just need to emphasize a few things before I tell the story.

First off, this story involves death. I will refrain from getting too graphic. However, I am going to be sharing some details that can only be best described as ""nsfw"". If reading about a topic like this makes you feel sick, or uncomfortable, please do NOT continue reading. You have been warned.

The day started off like any other day. It was about 3:00PM. I had just finished lunch and had made myself my fourth cup of coffee for the day. I get to my desk and see a call coming through from our monitoring station. They are the company that dispatches the police/fire department when there is an emergency as well as contact clients in an emergency. I picked up the phone and the following is a 100% story of what happened...

**Me**: ""Thank you for calling xxxx, this is imhometakemedrunk, how can I help you today?""

**Monitoring Station/MS**: ""Hey imhometakeyoudrunk, I have a client on the phone who had the police panic alarm go off. They said it was an accident but they may need service. Can you help him with that?""

**Me**: ""Of course, send them through.""

**MS**: ""Okay, the account number is xxxxxx, his name is Mr. Walker. Here he comes.""

**Me**: ""Thank you for holding Mr. Walker(MW). My name is imhometakemedrunk, what seems to be the issue today?""

**MW**: ""Well, umm. It's not really an issue, I guess. It's just the system tried to send the police. I can't have the police coming here."" The client had a very monotone voice. It sounded as if all the life had been drained from him. It was cold, sharp and completely lifeless.

**Me**: ""Okay Mr. Walker. Did anybody press the police button on the panel?""

**MW**: ""Yeah, my wife-- I mean I must have leaned against it or somethin---SHUTUP-- sorry, damn dog. Yeah, so I guess I leaned on it. The police aren't coming out here, right?""

**Me**: ""No sir, there is no dispatch being made. So the system is working just fine then? There are no issues today?""

**MW**: ""Well, the system isn't really working right I guess since it tried to have the police come out.""

Now, I'm going to pause the story right here. This is the point where things started getting....well, weird. Please understand, I did NOT know what was going on entirely until the next day. I was suspicious, but everyone in the office thought I was making things up. Looking back, it seems so obvious. The next voice will be titled, The Wife, or TW. I could barely make out what was being said. It took at least three replays of the call to get everything entirely. 

**TW**: ""Help me! PLEASE! NO! PLEASE HELP ME!""

**MW**: ""I need to make sure the system doesn't send out the police. I can't have that happening. Can you have somebody look at the system and-- CAN YOU CUT IT OUT! I'M ON THE PHONE! -- sorry about that. This dog is driving me crazy. Anyways, I do need somebody to check the system. When can you come out?""

**TW** ""Oh god. Please *smack* NO!! *garggling sounds*""

**Me**: ""Is everything okay Mr. Walker? It sounds like somebody is hurt.""

**MW**: ""What?! Oh, you mean my dog? Yeah, she bitches a lot.""

**Me**: ""Oh, what kind of dog do you have?""

**MW**: ""Just a mutt. She's pretty useless. *creepy laugh*""

**Me**: ""Well, I have two German Shepards. They are the greatest pets ever.""

**MW**: ""Riiiiight. Sooo, can somebody come out?""

**Me**: ""Absolutely. We have a time slot available tomorrow from 9am-1pm. Does that work alright for you?""

**MW**: ""Let me check my schedule for the morning. Give me a second.""

Mr. Walker sets the phone down and walks away for a minute. I heard some shuffling around then the phone pick up by a very soft and watery sounding voice.

**TW**: ""Please.......send the...I..please...""

**Me**: ""Hello? Is somebody there? Is everything okay? HELLO?!""

**MW**: ""Sorry about that! My phone fell down and the dog got to it.""

**Me**: ""It sounded like somebody was talking to me. That was strange.""

**MW**: ""So I'm available tomorrow around mid-day. Can you do something a little later?""

**Me**: ""Sure, we can do 1pm-5pm. Is that okay?""

**MW**: ""Sounds good. That'll give me plenty of time to take care of my stuff. We will see you then.""

**Me**: ""Okay Mr. Walker. We look forward to seeing you tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with today?""

**MW**: ""Nope, I'm all set. Let's just make sure the cops don't come out here. I can't afford that to happen. No false alarms here.""

**TW**: ""No, no no no no no no no no no no....--chink--""

**MW**: ""Ah jeez, I have to go - click-""

**Me**: ""Mr. Walker?""

I immediately went to my manager to have him listen to the call. I was really put off by the call and didn't know if I should call the police or just let it go. The whole time speaking to him it just felt, off. My manager passed it off as a normal guy watching a movie in the background dealing with an annoying dog. Anybody I told didn't believe me. Then, the next day happened. 

The technician showed up to the home, to find it swarmed with police, an ambulance and the fire department. The technician was able to get an idea of what happened from a police officer there. Essentially, Mr. Walker and his wife had a serious fight and he snapped. He beat her severely then killed her with an ax. She tried to have the police sent out by pressing the emergency police button on her panel, but because the husband answered the phone when the monitoring station called, there was nothing we could do. He tried to cut her up and dispose of her, but a neighbor noticed him CARRYING AN ARM out back. They called the police and found the husband trying to bury her in the back yard. 

This was easily the worst moment in my entire career. I know there was no chance to save this woman, or prevent any of it from happening. That's not what bothers me. It's the fact that I didn't even think that another human being could be capable of brutally beating and then killing his wife while on the phone with a stranger. It really makes you think. 

So please, if you see/hear/feel off about something, say something. You could be saving somebody's life. I hope I was able to provide something to everyone that reads this story. Whether it's the realization of human capability, knowing that saying something can help, or you're just twisted and wanted a good story to read, I do hope you take something from this story. Thank you all for reading. Take care, and be safe. 

Happy Halloween

**TL;DR**: Trust me guys, you're going to want to read this one.

**EDIT**: It seems some people don't understand procedure for police dispatch in the alarm industry. I will break it down for you.

1. Alarm sounds. 2. Monitoring station calls the home 3. Husband answers, says it's a false alarm, gives password 4. Monitoring station cancels dispatch

I had nothing to do with the dispatch. I was there to try and set service to for the guy. As the conversation progressed more and more things started to raise little red flags. It wasn't until the next day that I had realized what all those red flags were pointing too. I could barely hear the woman on the phone. It took multiple listens to the call and full volume to even begin to understand what was being said by the wife. There is NOTHING that could have been done by ANYONE in my company or the monitoring station that could have changed the outcome. Feel free to keep debating that though.","(NSFWish)The story you've been waiting for, or, I Listened To Her Die",444
NejKidd,27,35,1pn89g,122,"I now work in a supermarket, but for a season I worked in a chain hotel.  Not strictly retail, but we had a product to sell and customers and various different stories from it, but first I want to introduce the people I worked with.

**Background** I was a receptionist in an understaffed hotel reception which was attached to a large restaurant.  Although the hotel made the most money by far, the restaurant was the place that the managers focussed all their attention on, and as a result the receptionists were often the only member of staff to cater to every whim of any guest in the hotel - which was a feat of endurance considering there were 100 rooms, each of which could hold up to 3 adults.  A tantrum from one could be disastrous.

The management were too cheap to employ the correct number of staff - a hotel our size by company regulations needed an absolute minimum of 12 receptionists and 5 night porters to run smoothly.  We had 5 receptionists and 2 night porters...

The 5 receptionists were all female.  Our head receptionist was a lady I'll call Dolly.  Then we had Beth who was older than the earth and had been there since the first dawn.  She liked to chatter to everyone, and it wasn't unusual for her to 'not have time' for half of her duties before her shift was over.  Kim was new and very slow at everything she did.  Where I picked up stuff 2nd or 3rd try (average), she would need prompting on her 10th or 15th go at a task.  Then, the worst colleague ever, Megan.

Megan was a small town girl.  I don't mean those sweet, naive small-town girl, I mean one of those who saw every man as a meal ticket and every woman as competition.  She was married at 16, divorced with 2 kids at 18 and when I left (she was 20) she was pregnant with number 3, which she didn't know if it was her ex-husband's, her newest boyfriend's or perhaps the guy she'd also been sleeping with the week those two overlapped.  I was a year younger, with an acceptance to a good university the year after and been accepted into a job in another country which began at the end of the season.  People told me her attitude toward me was because she was jealous.  I have no idea, but the facts do make a good case for it.

But enough ranting!  **On to the story!**

We had three shifts in the day; 7am to 3pm, 3pm to 11pm and 11pm to 7am (night porter shift).  We also had a pretty retarded system where even though we had 2 tills and paypoints, we had only 1 till draw.  We didn't often have people paying by cash, so it was rare we'd open it.  But we still had to count it out and in every shift.

Also, to sign out, we had to take note of *every single penny* we took in cash on our paypoint in the day.  As you tried to log out at the end of your shift, you'd have to enter in the exact amount of money you'd taken.  If you were out by even a penny, it would refuse to let you log out.  You then had to go across to the restaurant, get the manager to look at their system to see how you went wrong, then track back to the reception to log out properly.

Because of this system (and the managers being idiots) it wasn't unusual for me to leave work up to 2 hours late.  This is why I loved being on morning shift.

This one particular day, I had been my normal efficient self and done all the morning things, and Megan, who had bitched to managers about the weird hours and not being able to see her children, so they'd altered the timetable *just for her* so she worked midday to 9pm.  So for the last 3 hours of my shift, I had to deal with her sitting and chatting to all the guests instead of doing the work she'd been set, telling me loudly and obnoxiously how to do stuff while I was already doing it, and texting under the counter.  At 3pm my relief came in, Kim.  I signed out an hour late (because Megan kept being a bitch about me signing out - have I done this, have I done that, where is this piece of paper, why have I done that.  READ THE FUCKING HANDOVER SHEET NOTES I JUST PUT IN YOUR FUCKING HAND YOU TOTAL WASTE OF SPACE!!  Ahem.  Where was I?)  So I signed out an hour late, and as I was literally on my way out of the door I saw that both Megan and Kim were occupied with customers, and Kim was floundering while the guest trying to check in was getting frustrated and Megan was ignoring them both.  I stepped in and took over the check in, making sure to show Kim everything I was doing (again) and in the transaction the guest gave a £50 note, for which I gave both £20 notes in the till draw as change.  No problem, crisis averted, I swiped out, and left the premises.  It should be noted here that I live an hour away, so to get to the shift at 7am I had to wake at 5am, and if I left at 4pm it was now 5pm and I was exhausted.

The moment I stepped in the door the phone rang, and the conversation went like this;

&gt; Me: Hello?

&gt; Megan: You took £40 from the till.  Where have you put it?

&gt; Me: Sorry, I haven't taken any money from the till.  What's happened?

&gt; Megan: There's £40 missing from the drawer and we've looked everywhere, do you know where it's gone?

&gt; Me: No, I have no idea.  I left more than an hour ago, so I couldn't have done anything.  Are you sure you looked everywhere?

&gt; Megan: [practically screaming down the phone] NO! It had to be you!  When I came in there was £40 in the till, it was there the entire time until you left and now it's missing!  You have to know what happened to it!

&gt; The phone crackles and suddenly there's another voice on the line, it's the General Manager who I shall call Chief.

&gt; Chief: Hi, NejKidd.  We're a little bit rushed down here, but Megan says there was £40 in the till before you left, and we're not accusing you of anything, but perhaps it fell into your bag or something? 

&gt; Me: [naively checking my bag and internally panicking]  No there's nothing here, I haven't got a clue where it went, the till balanced perfectly before I left.

&gt; Chief: Okay, we'll keep looking here, but if you do find it, please just call us.

She puts down the phone and immediately I'm panicking.  What if Megan took it and hid it to pin it on me and make sure that I'd get fired this time.  She'd recently tried to pin various other fuck ups of her own on me, so this was just another in a long line of issues I had with her.  Obviously, it's the one I remember the most.

I went to bed and at 10pm I'd still heard nothing, so I rang up work to see if anything had come of it.  By that time both Chief and Megan had left, but Kim was still there.  She was surprised I even rang back.

&gt; Kim: Oh they found it.  It was there all the time.

&gt; Me: What? How?

&gt; Kim: They counted the till.  You know that £50 note you took for me?  Well, Megan had looked in the till before I came in and saw there were two £20 notes, and when I went to count it after the handover, she saw that the two £20 notes were gone, and went to get Chief before taking the office apart and then eventually phoning you.  Then they counted the till and found it was balanced, just that Megan hadn't seen you give the £20 notes as change.

So, basically Megan and Chief had accused me of stealing money from the till without even checking to see if the money *was actually still in the till*.  To make matters worse, they hadn't even bothered to phone me to apologise/tell me everything was okay.

After that, whenever I handed over to Megan I made sure I sat down with her and painstakingly went over everything I had done that morning, even when she got bored, I would explain everything I did just to make the point.

Megsout,38,32,1pn7uc,131,"Hey guys, I'm so upset I just had to post on here. My sister has worked at a certain high-end retail store that sells kitchen and food items for a number of years. 

Today was her day off, until she unexpectedly received a call on our home phone (which was provided as an emergency contact number) by her manager. It turns out her manager had a spur-of-the-moment doctor's appointment at 4PM and no one else could come in and cover for her. 

My sister explained that because today was her day off, she had made other plans. *Now it's important to note that my sister suffers from self-esteem and confidence issues, so she has a hard time standing up for herself. Following the explanation, her manager proceeded to bully her into covering her shift (and work till closing). 

I know this doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but her manager has done this numerous times (once even forcing my sister to work open to close and then open the following day). She also told my sister she couldn't request any time off this month because they are short-staffed, but them proceeded to allow another employee to take a 10-day vacation. 

I'm upset because we had planned to carve pumpkins together for the first time since we were kids (this was also my first Halloween home in a while). I know it's dumb and only pumpkin carving, but I feel like we never get to spend time together and I was really looking forward to tonight. I'm also upset because I'm tired of watching my sister get pushed around by her excuse of a manager.

I'm not sure what advice I can give my sister, because I'm sure this will continue to happen until somebody speaks up (which no one will do because they are all afraid of the repercussions).

MrsJingo,46,32,1pmi75,167,"My previous job was at a big UK chain cinema. At this cinema we had an icecream stand that sold a specific big brand of American icecream. Icecream customers were the worst!

One day I am working the icecream stand, it was a Monday or Tuesday so the whole place was dead. Suddenly there's a small child at the counter, when I say small I mean no older than 6. As far as I can tell he's on his own, no parent to be seen and the foyer seems deserted. There is no way he could open the doors by himself so I assume mum or dad isn't far away, maybe hiding round the corner so the little man can feel independant.

He places a £2 coin on the counter (enough for just a single scoop) and asks what flavours we have. I went through all the flavours with him (12 I think) making sure to tell him what is each one. He says he would like the banana one and he would like it in a cup not a cone. He was totally adorable and explained he couldn't have a cone because he might spill the icecream on himself. I gave him the biggest scoop I could realistically get away with. Off he goes with a huge grin, one happy little chap.

Awesome transaction right? Wrong..

Mere seconds later this great big hulk of a woman comes storming over, dragging this (now bawling) little boy along. She procedes to scream right in my face something about trying to kill her child. Turns out this kid has a nut allergy, the banana icecream I sold him contains banana shaped chocolates and walnuts..

More than shocked all I can think to do is point right at the giant signs *everywhere* that say 'Due to the nature of this stand, all of our products may contain nut traces' and tell her he shouldn't have anything from here then. She threw the icecream at me and stormed off, didn't even ask for a refund.

I don't really hate it, but there isn't much room for career development in it so I'm taking a job as a hydroelectric plant operator.

WishfulOne,22,18,1pme05,62,"Once upon a time, in the land of BigBoxRetail (BBR), there worked an employee who had been dubbed Scratch 'n' Sniff (SNS) by her co-workers.  SNS was always assigned an area to but would always wander off.  It was left to her frustrated co-workers to track her down every time.  Complaints to the Rulers of BBR fell on deaf ears.  The poor co-workers were accused of being mean to SNS, that they were picking on her.  

A Handsome Prince (HP) was often spotted within the boarders of BBR.  He was well liked.  He would greet all he encountered and chitchat for a few minutes, if he had time.  HP did not like SNS, she was the only co-worker in BBR that he avoided.  If SNS saw him, she would follow him around, talking to him nonstop about inappropriate topics (e.g. having to pick up tampons for her sister after work).  HP was too nice to tell her to leave him alone and SNS didn't pick up on the subtle hints HP directed at her.

HP was a collector of miniature cars.  He would be spotted in BBR several times a week looking for additions to his collection.  One day, BBR was having a sale on HP's favourite cars. A large bin of the cars had been placed in the centre of a main aisle.  HP was bent over the side of the bin, happily searching through it, looking for more treasures to take home.  SNS, who had wandered away from her area again, spotted poor, unsuspecting HP and swooped down on him.  Out of nowhere she grabbed HP's behind, uttering a joyful ""How are ya?"" as she did so.  HP spun around, shock, horror, embarrassment, and confusion all fighting for a spot on his face.  

One of the Rulers of BBR was summoned and HP relayed his tale.  ""Do you want to press charges?"", he asked HP.  ""No,"" said HP.  But he did hope that SNS would be reprimanded/fired for her actions.  With that HP left BBR and was never seen within its boarders again.

The Rulers of BBR had always preached how there was zero-tolerance policy when it came to sexual harassment but that wasn't the case this day.  The Rulers decreed that since HP had decided against pressing charges, then SNS could keep her job.  Her co-workers, knowing full well that had roles been reversed they would have been fired, were given one more reason to dislike SNS.

are these all excuses? yeah, they are. but if he wanted me to wear another pair of pants that day, there were four easier, more mature options he could have taken.

I'll update when I come back

EDIT: k so I almost quit this job today (again)

So what happened on Tuesday was I went into work and was about to clock in and the DM started belittling / interrogating me in a smug manner about my sweatpants. Keep in mind my DM is 24 and I'm 20 so I'm already a little pissed at the way I'm being talked to.

I'm also being promoted to keyholder up there so I'm really glad our top manager respects other members of management even though they're beneath them LOL 

I got sent home today by my regular manager who is honestly a cool guy but he would have gotten in trouble if the DM had come in and seen my pants even though I told my manager I'd cover it over the weekend.

But ya know even if I had the correct pants the DM would have found something else to criticize me for. He picks on me and harasses me every time he's there idk why I avoid him cause authority figures freak me out but I'm tired of getting picked on by this spoiled little shit who probably only got where he is today because Daddy paid for it.

shaelynne,40,77,1pm7q8,415,"**Backstory**: I had been working for 2 1/2 years at a well known arts and crafts supply store. I had been given a measly 75 cent raise over those 2 1/2 years. My bosses reasoning? ""Being a woman, you can't lift as much as the guys can."" He was sexist and I was young and didn't know any better. My actual job title was price integrity coordinator, which meant I was responsible for price changes throughout the store. But, I also held keys, opened and closed the store, ran the front end, ran a register, stocked, did receiving and on occasion even jumped into specialty departments like floral or framing. Essentially, I ran the store on 75 cents over minimum wage. 

**The day I quit**: It was in the midst of Black Friday chaos. I had been working since 4am, and it was now about 8am. All 10 registers were rolling and the front end manager had pulled a no call no show. I was the only one in the store at that time able to make change for tills and had thought all my price changes were fine and set before we left Wednesday night (closed on Thanksgiving).

So, I'm in the front office, making cash drops and change for a few registers. My manager comes storming in, holding some papers. Apparently, sometime in the last 24 hours over the holiday corporate sent down some price changes for a small end cap of about 15 products. Something that could wait until change was made and cash was dropped, which I was almost done doing. Leaving over $1000 worth of cash in a drawer is not a good idea. Also, changing the prices would take no time, after I was done my task. 

I calmly explain to him that I'm in midst of dropping thousands of dollars worth of cash and making some change for some cashiers. NO! That wasn't good enough for him. He INSISTED I drop everything I was doing and change the prices. I stayed calm, he started getting angry and frustrated. We went back and forth, and I peered out the front office window at the long line of customers. I turn back to him, grab my store keys, and toss them to him. 

""You can find someone else to run your store. I quit."" And I walked out. Clocked out, collected my things and left. All the while ignoring him following behind me begging me to stay, begging me to help him get through the Black Friday madness. He even promised me a 15 cent raise. Oh boy!

Nope. I was gone.

I wasn't really new by the time this incident rolled around. Working the register by myself, being given more responsibility, etc.

Anywho, on Tuesdays we had 'Senior Day'. I HATED that day. No offense to old/older people in general but so many were just flat out mean for no reason. On this day people over a certain age got 15% off on their entire purchase(excluding color of the week tags/other sales items).

Lady Person(LP) has a medium sized order of stuff. I ring her up, and with a big smile I happily tell her to have a nice day.

LP stands there for a second looking between the receipt and me. Calmly she explains that she didn't get her 15% off. For a second my heart drops because I thought I had forgotten but checking the receipt in her hand shows clearly where it took off.

Gist of the conversation(It's been a good while):
Me: Yes, Ma'am, it took off. See right here?
LP: You didn't give me the senior discount.
Me: Y-Yes, Ma'am, I did. It-

A regular steps up to cut off what I was saying, suggesting that maybe I made a mistake. I just wanted to glare up at him while saying he should damn well know how to read the flippin' receipt.

Long story short I end up calling my manager because I JUST HAVE TO BE WRONG.

While waiting for my manager I serve another customer who's trying to help me feel better. All the while the LP is butting in, talking down to me. It only gets worse as she starts talking to my manager.

I'm a moron. I'm rude. I'm too stupid to be working register. Etc. And she says it in this VOICE. That's so sweet feels like your teeth might rot out. I honestly don't know what got to me but I spend the next five minutes crying my eyes out in the back of the store.

angerandbooks,17,15,1pm4vs,66,"Hello. I'm doing a blog, the first of which I posted here about a week ago, and this is my second post. It can be found [here](http://anthropologyandbooks.wordpress.com/2013/10/31/its-difficult-i-know/) (the formatting is a bit nicer) or you can read it below...


I once had a nemesis.

She only came in twice, but she spoke just to me, seemed to hate me, and I still think about her every now and then, so I have classed her as my nemesis (although I think I may have met my new nemesis, but we’ll see about that).

I used to work in a shop that was inside a shopping centre. It’s a pretty shitty shopping centre, with a big supermarket, a gym, two cafes, a cinema, a crap pub, some restaurants and a couple of other shops. People mostly come in for the supermarket. 

This shopping centre is in a really odd area, that doesn’t really have anything else going for it, other than you can walk to a very posh area in about 20 minutes.

The customers are, without a doubt, some of the most horrible people I have ever encountered, with the exception of an older gentleman who comes in every day, says hello to us all, and sometimes falls asleep on the couch. If he falls asleep, he walks past us as he is leaving and says “I just fell asleep!” to which we all chuckle merrilly, and he goes on his way.

Here is an example: I once got told off for showing a customer to the book she was asking for.

She said to me “Where are the Elmer books?” and I said “They will be in the picture book section, under M for McKee”.

I may have been slightly terse, as she didn’t greet me in any other way, just demanded to know where Elmer was.

She then stated “I’m in a hurry”, so I emerged from behind the till, took her to the picture book section, handed her some Elmer books said “There you go”, and left her to it. When she returned, she said to me “Everybody here is rude. You just stomped away after I asked for help”, to which I replied “I did not stomp. I am sorry that you feel that way. You told me you were in a hurry, so I showed you what you asked for”. She bought the book, and left in a huff.

But she was not my nemesis. 

My first encounter with the nemesis was as I was tidying a table in the front of the store. She entred the shop and called over to me.

“Where’s Jack London!” (The customers in this shop never seemed to say ‘Hello’, or ‘Please’, or ‘Thank you’. I honestly believe there is something in the water there).

I looked up at her, and said “Jack London? I think we might have him in the children’s section”. 

This was not the correct answer. “Children’s section! Why is he in the children’s section? He doesn’t write books for kids! He wouldn’t be happy about that.”

I almost said to her “Will you be telling him?” but I didn’t, as she was terrifying. 

I tried to explain that the publishers produce his books with covers for adults, and also some of his books with covers for children. She shook her head at me, as if I was making this up, and walked away as I was still talking to her, pulling her little trolley along behind her. 

Not so bad, really. She was very abrupt, and had absolutely no manners, but it didn’t bother me that much.

Then she came back. 

It was a few weeks later, she came in pulling her trolley along, wearing a t-shirt with the American flag on the front, sunglasses on inside. And again she approached me. 

“Where’s your American literature. I’m looking for writers like Jack London.”

“We don’t keep American authors separate, they’re all in the fiction section.”

“I’m looking for American authors like Steinbeck or Jack London. What Jack London do you have?”

Oh, God, I thought. We went through it again. I told her we only really have the children’s versions of White Fang and The Call of the Wild, and that yes, the publishers do this on purpose. 

She shook her head dismissively. She still didn’t believe me. I asked her which Jack London she was after. She said she wanted The Iron Heel. I looked it up, and we didn’t have it, so I said “We could order it in for you or I can check other shops and you could pick it up-”

“I am not going to other shops”.

“….OK”

“I am looking for American Literature that is older. I don’t mind newer stuff, but I prefer older like Steinbeck or Salinger.”

So I walked her over to the fiction section and said, again “We keep all the fiction together, alphabetised by author. How about Paul Auster?”

“No” 

“Have you tried Don DeLillo?”

“I don’t want that”

“….John Updike?”

“I did that when I was a child.”

After a few more sugeestions, and a few more rejections, I eventually said “Well, it’s really a matter of just looking through the section and seeing what we have.”

And she huffed, and said  dismissively “Yes, yes. It’s really difficult, it must be very difficult for you, I know.”

So I left her to it, slightly exasperated and a bit fed up.

My manager had come onto the shop floor in the meantime, and I returned to the tills to have a little chat with him. The woman approached again, and I quietly said to him “Oh, no. I don’t want to speak with this lady.”

She walked by the tills as if to leave, and then stopped in front of us.

“You know,” she stated loudly, “Every time I come in here I am treated with disdain. You speak to me as if I am stupid. I know you are going to talk about me as soon as I leave. DON’T try to deny it! You will! I am sick of being spoken to in this way. This is a bad shop, and I won’t be spoken to as if I am nothing.” 

She went on. All the while, we were both stood there, me trying to say “No, we won’t” Or “I’m sorry you feel that way”, but being interrupted, and my manager just looking on in shock.

Finally, to finish me off, she said “You remember this. I have written things. I write things! And you just work here. You just work here.”

And off she went. 

She got me, this woman did. I was very shaken. 

My manager said he should have done something, and he was sorry, but he was so shocked that he couldn’t react. I had to go off the shop floor and take some deep breaths. 

I did see her again a few weeks later, but I scuttled upstairs and she left without speaking to anyone. 

That is the story of the woman who I called my nemesis. She managed to make me feel very small, and I have no idea why. 

 

And yes. If you are rude, we will always talk about you after you leave. We are human. ","""It's Difficult, I know"" Or My Second Tale From Retail",81
mknow857,9,15,1pm33a,46,"**Background**: I have worked retail in a variety of ways, some more traditional than others. I worked at a retail pharmacy over the summer, but due to the short amount of time, I don't have many stories. However, I also work in a less traditional setting, selling memberships to a gym. This particular gym also had a pool, and I occasionally moonlighted teaching swim lessons, to boost my hours a little bit. 

This story is actual one of the more ridiculous, because of the triviality. This was while I was teaching a swim lesson, but I also handled some of the retail portion, since I knew how that worked as well. 

**THE STORY**: So, this round of swim lessons I was teaching pretty advanced swimmers. Our swimmers get colored bracelets denoting their swim ability, so the guards know where they are allowed to go in the pool. If you are a visitor (i.e. just there for swim lessons) you get a disposable one. Members get a plastic one. 

I've got a girl who isn't a member, but her mother keeps insisting she is. I start to write her a slip to purchase a new bracelet, but decide at the last minute to check her membership status. If she's purchasing, it doesn't lose us money, but again, I don't want to break rules and get in trouble. I hand her the slip (yes, my mistake), explain I'm checking her status, and then go to ask my boss. 

While I'm asking my boss, Crazy Mom comes up to the retail counter, gives them the slip (that I haven't signed yet, mind you), and purchases it behind my back. She knew full well I was checking and making sure I could even sell it to her. It's decided she is not allowed to purchase it. Now I'm stuck having to process a return for her. 

I try to calmly explain to her that she shouldn't have purchased it already, that it was decided she can't purchase it, and that I have her money (in cash, she had paid with card) for her in exchange for the bracelet back. The following is what she said - there was not much for me to say, because I never got the chance. 

""You know, I have CULTURE. I bring my daughter here because it's nicer, and because it's a better quality. All you've done is give me cash back for my card, I could have gone to the bank for that. You think I need you to give me cash back on my card? Like I'm some kind of poor person? I don't need to do that here - I can use my card like a normal person!

You know, I have CULTURE. You're treating me like some redneck piece of crap. You may be able to do that with some people around here, but not me. You can't treat me that way. I mean, what are YOU PEOPLE doing here. I'm high class. You need to treat me like it!""

At this point, I'm fifteen minutes late for the start of my lesson, I'm tired of the BS, and she's said she has culture like eight times. I just referred her to my boss and started the lesson. I eventually got to tell my boss what happened (so if I got a weird complaint she would know what happened). The fact that she snuck by me was the unbelievable part. The whole thing was so trivial! And the best, which I found out after she was done ranting, was that her daughter had a necklace from us (the old way we used to do it, and that we still used if members had them), but mom didn't want her to have to feel different from the other kids.

FredFltStn,278,743,1pm32e,1668,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Welcome to the week of scam artists. They rarely get away with it, but that sure doesn't stop them from trying.

Everything we sell is Buy 1 Get 1 Free (BOGO). We also send out mailers and have business cards that are good for Buy 1 Get 2 Free on any item up to $50. We also let you mix and match the items, so you don’t have to get three of the same things. I'm basically giving you an extra $25 in free fireworks just for showing up, in the hopes that you purchase more than that, and that you come back to see us every year.

The coupons have your typical legalese at the bottom. Can only be used on one item, cannot be reproduced, one offer per day, one offer per family our group, only valid on items up to $50, etc. 

I usually keep a stack of these coupons in my pocket, and I hand them out pretty freely when the store is open. I think it's a great promotional tool, and although it does impact my bottom line, I wouldn't think of getting rid of it.

As you can imagine, we get our fair share of people trying to scam us with the coupon.

**SCAM 1**  There's a lady and her husband that show up at our tent at least four or five times each season with coupons. Each time, it's the same routine. They'll spend an hour watching videos and carefully examining everything we sell. When they’re ready to checkout, the husband and wife will both approach the counter separately, each carrying their three items, and each with and a coupon. 

They each pay for one item, and get the other two for free. If we ask them if there together, which I've done before for laughs, they shake their heads and act like they’ve never met, even though they just spent the last hour shopping together. 

The very next day, they’ll show up and do the exact same thing.  Another hour of examining products, pick out three, walk to the counter separately, use their coupon. Even though they are technically scamming me, I always let it go, because frankly, I think it's funny as hell.

**SCAM 2**  Another regular customer. Every season, this guy comes in and picks out three of every item he intendeds to purchase. When he gets to the counter, he presents his coupon, and we of course explained to him that he can only use it on one item. He'll then spend 5 minutes arguing that I let him use it on everything he purchased the last time he was here. In the end, I’ll let him use it on two items, and he celebrates like he’s won the lottery. 

The thing is, he’s a regular, and he buys a shitload of fireworks. I’d probably give him a better discount than the two uses of the card if we didn’t have to go back and put up all the extra shit he picked out. I seriously think he does it just to feel like he’s gotten something over on us. 

**SCAM 3**  A lady walks up to the counter with a fountain ($19.95) and two massive assortments ($249.95) in her cart. I was standing behind the counter, so I went to ring her up. Before I could start, she handed me a coupon and this conversation took place.

**LADY:**  I’m just paying for the fountain, I’m going to use the coupon for the free items.

**ME:**  (wondering WTF she is thinking) I’m sorry, but the coupon is only good on items up to $50, and the free items have to be of equal or lesser value.

**LADY:**  It doesn’t say that anywhere on the coupon!

I look at the coupon and sure as hell, she’s right…because she’s cut off the bottom third of the coupon that had all the legalese.

**ME:**  I’m sorry, but this coupon has been altered. It normally has all the details on the bottom (handing her another coupon from my pocket so she can see).

**LADY:**  That’s not my problem! My coupon doesn’t say that, so legally you have to honor my purchase.

**ME:**  (rudely, because WTF, really?) Yeah, that’s not going to happen. I don’t know what happened to your coupon (sure I don’t), but it’s been altered, and I’m not obligated to take altered coupons.

The lady is now full on yelling at me, insisting that I’m breaking the law, and that she can sue me for not taking her coupon. 

On this particular day (thank god), we actually had hired an off duty uniformed police officer to sit at the entrance to the tent acting as security. We do that on our busier days because it’s a great deterrent for theft, and it builds goodwill with the local police, since they make great extra money for a really easy gig (see [here](http://redd.it/1nkw27)). Besides, they love my mom’s Cajun cooking.

The lady stomps away from the counter and approaches the police officer to obviously raise hell about me.

Before she can say anything, the officer looks her in the eyes and says “One moment ma’am”, the calls over to me loudly enough for everyone to hear.

**OFFICER:**  Did you want me to arrest her or just throw her out?

**ME:**  It’s up to you. You’ve got to fill out the paperwork.

She left without another word.

Phenakist,23,7,1pm2qi,43,"Something considerably more coherent than my last post. I work in a large UK discount chain that has a thing for Bargains. 

A couple of weeks ago I'm on till, as I've been exclusively condemned to despite my job description being ""general assistant"" but that's a rant for another time. All is going as well as can be expected serving to the lowest common denominator until a woman (lets call her Mildred) abruptly arrives at the end of my till. It's about 11am at this point

Mildred: That Chocolate is 3 days out of date!

Me: Oh? Sorry about that, don't worry, I'll get that looked at.

Mildred: That is unacceptable selling out of date products!

Me (firmly): Yes I know, I will get it sorted.

Mildred: You didn't even ask me what chocolate it was!

She leaves the shop and the day continues on as normal, the customer I was serving even commenting ""Well she's got her knickers in a twist over nothing, it's chocolate, it'll keep 'till the cows come home"". Soon after I manage to get a word in to my assistant manager, gave her the run down and she says ""I have a sign on that saying dated stock, it's discounted too."" So with that mystery solved, back to business as usual.

After coming back down from lunch, Mildred is approaching and beginning to harass one of our relatively new staff who hasn't yet developed the thick skin for till, and Mildred had her frozen wondering what to do about it. I step in.

Me: Is everything alright here?

Her attention completely shifts to me

Mildred: I told you your chocolate was out of date! It is still there!

Me: I've spoken to my manager about it, it is clearly marked as dated, and has been discounted appropriately.

Mildred: That is unacceptab-!

Me: -Lets go have a look at it. 

She storms over myself in tow, and proceeds to dramatically take a box from the shelf, scrutinizes the date thoroughly before thrusting it in my direction.

Mildred: SEE that date is 3 days ago!

Me: Yes, and that is a best before date, which means exactly what it states, it's not ""out of date"" and is therefore sell able.

Mildred: We'll see what trading standards has to say about this!

Me: I imagine they'll tell you what I'm about to tell you which is, we're allowed to sell something for up to 30 days after it's ""Best before date"" but not a second after it's ""sell by date"".

rumplesplitskin,48,15,1plsm8,91,"Ever since we've been open our little petrol station has had some kind of music playing device gently pumping out either the radio or a favourite CD that someone have brought in from home. In all this time management has never batted an eyelid about us listening to music as long as we kept the volume low when customers are in the shop. 

That is until last week when out of the blue we're instructed to switch the radio off permanently. Someone higher up found out that for over a decade we have been ""broadcasting"" music illegally. Going by what i've been told the main stores PPL licence that allows them to play music to the public does not cover us over here in the petrol station. And management are not willing to fork out the £130ish for a separate licence just for us.  

As you can imagine this bummed us all out as music can be lifesaver during those long cold winter hours where customers are few and far between. So myself and the other shift leaders got together and offered to pay for the costs out of our own pocket. But when the main store manager put this forward to head office they came to the store, lined us up and forced us to bend over naked while they inserted root vegetables into our anal cavity's using a polo mallet. Well this is how it felt when they said no.

We though about applying directly to the licensing folk but this too is not allowed. The public can't buy a licence for a business they do not personally own. Now here is where it gets REALLY bad.

We're not allowed to play copyrighted music but we are allowed to play anything that our department heads son had made with his friends in their basement recording studio(or i should say phone mic) Worse still they are a wannabe boy band. For the past few days we've been listening to four tweeny boys singing about falling in love, having sex and twerking.

I'm more than positive every member of this ""band"" is still waiting for the second testicle to drop.

RedhairedLady,6,5,1pls4n,26,"Back in college, I used to work at the customer service desk for a big box store. I would alternate mostly day shifts and a random night shift while going to a community college in the next town over. I'm terribly recognizable so customers would always remember me while I tend to forget them. 

One of my first nights there, we got a phone call for appliances. It was a slow night but appliances wouldn't take the call so I had to assist the customer. It was a woman with a thick accent (Middle-Eastern I believe) who was having problems with her dryer. She was loudly trying to tell me that it wouldn't work. I asked her when she bought it and tried trouble shooting as best as I could. I also couldn't understand her so I would ask, ""M'am can you talk a little slower for me, please"". Half the conversation was me pleading for them to stop speaking so loudly and to talk slower.  The person would not let me out of the phone call and no matter how many times I tried transferring to appliances, no other employee would take the call. My co-worker laughed at me while this scenario dragged on for twenty minutes. Frustrated, I finally apologized and asked for them to call back tomorrow and politely hung up. 

I was at school the next day waiting outside a classroom in the middle of campus with about twenty other students. Suddenly a rather large and sweaty guy appeared and started yelling to me, ""You! You work at big box store!""  I sigh and say yes. He then proceeds to tell me that he called the store last night and spoke to a girl about his dryer not working.  ""She was so dumb she did not know how to turn on a dryer. I know it wasn't you because you work in the daytime. She was so stupid. I'll come in when you're working"". I smiled, apologized for my idiot co-worker (which was me), and told him to have a nice day. The look on my face as this man walked away was priceless.

fire_pixie,9,3,1plo9h,20,"Hello, I need some advice on how to deal with this situation. I'm not sure how to go about it and I thought maybe people here would have a clue how to. 

The day started pretty good all was well. I'm a cashier and the customers weren't too bad today, the only problem I was having is working with one of the managers whom I don't particularly get along with, we just have nothing in common, we'll call him Stickupbum. 

Now it was time for my break, which was 20 minutes late, but I was alright, I got a $1 tip and people were very nice! I clocked out, grabbed some food, and headed back to get checked out. There were three checkers Stickupbum was one of them and he was just finishing up. I noticed a customer heading for him as well so I gladly waved my hand for the customer to go first and he declined insisting I go first, so we did the weird dance of 'no you'. I thanked the customer and went up to Stickupbums register and this is what happened:

SUB (stickupbum) Looking me dead in the eye ""Customers go first""

Me: ""But-""

SUB yelling: ""STOP!""

Me: ""He let-""

SUB still yelling: ""STOP IT""

I was stunned, I was insulted, I felt like a toddler getting in trouble. I grabbed my reciept took a look at the other two cashiers and headed towards the break room SUB said something along the lines of ""Don't talk to me like that"" as I was walking away. Called my boyfriend so he could help calm my nerves and talk it out with him. My very supportive loving boyfriend told me if I wanted to walk out I could and I could just find another job. I was so close to doing just that but I didn't want to be seen as the person who walks out on the job. 

I stuck it out for the rest of the night, I really didn't want to but I did. Now I'm sitting at home not sure if I want to go in tomorrow, part of the reason I don't want to quit is because it is just that manager, I get along with every one else and I only ever get positive feedback from customers and co-workers. Another reason is because my boyfriend and the store manager are good friends and he's the main reason I got the job, I don't want to insult the store manager because I really enjoy him. SUB works tomorrow too and he told me tomorrow is when we would talk about it because he couldn't talk earlier or he would just yell at me, I don't know what to say and I don't know how I will react to what he will say to me. 

I was waiting for an apology tonight but I never got one. I feel like I am not in the wrong and he is, am I wrong about that? I would like some outlook onto this, I'm sorry if this isn't really a good place to put this and sorry for the wall of text. I appreciate any responses :)",Some advice.,23
spinnaker989,49,50,1plnhd,267," I worked at a small store focused mainly on collegiate logo shirts and hats. We had several tabletop mannequins that were just torsos with legs extending down to just above the knee; ideal for displaying shirts.

Locclo,28,17,1plmyz,92,"This story sums up exactly why I get a tiny feeling of dread whenever an assistant manager decides to help out in our department. Don't get me wrong, I generally appreciate the help, but...well, you'll see.

For background, I work in the bakery department of a big retailer. It doesn't pay much, but it pays the bills, and it's one of the easiest jobs to just zone out while I'm working, since once you've worked there for three years, packaging the bread requires almost zero focus and attention. Cake decorating, on the other hand...that requires training. Training which I do not have, because I was hired as a part-time bread monkey. 

Worth mentioning is the fact that we currently don't have a decorator - we're supposed to have two decorators, but one slot has been in constant flux (one fired, one changed departments, one quit) and as of a week ago, the woman who had been decorating for years has moved on to greener pastures. As you might guess, we're kind of stuck, we can't take any cake orders since there's nobody to do them, and nine times out of ten, we can't even write on cakes, because between the Deli and the Bakery, out of probably 15 or so employees, one person is trained as a decorator.

Anyway.

In today's story, it's almost the end of the day for me, about forty-five minutes before I'm outta there, ready to enjoy a night of watching Breaking Bad while playing Batman (I have a thrilling social life, you see). Nobody else is in the bakery, I'm all by my lonesome, with the exception of two recently transferred assistant managers who are helping to stock, because I'm working on closing. That's when a customer walks up to the bakery and asks one of the assmen to write on a cake for him. Sure, the manager says, no problem, let me just grab Locclo from the back.

The manager grabs me and asks if I can write on a cake. I, of course, not being trained in this skill, tell him that I can't - all I can do is give a little plastic thing that says ""Happy Birthday"" on it. Now, I don't know if the manager didn't hear me, or if he didn't understand me, or if just didn't listen to what I was saying, but the next thing I know, he walks back over to the customer and says, ""Yeah, he'll do it for you, just tell him what you want written on it.""

[My reaction.](http://i.imgur.com/jNFqw.gif)

Well, obviously, I can't do it, so I quickly explain to the customer that I can't actually write on the cake, because I'm not trained in doing it. I apologize and offer him the plastic thingy, he doesn't seem to mind at all and just takes one of those instead.

Then, of course, the manager comes back, and he's none too happy. Once again, I explain to him that not only am I not trained as a decorator, I've never written on a cake before in my life. I have no experience, no practice, and for that matter, I only kinda-sorta-not-really remember how to write in cursive. Then he pulls out this wonderful line:

I looked at him like he was trying to sell me the SlapChop and Shamwow for $19.99 plus shipping and handling.*

Yes, the untrained, inexperienced guy who screwed up making cupcakes (which are harder than you'd expect to make them look nice, that's my story and I'm sticking to it) is going to do a better job at trying to write in frosting than a guy who actually knows how to do it. Even if it's been a long time, you've still got a huge leg up over the guy who has *never* done it.

Even better, his next direction? Get with my department manager so that he can teach me how to write on cakes. My department manager who also doesn't know how to do it.

I know this story seems like a pretty silly thing to rant about (I'm anticipating a bunch of posts about how it's not hard to write on cakes, just try it and practice it) but it's a little frustrating when the manager knew how to do something that I didn't, still asked me to do it, and completely ignored me when I said I couldn't do it.

I was helping this customer find a table for her new office. The one we found was out of stock in the whole city.

Her first words out of her mouth went a little something like this: 

""Well, make it your problem, not mine and fix it. I want this table"". 

My eye literally twitched, luckily where I work, my managers are okay with me not helping those with an attitude problem.

I asked her, in an annoyed tone:

""When you go buy furniture, do you want to see what it looks like before you buy it to see how it fits?""

""Yes""

""Then, that is why we cannot sell you the demo"".

I got 5 tall boys and a pack of smokes. It was $14.50 total.
I told her ""I have some old school coins, here's $10."" and had a $5 bill for the rest. 

She takes the coins and says, well you have a lot more than $10 here and starts counting out the Kennedy's as dollars. 

The thing that caught me off guard was that she was probably 30 years my senior (In her 60's). 
I wouldn't be too surprised if she was young, but I assumed she'd recognize the coins without an explanation.

She would have counted out $12 instead of the actual $6 I gave to her in half dollars.

quintz71,8,13,1pleoj,62,"I've worked many haunted houses since 1988 and one standing rule is ""No refunds, No Exceptions"" which is usually written in large print behind the ticker seller. So here's what happened last weekend.

It's about an half hour before opening and a lady arrives with a young girl (maybe 10 yrs of age) to go through the house. At this time most of all of the actors are hanging out in front of the house in various stages of being in their costumes which is a little pet peeve of mine especially when there are customers there that can see them since this can take from the fear factor, but all well since it can be a pain waiting in the house itself. But this lady with the young girl waits patiently for the house to open, obviously hesitant but excited to go through the house.

It's the top of the hour, the actors take their place and the house opens. And I see the lady and the young girl go into the house, the young girl again hesitant, but willing to go through. I joke to one of the other operators that the two girls won't make it through the house and we chuckle. It didn't take 3 rooms and I see them being escorted out from one of the chicken exits by one of our ""floaters"". We all start to laugh a little.

This is when things get really interesting. The lady immediately walks up to the ticket counter asking for a refund. The ticket girl points to the no refund policy behind her and tells the lady that it's not available. The lady gets upset and continues to demand a refund. At this point I step in and tell the lady we have a strict no refund policy which why it's written in such large letters so everyone can see when they purchase their tickets. The lady then argues that she deserves the refund since her and the young girl didn't even get through the first 3 rooms. I tell her that she paid for us to scare her and apparently we did one hell of a great job at it and again we don't give refunds. 

So then the lady argues that we shouldn't have sold a ticket to a young girl. All I could say was ""Ma'am, you purchased that ticket knowing how young your girl was, you accepted any such risks in that purchase.""

Finally the lady and I came to an arrangement that I would give her two passes that she could use any time for the rest of the season (which is this weekend). She took the passes and left.",One for the season,75
NinjaBunnyDeathSquad,51,49,1plb4a,224,"I am spending this week, burning the last of my vacation time so I don't lose it before the 4-month-long ""vacation blackout"" season that our company has imposed. Which mostly involves sitting around in my pajamas watching Doctor Who.

Anyways. Two days into said vacation, I got a call at home from my boss. The company has ""reevaluated all management positions"" (I am an assistant store manager) and they are ""restructuring into four unique positions"" - basically taking all of the assistant managers, all of the department managers, and just giving them a new title to their position. The workload doesn't change - I will actually be responsible for MORE now than before.

But, here's the kicker - my pay was based off a 46 hour work week, where the 6 hours were ""guaranteed overtime"". That money equals 25% of my total pay each year. They are removing ALL overtime but ""we get to keep our hourly pay rate!""

I just need to vent. I don't know what to do at this point, no one is hiring within miles of where I live, I am the only income for our family of 3 because we have a disabled child, and I just want to cry. They've also given me an assigned schedule rotation that is designed in a way where I can't even get a 2nd job because I wouldn't have enough availability.

expulsus,6,16,1pl98v,40,"Hey guys! This is my first TFR post. I work at a drug store. It's the easiest job in the world. I'm paid to smile and pretend to like you, kind of like a stripper, but with a little more dignity and a lot less cash.

It was a fairly busy evening around Easter and I was standing at the front counter ringing people up. In my town, we have categories of people, one of them being ""tubby middle aged ladies with 80's hair and matching pantsuits."" (TMAL) Every time I greet a customer, the conversation begins like this: ""Hey, how are you today?"" ""good."" ""Did you find everything you were looking for?"" and so on.

So anyway, I'm ringing up a long line of customers without a care in the world. One of the TMAL had just gotten a few giant bags of candy and was leaving after the usual ""hey, how are you"" ""good"" exchange as I greeted my next customer: ""Hey, how are you today?"" ""Well, how are you?"" ""Ooh, great! Thanks for using proper grammar!"" and then I kind of laugh and move on with my life. I'm an English major. I can't help it. I notice when someone uses proper grammar when I'm used to hearing the usual BS all day long from every single person I encounter. (That being said, lay off my grammar this evening. It's what I've been doing all day long and I'm tired!)

The TMAL turned around and went ""BITCH!"" and left the store. I had no idea what happened. In my tiny little brain, I had just been called a bitch for no reason at all. I shrug to myself and continue checking out my line, and promptly forget her.

About half an hour later, there was a bit of a quiet moment when I got a phone call.

""Thank you for calling my store, this is expulsus, how can I help you?""
""LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER.""
""Okie dokie, hang on just a second!""

A few minutes later, my favorite manager then comes out with this sort of shocked look on his face and explained to me that by complimenting that man's grammar, TMAL took it as a dig at her because she told me that she was doing ""good"" when I asked her. Now, I don't know about you, but as soon as someone walks away from the counter with their stuff in a bag and receipt in hand, I forget they were ever there. Some lady thought that I cared about her bad grammar so much that I was going to tell the next person that came through my line.

whatkindoffuckery,5,16,1pl8mo,43,"So I was working at the Service Desk of a grocery store for awhile. The store is right next to a not so nice neighborhood.  
We had a lot of crazies but one was just absolutely ridiculous.  
He had already been thrown out of the store on multiple occasions and wasn't actually supposed to be in the store but some managers just didn't give enough shits to throw him out. 

So its absolutely packed in our store, I'm trying to manage the usual circus act of answering all the cashier's codes while simultaneously running the service desk. I'm in the office when I see a man come and place some items on the counter. I finish up what I'm doing and I go to help him, but he's gone. Yet all these items are still on the counter. I ignore it and continue dealing with other customers.

About half an hour later he returns, with the exact same items that are on the counter... I ask him if hes doing a return and he says no. He pulls a reciept out of his pocket and proclaims that our self-checkout gave him this reciept today and he realized when he got home that his items werent on it.
I take a look at the reciept and its three days old and lists a cashier that isn't even at work that day. Not to mention its tattered and torn and definitely not from an hour ago. I explain this to him, and he immediately starts going off. ""Now I don't know what the fuck kind of machines youre running but it gave me this fucking reciept and I just want to pay for my shit"" 
I explain to him that if a reciept printed that he did indeed pay for it, but this isn't the right reciept. He continues on his tirade in front of the entire front end. So I go to ring his items up just so he'll leave and he then starts yelling because ""he's not paying for it twice""

I am literally just standing in utter awe of this man as I soak in the smell of cheap beer and cigarettes.  I call my manager over and explain to her what's going on.
She attempts to please the man, but to no avail because he doesn't want us to do a refund, he doesn't want to pay for it, he doesn't want the new product, he just wants us to ""fix our effing machine"" 
He continued yelling incoherent things until she finally just got him to agree to a refund.

Im still amazed that she got him to leave the store without threatening to come back with his shotgun.... again.

meowlife,8,11,1pl3x5,28,"Hey TFR, here's my story:

I work for a small, local, privately owned boutique. I worked in corporate retail for 5 years prior to landing this job and so far it's been a cake walk with the exception of one thing: My boss is a fucking nut case. 
She seemed normal enough when I started; Your typical ""the customer takes priority"" boss who stands over you while you clumsily ring up sales. But now that I've been here for well over 3 months it has come to my attention that this lady has some serious issues. 

* She comes in on her days off and plants/ hides empty hangers in the racks, then ""finds"" them and complains that we aren't straightening the store often enough. 

* In response to me telling her I wanted time off to go visit my grandfather and convince him to see a doctor because he had been showing signs of a stroke: ""well if that's the case, don't you think he deserves to have a stroke?""

* I'm still not allowed to close the store because she ""still hasn't shown me how"" even though I have my store keys and my alarm code and she's actually shown me 10 different times as well as my other coworkers (who don't understand why she still won't let me). I can close out the register in my sleep. 

* Because it's a boutique, there is only a small handful of girls working there. One week, several girls needed to go out of town *and* my boss was leaving to attend a fashion show and order more products. This resulted in me  having to work 8 days straight (which wasn't a big deal to me. I need the money and it is a pretty chill job when she isn't around). Then I got a cold. There was no way I could stay home because of how short-handed we were and one of my other coworkers was getting sick as well but we all managed to figure it out. Then Boss Lady came back from her trip, pissed because I came to work sick. She accused me of being ""in denial"" of my illness and of getting my coworker sick. When I told her that she was already sick because her kids had been sick the week before, she rolled her eyes and said ""well that's the downside on deciding to have kids."" 

* She wants us to play our own music on days that she isn't in the store, but only music that has been deemed ""appropriate"" for the demographic of women (about mid thirties to ancient) that shop in our store. All the other stores I worked in before this were around the same demogaphic, so I usually put on artists that I remember were on the CDs sent to us from Corporate at my old jobs.   Today I came in and my coworker told me we had to make a list of ""appropriate music"" to be played in the store because she thinks we are playing ""rap and 80s stuff"" when she's not around because she stopped in once when we had Janelle Monae on. 

* She does these weird impersonations of me. Example: One day I was late because the PG&amp;E guy parked in our employee parking so I had to find another spot down the street. I explained to her how he had not only taken my spot, but ignored me and walked away when I told him he was in our employee parking. ""Well who's going to take you seriously if you say it like..."" and then she hunched over and stuck her neck out and used this weird gravely voice to say ""you took my spot."" Apparently she sees me as a hunchback with a smoker voice. Her impression of me has become a common thing now when she comes in while I'm working. I've made it pretty clear to her that I don't like it but she does it anyway.

*Passive aggressively talks about me and my coworkers to customers... *as well as* me and my coworkers. Example: One of my coworkers put in her 2 weeks because she was moving to LA. For the next two weeks we all had to hear ""... unless another one of you decides to quit on me"" or ""... except now I'm losing someone so who knows what's gonna happen.""

That's all I can think of for now. Aside from dealing with her weird shit, the job itself is pretty laid back. My coworkers are all nice and the customers are usually easy to help. We've got our share of quirky customer stories, but nothing so far that tops my boss. ",Fun &amp; Games in Boutiqueland (aka my boss is crazy),39

It was another busy Saturday at the grocery store and this very old woman came next in line. I greeted her but got a scowl in in response.

Uh oh.

So I ignore the scowl, chalking it up to just grumpy old age. I scan half her items without a peep from her until out of nowhere she screamed

""DOUBLED PAPER BAGS! I SAID DOUBLE PAPER BAGS!""

Now this really could've warranted a response but I could tell that she had something wrong upstairs. So I instead said ""Oh I'm sorry I must've forgot""

So I continued, now doing double paper bags, all the while with her grumbling about my ""mistake"". Then her son, who looked about 55, came up to the line to which the woman told him angrily of my mistake to which he told her that it was fine and that she should take a seat.

I told him it was no problem and that this is my job, its just what I do.

I felt so bad for him and his mother. From the outside someone could have just said ""Wow that lady is such a bitch"" when in reality she probably has no idea what's going on and her son must take care of her.

The story: A girl comes in around three pm and buys a cappuccino.

Fifteen minutes ago (7:20 pm) she comes back. She says that the cappuccino she bought earlier was too sweet and asks if she could have something else. I told her that was fine as long as she got a soda, or another coffee. We can give fountain drinks away in moderation but I couldn't give her anything with a bar code for free. She says thanks and goes over to the soda fountain.

She comes up to the register a few minutes later and demands the price difference between her glass of water and the cappuccino.

I replied that if she wants any sort of money back she'll need to speak to a manager. So she takes down my name, and asks when the manager will be in. She then complains that I didn't give her a receipt with her original purchase. Of course I didn't, I'm pretty sure coffee is final sale. I told her not to worry, I'd leave a note for my manager.

LeadFootSpiderMonkey,14,34,1pkv6o,155,"So, I I just found this sub and I wanted to share with you the number one story from my serving days at a big chain eat-in style restaurant.

So, I was worked doubles for a while because we were short staffed, most of you know how that goes. Kinda slow unless it is a Friday, when people come on their lunch break.

We had been steady all day, and were just starting to slow down, when 2 State Troopers came in and sat down, they were regulars, and I'll get back to them in a minute.

Fast forward about 30 minutes.

I'm up front talking with the hostess about something when I notice a man dressed in all black, carrying a huge guitar case, walking through the parking lot talking to himself.

Now, I try not to jump to conclusions, but this guy was an immediate red flag, the way he was walking and talking to himself, answering questions no one asked, etc.

When he got to the door, the hostess went to greet him, and I started to walk to my section because I was next in the rotation.

That's when he walked right past both of us, tossed his guitar case on the nearest 6 top table, and seated himself, all the while just talking to himself.

Then things get weird(er)..

We calmly walk over and ask him if he could move to another table, as this section was closed, and that I would be happy to serve him if he would walk to one of the booths that were assigned to my section.

He looks up and his eyes met mine. If looks could kill.......

He glares at me, lowers his head to where just his eyes are looking up at me and gives a curt ""NO."" Then opens his guitar case and pulls out a book about cults and mind control (It didn't look mass printed, it looked like a self-published book that had been bought from someones writing endeavors, which made it a little spookier)

 ...Uh, Ok, now I want this guy to leave...

At this point he was freaking everyone out, including the customers seated around him. The hostess walks over and politely says, ""sir, you are scaring some of the customers with your behavior, could you please dial the rudeness back a little, please?""

He gives her the same scary head nod/scary glare look, and blurts out, ""I am worth more than GOLD, YOU FOOL. You are to WORSHIP ME""

Hostess: Sir, I am going to have to ask you to leave, as we have the right to refuse service to people who are disrupting the restaurant.""

Scary man: ""DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM, YOU STUPID WOMAN?!?! I AM JESUS CHRIST!! DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE TALKING TO?! YOU ARE TO WORSHIP ME YOU FOOL! I.AM.JESUS. I AM THE F***** GOLDEN F***** TICKET, BITCH""

So, I decide the freak show needs to end and walk around the corner to grab the State Troopers who were just out of earshot, in time to see another waitress already there, and they are putting their hats on and getting up to come escort him out.

When they get over there he just keeps yelling ""I AM JESUS, I AM THE F***** GOLDEN TICKET!, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE DOING!""

At this point it was pretty clear the guy was on something, so the officers asked if they could peek inside the case. Scary guy, for some reason, thrusts it at the officer and sits down Indian style on the outside walkway.

From where we were standing, we saw the other police cars pulling in and the drug dogs getting out, etc.

While we were waiting, one woman made the comment, ""Yooo, I know that ain't Jesus, I ain't never heard Jesus talk like THAT."" (not really relevant to this story per se, but it was funny and it made the rest of the customers and staff laugh.)

In the end we watched them pull out 4 bags filled with various white powders, and one filled with maybe 15-20 multicolored pills that looked like E. So the guy was definitely on a ton of stuff.

3 days later, the troopers came in and told me that he had almost every drug you could imagine in that case and that he was from out of state, and had hitchhiked all the way from Texas (I am in Tennessee)

So that is my most memorable story from my days as a waitress. Thanks for reading :)

metalsd,7,15,1pkt24,26,"So I've been around this subreddit for around a week now and it's like a drug I keep checking it every couple of hours, it's like looking in a mirror :). Anyway, it's my first story here about my soon to be (just one more week) past retail employment.

I think I wrote a little too much, but the TL;DR summarize everything in two simple lines

I work in a print shop which is inside an office supply store, and a couple of months ago I met this lady which we'll call Earthquake Lady (EA) and I had the most strange interaction with her.

Me: Hello how are you today?

EA: I'm very worried I have been sensing the vibrations of earth and I think one is coming

Me: Hmm ok, what can I do for you?

EA: Oh, I need a banner and some business cards

Me: Alright, (and start going trough the computer process setting up her stuff.


In the meantime she starts talking about how she can predict earthquakes and how she can get in contact with the supernatural, and how she helped the government to make better decisions (Mind you, the government and psychics now work together against earthquakes, not scientists but psychics). Anyway, I don't mind much of what she's saying and just go with aha, yeah alright to whatever she's commenting, when another customer pops up. I tell her to keep writing her business card while I go and ask the other person what she needs.
The new customer (NC) is about to tell me what her needs are when EA interrupts and ask NC how she can use her phone that she just bought and she doesn't know how to use. 

I got a little shocked but NC was very nice and try to explain her how to use but EA wasn't understanding. NC tries to tell me what i can do for her but everytime she opens her mouth directing to me EA interrupts and ask more questions to NC. 

Finally, I can get NC to tell me what she needs. I make her two copies and send her on her way, not before another customer approaches to ask how to use the fax machine and EA screams to her 
I SEE YOUR SOUL IS IN TOTAL PAIN, AND I KNOW ALL YOUR SECRETS BUT I WON' T TELL ANYBODY. 

I could just chuckle of hearing that and the fax customer was astonished. NC wished me good luck and ran away from the store while the fax lady, and EA were exchanging a conversation that went somewhat like this

Fax Lady: What?

EA: YOUR SOUL IS SUFFERING I CAN HEAL IT, LET ME HEAL IT

Fax Lady: What are you talking about?

EA: YOUR SECRET IS SAFE WITH ME I KNOW EVERYTHING AND I WILL KEEP IT FOREVER JUST LET ME GET CLOSE TO YOU AND I WILL HELP YOU

Fax Lady: What no

and then the fax lady sprinted away from my copy center not sending her fax and just looking very uncomfortable.

I come back to EA and try to finish her up so she has me typing all her services (contacting the undead, predicting earthquakes, saving souls among others) and she starts telling me how the government experimented with her when she was a child and how she lost her ear in an experiment gone wrong (she had both ears). So, I told her well I see you have two ears so you probably had an excellent plastic surgeon, and then she told me back that her family was killed by the government and not to make fun of her disability. 

I apologized and moved on. She had a lot of misspellings on her banner so I told her about it and she said it was fine so she paid and sent her on her way.

The next day she comes back (I wasn't there my coworker told me about this part) for her banner when I wasn't there, and she demands a refund because all of the misspellings in her business cards and banners. My coworker, tell her that she can fix them and reprint it for her and he surely do.

He told me that the lady told her that an Earthquake was coming soon and that we should be prepared because it will be the last one around before we all get the skill of communicating with the things we cannot see. My coworker shrug it off and sent her on her way with all her advertisement. It's been like three months from that occasion and we never saw her again (thankfully) and the earthquake hasn't happened either so we are missing on this new skill set :)...

I'm not your slave. I was going to ask you if you wanted me to throw your shit out anyways. There was no need to demand that I do it. It's not even my job to throw your garbage out, you almost have to trip over the garbage cans before you leave the restaurant...

BenSisko,27,31,1pki0s,129,"Hello again! After the overwhelming response my first post about Tony created (if you missed it, [here's a link](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1p9wov/she_wanted_it_hotter_i_made_it_hotter/) ) I thought I'd share with you another tale about my terrible co-worker. 

It was a pretty rough day in our coffee shop. Lots of angry customers with wonderfully awkward orders. I did my best (with help from Linda) to keep Tony as far away from the bar as possible, forcing him to wash the dirty cups and such in the kitchen area, rather than let him be in a position where he would have to talk to customers. 

While I was dealing with a particularly irritating customer (who simply ordered ""coffee"" and then couldn't fathom why he hadn't recieved a decaffinated half strength soya cappuccino) Tony comes storming out from the kitchen area with some glasses balanced precariously on a tray. He proceeds to elbow his way through the customers, grunting ""Move, will ya?"" whenever he couldn't get through, and shoving the tray into people's backs when they didn't move fast enough.

He slammed it down near the coffee machine, swearing under his breath about the ""fucktard customers"" getting in his way.

He then walked up to one of our customers near the bar and said ""Man, it is so fucking HOT in here! I'm sweating like crazy!"" in a voice that was far too loud, in front of customers and their children. He then proceeded to *wipe his sweaty forehead on this random customer's shirt sleeve.*

I had no idea what to do. The man looked disgusted (who wouldn't?) and Tony just sauntered off. I apologised (once again) for Tony's actions, got Linda on the machine to finish up the orders and called the manager. 

Once things had died down and we had fewer customers to deal with, the manager called Tony out on his actions in the office area. I don't know what was said, but I do know that, sdaly, justice still hasn't been served and he is **still** working with us now.

There is a bit of a silver lining to this depressing story- I managed to get hold of someone above our regional management. I told them about all the things Tony had done (and believe me, there are a LOT) and in response, they've set up a ""monitoring system"". Every time he does something, we write it down. At the end of the month, upper management will confront him with the evidence and, hopefully, fire his incompetent ass. I live in hope!

**TL:DR- Don't wipe your sweat on customers.** ",Another Tale About Tony...,160

A couple of weeks ago I need almost an entire week off of work to go back to my home state so that I could get a new car. (I was in a car wreck, totaled.) My manager loves it when college students ask for days off because it means he can give more hours to the employees that live there full time and have kids to support. He gave me that entire week off and said that if I ever need to take time off it wouldn't be a problem. He was also really comforting to me after the car wreck. When I told him about my back pain and not being able to walk around too much, he immediately stuck me on drive-thru, no questions asked.

crystall,107,87,1pk83x,448,"I was reminded of this story of my time working at a certain international, coffee shop chain, by another post. This was actually my comment to their post, but I have been lurking here so long now, commenting occasionally, that I thought I would share this with you all. 

Working the same shift in a downtown area of a city, you see the same people at the same time every day. You get to know what your regulars order, this makes sense, yes. If we were slow and I saw a regular headed toward our doors, I would start on their beverage so that by the time they paid, it would be ready and waiting for them.

 Most people appreciated this; they had a limited amount of time on their breaks from their own jobs and this way they didn't have to stand around waiting/wasting their break time. Most people. 

This one guy, came in at 2pm EVERY DAY and ordered the same non-fat, vanilla latte, EVERY DAY. I see him coming down the block, there are no customers, I have been cleaning up after the lunch rush, I stop what I am doing and start making his drink, so that just as my co-worker handed him his change, I came over and set the drink down on the counter in front of him, saying ""here's your non-fat, vanilla latte, sir."" He looked at it like I had just scooted a turd across the counter at him, gave me a death look and said, ""what is this?"" I repeated what I said, maintaining eye contact. ""When did you make this?"" he asked, incredulously. ""Just now,"" I stated, ""I saw you coming down the block and started on it for you."" I smiled, he was still giving me the death look. He picks up the cup, sniffs it, glares at me and walks out. 

Later on that day, my manager comes downstairs and tells me that Mr. non-fat, vanilla latte had complained that I had his drink ready for him as soon as he finished paying, he also contacted our corporate office to complain about my efficiency as well. Nothing ever came of it. But every afternoon after that at 2pm, I would wait patiently until he ordered, until he paid, then I would painstakingly make his drink, taking as much time as possible and hand it off to him with a smile.

I asked what she was talking about and she explained that when she came through yesterday morning the front drive thru manager told her there was a ""Pay It Forward"" line going, and her meal was paid for. She didn't appreciate somebody paying for her food because she has a ""very expensive SUV"" (she drives and early 00's chevy??) and she can clearly afford a meal at mcdonald's.

I was scheduled from 11:45-4, which where I work means I'll be off sometime before 4:45, usually about 4:15ish. Well, that time comes and goes, and I'm stuck on ""the line"" with a HUGE line people forming. Me and one other girl. Needless to say, we weren't getting anywhere. I kept trying to call for my manager who knew I was supposed to be off at 4 but he just would not come. I told another manager ""hey, I can't stay really late tonight... I really have to go before 4:45"". Staying over 5 hours means we have to take a 30 minute break. It's paid, but I needed to go get a parking pass because I just got a ticket this morning for parking in front of my on goddamn house. The office where I pick it up closes at 5.

jumpityjump,15,36,1pjjk7,117,"Background: I work on the cellar door at a very busy winery in a popular wine region. Basically, my job involves talking people through our wines, pouring wines, selling as much wine as possible, and ensuring customers have the best possible experience. We get all sorts of interesting customers and no shift is without its story...

We do get some strange requests from time to time and usually try to accommodate them, but this particular story was just so full of ridiculousness I thought it must be a joke. Wednesdays tend to be our crazy person/request day and this was no exception. It was around 11am, when the two customers at the bar suddenly looked terrified. We turned to see a wave of 60 Indonesian tourists walking down the long driveway to our cellar door. Usually, groups of 10 or more have to book in ahead of time and pay a fee per head for tasting (all other walk-ins taste for free). This group had no booking but all wanted to taste wine. 

After a quick panicked phone call to our manager, we decided not to charge them because they only wanted to try two wines each and promised to buy ""lots of cases"". After 45 minutes of stuffing around and backing and forthing, they finally decided they were ready to purchase. First request: they wanted cases of ten bottles – our cases are made up of 12 bottles and we do a discount for cases. But they only wanted 10 bottles in each case. Another 15 minutes of working out exactly how many bottles they wanted and we managed to make up 3 normal mixed cases for them. Then they made a list of which wines they wanted in those cases... written in Indonesian. They passed us this list and couldn't understand why we couldn't read it and make up their cases from it.  We finally got someone to rewrite their requests in English and were ready for payment. They offered us $US – we are not in the USA and they got very upset when we insisted they would have to pay in the correct currency or with a card because we cannot accept $US.

 Payment finally received, I put the cases on the bar. The main man we had been dealing with just looked at me and said ""you will carry them to bus for us"". I'm sorry, but I'm a small girl and you are a group of 60, at least half of which were strong enough men. I'm sure you can manage between you to carry three cases of wine to your bus (parked across the road at another winery, at least a 300-400m walk away). I explained that I could not leave the bar, so he said ""ok, then we will take your trolley to carry them"". I insisted that that was also not an option, as we couldn't let it leave the premises. Finally, we came to the agreement that I would wheel their cases to the end of our 100m driveway, where their bus would meet me and they would load them on. When I was half way down the driveway, dragging a trolley of cases and tailed by the wave of happy tasters the winery owner rocked up. Rather than stopping, he wound down the window, took a picture on his phone and sent it to the rest of our staff, saying ""this is what I call customer service!"". I'm still not sure if those three cases were worth all of the hassle, but it puts other difficult customers in perspective now!

I work at an entertainment company in the DC area, and on the weekends, I run the photobooth. This happened last Saturday night:

The parents rented out a really popular club in DC on Saturday night for their son's Bar Mitzvah reception. The entire VIP floor was just for the kids - unsupervised and unlimited soda. The parents had the 2 lower levels to themselves to get wasted.
The kids TRASHED THE CLUB. Every single soda they got, they spilled. The floor was a muddy, sticky mess. They grabbed the cushions from the VIP couches, and threw them all over the floor, basically ruining the furniture (really nice leather couches). They broke a glass panel, jumped up on the window sills and started banging on the glass (this was on the third story, so if they broke the window and fell out, they would've died). They climbed behind the couches and destroyed the paint jobs on the walls. Ruined like 3 speakers, which I later learned were each valued at around $1500. There was sushi smushed into the floor everywhere, and you couldn't walk without getting a kid or two shoved at you.

I was working the photobooth, and even though I've had some bad parties before, I have never had to shut down the booth due to hell being raised. The booth has about $10,000 worth of equipment, in it and these kids were punching, kicking, shaking it as if it were a toy. If it had fallen on one of them, it would've been my fault, so when the mom started yelling at me for shutting off the booth, I yelled right back for letting these little demons get away with it all. 

From what I heard, the owner of the club is suing the parents for the damages.
I think the club cost about $20,000 - $30,000 to rent out for the night. They paid my job around $10,000 for the entertainment (DJ, MC, photobooth, dancers), then more for the catering (had a well known froyo place cater dessert, and a sushi bar came in with food). They also rented some extra furniture, which was ruined and they have to pay to replace.

Most of the people who buy fireworks from me use credit cards. I’m actually pretty happy about that. Even though I have to pay fees on each transaction, it reduces the possibility of theft, and I don’t have to deal with as much cash.

Believe it or not, most banks now charge you a fee if you deposit more than $5000 in cash to your account during a single billing period. Yep, it’s bullshit, but if all banks are doing it, what’s your alternative?

That being said, we still receive a fair amount of cash during the course of our sales season, and I do everything I can to reduce my risk. My cashiers all use money pens to check the large bills, we try not to keep a lot of cash in the register drawers, and our friendly local police escort me to do cash drops at the bank when needed. Overall, we’ve had very few problems.


**STORY:**  One of my cashiers called me over because the $100 bill she was holding didn’t look right. The paper seemed right and it passed the pen test, but the printing on the bill did seem a little off. The lady who had paid with the $100 bill was getting impatient, and in the end, I just assumed the bill was old and worn (we do see that a LOT). 

Apparently, the night deposit I made on the 4th of July had several of the bills, 8 to be exact. Guess who showed up at my tent on July 6th to discuss it!

The Agents were actually very nice. They couldn’t give me many details, but apparently the woman who had passed the bill was no stranger to them. I’m not sure if she had made multiple purchases at my store, each with a phony bill, or if she had accomplices. I gave them my statement, but I honestly didn’t have much to tell them.

The Agents did say that the bills were actually very high quality, and that we were lucky to have noticed anything wrong. I didn’t feel very lucky. In the end, I was scammed out of $800.

**To the lady who scammed me:**

I have a container of explosives and a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If I see you in my shop again….

AWard4Love,10,19,1pj9de,79,"So the company I work for has both retail and outlet locations. Which is fine, many companies do. However, we are not allowed to take returns from an outlet store in the retail location, and vice verse. I work at a different brand, and helping out at another one. At my brand, the tags are different at outlet and retail, which causes problems if somebody tries to purchase an outlet product in the retail store.

Enter older lady. She was VERY nice, waited until I finished up on the phone before asking her question, and I was perfectly able to help her find exactly what she was looking for. 

The whole reason she was at the store was to return two coats and pick up two new ones in the correct sizes. She pulls out her receipt, I scan the bar-code, and a new prompt pops up on screen ""Cannot accept returns from out of state or other brand."" Living in Maryland, I was confused as to why a store in Delaware  would be considered out of country, joking with this woman about it, making light of the situation.

Unfortunately, she really wanted to do this here, so I had to call the customer service hotline for the stores, to see if there is a magical way to process things. I finally get my representative on the line, saying ""I have a very patient customer who is wanting to return an item and this is what is happening..."" The woman is getting a bit annoyed with the delay, while I am trying to figure it out. 

And then I realized I am the idiot. 

The receipt was from the same brand, in the same country... but it was from an outlet store. I asked the CSR if outlet stores for this brand carry the same product as the retail, because that is what confused me (for the brand I usually work at, it is product from last year, not current product). The CSR said it could happen, but she wouldn't be able to let me know for sure. 

I hang up and turn to the woman to start to explain what is going on. I mentioned she went to an outlet location to purchase, and unfortunately, this was a retail location. She went from kind and patient into The Hulk. She kept saying we were an outlet location, which I had to keep reminding her we were not. 

""I demand your customer service number, this is unacceptable!"" I wrote it out for her and sent her on her way, while apologizing that there really was nothing more I could do in our location, while providing her with the closest outlet stores possible.

philosanity,40,37,1pj3nd,153,"I work in a canteen-style restaurant that requests customers clear away their own trays etc to trolley areas. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. We wouldn't mind if at least everything was left neatly, but some people seem to think that it's appropriate to eat like a pig, smearing ketchup all over the table, covering the floor with wrappers and large amounts of food, and not reporting spills. I'm concerned about the state of these people's houses if they eat like that at home!

Then, occasionally, you get wonderful people like the family that came in yesterday. They had young children with them, and so had generated quite a mess on and under the table. Then something amazing happened. The dad went to the trolley bay, found one of our long-handled dustpan and brush, and proceeded to clear up. My co-workers and I couldn't stop staring and then talking about it for a while afterwards. It may not seem like much, but it reminded us that there are customers out there who do respect public spaces and feel accountable for the messes they make. Yes, we do have staff to clean and tidy, but common decency should mean we don't have to scrape half your meal of the table and floor.

So a kids walks up to me, he's about 6. He said, ""Can I get this Pokemon game with the red guy on it, using my mommy's credit card?""

""Awe, cute!"" I thought to myself. Then ever so slowly the wheels turned in my thick retail skull, ""where are your parents,  sweety?!""

I don't think to ask where his parents are, because quite frankly, I'm not his parent. The transaction wasn't complete because he didn't know the pin to his mom's credit card.

vaime,63,40,1picxh,126,"I work as a promotional model in a duty free store at an international airport. It's our job to give out samples, educate customers on our product and generally help the retail staff with sales. 

Being an international airport in a main city, we occasionally get some celebrities coming through. The staff at our store are allowed to ask for photos and/or autographs as long as they are polite and professional whilst doing so. As all the staff I work with are amazing, there's never been an issue with this so it's common practice.

We're a small country, and most of the celebrities that come through are local TV celebs or sports hero's - people who are more than happy to stop for a photo and an autograph. Occasionally big shot, international celebrities come through; most don't bother stopping at duty free and are ushered on past by their security, but the occasional few who stop to browse are usually happy to indulge a few staff in a photo.

Myself and another employee were watching one afternoon as a couple of staff got photos with a local sports star. I mentioned how fun it was seeing these kind of people come through and it sparked a conversation on some of the international celebrities who have been through. Most had stories of how nice so-and-so was etc. 

Our floor manager had a very different story. She was working with staff from a different shift one evening when a very VERY famous young male popstar entered the store. The store was quiet, as he was very early for his flight and there weren't many other flights at that time. Due to his fame a few of the younger staff were (understandably) quite excited. He was looking around at the products and one of the younger staff asked if she could help. When he informed her that he was just browsing, she shyly asked if she would be able to have a photo with him.

He immediately picked a bottle of vodka up off the shelf and held it up ""Do I get this for free if I take a picture with you?""

The poor girl was speechless, and he kept asking things like ""I should at least be given a discount, you know - seeing as I'm helping you out here"" ""It's only fair that you give me 50% off in exchange for a photo."" ""I'm doing you a service - you should do me one too.""

The poor girl tried to explain that she wasn't able to give out discounts, and even if she could due to alcohol laws she wasn't able to give out discounts on the alcohol (even vouchers and coupons can't be used on liquor in our store). The girl was near tears, stuttering and trying to explain but the celeb just kept getting more and more heated, raising his voice to a borderline yell, telling her that she was stupid and asking her why someone like him should even consider doing anything for a shopgirl when she refused to even give him a small discount. 

The floor manager overheard this and immediately took over the situation, sending the employee to the back room to recover and explaining politely but firmly that the employee had no authority to give discounts on any product. She apologised that he clearly didn't want to take a photo and politely let him know that he was well within his rights to decline - she bit her tounge and avoided telling him that he could have just said ""No."" despite badly wanting to. He basically turned around to the manager, puffed out his chest and told her she was damn right she was sorry, informed her he was too important to be bothered by staff and should get a discount anyway because *didn't she know who he was*?

The manager (a badass, middleaged eastern european woman who had probably never listened to pop in her life) looked him in the eye and let him know that, no, she had no idea who he was and she was sorry but they didn't give discounts on alcohol no matter WHO was asking for it, but if there was something in particular that he was looking for she was more than happy to help him personally.

This clearly tipped the celeb over the edge, who snorted, swore at the manager and stormed off. Throughout all of this his handlers were standing a few feet away - looking sheepish but not doing anything. The manager said she felt most sorry for these guys, who from the look on their faces saw this kind of behaviour all the time but didn't dare say a word. Apparently the popstar sent one of them back to the store around half an hour later to pick up a list of stuff he wanted - the poor guy couldn't even look the manager in the face while she was ringing up the items (particularly because the young employee had only just come out of the back room and was being consoled by some of the other staff)

The whole experience really pissed off our manager (she'd never heard of this guy before, and to hear her hate on him was kind of hilarious) mainly because she couldn't believe a multi-millionare would be so cheap and tacky enough to demand discounts - and worse still to bully a young employee to the point of tears. This guy had been that employees hero, and meeting him was practically a dream come true, so she was incredibly torn up about the whole situation. Our manager, whilst being a terrifying woman, is also staunchly loyal to the ""family"" who work there and hated seeing one of her ""girls"" so cut up by that douche.

I really hope next time he comes here for a concert our badass floor manager is working - he certainly won't be getting any special treatment from her!!",Turns out big-shot celebrities are just as bad (if not worse) than average-joe customers.,166
Westykins,14,7,1pibub,12,"You guys are some of the best groups of people i've ever ""known"", so i'm hoping for some guidance.

I'm 20 years old, going to college, and I work at a grocery store as a cashier.  A couple of days ago, this tall mild mannered man asked nice questions like ""are you going to school?""  etc. When i told him what school i went to, he said ""ah, that's my alma mater""  or something. Curious, i decided to ask him what he did for a living now. He said he was a financing manager or something, and then asked for my phone number because ""an office was opening up in the area"".  I gave it to him, because hey, could be an opportunity.  

I forgot about it, but then he calls today and leaves a voicemail.  He says something like ""Hey, this is - from ""trans?""America.  I met you at (name of store) and i was calling to have a conversation with you. Give me a call back when you have the chance, and have a nice evening. ""

I was wondering if any of you have ever heard of something like this before.  I know all too well about job scam things, but if this is an actual opportunity for something that'd be amazing. I don't want to throw that away just off of suspicion.  

Thanks for any advice guys, i hope i can get some help here :(

AFruitNamedDave,38,14,1pi9yg,66,"So I was happily working away on the till point, dreaming of a job where I make more than minimum wage, when this guy comes up. We chat, he's friendly and I scan his items which comes to £17. He gives me two £10 notes and £2 so that when I gave him his change I could just give him a £5 note back. Fair enough, this happens quite a bit with customers and notes are easier to carry. 

I open the till drawer and immediately see that at the moment this specific till doesn't have any £5 notes in. I give him back his £2 (because I only need the £20) whilst apologising and putting the two tens into the drawer. I grab £3 in pound coins and give them to him, put his receipt in his bag and give a cheery ""See you later!""

He just stands there. Stands there and stares at his hand. My happy-to-have-served-smile falters and I instantly think ""ah shit, I've given him the wrong change"" but after replaying the last minute in my head I'm certain I gave him the correct amount. Then this conversation ensues with this customer's name now changing to Confused.com. 

Confused.com: ""You owe me £2."" 

Me: ""Oh! No, I gave you that £2 back remember?""

Confused.com: ""But I gave you £22.""

Me: ""I know but I didn't have a £5 note so I gave you the £2 back and gave you the change from the 20.""

Confused.com: ""But I gave you £22 so you owe me, in total, £5 change.""

Me: ""You gave me £22 but I didn't have the 5 so I gave you £2 back. Your total was £17 so I gave you 3 back.""

Confused.com: ""You still owe me £5.""

Me: ""I don't though. Your total transaction was £17, you gave me £20 in two £10 notes. Then an extra two so I could give you a £5 note but I didn't have one so I gave you that two back which is there, in your hand."" *I point at the shiny golden money that is still in his hand*

Confused.com: ""But you still owe me £5.""

Me: (Oh Christ, I'm going to be here forever.) ""I'm sorry but I don't. Your total was £17 so-""

Confused.com:""Look forget that (the transaction total) for a moment. I gave you £22 so you owed me £5 change.""

Me: ""We can't just forget that, that was the total which you had to pay. You had to pay £17, you gave me £20 then an extra £2 so that for your change I could give you £5. I'm going to get someone else to clarify this with me.""

I only attempted to do that so maybe he'd finally understand, thankfully however he got a bit flustered and said ""Well, if I'm wrong I'm wrong!"" and walked out so I didn't have to explain the whole process all over again. I think it's burned into my brain for eternity. 

At no point did he raise his voice, act rude or ask to speak to a manager. He didn't even seem very confused, just adamant that he was right and then at the end to just suddenly accept it and walk out. I can understand if he'd gotten a little confused over it but surely me explaining no more than twice should have cleared it up for him.

Ayverie,78,26,1pi69x,66,"Mini background: I've been working at a major grocery-store chain in Canada for the past 8 years. I've done various departments, from the clothing dept. to cash and to stocking fresh produce. 

Onto ""Jesus Lady.""
Firstly, I apologize for the upcoming wall of text. ""Jesus Lady"" requires some description and detail in order to get the image of this woman across. 

So, every month, either at the beginning or end depending on when her welfare/disability/pension/unemployment cheques come in, this woman would come grocery shopping, sometimes alone, sometimes with her husband (the poor man). Now, we get a lot of people at around these times due to the aforementioned cheques. Normally, she wouldn't really stand out, but she didn't get the name ""Jesus Lady"" for nothing. 
""Jesus Lady"" was this slightly frail, unkempt older woman who occasionally walked with a cane. She would often berate cashiers and stay at the cash well after her order was purchased, bagged, and put into the car by her husband/children. The reason she stayed behind was to try to convert the cashiers to Christianity. Normally, if it were a brief chat, we would be able to push it aside, but she would remain behind for at least an HOUR, blocking up aisles for cashes and distracting cashiers from their work. If they didn't respond well, she would often become angry and aggressive in her tactics, so, more often than not, the cash manager would kick her out after so much time. 

So, long story short, we called her ""Jesus Lady"" because we didn't know her name and she spent an insane amount of time trying to convert us. 

Onto my experience with ""Jesus Lady.""

At this time, I was working in the bakery section. It was Halloween, so a lot of staff were dressed up. One coworker (I'll call him Duro) was dressed up as a manager, and I was wearing a Little Red Riding Hood costume (these are a bit important). 

In the middle of our night, all of a sudden, I, and a few others, notice that Duro had suddenly been ""captured"" by ""Jesus Lady."" She was in the middle of her usual spiel, trying to convert him, telling him to praise the lord and all that jazz (sorry if that offended anyone). So, the others and I devised a plan to get Duro free from her clutches. We called a manager to the back of the store and I hurried over, pretending that we needed him for an emergency. 

Worked like a charm.

Until ""Jesus Lady"" commented on my costume. Said it was cute, I thanked her, I go to move away, but she kept talking about random little things. Now, I was raised not to leave mid-conversation and I've always been a bit too nice. At this point, it didn't work out well for me.

Eventually, she began angrily talking about a Muslim cab driver she had had the ""horror"" of meeting. She said that while he drove, he ""attempted"" to convert her to Islam and he kept referring to the Q'ran. Honestly, at this point, I don't care. Until she asked me what my name meant. 

Me: ""Well, it's a Hebrew name but I'm not Jewish.""

JL: ""So, you're Christian?""

Me: ""Uh....no."" 
I'm actually far from Christian. It's just really not for me. I won't get angry if someone else is Christian, it's their choice, and if I can respect their choices, I expect them to respect mine. 

""Jesus Lady,"" however, decided that this wasn't right. She began to perform her spiel, attempting to convert me. She ended her sentence with ""You ARE Christian.""

Me: ""No, I'm not.""

JL: ""Yes, you are. You are Christian at heart.""

Me: ""Ma'am, I'm really not Christian, at all."" 
At this point, I was getting frustrated. She kept trying to push me to convert to her beliefs and it was particularly annoying since she had been complaining about her Muslim cab driver. Hypocritical much?

Eventually, I manage to pry myself away from her and hide for a period of time in the back of the store. Duro was back there, laughing his ass off at me, and I hit him (jokingly). 
We hid there for about an hour, doing work, and when we looked through the plastic windows on the doors separating the backstore from the front of store, we noticed that ""Jesus Lady"" was patiently standing there, by the door with her cart. 

Apparently she'd been standing there the entire time, waiting for us to come out. It was like some strange horror scene when the ""bad guy"" is an overly excited Christian missionary. We hid there for even longer and eventually she seemed to get tired and just left. This was the first time she had actually waited for someone to reappear for her. 

From that point onward, Duro and I were very cautious at the beginning/end of the month and always had coworkers looking for ""Jesus Lady"" for us. 

I would have gone into more detail of what ""Jesus Lady"" said, but it was a few years ago and I didn't really listen to most of what she said after the first minute. The ""You are Christian"" bit really stuck with me though, because she was just making these assumptions without any fact. 

Fortunately, we haven't seen ""Jesus Lady"" anytime soon. I'm not sure why, maybe she switched supermarkets, maybe they moved, or maybe I'm just never there when she's there. But not seeing her has created this collective sigh of relief amongst all of the long-time employees. 

Now, I just want to point out that I'm not against Christianity and I did not come up with the name for her. I'm very respectful of others' beliefs and I expect others to respect my own. I'm very tolerant, until someone tries to convert me or my friends without regard towards our personal beliefs. And ""Jesus Lady"" really liked to push our buttons. 

Anyway, that's just one fantastic tale about ""Jesus Lady"". Let me know if you ever want me to collect some more and share them. ","A Fantastic Tale about ""Jesus Lady""",92

#1: A normal day of helping this guy load things up onto the register turned quite aggressive out of nowhere. 

I bring this guy's things onto the counter, when I notice a small box that I thought was part of his order. I realized it wasn't:

Me: ""Oh, sorry. I thought this was a part of your stuff.""

Guy: ""No. Those are the ASHES OUR DEAD CAT.""

Yikes. It caught me off guard about how aggressive he turned in an instant. 

#2: I get called over to the fish food aisle where I see this guy looking at different brands, he doesn't even look at me when he says: ""Hey how ya doin', there's a spill over on aisle 20, I'm gonna need you to go over there and clean that up."" As soon as he said that his girlfriend and girlfriend's daughter start pissing themselves laughing, while I'm sarcastically thinking ""OH MY GOD, THAT'S SO FUNNY."" And I walk away.

#3: Eventually I transferred over to pet care which involves me getting people's fish, birds, lizards that they want to buy. I would sometimes get people bags of crickets for their lizards. On more than one occasion, little kids would walk up to me as I would scoop up the crickets and ask what I was doing, I would explain and they would ask 'why?', OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. No matter how much I explained myself. I really thought that this only happened in sitcoms. 

So many horror stories that I heard from word of mouth too. Such as:

-My manager telling me how PETA broke into the store and killed some of our bird and lizard selection instead of just setting them free. 

-A random guy telling me about how he used to work here and how he received his first blow job in the back room.

-My coworker telling me how he used to jack off in the restroom during his break.

-Another coworker telling me how he had to pick up dog diarrhea.

Every one of us had to pick up someone's dog's shit in the middle of the store at some point. Because not everyone who brings their pet in is a responsible person.

* **The rusher** - A young man who always wears the same black trenchcoat and the same army boots. Every day he walks really fast into the store, rushes one full circle around the store, as if he is intensely looking for something, never buys anything, never speaks and then leaves in a rush. Our store has a few franchises in the city, and apparently he is a regular in most of them.
* **The Porno-Nazi** - A sweaty middle aged man who comes in every week to look for books on warfare, war engines, nazis and murders. He regularily rants about his mother being a bitch who he wants to kill, and about how Germans are an inferior race and that they should all be slaughtered. He dreams of paving all of Germany with tarmac. He also asks for Playboy regularily. One time we didn't have the latest Playboy and he just broke down, as if the world was going to end if he didn't get his porn. Tears and sobbing and whatnot...
* **The hoarder** - An old lady who lives in the forest where she keeps all the garbage that she hordes. Comes in every weekend to look at arts and craft books.

christein,25,27,1pi0ud,99,"I worked for many years at a bookstore that is no longer around. I have many fond and not so fond stories of this place, but figured this story would be a great way to engage all of you in TFR.

I just clocked in and was helping with some of the re-shelves we had behind the information desk. I like to organize them in small piles of sections so that I don't have to double back to the same sections over and over. As I'm organizing, I noticed that my sex section pile was unusually large. I figured there must have been some high school kids around thinking it was fun to go through the section, and I continued to organize. A person drops a few more books on the desk (which at this point I was actually pleased because most people don't pick up after themselves) and goes back to where he was before. I notice again, it's mostly sex books which is really odd. About 10 minutes later after assisting customers with some orders, a customer comes up to me...

Customer: Excuse me
Me: Hi! How can I help you? 
Customer: I don't know how to tell you this, but you might want check up on someone
Me: Is everything ok? Do they need help? 
Customer: Well, I think...umm...*whispers* he's touching himself.
Me: Oh

At this point the poor customer was super uncomfortable and blushing profusely, so I casually walk past the sex section to see one of the chairs that was in the kids section there facing the wall with the same person who brought up the sex books to the desk. All I see is his arm moving and hear heavy breathing. I immediately call for a manager and let him know what's going on. The manager comes and shouts for the guy to leave. He stands up, junk at attention and all and starts to leave the store, trying to shake everyone's hand on the way out. Security was called but at that point I was called to registers so I'm not sure what happened after that, except that the police were called as well and a report was filed. 

We had to damage out all the sex books that were removed from the shelves during the time he was there.

As you all (hopefully) know, the hedgehog car-hops make less than minimum wage, like most restaurant slaves. So we need to make up the rest of our wages in tips. I probably got around fifteen 50 cent tips today on varying sized orders. I got one on a $1.11 order, that's acceptable because who would tip more than half the order?

So I never get misty over Christmas songs. They just remind me of hearing them blaring out of an overhead speaker on an endless loop. Thanksgiving is more about a family of cashiers enjoying a fruit roll up on a smoke break between waves of insanity. 

But I always found birthdays to be a way to celebrate something a little unique about your existence, and happily mine falls on the twenty ninth of October. Today. Close enough to a legitimate holiday to enjoy the trappings, but not close enough to the majors to force me to work it. 

So I am forty two today. That seems impossibly old. I could ramp on about the Good Old Days, and be aged and cynical enough to mean it. But what I truly enjoy is looking back on a lifetime of improbable events and being able to express them to others. Sharing a chuckle or two. Or some feels. It does my heart good to share a story. 

And in TFR I have found a place for my lunacy filled with understanding and wisdom and genuine emotion. 

I've had people reach out and give me hope. Give me tangible support. Help keep me alive.

It's been an odd year. There has been much to moan about. But I take this opportunity to look back and see the good that has come into my life. And so much of that has come from the fine readers of /u/talesfromretail . 

So thank you, clerks and cooks. Thank you, baristas and bartenders. Thank you tired techs and overseers of the confused shopping agenda. Thanks to delivery drivers, and loss prevention officers, door knockers and bell ringers, Ultimate Zen holdouts in the palace of Mammon, the gatekeepers of greed and gluttony. Keyholders and attendants of retail hell. 

Thank you so much for the gift of community. Thanks for reading my stories. Thanks for reaching out. I love it. I promise this is a gift I will never try to return without a receipt. ",[META] TFR- My Favorite Gift,56
GotNoms,113,105,1phsnx,279,"Hey, me again, author of two popular posts here recently titled ""The day I became ""animal control"" and ""Security"", I enjoy seeing yall's reactions to stuff I have gone through with my old job (Quit after a story that I will get to eventually, new job only has a few stories to tell) so I decided to make a new post every few days of everything so far. This is one that will put a smile on anyone who hates bratty kids faces.

I had been working, stocking shelves, all week at this point because we had been having a large sale and people were clearing off shelves (25 cents off of a 10 buck item, better get 12) and of course being on the main floor opens you up to getting fucked with by every single freaking kid who comes through. Kids knocking boxes off of shelves and parents laughing, kids opening products and eating it...and parents laughing. Everything under the sun and parents of course laughing and making me clean up after it. 

This had been going on for quite some time until a (I am assuming grandmother) woman and kid walk in, and already for some reason I can sense a bit of a Madea vibe coming from this lady. The kid kept doing random shit while she shopped, but amazingly the woman kept saying sorry to me then making the kid clean up whatever it was. Then shit hit the fan, We don't have a toy aisle but we do have little toy things [like this] (http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_046n1L57oBY/THWtDCLww5I/AAAAAAAAApk/nG77cLo_mN8/s400/-1.jpg) hanging in the aisles, one of which has little [plastic slingshots] (http://www.melchiormenzel.de/pictures/photos_slingshots/photo_slingshot_plastik.jpg) on it. This kid has the bright idea to take it out of the package and try to shoot me with a penny while I am stocking the frozen food refrigerators, well I opened the glass door as he shot, the penny bounced off of the door and busted his gramma smack dab in the ass cheek. This lady was furious, yelling at him, the whole nine yards. I keep working grinning to myself just a tad, as if this one kid getting in trouble made up for all the other times they didn't. Then the lady turned to me and asked if it would be possible to borrow my belt (part of our uniform), I told her yes but asked if she could please go to the restroom as to not cause a scene, which she happily agreed to, no more than 10 minutes later she returns my belt, kid in tow sniffling and walking funny. She made him say sorry for being a bother to those working, she paid for her stuff and left with no further problems. 

I still see them around, she is the sweetest little old lady you have ever met, funny as all get out, but if you get on her bad side you stay on her bad side.",The day shitty kids ACTUALLY GET PUNISHED.,384
ilovetrolls98705,14,15,1phsi9,54,"Me and my mother were getting our nails done for a wedding last week, and unfortunately, my mom is a crazy bitch. We had an appointment set a few days before but we were really in no rush because our appointment was at noon and we didn't leave for our hotel until 8 pm that night. We arrived at the nail salon (it was very busy), and we checked in a few minutes early, sat down, and were just mindlessly sitting, nothing out of the ordinary and definitely nothing to complain about. Well, not for me at least. It was about 12:05, and my mom became VERY impatient. She repeatedly said to me, ""Oh my GOD we have an appointment, why are they so effing slow?"" 
I went with it for about a minute, but she was relentless. She went up to the front desk (to a lady who was checking in someone else, but was in the middle of another woman's nails) and said ""Um, we have an APPOINTMENT, right?"" That poor lady, she wasn't even the normal clerk. Well my mother came and sat back down and I glared at her, but she was too busy fuming. I had to mutter to her, "" *Mom*. They are busy, and we cant control other people, *calm down*."" She ignored me. Another worker walked by, and she was about to yell at them again, but I had to physically grab her arm and I looked her in the eyes and told her ""STOP"". At this point, I was very embarrassed of her behavior. at 12:15 we went back to her seats, and I apologized to the women working there, and tipped my stylist out of pocket because of my mom.

This test would cover common sense, basic communication skills, basic business functions, and basic finances. If a customer is able to pass the test, they will be allowed to shop as they please. 

Common sense: It really shouldn't be hard to use common sense. For example, if the light on the register is on, it's open. If it's off, it's closed or in the process of closing. Also, keep aware of your surroundings. Also, what's going through your mind when you throw cash on a moving conveyor belt. 

Communication: If you have a question, yelling isn't going to help. And don't assume that we can read minds. 

Business: I'm not saying that you have to be able to run a business (bonus points if you can), but I feel you should understand how every business needs to make a profit, if there are a lot of people the lines will be longer, and basic logistics. 

Finances: if you don't have the money, you can't buy it. If you use a card earlier, and then it stops working, maybe you ran out of money.",Customer Training Module,26
Moonlesschris,4,12,1phjyu,0,"A while back I needed to buy a few items from a supermarket.  I was low on funds so I dipped into my change reserve.  I rolled my coins and proceeded to the supermarket.  Upon arrival, I decide to take the rolled coins to customer service to exchange them for bills to make it easier on the check out cashiers.  I wait in line to be seen and when I get to the counter I present the coins and request cash.  The SUPERVISOR informs me that ""We don't do that here.""  I was a bit taken back and felt that she might have misunderstood my intent.  I replied that I was simply trying to make it easier for the cashiers.  She then directs me to the coinstar.  I looked at the ROLLED coins and mentioned that the coins were already counted.  She grew more concerned and her eyes widened and she spoke to me as if I had a gun pointed at her head.  I did in fact ask if she was on drugs, After which I decided to just go to the coinstar.  

As I had to unroll the coins into the coinstar, I ended up with two receipts due to a time out.  I was charged around $5 to have my counted change counted again.  As I walk around the isles to kill time, I see a large man who was not round fat but shapes fat (Dane Cook).  He resembled a sickly looking cancer patient with red eyes.  He was giving orders to a young guy who was moving pallets.  My eyes were then drawn to the large man's name tag.  The name escapes me because the memory of his title eclipsed every other thought.  He was a SUPERVISOR.  I quite literally stood in aww as I watched him spout orders in mumbly voice.  Finally I break away and continue on my adventure.  

As I reach the check out lane, I figured that I would have to pay more then I what I had in change.  After I received my total I handed the cashier my two coinstar receipts and readied my wallet to pay off the remaining balance.  After scanning the receipts, the cashier hands me tender in the amount of the balance (Approx. $20).  At this point, I was fed up with dealing with the employees of this establishment that I did not care to correct the mistake.  I gathered my things and walked out the door.

I work at an independent grooming salon and I overheard this exchange with my boss. 

A woman calls asking for an appointment. We're booked this week but amazingly we got a rescheduled appointment today so we can take her. She asks for a discount because she's unemployed and my sweet boss gives her one, but only if this is a shave down. No fancy cut. The woman is fine with this and asks when she can come in. Boss tells her between 12 and 1pm. Woman says oh that won't work. She'd rather come in at 4pm. Boss tells her no, between 12-1pm is the drop off time. So that doesn't work and she asks for tomorrow. Again is told no, already told her we're completely booked this week and that today is it out she can come in next week. She says ok and phone call ends. The woman called back two minutes later asking the same questions and gets told again that it's today at 12-1 or next week. That's it. Then she gets her friend to call a few minutes later and asks the same freaking questions, trying to get an appointment tomorrow. Guess what the answer was... 

She is fluent in English so we know she's just trying to make us give up and give her what she wants. This isn't the first time we've had people try this.  We at the shop have decided that if she calls back the discount is gone and we're not going to be patient with her on the phone anymore.",A dog grooming tale,29
Adventureisoutthere9,7,11,1phhb8,35,"Back story: I work at a ""higher end"" grocery store that sells a lot of specialty and organic items, and a lot of the guests that shop here have insanely entitled attitudes.  It's enough to make even the most patient of people crazy sometimes.  At the back of our store, we have a patio where there is live music on the weekends and where people can sit during the week and eat lunch.  We have a deli of prepared foods that you can heat-and-eat at the store if you like, as well as a taco bar, sandwich bar, and soup/salad bar. There are two express registers by the door leading to the patio, so people will pay for their food there and then take it outside to eat.  This is not technically a restaurant; you serve yourself.  If you want a drink from the fountain or water, you take your cup over there and get it yourself.

There is one older couple who comes into the store at least once a week.  She is very kind and sweet, but he is a complete jerk.  Just seeing him makes me angry, and I a generally mellow person.  His wife will be in an electric cart and he walks around using both his and her canes.  They usually get soup and something small from the Chef Prepared deli area and then check out to go outside.

The old man used to treat the cashiers and those working in the deli area like they were his waiters, and demand that they go fill his drink for him, bring him napkins, silverware, etc (all of which are located at the checkout).  I guess someone must have finally said something to him because he gets his own drink now.

But still, when they come into the store, he will be checking out and his wife in the cart behind him.  I'll tell him his total or try to be friendly and talk to him and he cuts me off in the middle of my sentence and yells, ""What?! I can't hear you!"" Very angrily.  His wife will then try to repeat what I say to him, and he glares at her and says, ""Miriam, I can't understand a damn thing you say. Is it important? Just wait til we get outside and tell me then.""  This happens every. single. time. he comes into the store, and the way he treats his poor wife I swear he was physically abusive when he was more able-bodied.

Then, a couple of weeks ago when he was in here, I was the only one working at the side registers by those doors.  He had purchased his food and taken it all outside then came back in in the electric cart and tells me I need to go around the corner to get him some more plastic ware (the basket we keep at the register had just run out).  There are about 5 people in my line at the time, so I told him, ""Sir, I can't leave the register right now.  It's just behind me next to the drinks if you would like to go get it.""  He cursed and made a show of going and getting his own dang cutlery.

He makes me so mad!

rugbygirl24,16,15,1phf3x,68,"**Background:**I work the desk at a high end hair salon in the USA. Although a majority of the people who come in are very nice, we get our fair share of self absorbed, rude women more concerned about people noticing their Gucci purse or Burberry coat than being a decent human being. Most of them you can deal with easily with a forced smile but there is a list of 5 or 6 women who each of us at the desk knows to be prepared for a hassle. They all are short tempered, bad at communicating and expect you to read their mind when booking appointments/checking out.

**Story:** The worst of them all, we'll call her EW for Evil Witch, gets her hair cut and colored and her nails done there with our top technicians. This means her haircut is $63, her color ranges from $72-$214 depending on if she gets highlights or not and her no-chip french mani/pedi runs about  $58/$98 respectively. With guest who spend that much we are careful to make sure everything about their experience is perfect, but it is never enough for this woman. On top of it, she is fat, ugly, and gets her hair cut high and tight (short on the sides, a little longer on top) so its beyond me why she wants to see the top people. 

The most recent encounter with her made me laugh out loud when I heard about it. She called to cancel her regular nail appointment for whatever reason and almost immediately someone else called and took that slot. We book solid for nail appointments for about 2 weeks so this is not uncommon. Well EW decides to show up for the appointment anyway, and proceeds to yell at my manager loud enough for half the salon to hear about how its an outrage that we can't accommodate her. What a shocker, you don't have an appointment on the busiest day of the week and the 1 nail technician left who will take you (who calls EW princess bitch face haha) doesn't have an appointment available? To make it worse, my managers father was standing at the desk paying for his haircut while all this went down.

I will bend over back words for nice people, no matter how much money they spend there, and it is amazing what can be worked out when a guest is kind, patient and a little flexible. The absurdity of EW's actions never fail to amuse me. She avoids talking to me for booking appointments or the final check out because she doesn't intimidate me anymore.","Pardon me, your Highness!",83
TheDivineSalM,16,5,1ph94q,44,"My TM has a real Jekyll/Hyde kinda thang going on.  One minute she can be nice, then BOOM! Douchiness ensues at the drop of a hat.  

Yesterday was two cases in point. 

All our Christmas temps have now started so the store is full of bodies.  Yesterday the UK had been threatened with an apocalyptic storm that had missed my fair city but the tv warnings to travel when only necessary, added to the fact that it was pissing down with rain, meant we were very very quiet indeed. 

I can't just stand around doing bugger all, so I went over to the counter of a certain San Franciscan makeup company and started unloading their delivery, seeing how we hadn't got a sales rep for that brand in on a Monday.  

TM appears at my shoulder.  'Who asked you to do that?' she said, and not in a nice way.  My dander was up a little as in the past she has berated people for not putting the delivery away if we've been quiet.  'I'm just putting the delivery away... it's quiet on tills' 
'I didn't ask what you were doing, I asked who told you to do that?'
*sigh* pardon me for using my initiative, biatch. 

Then later, I had been going to ask her could I swap my day off on day in December as my Mum had a hospital appointment and it left me without childcare after school.  I am the sort of person who doesn't like to give you a problem without also supplying a solution, so I'd already checked with a colleague who had said she'd happily swap shifts with me and take my midweek day off, so that TM would not have any juggling to do, Christmas being busy enough and scheduling not being her strong point.  

Bear in mind we were the last department in the store to be given our Christmas shift changes to contracted hours, and the week before she'd got me in her office and told me that the Christmas hours were nearly done but she was worried people wouldn't be happy with them.  Nobody ever is, there is always someone who wants X off to do Y and why the hell has so and so only got two late nights when I've got twenty million? I told her not to worry, the worst that can happen is that people moan behind her back and she said 'I'll do them by next week, and if people want any changes they can sort it out among themselves' 

So I wrote her a note telling her I needed a Monday off but it was ok as I'd already arranged for cover and she didn't have to do anything.  She found me on the shop floor later and handed me my Christmas hours and in a very cutting and sarcastic way said 'no doubt these will change as you've all already started swapping them amongst yourselves'

Well YEAH! That is what you told me to do! 

I hate not knowing if I'm getting good cop or bad cop from one minute to the next.  She's worse on a Monday after the management meetings, as if there are niggles from on high then I understand that shit rolls downhill, but damn! Pick a lane! I don't think I can stay there much longer.  I used to be in an abusive relationship and I'm starting to feel the danger signs of getting stressed from walking on eggshells all the time.  I don't want to get depressed again.  That black dog stalked me long enough.

TL? You don't have to read it.  It's just nice to rant.  My Mum is no good at letting me unload as she's worried I'll go downhill again.  Thanks for letting me unload on here.

rugbygirl24,22,28,1ph8yi,120,"**Background:** I work the front desk at a high end hair salon in the USA. Whenever the company hires a new person they put them through a roughly 9 month long paid internship program to get them up to the ""standard of excellence"" expected from each technician. During this time they are referred to as junior stylists/colorist. The juniors are able to take appointments during this time but the prices are about half of what the least expensive full price haircut/color would cost with a full priced technician. The salon operates on a level system, meaning the longer a tech has worked there generally the more expensive their prices to reflect their skill level. The salon is also departmentalized so stylists only cut hair and colorist only color.


So seeing a junior for a service is a great deal. You get high quality work done for half or more than half the price of full priced services (most juniors have worked in other salons so they have experience and they are also supervised by a mentor who checks their work before the juniors guest leaves). Also anytime a new guest comes in they receive a thank you packet of coupons for being new to the salon and to give them and incentive to come back. These coupons do not apply to junior services as they are already heavily discounted, although it does not expressly state that in the fine print on the coupons, people frequently give us a hard time about this. 


**Story:** When I had just finished training and was working my first closing shift alone I get a phone call literally 3 mins before we close (10pm). I pick up with my normal pleasant greeting, get no greeting in return, just a ""yeah, I want to see a junior colorist."" I asked what kind of color service she needed to get done and told her the days the junior worked. That was the first problem, the days the junior worked weren't good for her schedule or someone had already booked an appointment at the time she wanted. 


I'm doing everything I can to make this work somehow but she is getting more and more frustrated with me. She then tells me she wants to book a time 30 mins before close, not a time I offered as available. I calmly try to explain that we do not book color appointments that close to closing time because it will take 30 mins to apply the color and another 45mins to an hour for it to process. By the time she would be shampooed and blow dried that would be about an hour and half past close and we simply do not book color appointments that way.


This is when she lost her damn mind. She starts yelling at me, saying ""So you just kick people out the door as soon as you close? This is ridiculous! I'm trying to come in and give you my money, I've been on the phone with you for 15 mins (it had been 5 or 6mins max) and you can't seem to work the computer!"" I once again calmly tried to explain that no, we do not kick people out as soon as we close but we do book color appointments in a way that allows for them to end before or right as we are closing. She then proceeds to go on a huge rant about how she'll have to miss her grandsons baseball game and he'll be so upset and blah blah blah. All I'm thinking is I don't care please just give me your name so I can book this appointment and go home!


She finally gave me her name, I put her down for an appointment that would allow her to leave halfway through her grandsons game and before getting off the phone she says ""oh wait, I have one of those new guest coupons!"" My heart sinks because I know exactly which coupon she's talking about and I was also fairly certain it would not apply to a junior service. The coupon is for $20 off color which would make the $31 service she wanted $11, a service that at its cheapest full price is $60! I tell her that I am pretty sure the coupon would not apply as the junior services are already heavily discounted and she starts to read me the fine print on the coupon in a snarky voice, saying it says nothing about junior technicians. My voice starts to shake as I once again try to explain that I am almost positive the coupon will not apply and she loses it again, this time attacking my personally saying I am the worst customer service person she has ever had to deal with, she can't afford it she can't use the coupon, she is gonna have to miss her grandsons baseball blah blah you suck blah blah. When she finally stops I tell her I will have my manager contact her in the morning. She tells me one more time how incompetent I am and hangs up.


I called my manager immediately on the verge of tears and still semi shocked at what just happened, I had worked customer service before but never had someone treat me that poorly. My manager is able to calm me down, tells me I didn't do anything wrong, and that I was absolutely right, this crazy woman cannot use the coupon for a junior service. I will never understand why people think it is ok to be so rude to customer service employees. 


**Edit:** Sorry I'm such a noob at this! Hopefully this formatting is better and I tried to cut some of the fat from the story.

background: i don't work in retail ( i do tech support) but have a friend that works for a popular grocery store brand in america, the kind that carries your bags to your car.
she's a mid level manager and is often the case with most places, she (and other employees) like doing some harmless hazing on the ""newbies"".

on vacation i decided to hang out with her at work one day and assist with what ever i can, because pandas are nice like that :P

highlights of the day:

her asking one of the ""newbies"" to mop the freezer... a few minutes later (i hado t go and retrieve a bottle...) i located said employee outside of freezer getting mop ready and handed him a bottle of anti-freeze....the joy of seeing the 
""newbies"" face light up with realization he's just been pranked was priceless :)

~~~~~~~~

later in the day aroudn closing time another ""newbie"" was asked to take down the flag outside, (the store has no flag) after about 5 minutes outside the employee is standing there trying to figure out what flag, noticing this i decide to go over and see whats up, (to which point they explain the task assigned to them) after we both have a short laugh i handed them a canadian flag i had in my car (remember this is a US store, also i was on vacation and like to bring canadian memorabilia for my friends) and told employee to bring flag back to the manager that had given them the task, a job done...... the ensuing managers confusion, i'm told was priceless beyond compare :)

wootitsathrowaway,15,13,1ph78m,58,"**Background:** I work as a cashier in a ""fancy"" grocery store.  

**Story:** This past Saturday night, I was working at the registers when the hordes of costumed people started swarming in.  A girl about my age (early twenties) came up to the register, and I greeted her with a smile and started ringing her up.  She was dressed as a wolf, wearing a tight dress and with face paint on.  A middle-age guy (probably late 40s, early 50s) gets in line behind her, looks her up and down, and starts chatting her up.  Let's call him MAG.

She seems okay with it at first, as he seems he's just trying to be friendly, but then starts getting pretty flirty and slightly creepy.  She looks a bit uncomfortable, but she seems to be handling it well and laughing it off.  Even so, I kept tabs on the conversation in case I had to jump in and say something-- I wasn't even sure what I would have said, especially since I'm super shy, but I know what it feels like to be hit on in an uncomfortable way and be too afraid to say anything.  

I finish ringing the girl up and she leaves.  It's MAG's turn to be helped.  I smile at him but before I can greet him, he says to me, in the most creepy way possible, ""Well, *she* was hot.""  
The way he said it was strange, like he was hinting that I wasn't.  Okay dude, great.  I'm sure I'd look better in a tight dress than I would in my work uniform consisting of a baggy polo shirt and khakis too.  

I meant to fake-laugh it off (if you're in customer service, you know the laugh I'm talking about...The one you have to practically beat yourself over the head to emit when a customer makes a ""joke"" at your expense or suggests that because an item doesn't ring up, that it's free).  
But instead, my true feelings came out.  The ""laugh"" came out as a scoff that practically reeked of disgust and fury.  I wanted to shove it back into my mouth as soon as it happened.  I normally try my best to be friendly (or if the customer is rude, at least detached and polite), but it had been a ridiculously busy and trying day for every employee in the store, and dang was I tired.  

MAG's face immediately fell and settled into a cold scowl.  We didn't speak to each other for the remainder of the transaction.  As I handed him his receipt, he glared and rushed out.  

I felt so bad about my accidental slip that I talked to a manager afterward.  She said not to worry about it, that sometimes the wrong reaction just comes out and there's nothing you can do.  She was totally sympathetic, as she's dealt with plenty of strange/creepy/rude customers too obviously!  Thank goodness for kind managers. ",In which I can't contain myself because of a creeper.,71

Last Tuesday, I invited some of my friends over to my house. In preparation for this gathering, I went to my nation-wide superchain grocery store here in America.

All was well and I had finally gathered up all my things. I made my way over to the self-checkout lane and waited for my turn. There was already someone in line, so I waited without giving it much thought. After about 5 minutes or so, I looked up and noticed that there were already about three tills open, so I spoke up to the customer in front of my, let's call him Illiterate Idiot. The conversation went as follows

Me: Hey man, that till over there is open if you want to head over.

II: I'm just waiting for one of these employees to tell me which ones take cash

Me: That's cool, there are three tills open,  but I think that one over there says that it takes cash.

II: EXCUSE me? Do you work here? Do you?

Me: No, but I can read a sign.

II: Hey, if you feel the need to go, just hop on over, otherwise, shut your bitch ass up!

Me: Fine.

I then proceeded to take the only till open that takes cash. As I'm checking out, I hear him ask an employee which ones take cash. The employee proceeds to tell him that the one I took was the only one that takes cash. He looked over, and I waved my card at him.

I had only been working there a couple of weeks when this first story occurred. We had just swapped over vintages with our red wines (from 2007 to 2008) and hadn't had a chance to update the tasting notes yet, so the vintage on the notes was not what we were tasting. We were all careful to make customers aware of this and make it clear what they were tasting and no one had a problem... until the Grumpy Old Man (GOM) came along. It was the end of a very busy day when GOM and his wife came up for a tasting. I gave them my usual chirpy greeting and asked what they would like to taste. I always try to make conversation with customers and build a rapport, but all I got from this man was huffing and grunting and displeased looks. In my distraction with the busy bar, I forgot to tell him about the change in vintages (though it was clearly marked on the bottle in front of him). At the end, GOM decided that he like the Shiraz and wanted to buy a bottle of the 2007, at which point I had to explain that the one he tasted was actually 2008 and did he still want to buy the (now more expensive) 2007 or the one he tried? Next thing I knew, I had a tantrum on my hands. He was screaming about false advertising, how incompetent I was, how he wanted to buy what he tried, but he wanted it to have been the older vintage and he didn't want the younger one... actually, I don't think he knew what he wanted. I had no idea how to deal with this  and his poor wife obviously took pity on me as I tried to come up with a solution to keep him happy, and she tried to make conversation while her husband fumed. She asked me ""So, dear, which wine is your favourite here?"". To which her husband snapped ""SHE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT!!!"" and stormed off to the car. Apparently being a young, new cellar door assistant means I had no idea what I personally liked to drink. His wife bought a bottle of something and hurried off after him, apologising profusely.

throw_away_account23,7,9,1ph2w2,55,"This is a short story.  

So a customer came, bought some small items, left, it was nice and easy.  Next customer in line comes, slams his hand on my desk and yells at me for not having another cashier open, even though the only the 2 people were in the line (him and the customer I helped previously).

So this rude guy wants to buy some $70 product.  I scan it.  Then he hands me a printout of our stores flyer saying the product is on sale for 50% off.  

However, the printout starts on the next day.  If you are signed up through email, you get the e-flyer a day early. 

Now, normally I don't mind changing the price.  Managers let me have that authority.  However, since this guy was so rude, I just pointed at the date and said no.  He kept arguing with me, but I refused to change the price.  He demanded to speak to my supervisor.  I got the one that was near by since I suspected he heard everything.  He stood by my decision.

OrbOfConfusion,17,11,1ph289,36,"First post here, just started working a cash register at a casual restaurant - no waiters, you order up front with me and we bring you your food. So no one really makes tips.  We do have little cups by the registers that are technically tip jars, but since pretty much no one ever tips, the customers mostly use them as ""take a penny"" jars. Whatever, it's annoying but in over a month I've made less than $5 in tips, so I'm not missing out on much. (relevant) 

So this older crabby guy (OCG) comes in and orders a sandwich and stuff. I ring him up and his total is, say, $17.51. Something like that, I don't remember exactly. He counts out 17 dollars in bills, and starts looking at his coins. Yay for exact change! But he ends up handing me exactly $17.50.  

Me: ""Alright, sir, I just need one more cent.""

OCG: ""Take one from here!"" He indicates the tip jar, as though this was the most obvious thing in the world and I should've known to do it on my own. 

Me: ""Sir, it's empty."" I hold the cup up to show him.  

OCG: ""Well I don't have another penny! Go find one!"" 

Now, we were busy that day. There was a line forming behind him. I was not going to leave and go around to the other registers and look for pennies (in our *tip jars* no less!) to give this guy.  

Me: ""I can't do that, sir.""  

OCG: ""Can't you just get it? It's just a penny!"" He throws his hands in the air in disgust. 

Me: ""Sorry sir, I need $17.51.""  I mean, I guess I could've just taken the money he had, but I've been reprimanded by my managers for being a few cents off on my drawer before, and that was just from regular human error. I wasn't going to purposely make it worse. And I'm pretty sure at this point the guy wanted me to reach into my own wallet and give him a penny. 

OCG: ""Fine!"" He waves his hand at me to give him back his money.  I hand it back to him and he slaps a $20 bill in my hand. ""Here!"" 

I get my fake cheery voice on: ""Here's your change sir, have a good day!"" 

He harumphs at me and walks off. My coworker saw the exchange and puts one of his own pennies in the jar for me, in case it happened again. 

Just to be clear, if you're super nice to me, I'll probably be willing to dig around in the other registers for a penny for you, but I definitely won't take an amount less than the total to put in the register. It's policy, and I thought it was obvious to everyone. But apparently it's my job to run my ass off to get you *one cent* just so you avoid having a few coins in change. ","""I'm a penny short?

LovablePWNER,58,13,1ph24m,67,"I'm sure everyone has heard or even been the recipient of someone who pays in all change. This particular one is slightly different because this guy worked in the same store as me and still did it.

Ok so I work at a large grocery chain Michigan that was started in Michigan (if you're from the area you know where I work). I was working at the express lane that has a shorter belt and typically I just take smallish orders and the point is that it's supposed to be fast.

Well this guy I work with that we'll call Paul comes up with 3 bags of fun size Snickers. Nothing unusual, easy order. It comes out to be like $8.53 or something along those lines and I tell him the total.

That bastard pulls out a zip loc bag of pennies, nickels and dimes and goes ""Gotta get rid of then somehow uh hurr hurr""

Now he doesn't work as a cashier, he's actually a utility worker, but he knows what I do and what my job is and he still friggan whips out Tooth Fairy money.

The whole thing took like 13 minutes and he actually lost count at one point. I eventually just said ""Let me count it man"", in not the kindest way, and got him out of my line.

He seriously backed up my line up to five people who were actually very understanding.

TL;DR Don't pay with a bag of change. Especially if your doing it to someone you work with.

C08313458,19,33,1pgqj8,108,"Hi there TFR! I'm never really sure where to post my stories as I work in retail (Box Office), but I also work at the ""front desk"". So I'll post this here first, and if people think that it would work in /r/talesfromthefrontdesk as well I might pop it on there also.


As you can see from my previous post here (months ago) I work in a busy, multi-venue theatre in the UK. With three venues, multiple shows on a night in each so it can get quite manic. Especially when you have 2 sold out shows exiting at the same time, and you still have customers trying to collect tickets for the later shows. And they all have to go through the foyer... 


That's what was happening at this moment in time. It was a Saturday night. I was two thirds through a 9 hour shift. We had two sold out venues exiting (one from the basement and one from the main house - both around 140 people, so nearly 300 in total). And countless people trying to collect at the box office for out shows later that night.


A family of four came up from downstairs, as far as I could tell they were an elderly couple (grandparents), their middle-aged daughter and her adult son. They decided to stand right in front of me. I could see there were people trying to get through to the Box Office but these ignorant, oblivious people just stood there talking about how quaint the theatre was, and how exciting it was to be ""off-West End"".


The son was finishing off a glass of wine, so I thought they would be going back into our bar. When they didn't move, I stood up and, as nicely as I could muster, asked them to either make their way outside or into the bar so that the foyer, which is a fire exit can be kept clear and people can get to the box office. The middle-aged woman just looked at me with such contempt and venom that such a low-level servant had dared spoken to them. She then spat out ""We're leaving in a second"".


I replied with a ""Thank you very much.""


The son then finished off the last dreggs of his wine and placed the large glass right bang in front of me.


Now, as I said I work at the box office. Not the bar. The bar is less than 10 feet from the box office. Now, it was busy as it was a Saturday night, but there were tables right by the entrance that someone could leave down a glass if they so wanted to, without going into the actual bar. Another thing to note is that there is a small bar in our downstairs venue. They are both run and staffed by the same company. 


When he put the glass down I looked up at him and said ""I'm sorry sir but you cannot leave that here, if you could kindly bring into the bar, I would really appreciate it as we can't deal with glass here"".


The grandfather replied incredulously ""We were ushered out of downstairs and didn't have time to bring it to the bar down there""


ME:""I apologise if you were moved out quickly but we do have another show down there in half an hour and we need the turn around time. This glass can be brought into out main bar, just behind you.""


The son then went to pick up the glass (*cue shocked gasps*), and I thanked him. Thinking that that is one less THING I have to deal with tonight.


BUT...! Just as he picked it up, his mother - this guys own mother - took the glass out of his hand and placed it defiantly back down, all the while staring straight at me. 


I tried to say something, but words would not come. I sat there speechless until they started to move out. Both me and my colleague, who had witnessed the whole thing, started to actually shout after them... ""Excuse me..? SIR?! Your glass?!""


But he just turned around and gave the biggest shit eating grin I have ever seen. It just said 'I am better than you, and I know it'.


I was angry the rest of the night that I had to go onto /r/aww to calm myself down.

FredFltStn,302,753,1pgoim,1625,"**BACKGROUND:**  I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven.

**STORY:**  Welcome to the week of scam artists. They rarely get away with it, but that sure doesn't stop them from trying.

One of my cashiers was ringing up a large order when she flagged me down. She noticed that the price sticker on one of the items was wrong, and wanted to let me know so we could fix it. We occasionally screw up (once again I'm talking about you Josh) and misprice stuff. When we do, we always sell it to the customer at the marked price since it was our fault. We'll then go back and fix the mistake on any remaining inventory on the shelf.

The item was a large mortar kit that retails for $169.95 (buy 1 get 1 free). The price tag on it said $49.95, so the female customer was definitely going to get a deal on our screw-up. I walked over to the shelf to check the price on the remaining products, but they all seem to be ok, so I went back to helping other customers.

A minute later, I get flagged down again for another price check. It's another large item, and it's priced for less than half of what it normally sells for. I make a mental note to castrate Josh, then go to check out the remaining items. Once again they all seem to be priced correctly, but I did notice that a different package on the shelf was totally missing a price tag. I grabbed a price gun and tagged the package missing a sticker.

I barely finished putting a sticker on the item when I'm flagged down AGAIN! Now the customer starts fuming and berating my cashier about what screw ups we are. She really starts to raise hell, so I apologize and tell her that we'll take care of the issue. I also remind her that even though the items were mispriced, we were giving them to her at the lower price.

I go to check the item on the shelf and once again, all of the remaining inventory seems to be priced right. Now my spider sense is tingling. I walked back to the counter to “help” the cashier ring in the rest of the items.

Amazingly, I noticed that at ALL of the larger items that the woman has brought to the counter are mispriced. All of her large items, no matter what the original price, now have a price tag of $49.95. I stopped the transaction, looked the lady in the eye, and told her, “I'm not selling you anything, and you need to leave now”.

Do you remember the scene from the movie “The Exorcist” where Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) tries to expel the demon from Reagan (Linda Blair)? The scene that unfolded at my tent was very similar to that, but with less head spinning and more swearing.

I’m in my 40’s, and I honestly believe that I learned a few new words that day. She combined swear words and ethnic slurs that I’m fairly certain have never been used together before. She wove an amazing tapestry of obscenity, punctuated occasionally by wild arm waving and the liberal use of her middle finger. I think she could have honestly set some type of world record, but I apparently threw off her rhythm when I started applauding her performance.

I offered to call the police and have them sort it out, but she was apparently uninterested, and made a beeline for the door. The sad thing was, she would have gotten away with it if she had just changed the price on one or two items. 

In retrospect, I really need to train my staff better. My cashier actually did a great job in spotting the mispriced items, but when I started to applaud the impressive display of obscenity, none of my staff joined in. I’ll be adding that to our Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) before the upcoming New Years Eve.

This past sunday I was working the ""close"" shift. In quotes because I work at a 24 hour store, but a close shift at a non-24 hour one. We had three sick calls, that night, two on our self-serve side and 1  in our pharmacy. It was around 8 pm, and I and my photo tech were alone at the registers with an employee on break and about 15 people in line.

In comes a cranky regular(CR) who just wants to use the bathroom.

CR: I need someone to open the bathroom (talking loudly over the people we're helping)

Me: Sorry Sir, I don't have anyone to open the bathroom right now.

CR: What am I supposed to do???

Me: there's gas stations 1/4th a mile on either side of us on xxth street

CR: I need to use the bathroom! This is ridiculous!

Me: (I'm still smiling and ringing up customers) Sir, I don't have anyone at the moment to let you in, it's just me and my photo tech here. We're short handed and our other coworker is on break.

CR: Well i might as well go on the floor here if i'm not let in! What am I supposed to do!!!!!???? (Practically shouting)

Me: You're an adult Sir, I'm sure you can figure out what to do.

At this point the employee on break (We'll call Bob) comes back and see's we have a huge line and tries to sign in.

CR: YOU LET ME INTO THE BATHROOM NOW!!!!

I lean over to Bob: Let him in and hurry back we have ACTUAL customers that need to be rung up.

CR grumbled at me and followed him to the bathroom.

Apparently on the way to the bathroom CR was ranting at Bob.

CR: This is horrible, I always should be let into the bathroom right away

Bob: We're short staffed he didn't have anyone to let you in

CR: Then you should hire more.

Bob: that wouldn't help since we had sick calls

CR: I want to speak to your manager

Bob: You did at the register

CR: He wasn't the manager, I want to speak to the real one

Bob: He had a tie and vest on with a name tag that said manager, you just spoke to him.


Bob returned and we finished ringing up the rush. As I was walking back to the office CR came around the corner and started yelling: You better clean up those bathrooms, everytime I come in here they are so dirty, I'm going to call the health department.

Me: You do that sir (walked away)

I checked the bathrooms about 10-15 minutes later and besides some dirt marks on the floor from the use from the day, it was completely clean.

So I'm loading items on the grocery conveyor belt.  My wife and I have about $100 of stuff, nothing big.  There's a large bag of charcoal in the bottom level of the cart.  I didn't bother to put it up there because I figured I'll hold it up and have her scan it at the end.

While she's passing other stuff across the sensor, she says very nice and calmly, ""Can you hold up that bag of charcoal?""

Now, completely as a joke, with a big goofy grin and comedic tone of voice I say, ""Aw damn I was hoping you wouldn't notice it!""  My wife laughs and calls me a clown.  Even the guy behind us chuckled a little.  *As I am grabbing the bag to hold up* she says, ""You were intending to *steal it?*""  
""What?  No!  I was only joking!""  
""I'm getting a manager.""  

She hits her little buzzer, calls the manager and tells him to bring security.  Apparently there is no security because he arrived alone.  The cashier, an older lady, goes into this short tale when he arrives about how she ""caught"" me trying to steal a bag of charcoal.  At this point I'm holding the bag up and both my wife and I are just rattling away about how it was only a passing joke.

The manager excuses her and says he'll handle the transaction.  He says, after she walks away, ""Sorry about this, guys.""

riot-van,43,36,1pgicw,145,"I work as a cashier at a supermarket, and although this story doesn't sound too crazy, it REALLY got to me. I was checking out this guy's groceries today. He didn't really say much, but I was fine with that as I had had a long shift and was ready to go home and relax. Anyway, the total came to, lets just say $15.63. In Australia we round up to 5c in this situation, when paying by cash as we no longer have 1c and 2c coins.

So the man handed me $15.60 in cash. (50c and 10c coin, he had forgotten the other 5c) Because this customer had been nice enough thus far, I didn't ask for the extra 5c, and instead just opened the drawer, put the money away and handed him his receipt. 

Anyway, this is what followed:

Me: Have a nice night! (Hands customer his receipt)

He took the receipt, and didn't say anything but just looked at me. After a few seconds I asked:

Me: Sorry, was there something wrong?

Customer: Where is my change?

Me: Oh, the total came to $15.63 (pointing to his receipt) and you gave me $15 in notes and then a 50 cent and 10 cent coin, so there isn't any change to give, sorry!

The man paused again, still looking at me but with a shocked expression on his face.

Customer: No, I gave you 70 cents. A 50 and a 20. Don't you know how to do maths?

Me: I can assure you that it was a 10 cent coin and not a 20 cent coin, as I always double check the amount of money I am given before putting it away in the register.

At this point he had a smug expression on his face, and was looking around at the other customers trying to imply that I was an idiot.

Customer: No, you have short changed me. I've been short changed!!!! 

Me: Okay, then what do you want? (I changed my tone from being friendly to being pretty rude)

Customer: For god sake just give me my change is it that hard?

He kept looking around at the other customers to try and humiliate me for the mistake that I had apparently made. After that, I just opened the register, gave him 5 cents and said ""Here!"".

Like I said, I know it sounds trivial, but I had been nice to him by not making a fuss over him not having enough money, and then it was thrown back in my face over a *5 cent coin*. Really??
I just wish that customers treated me with a little more respect. Even if I was at fault in this situation, he could have easily asked me politely and I probably would have handed him the 5 cents without any other questions!

Anyway, thanks for listening... I just needed to vent because he really made me feel like crap even though he was in the wrong. There's no doubt that you guys have similar stories to share!!

Lightfairy,18,24,1pgfjt,93,"Hi all, me again with another tale from my ever amusing workplace. For those who don't know me I work in an adult shop in a predominantly gay area of my city.  This one happened yesterday.

A wee touch of background. Predominantly gay area as mentioned above and this area attracts a lot of tourists. From within the country and from outside the country. My city also sees a lot of young people from other countries who like to take a year off and travel or who have working visas. These people tend to pick up whatever work they can during their travels. I get a LOT of them dropping off resumes at my work. 

To the story. Two young Italian boys enter the shop. Not ugly, not gorgeous. Fairly average to be honest. Around mid 20's is my guess. Their English was horrendous with only one conducting 99% of the conversation. The conversation goes a bit like this (with occasional Italian exchanges between the two as they tried to figure out/remember English words). I will call them IB for Italian Boys and please imagine this conversation with their voices in the broadest Italian accent you can think of.

Me 'Hello there, how can I help you?'

IB 'We are trying to find a porno movie company so we can be in porno movies. Can you help us?'

Me 'You want to be in pornos?'

IB 'Yes. We travel here and need to make money so we want to be in pornos.'

Me 'Sorry to tell you this but you need to go to America or back to Europe guys. My country does not really have much of a porno industry. There used to be an industry in one state but it has pretty much dried up. Not enough money in it.

IB 'So we cannot get into pornos here in this country?'

Me 'Yeah sorry guys but I really don't see that happening for you.'

IB 'What about (Names another state)? Do they have porno companies there?'

Me 'Doesn't matter where you go in this country. I really don't like your chances of finding the kind of work you are after. Have you been in any? Do you have any experience?'

IB 'No but we would like to.' 

Meanwhile I am thinking 'Yeah, you and just about every other guy on the planet!!

Me 'About the only thing I can suggest is go online and have a bit of a look but there are tons of guys out there just like you wanting to get into porn and if you are looking for work I think you should find other areas of employment because I don't like your chances.'

IB 'What about as gigolos then? Can we find work as gigolos do you think?'  

WTF!

Me 'Guys again I don't really like your chances. If a woman wants a man in this country she just goes and finds one. I think you might have a problem finding women who will pay. I do have a couple of 'working boys' as customers here and they are built, gorgeous, extremely well spoken and they only do it as a sideline because there is not enough money in it. I don't see you both making a living as gigolos while you are here in my country.'

IB 'Hmmm ... so you don't think we could find an agency or something?'

Me 'Again, look online. You might get lucky but I doubt it. Like I said most women here don't want to pay for what they can get for free.'

IB 'Yeah, we have gone out and picked up women and bought them drinks but when we tell them they have to pay for sex they are not interested.'

What the actual heck did I just hear??????????????

They left soon after. I felt bad for having dashed their hopes of screwing their way through my country and of being paid to do so by all the porno companies and all the eager women who would so love some very average little Italian boys!

MrRatedrockstar,13,11,1pgfj4,71,"**Background**

I work for one of the leading supermarkets in the UK known for its excellent customer service and this woman takes customer service to a new level.

This lady is a 65~ or so lady from somewhere in France and is literally the worst customer I have ever had the displeasure in meeting.

**The First Encounter**
I had been working here for about two months when I first witnessed and had the pleasure of helping this customer. We will call her Crazy Lady (**CL** for short).

So I am going about my usual duties on the Fruit and Veg Department when **CL** comes up to me and says *""You! Weigh these for me now""*. The conversation goes something like this from then on:

**Me:** ""That's fine I won't be a second!"" I then go and weigh 4 different mangos for her to get the *best value*.

**CL:** (With no thanks) ""Now put them in my basket. Why are these not in the promotion?"" Thinking I was in charge of promotions for a nationwide store.

I then explain to her that promotions are based on what is best in season at that period of time. So currently Pumpkins are on a 1/3 off the usual price.

After about 10 minutes of not seeing this lady and continuing on with my job I hear from behind me:

**CL:** ""You, what is the price on these?""

**Me:** ""I am not too sure on this particular item as it is new let me just go and grab a gun (not a real one, but how I wish) and find out for you"". (I use this as a method of killing time most of the time)

*Goes and picks up same item from shelf to scan*

**Me:** ""Okay this item is £1.50, is that okay?""

**CL:** ""Where did you get that from? (The EXACT same item) Is this the same price? (The item she picked up)""**

**Me:** ""Yes that is the exact same so they are the same price. Is that all I can help you with today?""

**CL:** ""Yes."" Proceeds to walk off

The drive thru was backed up and people were getting pissy. The car I had parked have been waiting for at least 10-15 minutes. The women and her boyfriend(im guessing) get down and she starts getting loud and telling me that she has been waiting for over 10 minutes and I calmly inform her that her food wasn't ready but will be out shortly. She then proceeds to ask me if any of her order was ready in a very rude and loud way and again I calmly repeat myself and she proceeds to yell ""I'll kick your ass little girl"". This women was probably around her early 30's and was pretty big. She kept.going on about how my coworkers and I were fucking idiots and that we were worthless. I proceeded to go to the back and take a breather. I could here her from the crew room. I got really upset and wanted to cry. This job made me hate people even more. So this lady ends up getting her money back and also free apple pies.

RattsWoman,9,19,1pfxxn,89,"Ah, the age old argument of retail, the argument of whether or not the cashier gave the customer their change. Now, folks, I've had my fair share of trying ordeals with customers, from being a victim of racism to being indirectly blamed for moldy raspberries, but last night's events takes the cake (so far, anyway).

I'll put the **tl;dr** up here because this is probably the lengthiest recount of events I've ever had:
**Tiny old lady angrily and violently accuses me of stealing her change; ends up being accused of stealing her own groceries.**

I'm at my register, putting through a customer's order, when I see a customer that I had just had maybe 10 minutes prior. She's tiny, feeble-looking in her over-sized parka and winter hat, and looks to be no younger than 85 years old. The items she placed on the belt were the exact same items she brought through earlier. I'm thinking, *Maybe she forgot that she bought these items already* so when it's her turn, I smile and ask, ""Didja forget something?"" She immediately responds in anger with ""Yes! You didn't give me my change! I bought 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 items **slams each item on the belt as she counts* * and you asked me for a nickel [her total was $5.05] and I gave it to you along with twenty dollars to pay for this and you never gave me the receipt OR my change!""

I calmly inform that I did indeed give her her $15 change and she must have misplaced it, to which she angrily continues, ""No, you didn't! I'm not stupid! I went to the bank and got twenties in my wallet, and after I came through here, I have one less twenty and no change!"" This is when the next customer in line begins defending me, coolly saying ""Ma'am, you're not going to get what you want if you keep behaving this way"" and the old lady replies to her, ""You shut your mouth and mind your own business!"" I even ask the old lady if she's implying that I'm stupid enough to not give her her change. The defending customer keeps trying to calm the lady down and attempting to make her see reason, which is when this tiny little old lady yells at her (in her tiny old lady voice) ""**You don't shut up I'll punch you in the mouth! You bitch! Mind your own business! She didn't give me my money and you're being a bitch that's what you are!**"" At this point, I almost died because it was too hilarious but also kinda scary that I was even in this situation.

Old lady demands to speak to my manager about me, so I told her to go ahead, I'll call him for her if she'd like, meanwhile I'm very shaky and upset by this whole ordeal. She shuffles away to the service desk to complain some more, and my lane is shut down after helping my last, very helpful, customer in order for my tray to be audited. I was perfect. My superiors printed out the receipt to show the lady, and I resume working. 

From this point on, I'm not 100% sure of what happened because I was working and not involved with the actions taken afterward. I assume the old lady didn't believe the print-out, so they got the acting manager to review security camera footage. This lead to a comedy of errors. Acting Manager only reviewed the tape up to the most recent time the old lady was in my line. This footage showed her placing her items on the belt, then placing them back in her buggy and walking away after some time, making it look like I let her get away with stealing (so now I was in trouble), and that no actual transaction had taken place. As you can guess, little old lady was now accused of attempting to steal her $5.05 worth of groceries. I can only imagine how frustrated and infuriated she became, and acting manager had had enough at that point, told her, ""Ma'am there's nothing more I can do. You tried to steal these items, and no transaction took place between you and the cashier. If you want to call the police, then by all means, go ahead, but there is nothing I can do now."" 

I didn't see when she left, but when I went on my break, I was told that she was caught stealing. I became confused, and then realized that they didn't look far enough back in the tape, so I informed them of this. Of course, it showed me handing the lady her $15 change and her receipt all in one hand, so all's well that ends well. We all had a good laugh about this lady accusing me of stealing her money, and ends up being accused of stealing her own groceries. However, I was so rattled by this whole thing that I clocked out half an hour early by accident, only to be stopped by a supervisor asking me ""uhhh... where do you think you're going? I have you for another half an hour."" I laugh-cry and clock back in. 

The relief I felt when it was actually the end of my shift was indescribable, and I'm glad I'm not back in until end of this week.","""You don't shut up, I'll punch you in the mouth!"" - +85 year old tiny lady",108
YoshisIsland,4,10,1pfwsg,48,"After many years in retail I have finally escaped the shackles that bound me and have entered the work force (I have a cubicle and everything). 

As a last hoorah I give you one of the last amusing things that happened to me on the job.

---

One of our regular (and very annoying and cheap) customers came in with a return. She chose an item of the same value thinking she could make an exact exchange. Here's the thing - she used a coupon on the first item and our policy is that once you use a coupon it's gone (unless you exchange for the exact same item in a different color or size).

She proceeded to throw a huge fit - she grumbled about how unfair it was and argued with me as I continually told her I couldn't give her the coupon back. 

While I'm returning the item she inquires, ""so is this item still full price?"". I am suspicious. ""Yes ..."" I told her. (Let me stop and note that our store policy for returns without a receipt is current selling price in the form of a merchandise credit.) I am holding the receipt in my hand as I process the transaction and she has the audacity to say **""can't you just pretend I don't have my receipt and give me full price on a merchandise card?""**

I struggled not to laugh and instead put on my straightest face. ""That would be dishonest. I have your receipt in my hand."" She had paid half of the full price with the damn coupon! 

Anyway she angrily walked out with her friend as she loudly explained what had just happened. As soon as she was gone I laughed out loud and told my co-workers the story.

So long retail! ",Free at last! A final story,58
LivinLaVidaLoki,22,29,1pfv61,135,"I work at a very busy grocery store. Sundays are always the worst and almost every item gets completely wiped from the shelves by the time we close. Our cereal doesn't arrive until noon on Monday so the aisle is always extremely empty by that time. Today an angry woman (AW) approached me while I was stocking some Cheerios. Just from the look of her I could tell she had worked herself up into a little tiff. I took a deep breath and put on my retail face.

Me: ""Good afternoon, ma'am. How can I help you?""
AW: *angrily* ""Do you have REGULAR Frosted Flakes?! It's crazy how this store NEVER has ANYTHING that I want!""

I turned to look at the pallet of cereal I had yet to mark and put up and noticed that yes, I did have a box of regular Frosted Flakes. 

Me: ""Yes, ma'am, I do."" I go to move some of the boxes so I can get to them.
AW: ""WELL THAT'S JUST RIDICU-"" Her brain finally processes what I said. ""Oh. Um. Thanks, I'll take two.""

I handed her two and wished her a good day. An old woman who had watched the whole thing told me I had the patience of a saint.

So I work at a retail hobby store/chain (you should be able to guess it). I work in the RC department and day in day out deal with people who for some reason have paid nearly $1000 for a car only to not know who makes it or what model it is. So it's up to me and my colleagues to ""guess"" what car they have and find parts for it because they sure as hell don't bother to do any research and bring part numbers. But the ones that really get to me are the customers like I had today.  

Before I begin I'll give a little back story on myself. I'm going to school for electrical engineering as well as working on various IT certifications (currently CCNA), my other two friends that are working there are doing the same only one is just IT stuff and the other is programming and IT. I wasn't really well off growing up either so if I had something that broke or just wouldn't work it was basically up to me to trouble shoot and fix it myself, same with my friends, so I guess you could say we're not strangers to tools and fixing things.

Customer comes in and I start with my usual greeting ""You doin' alright? Anything I can help you with?"" Then it just goes down hill.

Customer: I need a screw.

Me: Ok, what size?

Customer: Long.

Me: Ok sir, I'm going to need a little more information than that to help you. (We have a vast array of screws.) What are you using it on? Does it go through metal? Plastic? Is it for a specific car? Is it for wood? Do you need course thread or machine thread?

Customer: OK. (Proceeds to stare blankly at me.)

Me: Ok, let's start with this, do you need standard or metric?

Customer: Yes.

Me: Both?

Customer: What?

Me: US OR JAPAN SCREW?

Customer: Oh, japan.

Me: Ok cool, about how many millimeters?

Customer: 3 or 4 inches.

Me:.... That really wasn't... well... hmmm....

IAMgrampas_diaperAMA,82,118,1pfpi5,431,"I work as a pharmaceutical technician at a popular drugstore chain and our store is VERY high volume. We are situated in suburbia and are the primary pharmacy for 3 old folks' homes in the area so the level of entitlement amongst our customers is enormous. 

I have experience as a cashier and a technician so on this particular Saturday (our busiest day of the week) I was working an 8 hour shift at the register. Saturdays we have two registers open but seeing as I'm the only cashier, I put a sign that says ""closed"" at Counter 2 so that people will line up at Counter 1 and I'm not running back and forth and having to deal with ""who was first"" situations (a fucking nightmare, you would think these people are children).

Right, so I'm serving a client at Register 1 and an elderly woman strolls up to Register 2, completely disregarding the ""closed"" sign. At this point in my shift, I only have one client at Register 1. We are waiting for my manager to come over and do a refund for her.

While waiting for my manager to come, I go over to Register 2 and put the sign to the side and ask ""how can I help you?""

Old Lady: I called in a prescription

**manager arrives**

**Me to my manager**: I just need you to do a refund for this customer over here please.

**Old Lady**: Excuse me, are you serving her or me?

She was actually visibly ANGRY that I had spoken to my manager instead of seamlessly continuing the transaction with her, the client. I was so shocked by this that I literally stared at her for a solid 10 seconds.

**OL**: I SAID, are you serving her or me?

**Me**: How can I help you?

**OL**: Oh my god. I told you I called in a prescription

**Me**: Okay, what is your name?

**OL**: ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I JUST TOLD YOU!

At this point, I have people lining up behind both customers at both counters (the situation I wanted to AVOID IN THE FIRST PLACE). So I'm getting really fucking agitated which is not like me, but I was 5 hours into my shift and tired and hungry. So I snapped.

**Me**: No, you DIDN'T actually.

At this point, her husband and two other customers behind this old lady go **OOOOOOHHHH!!!**, like I'd made some huge dis towards this woman. I swear to god.

Her husband walks up to the counter and goes

**Husband**: ""You really need to change your attitude. Why don't you put a smile on your face for a start?""

Now keep in mind that my manager has been standing here the whole time, seeing this woman being a complete bitch to me. So manager takes over old lady's transaction while I go back to Register 1, shaking. Not before looking at the husband straight in the eyes and saying dramatically 

""**Never** for you.""

I am not a comedically timely person or witty by any means but my manager almost died laughing right there. Both of them went off on a rant about how they were going to change pharmacies and how I needed to get an attitude adjustment and how dare I. My manager assured them I would get reprimanded and they left grumbling to themselves.

I asked my manager if I was really going to get in trouble for what I said and she said

""I have no fucking clue what just happened so I'm going to walk away and forget about it.""

I've posted a few stories on here and I'd like to tell you guys about my shift today.

I work service desk under a blue light. Service desk consists of doing refunds, returns, and exchanges, supervising the cashiers, handling complaints, and answering the phones. 

______

My stories today are about the weird phone conversations I've had today.

The first phone conversation I had was right at the start of my shift. I got on a noon, and the phone rang at about 12:05. We'll call this guy Angry Johanna Guy, or AJG for short.

&gt;Me: Hello, [store]. This is Obscurethestorm, how can I help you?

&gt;AJG: Can I speak with Johanna?

&gt;Me: Yes sir, please hold.

So I page Johanna, who works in our cash office, and she didn't respond. So I called the cash office line directly to see if she's back there.

The phone rings.

&gt;Me: Hello, [store]. This is Obscurethestorm, how can I help you?

&gt;AJG: Yeah, I was on the phone a second ago and the line disconnected. I was calling for Johanna.

&gt;Me: Yes sir, I remember. I'm still trying to get a hold of her, she didn't answer her phone. If you'll just hold a little more, I'll try to find her.

&gt;AJG: *humph* Okay.

So I put him on hold again. It's been maybe a minute and a half since he called the first time, and sometimes our phones disconnect, because they're old and corporate wont update our technology. It happens, no big deal.

I start looking for Johanna again. I page her over the intercom and I call the main office, which is right next to the cash office, thinking that she might be in there. Another minute passes, still no answer, and the line is still on hold so I know she hasn't picked up. I decide that I'm going to call for a manager and see if they can find her.

The phone rings.

&gt;Me: Hello, [store]. This is Obscurethestorm, how can I help you?

&gt;AJG: Uhm, yeah. I was calling for Johanna, are you fuckheads going to find her, or are you going to fucking keep me on hold all fucking day?

&gt;Me: We are doing our best to find her sir, but she isn't responding to any pages or answering the phone in the cash office.

&gt;AJG: SHE SHOULD BE DONE WITH CASH BY 11:30!

&gt;Me: Okay, well I don't work in the offices, so I don't know her schedule.

&gt;AJG: WELL I FUCKING DO SHE ISN'T IN CASH, JUST FUCKING FIND HER.

&gt;Me: Sir, I'd appreciate it if you changed your tone and stopped cussing at me. It's really unneeded. 

&gt;AJG: JUST FUCKING FIND JOHANNA.

So I put him on hold and call a manager up front. My manager today is a really sweet girl a few years older than I am (I'm 18, she's maybe 22)

&gt;Manager: Whats the problem?

&gt;Me: There is a guy who was on line one, then line two, and now line one again who is calling for Johanna. He's been on hold for maybe 4 minutes all together and has now started cussing at me and I'm not dealing with it.

&gt;Manager: O.o Okay, I'll take care of it.


&gt;Manager: Sir, hello, this is [Manager]. We are working on finding Johanna for you, but she isn't responding to our pages or calls. It's possible she's on lunch.

&gt;AJG: NO, SHE FUCKING GOT OFF LUNCH AT 12. SHE SHOULD BE BACK BY NOW.

&gt;Manager: Well, we are trying to find her, so please hold.

My manager eventually found her, still on lunch, and had her answer the call. It was really bizarre, and we think it was her husband, which makes it sad because he sounded really angry. 

_____________

My second story starts much like my first: with the phone ringing. We will call this man Lawn and Garden, or LG for short. I know this is a different man by the way the voices sounded. It was about 2:30 when this guy called.

&gt;Me: Hello, [store]. This is Obscurethestorm, how can I help you?

&gt;LG: Uhm, yes, Lawn and Garden please.

&gt;Me: Okay, please hold while I transfer you.

So I put this guy on hold and page for someone to pick the phone up. We don't actually have a transfer system, just four phone lines that we walkie talkie each other to pick up. So I ask for someone to answer line one for Lawn and Garden.

Minutes pass. The phone rings.

&gt;Me: Hello, [store]. This is Obscurethestorm, how can I help you?

&gt;LG: Yes, I called a minute ago and a kid answered the phone and then FUCKING put me back on hold! I've been on the GODDAMN hold for like five FUCKING minutes already!

&gt;Me: Sorry about that sir. What was your question?

&gt;LG: ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED? MY FUCKING QUESTION. WAS IF YOU HAVE. [insert some soil product here].

I'm normally a patient person, but I've honestly had a shitty day for a lot of reasons, and I'm tired of assholes yelling at me over the phone. If you're gonna speak to me like I'm an idiot, I'm going to speak to you like you're a child.

&gt;Me, in that condescending ""I know everything and you know nothing"" tone: Well, sir, he's probably *looking* to make sure that we actually *have* that soil in *stock* so that you can come to the store and *buy* it but not have to waste your time. Sopleasehold.

So I put him on hold and the guy who answered the phone (the current manager on duty (managers changed at 2)) comes over the walkie. 

&gt;Manager: So the guy who was for lawn and garden isn't there any more. I think he might have disconnected.

&gt;Me: Nope, he's on line two now, and he's screaming curse words at me so I'm gonna let you handle it.

&gt;Manager: *Fantastic.*

So that was my shift today. Not to mention we had a no call no show so I had to stay an extra hour until a replacement was found. So that was awesome after being yelled at basically all shift, in person and over the phone. I **LOVE** the people I work with and my actual job, but I **HATE** customers with a passion.

whatkindoffuckery,29,45,1pflae,180,"I work the front end at a pharmacy. We're a smaller store and generally only have one person up front for a couple hours in the morning. 

So enter Mr.Impatient. He comes in regularly and gets upset if he even has to wait behind another customer. He will literally insert himself not even two inches away from another customer if they dont get out of the way in time.
So he comes in, Im by myself, and Im assisting a regular customer down one of the back aisles. She wants to know if we have a certain product in the back. He sees me and starts motioning for me to come there. I explain to him that Im helping another customer and that Ill be there in a minute. 
He screams that he doesnt have a minute. I explain again that Im helping another customer and that Ill be there in a moment. 
So I check for the product, we dont have it, so I go to check him out. He asks me all the information he'd need for a complaint. Then the price on his item has gone up and he questions it while staring at me like I personally did this. I explain that the price has changed and he continues staring like I personally did it. I tell him blankly that the price changed, I cant mark these items up and he says ""I didnt say you did"" in a condescending tone. 

When he left, the woman that I was helping before him said that he does this at the store she works at and once yelled at her for not helping him while she was leaving and off the clock.

caticorns,15,39,1pfim4,128,"As you all know by now, I work in the deli department of a grocery store. Big whoop.

Last night, I stopped by my store to pick up a few groceries. As I walked in, a cashier, we'll call him R, waves for me to come over to him. He then tells me a lovely tale.

He first asks me about one of my fellow deli associates, Drunk Idiot, or DI. I confirm her name and whatnot with him. He tells me that earlier in the evening, she went through the self-check out lane with some beer. She scanned it, R checked her ID, and went to help another customer. A few seconds went by, and another customer went through the lane that DI had gone through. The customer flags down R, asking why there was beer on her screen, when she didn't buy any. Red flag. Then the customer R was previously assisting pipes up, ""Yeah, that lady just walked out of the store with a case of beer!"" DI had stolen beer. 

A little background here: DI is an absolute moron. She steals all the time from our department, and despite us telling management, nothing ever happens with her. 

I ask R what's going to happen to her, and he tells me that his immediate supervisor said they'll take care of her in the morning. 

So, I'm doing my shopping, and I swing by the deli department to get myself a salad, and who do I happen to see? DI. She waves and chats me up, and I just kind of do my awkward, ""Sorry I've got to go"" spiel, and rush to the front to tell R that she's still in the store. 

I inform R, and he tells his supervisor. At this point, I have this huge adrenaline rush going on. 

So I leave the store, go home, enjoy my food.

Around 10:30, my co-worker, E, who was on break when I came by, calls me. She knew about the whole beer incident. I ask her what happened to DI. Management told her to pay for it, and she was fine. 

What the hell? How is that in any way fair? She had no intention of paying for it, but hey, it's fine, as long as you paid for the stuff **you already have in your car**, it's no big deal.

Normally, in this situation, I would ask the customer to place the basket in the front of the cash where our front-end customer serviceman will bring the cart along to pick them up.

Me: Could you put your basket in front of the cash on the floor please?

notmyfaultyousuck,36,46,1peoo0,169,"**Background:** I work as a cashier in a small town grocery store, where yes the prices are expensive but that’s because it’s a small town and the next nearest grocery store is 15 minutes away by car. Take it or leave it.

Either way, I have been working at this grocery store for over 5 years now and there is this one customer who is absolutely dreadful to deal with. Every time he comes in he huffs around the store complaining, speaking rudely to the cashiers and being genuinely annoying.

About three weeks ago, he came in and wanted to return two empty 18.5L water bottles for two new ones, not a problem whatsoever. However, my co-worker who was in the express counter with me that day spoke French as her first language and misunderstood this English speaking customer. She did the return without charging him for new water bottles and this man erupted in anger. He began yelling at her, leaning over the counter so his face was right in front of hers and was calling her “uneducated because she can’t understand simple mathematics”. She ran into the back of the store and started crying.

I went up to the store manager after the incident with my co-worker and gave a detailed account of what happened and a description of what he looked like. My store manager said he would handle the situation next time he came in and was pointed out to him.

It’s been three weeks, and this man has been on a rampage every single day (because he shops at our store every. single. day.) and needless to say, none of the cashiers want to deal with him and my boss has done nothing about him (despite having pointed him out more than once). This customer yells at us over prices, loud enough to draw attention to himself and he treats us disrespectfully by saying: “I spend so much money here I might as well just pay your salary from my own damn pocket”. 

When I tell my boss I don’t want to deal with being treated that way any more, he just says that he has it under control and he’ll deal with it. I’m frustrated because that man gets under my skin every shift and nothing is being done.

LameCake,6,7,1peha3,40,"I work at a children's entertainment facility that allows people to have birthday parties and a private room for a pretty low price. My party for the day had shown up, and according to the books, they were expecting about 20 children. The birthday boys were twins, this is relevant. 


The mom shows up with her twin boys and a few other guests. I show them back to their room, the biggest one, and the mom exclaims that it’s a very big room. I ask how many more people she is expecting, and she tells me about 8 more. So oh well, not the 20 people we were expecting, and I have a big room to clean afterwards, no biggie. I get the drinks out, and I’m conversing with the guests, when the mom asks if it’s 8 guests that she’s paying for, and the two birthday boys and two parents that are free (this is to participate in the games). At our company the birthday child(ren) are included in the 8 guests for the base price, and each person after that is $20.  I explain this to her, and she says the person who booked her party told her differently. I tell her that it has always been the the birthday children are included in the 8 guests, and it could have been a misunderstanding. I say this all in my nice hostess voice, and she says okay, and I head to the front to great any more party guests. 


The mom comes up after some time with a guy, who I assume is the dad. She asks for my co-worker who happened to be in the party room stocking plates and cups when my conversation with the mom took place. He goes out there and the dad tells him that they were told that the birthday boys would be free, and that they weren't told that they would have to pay for them too. All the while the dad is exclaiming that this is bull shit, but not a big deal...wtf?; and that they just want to get back to enjoying their party. If it’s not a big deal, then why is he making a big deal? I understand wanting to clear it up, but he came on kind of aggressive, in very hushed tones, and a big ground standing, this is what we were told attitude. I knew I was doomed right then, no tip for me. My co-worker directs them to our manager, and he tells them the same thing, but will call the person who booked the party, whom is the owner.


Now lately there have been some mistakes on cake orders made by him, as well as names of parties, but I don’t think he would actually tell a person that the birthday kids are free, as this has **NEVER** been policy. He usually explains in great lengths what is to be expected in what they are paying for.


The owner says no, this is not what he told them, and even explained that it would be the two boys and six guests for the base price and $20 each person after. He caves a little and says instead of having to pay for two birthday children, to just combine it to one. Great now we are at 8. Since I am still confused as to how many people are showing up, and the first game is about to go in, with still only 9 guests, I go back and ask the mom how many people in total, again. She say 15. Since this greatly affects how many pizzas I make, I make four pizzas. With 9 guests I should only make 3. Guess what, no one else shows up.


The manager tries to tell the mom what’s going to happen now, but she doesn't want to hear it, and to just tell the dad. I end up telling the dad after I serve everyone pizza, that instead of having to pay for two children, the we’ll just combine it to one. He shakes his head and says whatever a couple of times, in a  don’t want to hear it demeanor. Okaaaayyyyy. I’m sorry that your expectations were miscommunicated, but this is how it works. In any case, you **HAVE** to pay for a minimum 8 guests, so even if the owner decided to say don’t charge for the birthday boys, they would have paid the same exact price because it would have been 7 guests. The rest of the party goes without a hitch, and the children were actually some of the best children I've had. Paying for the bill time comes and no tip.

BigMacisBP,46,15,1pegr1,74,"TFR, I need your input on something. I may or may not have been that asshole customer this past weekend and I need some input on what happened.

Saturday I was sent out with list of honey-do's while my hubby was at work. One of them was to pick up a few items (corn syrup, food coloring and some sparkling cider, because srsly, sparkling cider)from the store for a zombie crawl that we were going to that night. I managed to find a lane that was not too terribly overwhelmed with people, maybe three or four parties, each group with less than 10-15 items a piece. In my wait I noticed two managers standing a bit away from me in women's softlines. Both of them were quite literally leaning on a rack of clothes shooting the breeze. Now, I happened to work for this particular company in the past and currently being a manager at my current company I found it annoying to see the two of them doing effectively nothing but wasting oxygen. I put it out of my mind until I was second in line, approximately three to five minutes later, when the cashier says to the party in front of me that they would need to pay with a card as she did not have cash in her drawer to make change. I asked her if she in fact had said that she had no cash in her drawer and that she was only able to accept cards, to which she confirmed. 

Now, my first thought was I admit why the hell didn't she say anything sooner or have a sign up, but I took stock of the lanes and realized that the store actually had more lanes open than was normal and all of them were at least 4-5 people deep, so I backed off and gave the cashier credit for moving people along as fast as she could. However, as I turned my sights fell to the two managers who were still shooting the breeze. And I kinda slipped off my rocker a little bit. I walked up to the two of them and in my most pleasant voice simply said:

""Excuse me, while the two of you are standing here, holding this rack of clothes down and making sure it doesn't float away, your cashier over on 26 has no cash in here drawer and the department you are standing in needs help with its zoning.""

I turned on my heel and walked away. To which they hollered after me:

""Thanks sir, we'll take care of it.""

I walked to the end of the store to find another register. Another 10 minutes later I am walking out and low and behold the two of them are still standing there, ensuring that the laws of gravity over that one rack of clothes didn't suddenly cease to exist. 

So TFR, was I out of line for calling the managers out like that? And for those who would interject that I didn't know what they were talking about, I know what shooting the breeze looks like and these two were armed with bazookas.

abbeyinreallife,25,22,1pe61d,135,"Hi everyone, I'm new here but you'll probably end up hearing from me on a regular basis! 

I was recently hired into my first retail job at your friendly neighborhood fabric and craft store. I haven't come across too many post-worthy stories, but this one I wanted to share.

I was working at the fabric section on this particular day, and I was putting away bolts of fabric. When guests come up and want fabric cut, we cut it for them and then put the bolt in these cube-shaped carts behind us. These carts look absolutely nothing like shopping carts and are not meant for guest use.

 I was using one of those carts to transport fabric around as I was putting it away. I had quite a few bolts left in it, when a guest pulled me away to help her find something. I was gone for maybe 2 minutes, only a few feet from my cart. I started walking back to finish my job, and gasped. A woman dumped all of my fabric onto the floor and kicked it to the side in a messy heap, and was loading her snuggle flannel into it as a shopping cart.

I was speechless. I needed the cart back because I couldn't carry all of the bolts in my arms, but I just didn't know what to say without yelling in her face. I wish I could've said something to her but all that came out of my mouth was a guttural ""uhhhhh..."" noise as I looked her in the eye and gestured to my disarray of bolts. Instead of acknowledging the message I was trying to convey to her, she asked me if I would cut fat quarters out of our bolts for her. When I said no, we only cut by the yard and not just CHUNKS out of our fabric, she proceeded to have a hissy fit and storm away. With my cart.

I have this guest who comes in relatively frequently who we will call Vegetarian Maniac (VM). He's not overtly rude, it's just that he says things that are out of place. This is how our first conversation went.


Me: Hi, can I help you find something?

VM: Are you a vegetarian too?!?!?!

Me: ...no, I am not, sir.

VM: Oh, well you should try it! I can barely keep weight on because of it.

Me: Alright well thanks for the advice, have a good day sir.


So I walk away from this thinking, ""Well that was strange. At least I will probably never see him again since we don't carry a ton of healthy products."" But, no, I could never be that lucky. Here's how another one of our interactions went down.

VM: Man, every time I see you I keep thinking you're gonna go on a diet!

Despite being a small store, we get quite a bit of business due to the fact that we are located literally right beyond the cash registers - You absolutely cannot miss us if you exit the store.

Anyway, our store closes at 9pm sharp which causes some confusion because our host store closes at midnight.

Yesterday, I had just closed the store, which involves pulling in all of the displays as well as putting the gate across the front, but not locking it. To a normal person, we looked 100% closed.

redstarpirate,156,59,1pe1gs,186,"Hello again, 

The title is basically the format for one of the most annoying phrases I hear in my Sydney Cafe workplace. 

Now, I'm very aware of the seriousness of actual allergies. Years of experience in hospitality, food safety training, and some now outdated high school Army cadet medic training has made me the food safety gestapo of my workplace.

So when a customer comes in with a special request, often what would would amount to a personal preference, yet adds ""I'm allergic to it"", I'm torn as to whether I should press them for details. You'll see why. 


**I'm allergic to colours:**

One of the Sydney trends at the moment is to make ""Babycinos"" for kids. It's just frothed milk with some choc powder on top in an espresso cup. Often with a marshmallow on the saucer to appease a kid's sweet tooth. The allergy, you might ask? 

Pink marshmallows. The words from the little terror's mother's mouth ""He's allergic to the pink ones."" 

I'm aware there could be allergies to food colouring, some preservatives and the like, but feel free to let your server know if there's serious risk of an incident, or if your son will throw a tantrum because his treat was the wrong colour. 

That family needs a post of their own, by the way.

**I'm allergic to combinations of food ingredients:**

Some things aren't to my taste, often it's specific ingredients that when added heavily or not balanced with others seem overwhelming. Personal taste is just that. 

But, ""I'm allergic to pesto."" 

Is it the parsley? The garlic? The olive oil? 

Seriously? Some of the ingredients used to grill and flavour the chicken breast in that dish are used as components in pesto. 

**""I'm allergic to not being on a fad diet""**

Coeliac Disease. A condition that affects far more people than science and medicine has yet to discover, apparently. Of the dozens of people a year who come in and claim they have an allergy to gluten, not one of them has used the correct term for it.

The actual rarity of Coeliac disease makes me wonder if we actually attract most of Sydney's Coeliac population despite not having a gluten free option on the menu. 


There's not much to say about the actual dangers of allergies. They can kill and they are taken seriously by the industry. But those who live with the actual dangers of anaphylaxis or even severe discomfort or poisoning, know that they need to be very specific about what they cannot be in contact with.

FredFltStn,170,534,1pdzxx,1353,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven.

**STORY:**  I think this week I'm going to focus on stories about people who try to scam me. They rarely get away with it, but that sure doesn't stop them from trying.

We had two customers that came into the store and announced to the cashier that they were looking to spend around $1000 and wanted to pick up a lot of fireworks. My dad greeted them and offered to show them around.

Dad went through the spiel and started showing them videos and helping them out. The entire time, these two were trying to work a better deal. I know most people don’t try to haggle when shopping at their local Target store, but hey, I get it, it's a fireworks tent, and the truth is we usually are willing to haggle a bit, especially if you’re picking up a lot of stuff. These guys definitely took it to the next level.

My dad is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet, but this type of thing wears on him pretty fast, especially when someone is obviously going over the top. It’s one thing to offer a lower amount for an item, but when you start criticizing the products or my store, my dad is going to quickly lose interest in helping you.

After about 30 minutes of this, I could see dad was pretty much over these guys, so I walked up and told them that if they were going to pick up a lot of stuff, we would just give them 20% off their total order. They immediately protested that that wasn’t good enough, but I was pretty firm. I already know that I’m cheaper than anyone else, and 20% is a substantial discount. Hell, the only reason I did 20% is because my dad was tired of dealing with them and I wanted to get them out of the store.

The guys finish picking out their stuff and go to check out. They fill out the liability waiver, and the cashier starts to ring in their stuff. After the cashier rings in their purchase, she waves me down, and I walked over to the counter to see what the issue was.

Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dumber (TD) were trying to pay with two $500 gift certificates. Now I give away a LOT of gift certificates on the radio and during sales promotions. The thing is, I only give away $50 gift certificates. These two idiots have obviously photocopied and altered a real gift certificate, and are trying to pass it off.

Now I’m pissed.

**ME:**  This is the worst forgery I’ve ever seen. You guys are idiots.

**TD1:**  I won those on the radio. They’re real.

**ME:**  My gift certificates are printed on custom paper, and I only issue $50 Gift Certificates. These are colored scans of a gift certificate and they’re not real.

**TD1:**  Yes they are!

**TD2:**  Besides, if you’re gift certificates don’t say no reproductions on them, you can make copies.

**ME:**  Yeah, that’s not what the law says. What the law DOES say is that you’re guilty of 3rd Degree Felony Theft for trying to steal $1300 of fireworks (their amount before the 20% discount).

**TD1:**  We didn’t try to steal anything!

**ME:**  You attempted to pay with a forged document. It’s the same as if you used a stolen credit card. I have your name, address, and multiple witnesses, and I fully intent to press charges. You guys can stay until the cops arrive, or they can arrest you at home, doesn’t matter to me.

**TD1:**  That’s not real. We didn’t steal anything.

**ME:**  Oh, because the last two times this has happened at my store (never actually happened before), the people were arrested and convicted of theft. I guess we’ll let the police sort it out. If you can’t pay for the fireworks, it’s theft.

TD1 and TD2 start an intense negotiation between themselves that involves more than a little shouting at each other. After a while, they insist that I’m wrong, but they’re willing to pay with a credit card just to be done with it. 

They’re trying to figure out how to split up the $1000 when I informed them that the total was $1300. There’s no way in hell I was giving them a 20% discount after they tried to scam me.

In the end, they only paid for and received around $600 of fireworks, and they had to split the charges over four credit cards between them to do that. We were very careful with the signatures and I made the cashier copy down their driver’s license numbers, just in case they tried to dispute the charges. 

To be honest, I would have just let them leave if they had tried. It's not really worth my time or effort to press it, and I was actually just making it up as I went along because they pissed me off.

They definitely didn’t leave happy. My dad couldn’t resist when they were walking out.

**DAD:**  You dumbasses come back and see us again next year.

They haven’t been back.

Despite two enormous easel type signs by each of the stores entrances, another large sign right when you walk in the front, and smaller signs taped to every door and scattered throughout the store, I still get at least four customers every shift asking 'what is going on'. Oh, it isn't like the store is fully stocked either. As soon as you walk in, you can see that signs have been removed, displays are gone, and shelves are near empty. Not to mention most of the service departments have already shut down.

JealousyGrey,15,48,1pdxfe,233,"So I seem to see a lot of posts complaining about incompetant coworkers, but not quite as many focused on giving them kudos. So to give some appreciation to one of our fellow under appreciated retail brothers, I am going to rant about a guy I shall call Ian.

Ian is a fairly nondescript guy in his thirties who was hired a little later than I was almost a year ago. I don't know much about him outside of work, but he spent some time in the military (relevant), and goes to the same community college I do. 

He is one of the nicest, friendliest people I have ever met. Because he was in the military recently, he follows every direction given to him by the managers. They love him for this, because they can tell him to do anything and they know it will get done. He is often taken advantage of, but if you ask him he would say he doesn't mind, and he would mean it.

This guy has stepped up to the plate time and time again, going from cashier to customer service to electronics, but he helps out wherever he's needed. I'm especially fond of him because he thinks nothing of running back and forth from electronics to customer service to help me out when he sees I'm struggling. (I'm new to CS, so this is often.) Even though he was hired after me, he knows almost everything there is to know about the three places he's worked in, and a few things about the departments he hasn't.

Ian is also AMAZING with customers. He is soft spoken and even-toned, through even the most stubborn, angry, and belligerent people. You seriously cannot faze this guy. 

You know those times when you know there is nothing you or anyone else in the store can do to help the person, yet they refuse to accept they're wrong? Then you have to pretend like you're doing everything in your power to help them, and Ian is the ultimate service associate. He goes through all the inventory logs, looks up the item number, upc, goes to the store website, anything it takes.

Example (the reason I'm writing this actually): A woman comes in with a flat antenna she says she purchased in our store. She has no receipt, and doesn't know when she bought it or if she payed with one of her many cards, so we can't look one up. Since it is policy to get all electronics checked out by an electronics associate before they can be returned, I call Ian up. He looks it over, okays it, but when I begin to process it as a no receipt return, it comes up as not in the system. 

Ian and I both know that without a receipt, there is nothing a manager can do, so we don't bother calling one. Instead, while I deal with the massive line that built up, Ian looks up the product in the computer system, it's not there. It's not just Not On File, it's never been on file with the home office. But this woman is POSITIVE she bought it in our store. She remembers what the display looked like and everything! She doesn't understand why we can't just look back to what turns out to be LAST CHRISTMAS (we have a 90 day return policy) and look up our inventory from that time! But Ian takes it like a champ, and looks up the item on the store website. It turns out the item is sold through a third party vendor through our site, so it wouldn't be on file anyway, since she actually ordered it online. Long story short, Ian gets this formerly angry and stubborn woman to leave unsure and apologetic, with the customer service information for the third party vendor in hand, in less than 10 minutes. Without once getting visibly annoyed or frustrated, this guy was zen. (Afterwards, of course we broke out in laughter because with some customers, it's all you can do).

 It turns out he saw some Lilly's on the clearance section and decided that because they were reduced from £5 to £2.50 that the ones NOT in the clearance section should be the same price.

They get over to the Lilly's and then the guy goes mental about how the same product shouldn't be different prices, my manager calmly explains that it's because the Lilly's he saw in clearance had already bloomed hence them being reduced. 

The argument went on and on with the guy hurling abuse at my manager for about 10 minutes, meanwhile a small crowd had gathered next to me as I was hiding in the bamboo watching this all unfold, at this point my manger lost it and began shouting back at him!

jennifersalome,4,16,1pdki9,55,"I have this coworker, ""Betty"", who I'm trying to like. I've had my annoyances with her before, but I'm trying. (I think) She's trying. Our manager is pretty good with her, but sometimes I feel like her second in command because I have a good head on my shoulders when dealing with this associate... most of the time.

I'm talking to our manager (let's call her Joann) and I get a call in my department. It's my coworker, Betty. She starts telling Joann what's going on in the department she's working in (which isn't her home dept. either.) and Joann is getting visibly frustrated. Note that all of this could have been solved if Joann had gone there herself, but it was at the end of her shift and talking about another issue with myself was probably getting her frustrated. (An irrelevant issue.) Instead, Joann sends me down to help Betty.

A customer is trying to return a sweater that was damaged when she bought it. The way Betty made it sound was that we did not have this sweater and was telling the customer she had to go back to the other store where she bought it. I do not work in this department. I don't even hang around there or do recovery there. Betty probably spends more time there than me. In order to issue a proper return, I'd need a combination of her credit card and a UPC. The customer is very frustrated, stating that she thought a manager was coming down to help. I am not a manager. Joann is, but she sent me down. Oy vey.

So I round up a similar sweater and issue the return. I made sure the price going back on the card was close to what she said she paid. I override it because I don't want a shitstorm coming down on me on something I was just thrown into.

Turns out, not far from the wrap stand is an outpost of the sweater this customer was trying to return. She says to her, ""You seriously couldn't look around 4 feet?"" and she's pretty mad. I mean, I just took Betty's word for it and I felt really bad (Betty was even looking it up in our search system for it.) The customer even said to me, ""It's not your fault, you don't work in this department."" I don't know what Betty said to her. The customer then buys a couple replacement sweaters (which I discounted) and leaves. Betty says nothing. I shrug because what the Hell else am I supposed to do?

I went to try and find Joann, but I didn't see her for the rest of the shift. I know she doesn't have a lot of faith in Betty, either, but we're trying.

Okay guys, I need to vent. I have dyslexia and was asked to count down a till today. It takes me twice as long to count it, because I have difficulty adding numbers, but I digress. Today I had customers constantly interrupt me and ask me to price check items for them. I naturally have to refuse, as my cash codes are currently being used on my till. They don't seem to understand we have other priorities beyond scanning bedding for them. 

Worst of all, my coworker decides it would be appropriate to keep coming over to my register to ask me redundant questions, thereby further delaying the count. I want to slap some sense into her SO badly. /r

ChiefMishka,5,8,1pd8f9,24,"A department store is the locale for the story. I've been working at this store for a year this coming black friday (my second day was black friday last year) but enough about me. This is about a co-worker whose name shall simply be UE for Useless Employee.

UE is the type of worker you see come through in all lines of work. Tries really hard to make it look like he is contributing but really doesn't do that much and every night you close with them you consider yourself a person down. This one however seems to exhibit not a single working brain cell. So aside from the usual things this type of worker might do in any job to make it look like they are working hard I thought I might list some of the special cases that have arisen during the few months I have worked with this person.

UE takes a call from a person who is asking if we carry suits. While we don't sell sets we do have all the individual items; suit jackets, suit pants, dress shirts, ties, dress socks, dress shoes, etc. UE however jumps to the conclusion that the customer is only interested in a package that contains everything the customer might need and proceeds to tell the customer ""no, we don't have suits.""

UE is on a register. Personally I would rather have UE there than on the floor because he is slow and always misses stacks of clothes that need to be folded so one of us usually has to come along after UE is done and double check everything. UE got a customer one day who wanted to return a suitcase. Customer had the receipt so there wasn't a big problem with that. Our return policy is that we can return it to the method of payment made. If the customer paid with a credit card we return it to that card, gift card goes back to a gift card, cash or check or debit card is given as cash. The customer made the purchase with credit card and UE gave him cash for the return (which was a hundred or so dollars). Mistake number one. Mistake number two came when the customer then comes back to UE with a new suitcase trying to get a new suitcase but the customer wanted to exchange the suitcase they just returned for the suitcase they picked out. So UE is having difficulty completing an exchange for the suitcase because the system shows that the suitcase being exchanged was already returned (10 minutes earlier by UE).

We have a store credit card that we are constantly told to ask customers if they would like to sign up for. We require photo ID to enter the customers information into our system and verify they are who they say they are. I have heard UE asking the customer for this information out loud and wondered why when he could just read it off the ID. I only recently learned that he has been known to not get an ID and just ask for all the information.

Here's the story that prompted me to write this post. I'm working at the register but with no one in line I am just folding and separating returns as we were closing in an hour or so. Both UE and another coworker (well call him Ryan) were cleaning the floor and talking about 30 feet away from myself. It was far enough that I couldn't hear exactly what they were discussing but as a customer and her child (younger than 10) walked by I did hear this

Ryan: ""I apologize for UE Ma'am.""

Customer: ""Oh, don't worry. I hear far worse from my kids.""

The customer and her child walk casually towards the doors and I wish them a good evening. UE goes off to do something unproductive and Ryan comes over and asks me if I heard what UE had said. I hadn't and he was relieved because he wanted to know if anyone else outside of those 5-10 feet had heard it. UE had (in their discussion) pointed to his show and said ""This fucking thing"" loud enough that the customer had heard. This saint of a woman however simply shrugged it off and was not bothered by it one bit. UE had gotten very lucky that is wasn't one of the other thousands of customers that would have immediately asked for UE's name and a manager, or that it was a manager who walked past.",A Useless Co-worker,32

MycroftNext,25,23,1pcrxd,113,"I worked in a liquor store on and off through university (previously mentioned [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1mm1si/doing_my_piece_to_stop_drinking_and_driving/). Thanks everyone for being so nice!).  /u/Gwappa's [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1paaw5/i_assumed_you_knew_where_it_was_since_you_work/) reminded me of trying to help people how to find wine.

Now, I don't mind helping pick something out. It was one of the most interesting parts of the job, and being as I started working there when I was 19, I learned a lot about wine as I went. But here was a regular conversation I'd have at least once a month:

Customer: ""I'm looking for a bottle of wine I had a month ago. It had a purple label.""

Me: ""OK, do you know what kind of wine it is?"" (thinking they'd say something like merlot or chardonnay)

Customer: ""I think it was red wine.""

[Here we go.](http://i.imgur.com/wYpO0Lb.gif)

Me: ""Okay, do you know where it's from?"" I'd ask this a lot because our wines were sorted by region. It was a fast way to narrow down choices if you were browsing, and it really supported local wines.

Customer: ""Uh, no. But I think it was about $15 at the government store.""

[Uh-huh.](http://i.imgur.com/n6ivOlC.gif)

I worked in a private store. We were non-unionized and open longer hours than the government store. Everything was more expensive in our store, but not to a reliable degree. I had no idea what a government $15 wine would be in our store.

And finally, the hail Mary.

Me: ""Do you remember anything that was on the label? Maybe a picture or an animal?""

Customer: ""Oh yeah! It had a vineyard on the front! Do you have that kind?""

You know, *that* wine. [The one with a vineyard on the label.](http://i.imgur.com/mOz6aUB.gif)

Me: ""You know, we've got a few like that. Is it this one? It's really popular.""

Customer: ""Nope, not that one ... the purple I'm thinking of was more blue. And I think the label was an oval.""

Me: ""Was it this one? It's pretty new but I think it's gotten some press.""

Customer: ""What?! I don't even know what that is.""

Me: ""Hmmmm ... well, do you maybe want to come in and look around? Maybe you'll know it when you see it.""

At which point you, dear reader, think, hey! I didn't know they were on the phone! We weren't. This person would be [**IN THE DRIVE-THROUGH**](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/155/594/yesitis2.gif). They wanted to browse our wine section through the window, with a nice chat and 15 cars building up behind them full of the after-school rush, when parents most often swing by for a quick six pack.

But it wasn't completely horrible. Because every other time someone couldn't remember a wine, this would happen.

Customer: ""There's this wine; I can't remember what it was...""

Me: ""Was it Yellowtail Shiraz?""

Customer: ""YOU'RE A GENIUS!""

LP970,9,9,1pcnlf,23,"Most of the posts here seem to be about funny, quirky, or horrible people. I though you all could use a story of a lighter tone. 
So last week a (might I add, very attractive) woman came into the appliance department I work in. She was looking for a new dryer, and was very nice but had really no idea what she wanted. So we spent the best part of 20 minutes going over all the new features since she last purchased a dryer, and rather quickly started a conversation not appliance related. We probably talked for close to an hour. For any of you that have had an awesome customer that is content with a nice chat, it's quite lovely on a slow evening and makes the time pass quickly. Being a man that pays attention to details such as nail polish color and things, I made a mental note of things about her so I could remember her if she came back later.
Today she comes back, and I greet her like I just saw her yesterday. The funny part was she did the same. This time we taked business for about five minutes, and over the course of the next fourty five minutes, we talked and I finished her order (usually takes six minutes). Since I'm paid hourly, I don't care at all about taking that kind of time, and it helps the time pass faster. She never even lost interest in my speaking when I explained 3D printers to her and I ""nerded out"" for a bit. If anything (I was unaware of at the time) it turned her on a bit. 
We finish up her order and she leaves and my co-worker (female) comes over with this silly grin on her face and asks me when the customer and I are going out. I responded with something like ""she was interested in me? I'm totally oblivious to that sort of stuff, I litterally need someone directing me and saying it * waved hands like airplane traffic director *)"" My co-worker laughs and said something like ""wow, you are clueless, she was totally in to you. You should call her when you get off (she points to the phone number of the customer on the order still on my screen)"". I'm not sure if I should call her or not but the point of the tale is that eventually, despite all the assholes out there, you will get some really nice customers that will make your day go nicely.

I work as a cashier at a ""high end"" grocery store with a lot of specialty products.  

**Story:**
This one is a just a short story.  I seem to encounter a lot of ""weird"" customers, and this was one of those occasions.  
I started ringing up a customer (a man, probably late 30s, early 40s), smiled at him, and asked ""How are you?"" 
Now, asking this can be a bit of a risk.  I've had people glare at me and spit out, ""TERRIBLE"" or something similar.  But still, plenty more people actually thank me for asking and seem to warm up after I ask them how they are.  
The man I was currently helping, however, was apparently having a bad day.  Let's call him ""TM"" for ""Touchy Man.""

Me: ""How are you?""

TM: ""I'm FAT.""

bnkls,73,82,1pcccq,295,"I work as a fry cook and cashier for a pretty busy fast food chain restaurant. Ideally, we have at least four people while the dining room is open so that there's one person on every station but lately we've been really understaffed. From around 10 PM to 12 AM (when the dining room closes) they'll occasionally only leave us with three people, which makes our order times skyrocket and exhausts whichever unlucky three have to stay.

A few weeks ago there were only three of us working when we got a huge rush after a baseball game ended. We completely lost control and it was taking twenty minutes to get our front orders out, I don't even know how long the drive through was taking. Customers were shockingly forgiving about it (presumably because our home team won, if they lost I'm sure we would have had a riot) and eventually it slowed down enough for us to get everyone's orders out and close the dining room for the night.

After that was over we were all very stressed out but the grill guy seemed like he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He was leaning against the wall with his hand over his chest, breathing hard and complaining that his heart was beating rapidly and his chest hurt. I had already clocked out and just decided to chat with him for a moment to see if maybe it would calm him down and offer him a cigarette. He threatened to walk out or quit if he heard the drive thru beeping at us again, but he ended up staying for the rest of the graveyard shift. Apparently, our shift leader and the morning shift leader wrote him up for basically having a bad attitude and being lazy that night.

The next day he doesn't show up and on the schedule our managers have written in ""No call no show"" by his name and crossed out his shifts for the rest of the week. He comes in again about a week later and I ask him how he's doing, he tells me that he's doing pretty shitty and he's been to several doctors that week. He walks upstairs to talk to our manager and comes back out with an honest to god pink slip.

The other day he came in and was leaving right as my shift ended so I walked with him and he explained to me that he had apparently had a minor heart attack that night (he's in his early twenties, holy shit) and gotten a doctor's note saying that he needed five days off of work. At the end of the five days they fired him, so he called HR and they offered to help him sue the management for wrongful termination. He came in that day to get an official written reason for his firing for his lawyers.

Sorry for the wall of text, but that's every bit of information I have and I'm really curious to find out what will happen next. If everything he says is true, and the company that my managers work for is going to help him sue them, they're definitely going to get fired, right? Or is there a possibility that they're going to get out of this without any repercussions? And are the omniscient people from corporate going to see my post and figure out exactly who I am and fire my ass? I suddenly feel very paranoid.

It's around noon, so the place is packed. Not too big of a line, but it was obvious we just missed the rush as I could see the employees scrambling to get all the orders done. After waiting about 5 minutes it was my time to order. After placing it, I go wait across the ordering line. 10 minutes later, I hear my order number get called, and I go up to the counter. The employee who was handing me my order looked exhausted. She was the one handling most of the lunch rush. I took my food and said ""thank-you.""

GotNoms,80,56,1pc0f7,200,"I recently posted ""The day I became ""security"""" and all of you here seemed to enjoy it so I decided to bring you another story from the same grocery store.

We had a system where your duties are rotated weekly, from stocking shelves, dairy, check out, cleaning, and then my least favorite what we lovingly called ""bag bitch"" (I'm not sure exactly how common it is elsewhere but bag bitch is when you sit up front with a few other guys and loaded every single persons stuff into their car, no matter how little they had, seriously if you allowed someone to walk out with a single bag you risked getting fired) This story takes place my first shift as bag bitch.

It was getting close to closing so everyone had pretty much cleared out and the stock boys began sweeping etc. so people could get the hint to get the fuck out of the store. There was one lady who was taking her sweet time getting out of the store, lets call her Rich Entitled Ass or REA for short, by the time she finally got to the register we were about two minutes past when the doors were supposed to be locked and everyone getting closed up for the night.

RAE: (Who has a grand total of two freaking bags) HEY, YOU quit just standing there (I was sweeping the front of the store, two other guys were waiting to help anyone but she called me out) and come get my bags and bring them to my SUV.

Me: Yes, of course ma'am, right away

RAE:(as we make our way to her new looking SUV) *random small talk that anyone who does this job knows ""they working you too hard?'"" ""like working here?"" etc.*

Me: oh no ma'am, oh yes ma'am, Would you like the bags in the back seat or in the very back?

REA: Well the very back of course, who the hell puts groceries in the back seat, don't they teach you anything here.

Me: Of course ma'am, what on earth was I thinking. 

REA: (she goes and sits in the front seat of her SUV which is odd because most people stay and help, then doesn't unlock the back hatch for me, so I just have to sit there awkwardly for a bit until she does)

Now, at this point I had been standing behind it for about 15+ seconds and she was just looking at me through her side mirror saying nothing. Her windows were so tinted, along with how freaking dark it was outside I couldn't see anything inside.

Me: Ma'am? Could you unlock the back hatch?

REA: Oh, I guess, but it automatically opens so stand back.

Me: WIll do.

She opens the back hatch and a GODDAMN GOAT RUNS OUT.

RAE: OH SHIT I FORGOT ABOUT HIM, GO CATCH HIM.

Que running around the parking lot and down the road for almost 20 minutes trying to catch this mother fucking goat while this lady yells at me to ""Hurry up, I got shit to do"" from the front seat of her SUV. Bitch, if you want to get out of here quicker come help me.

Once I finally corral this asshole into a corner of the loading bay and bring him around the store the lady FINALLY steps out to do something. 

REA: Took you long enough, put him in the back and close the hatch.

Me: (rather pissed at this point) WHY would you not tell me there was a goat in the back that was unsecured?

REA: Well, I forgot about him after I bought him at the FFA auction (future farmers of america, a agriculture extracurricular activity at the high school who raises animals each year, also going to add the auction was done about 5 hours before this incident), sorry I guess.

Me: And you stayed in the car because?

REA: Well, isn't this what they pay you for.

Me outloud: I guess so, but that was rather rude ma'am

REA: You are being rude right now to me, I will report you to the owners and you will be fired.

numenorweeps,18,11,1pbrwb,60,"I just need to vent a little bit so I can get this off my mind and go study for a test. It's a pretty short story. 

I worked open to close yesterday. It was a normal Saturday. Not terribly busy. Today, I was excited to go into work. I only work on weekends, so there are a few of my coworkers that I rarely, or never get to see. Today was a meeting, so I'd get to see them for once. Not to mention, after the meeting I was off for the day. This is the first Sunday I haven't worked on in about 6 months. 

The meeting is the usual stuff. Inventory coming up, no cellphones on the floor, need to get the stock room in the back organized, etc. Most of it is directed at one individual, who nods and smiles and then promptly forgets everything said. Not a big deal. 

Then, we're told that the TM isn't happy with our store now. Apparently, whoever closed last night forgot to press the end of day button before they left, which means he got a call around 8 or 9 and had to come up to press the button himself. Well, guess who was closing yesterday? Me. Of course. 

I have no issue with that. I know I messed up. He has a right to be upset (he doesn't live particularly close). From what it sounds like, he called the manager so she could call whomever was closing, but she was in bed sick so he had to do it himself. 

I'm going to issued a written, verbal warning. Basically, if it ever happens again on my watch, I will be written up. That's all right. I'm in trouble, but not really. I know I'll never make the same mistake again, so I'll be ok. 

What I have an issue with, though, is that I'm not the first person to do this, but I'm the one getting the warning. Apparently, our TM isn't upset that it happened, he's upset that it's happened three or four times over the last 6 months. This is the first time I've ever made any mistake. My manager even told me such today. I started working there in January (my first job, I might add). By April I was a key holder. By May they were having me train the new employees. Other people, people who have worked there for 8 or more years, messed up a couple times prior to this and just had a finger shaken at them. I, however, am halfway to a write up. 

And it's not because I'm the new kid. Our TM didn't know who did it. He just issued a mass email to all the key holders saying that it couldn't happen again, and telling our manager to issue the verbal, written warning. So I'm being made an example of. I'm getting in trouble as a warning to the other key holders, as well as the manager, so it won't happen again. 

Maybe it's just me. Maybe it's because this is my first job and I'm just not used to how the chain of command works, or whatever. But it seems to me that if you are going to issue an official warning for a mistake, you should do it every time that mistake is made, no matter who makes it, not just when the mistake catches you on a bad day and inconveniences you. 

I know that this really doesn't matter that much. It doesn't affect me more than me having to sign a paper saying I know I've done wrong. If it was going to be more than that, I know my manager would stick up for me. But this TM really should not be in the position that he's in. He will yell about the smallest things, from not having a stopper on a hook that was just put out to finding a layer of dust on a counter to not making sales when we didn't have anywhere near enough people coming in to come close to the ridiculously high goal we're given. He smiles and takes you to lunch for a job well done one day, and the next throws you under the bus when his boss comes to him with an issue. 

The only thing that keeps me enjoying my job are the people I work with. It's a very small, tight knit group. We all try to protect each other, and make sure everybody's job is done. We trade off on sales so that we all stay pretty well neck and neck. If the store doesn't make goal, no one makes goal. We keep it fair and even. The occasional drama always is fixed within a day, and blows over within a week. 

But our store has been picked to house the RM (TM's boss) starting in November. Which means we'll be seeing a whole lot more of TM. We'll have a bunch of policy making bureaucrats in a store that doesn't fit in the mold they've set the policies to. We're the only store in the country inside a museum, which means we have to cut corners and run things a little differently to accommodate the strange hours and the different set of people we deal with. 

But now the policy makers are going to be at our store every day. I am not looking forward to that. ",I'm the example,71
Darling_Shivar,27,31,1pbql8,117,"I do not have magic powers that allow me to estimate something's weight based on its appearance. I am not going to be able to cut this roast to make it the weight you want it exactly. Also cutting a full roast into a weird shaped chunk is silly .

Similarly, fish. ""I need .6 pounds of salmon"". Cool, but wouldn't you rather have a full fillet? Or half a fillet? 

Basically, unless it's bulk product (something I can slowly pile a bit on until it reches the right weight), asking for it by weight is *really annoying* and I feel like you can deal with a roast that's a whopping fifth of a pound heavier than you want. 

I can't tell you how many fillets of salmon end up chopped in 3 pieces and nobody wants those size pieces, just because someone insisted they get a fillet of an exact weight and it took a few tries.","If you approach the service counter for a roast, proper procedure is to pick one, not ask for a specific weight.",148
QWOP_Sparkle,28,85,1pbj1l,134,"This happened about 6 years ago when I worked as a cashier in a big clothes store chain here in the UK. It's well known for being very cheap, which sadly means it attracts a lot of benefit laden families who believe the stores needs suit them entirely and nobody else.

Clothes are thrown around, women steal clothes out of other peoples clothes baskets, staff are spoken to like shit on a regular basis and people can get pretty violent over a 50p bracelet on sale.

So one day, whilst serving during the peak time (12-2pm generally), I was just in the middle of serving my next customers. Middle aged happy couple, start scanning their things through, folding their clothes etc. I usually converse with the customers but at this point the couple were discussing amongst themselves family related stuff so I just left them to it as opposed to giving them the generic 'did you find everything you were looking for?' speech.


As I'm halfway through folding, and neatly putting away their clothes I hear a large *thud* from the customer being served by the cashier next to me. I look up and she's giving me the most evil glare that I have ever seen from a customer. She was huge, whale standard, I couldn't tell you how much she weighed exactly but she had at least 2 or 3 fat rolls hanging round that stomach of hers. Greasy hair, greasy face and a hint of a small black moustache starting to form. 

&gt;**Whale** - What the FUCK do you think you're looking at?!

I realised that comment was directed literally at me, I was only looking at her because 1. She slammed her fist against the desk and 2. she was giving me the death stare like I just ate the last Big Mac in the country. 

&gt;**Whale** - EH?! I'll fucking jump over there and knock out those pretty little teeth of yours out you little bitch.


OK, panicking now. I just get back to serving my customers who have stopped speaking overhearing this exchange. The whole line went quiet with shock. The till op next to me had no idea what to do. We were both 16, we had only just started working there for a few months. We weren't taught how to handle aggressive customers, other than ring the bell under the till 3 times to call security. But even then, if I done that then she would have known it was me. By the time security got there, she'd have waddled her way over and flattened me. This was a serious lose, lose situation.

So I just avoided eye contact and kept serving.

&gt;**Whale** - Yeah. That's right. You just look away you pussy slut.

And with that, she paid, grabbed her bags and left. I was unable to control how nervous I was, just served my customers and called over the next with a mega shaky voice.

I never told the supervisors, managers, security. Anybody. That's one of the worst shifts I've ever had. Had I been staring at her, then I could understand her getting conscious or angry, but I didn't even see she was there even though she was of an amazing size. I just felt like shit.

And it's not like I'm a model or anything, I don't have a gorgeous face or body, so I was really confused why, of all the people serving on tills that day, that she chose me to take her anger out on. 

Had I been in that situation now, I'd of just walked off shift and went home. That store treats its workers like slaves and I feel sorry for anyone who works there.

TL;DR - Whale gets angry at me for staring at her even though I hadn't noticed her.",Got threatened by a Whale whilst serving another customer.,219
oh_papillon,24,14,1pbdnz,51,"Recap: I work softlines (clothes, shoes, accessories, baby) in a big box store. I also recently got a second job at a dollar store. My first rant pertains more to my second job, and my second rant pertains more to my first job.

We drank a lot of Kool-Aid in my family when I was a kid. My mother alone probably kept the company in business with the amount of Lemonade she drank, never mind all the other flavors that my sister and I gleefully consumed. It was while grocery shopping with my mom as a kid that I learned the cardinal rule about purchasing Kool-Aid: Never put a packet of Kool-Aid down flat on the conveyor belt, because it's too flat and light to trip the sensor telling the belt to stop, and the belt will just keep on going and eat your Kool-Aid up. 

Hey customers, you know what's also too flat and light to stop my conveyor belt? Your cash. I love the customers at my new job, but at least 30% of them will take out their cash and place it on the *moving* conveyor belt while I'm finishing scanning their items. Seriously? How hard is it to walk a few paces over to the other side of the register? There's a platform there specifically for counting out your cash that doesn't move and won't eat your hard-earned money! My favorites are the ones who put their cash down on the moving conveyor belt and then freak out and go, ""It's moving!"" Yes, yes it is. It was moving when you put your money down, and your money ain't gonna trip the sensor so yes, it's still moving. I really have to bite my tongue to keep from saying ""Yeah, it does that"" whenever someone points that out.

One of the duties that frequently falls to me in my big-box job is that of telephone operator. In addition to the corded phone at the fitting room, we keep a couple of cordless phones so the phone person for the day can take the phone with them while performing their daily tasks. 

Now, we cannot give out schedule information over the phone. It is not allowed, period. If you call and say, ""Hey, is So-and-So in?"" I'm not allowed to tell you. If you're a job applicant looking to set up an interview with the hiring manager and you're using the name they gave you, that's one thing. But generic requests for people who work here must always be denied. Why? For safety reasons. You may say you're Michelle's boyfriend, and you really might be. You might also be her psychopathic ex who, upon finding out she's working tonight, drives to our store and waits outside the door with a baseball bat. Or a gun. 

So callers, please bear with me. When you ask me if a co-worker is there and I tell you that I can't give that information out over the phone, repeating your question isn't going to to a damn thing. Yes, I can transfer you to my manager. They'll be happy to tell you the same thing I did.

Also, newbies: As per the policy stated above, if you try to call the store to get your schedule for the week, you're gonna have a bad time. Why? Because anyone can call up and say they're Amanda and they forgot to get their schedule, even your psycho ex-best friend or anyone else with a grudge against you, and if we gave out schedules over the phone, now they have your schedule and can harass you at work all the livelong day. You are adults. You can remember to write your schedules down. We have paper in the backroom next to the schedules for that very purpose. It is annoying that we can't tell you your schedule over the phone, but I for one do not want your blood on my hands if the caller turns out not to be you.

jimunoz,16,35,1pbd8e,70,"Some weeks ago I got a call from a very well known clothing store. They wanted to interview me for a job position. I got very excited because it was a great opportunity. I went to their HQ and the first impression was the worst ever. The reception hall was dirty and messy, I was surprised because the clothes from this brand are very expensive. Then, I started to wait for my interview. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes and no one appeared to interview me. Nobody gave me information of why this was happening. After 40 minutes, I was very angry and I left. I was so pissed.

After a few days, I got another call from this store and they said that my CV was very interesting and they wanted to interview me. I said to the girl who called me ""Did you know that I went for an interview in your HQ and no one came to interview me. I was there for 40 minutes and I left. This is so unprofessional"". The girl didn't knew anything about what happened and after I started to complain she told me that the day that I went it ""was"" an emergency and no one could interview me because of that.

Our site is really slow so there's no point in having more than just me on, most of my business is people paying for their gas at the pump with their card. 

I greet him when he comes in like I do everyone and he walks right over to my register. I figure he was a bar fly looking for his smokes and ask how I can help him. 

Bad Guy: you can hand me all the money in your till and in your safe. 

I just sort of sighed at him. 

Me: listen buddy. You're not only on multiple cameras (I gesture to the big TV that shows all my camera views), but there's also a cop that circles this area constantly.

OR you could turn and walk out my door and not come back and I won't say a damn thing to anyone about this. 

He didn't even take a second to think, he turned on his heel and walked out. I don't know why he wanted the money, but I'm glad he decided not to go through with it. I'm quite proud of myself for handling that so well. I know we're trained to just give them what they want and hit the panic button when they leave but I think if you calmly and rationally lay the facts out for people it'll turn them off to the idea.

This girl was in between her junior and senior years in high school. We trained together back in March. She seemed like a stellar employee. She surpassed me in a few different areas. Things were going swimmingly. For like a month.

She started to complain a lot. Which is fine, I guess. Everyone complains, especially in retail. But then she started pawning her work off on other people, including our managers. One of them is just a super nice guy. The kind that if you asked him to grab you something he'd say ""sure no  problem"" without thinking. Anyway, she manages to find a way to make it seem like she's working without actually doing anything. That works for about a week. And then the managers start to get mad. And she bitches when she has to come in. And she's completely rude to customers. She eventually turned in her two week notice after failing to show up for shift. And then assumed that because she turned in her two weeks, she wouldn't have to work for those two weeks. Why would you think that?

So this next candidate is one that I got to see first hand. We'll call him Jim. He had always been a bit of a party-er, but he managed to leave it out of work for the year or so he worked there before I came on. *(Important note: We have to call in an hour before each shift to see if we're actually working. Because it's ice cream, we're very weather dependent as to how many people are working)* I call an hour before my shift, thinking that I'll get pushed a couple of hours back since both Jim and my manager are working and the weather is crappy. My manager, we'll name him Gavin, answers the phone, and apologetically states that I need to come in ASAP. I do so, and as soon as I walk through the door, I see that Jim is completely out of it. Either hungover or something...but he's gone. I go back, get in my uniform, and clock in. Gavin promptly takes Jim to the back room to speak with him. I stay out front to stock and help customers. All of a sudden, I hear from the back ""Nigga, I can get away with anything at this store.""

**I'll-Leave-When-I-Want-To Boy**

Most recently, there's this gem. We'll name him Marvin. Marvin was an...okay employee. He's not exemplary but he'll show up and he'll get it done for the most part. But recently he's gotten a bit of a hot head. Last weekend, he decided that he was going to leave an hour early. This actually happens quite frequently, but it's entirely up to management and speed of business. Nobody just declares it. It ended up that he could get cut early anyway, but it was still extremely frustrating. 

This past week, he texted me saying that ""something really serious came up and can you please just cover my closing shift on Saturday just this once? :)"" It should be noted that I open on Saturday. My shift is from 10am-6pm. His closing shift was from 6pm-10:30pm. I would have had a 12.5 hour day. I might have done it too, if I didn't have other commitments on Saturday evenings. 

The store owner called me a couple of hours later to chat about something completely different. She was bored and hadn't worked with me in a while and just called to talk. That was kind of cool. Off topic, sorry. I mentioned it in passing that I couldn't cover his shift, even though something serious came up, and apologized. She got angry.

""HE IS LYING TO YOU""

""What?""

""He decided last minute that he wanted to go to homecoming, asked a girl and made all these plans before ever checking his work schedule. You absolutely don't have to cover his shift. It's completely his fault.""

I never responded to that text. He sent the same one to me 2 days later and I just responded with ""I know it's homecoming and I can't cover you"".

Today was the Saturday that he wanted covered. He came in about 2 hours before his shift to tell us that he wasn't coming in. From what I understand, the conversation went like this.

**GAVIN: Can you just call before your night shift?

MARVIN: No, I'm not coming in.

GAVIN: I'm telling you to call.

jenbenfoo,12,29,1pawb5,98,"So I work at the deli counter of a chain superstore prevalent in the Midwest. Working in such an environment gives me many stories to tell, and here's one: 

Today, I was working in the hot foods area- fried and rotisserie chicken, mashed potatoes, etc. I had a woman and her adult son come up to the counter asking for chicken tenders, which I'd just ran out of and hadn't had a chance to make more yet since we were very busy, and at that time both of our fryers were in use. I told them I'd be making more as soon as I had an open fryer (about 10 minutes) and that they took 15 minutes to cook. The woman seemed mildly irritated but said she'd finish her shopping and come back. Okay, no big deal. So I get the tenders ready to cook as soon as I can, and when the first fryer is available, I start the tenders. When there's about 8 minutes left, they come back. And after seeing that there's still none in the case, they just stand there and wait. The son, who was probably in his early 20s, just sorta meandered around in front of the deli, not seeming too bothered, while the mother stood back a few feet, alternating between glaring at the fryer and me. I wanted so badly to tell her that giving it such a heated glare wouldn't cook the chicken any faster, but I wisely held my tongue. Eventually the tenders were done, she got what she wanted and was on her gloomy way.

Lots of families with little kids all anxiously waiting in this huge line. The line moved quickly for having so many people and after about 10 minutes, I was about six people away from checking out.

acciobrainyspecs,24,41,1pam5y,167,"I put in my two weeks at the restaurant last night and I guess because of that the universe decided to remind me what I was going to be missing.

The night was going smoothly, I was flying high on the knowledge I'll be out of the industry by the 10th, I got a large party that wound up containing a very old friend of mine I hadn't seen in years and I was feeling good despite the fact that my back was hurting like hell. Whatever, no biggie, I'm used to a tense back. After my large party left I had a moment to run to the restroom and while sitting down I somehow-- don't ask me, I don't know-- managed to wrench the hell out of my back. It... it hurt really bad. Unfortunately, it was a Friday night so I pretty much just sucked it up until about 15 minutes later when my back muscles start spasming and put me in tears. I have a very high pain tolerance and coupled with being stubborn as a mule I put on a brave face and went with it until it slowed down and one of our lovely, wonderful hosts finally asked our manager to cut me. I had a lot of help from the hosts with taking the heavy extension off the table and clearing the heavier plates, and our manager B gave me my checkout sheet early. I started wiping down my tables and I'm sure I was looking a little odd because I couldn't bend without incurring massive pain so I was periodically rubbing my back and bending stiffly at the knee to sweep and wipe my tables.

I noticed a man at the table immediately next to my section watching me but I figured that he was just a bored single diner watching me do my thing in a rather humorously odd manner. I was wrong. He asked his server to send the manager over and B came out and sat down to talk to the guy. Their conversation went thusly:

Man: I've been watching this girl and you have come to check on her and several other people have come to check on her.

B: Yes sir, she's having some back pain so we're trying to get her free so she can go home.

Man: I don't think she's having back pain at all. You need to have her tested for drug use.

B: I'm sorry?

Man: She's clearly under the influence, you need to have her tested for illicit drugs.

B turns to glance at me but the man stops him.

Man: No no no! Don't look, don't alert her!

(Now I should note, I was standing RIGHT NEXT to this table sweeping. I could hear every word this man urgently muttered to B. It took an incredible amount of self control not to look up and say, ""I can hear *every word* you are saying."")

B: Sir, she's not on drugs, she's just in a lot of pain.

Man: You don't understand, you're putting yourself at a huge risk for liability having her work here. I guess you don't know who I am. You NEED to have her tested.

B: Sir, I'm not sure what you want me to do about this.

Man: You don't have to do anything, it isn't hurting me.

B: I'm not sure what we're talking about, then. Is everything else okay?

Man: Oh yes, the food is fantastic.


So when B and I tell this to everyone in the back a large group of us are already laughing about this man, B said it took everything he had not to glare at the man say, ""Sir, she is *pregnant*."" just to fuck with him. Our kitchen manager told me I should put some lemonade in a glass and drop it off at his table, and our assistant manager urged me to walk by the table scratching my arm, sniffing, and just generally fulfilling every cliche druggie tic we could come up with.

obscurethestorm,22,106,1paeun,439,"This is a story that happened in the beginning of September, and I posted it on my facebook, so I'm just going to copy/paste it from there. 

For reference, I work in a retail store where the blue light shines bright.

&gt;Yesterday a woman came through my checkout with her two kids, a teen girl and a boy who looked around 10 years old. The boy ended new shoes, and they thought they could get then buy one get them half off, but one of the pairs they picked out wasn't included. They checked out and the boy was sad because he'd have to continue playing in his ratty shoes and saving the other for school. 

&gt;When their receipt printed out, they got a ""$10 family shoes *with a purchase of $50 or more"" coupon. They were so excited, but then they realized that they couldn't spend $50, obviously. The lady behind them had been waiting patiently for me to get them all check out, and she saw the coupon. She told the little boy to run back and get his shoes, and she used the coupon in her purchase (which ended up being like $62~something), and the mom gave her the money to finish covering the shoes ($8). It was seriously the most heart warming thing ever. 

&gt;When the family left, the woman paid and said ""I just can't stand the thought of that little boy playing in those shoes any more. My sons had to do that, and I wish someone had helped us."" I wanted to give her like, the world's biggest hug. It was awesome.

Kelnam,16,62,1paeto,184,"I just found this subreddit today.  I’ve only been working in retail for a few months but I already have a few good stories.

I'm in high school right now and work summers at a large “farmstand” which is really just a medium-sized local produce store that’s missing a couple of walls.  We're known for a few products which we grow and make just down the road at a medium-sized farm and which have been described by many customers as the best that they've ever tasted.  

We're in an area that gets a lot of summer tourism (like literally 3/4 of houses in a nearby town are only occupied during the summer) from rich snobby people from the nearest major city, which is a rather large and wealthy one.  The rich assholes from the city are typically called cidiots (from city idiots) and there's a lot of passive-aggressive hostility from the locals towards these people, but most of the jobs and businesses out here depend on them to survive so we usually try to keep up appearances.

One of the foods we are known for is our tomatoes.  They are of a unique variety that was developed by the owner of the farm and the stand.  They're $3.99/lb but everything's super expensive out here in the summer and a decent amount  of the people that vacation out here typically can burn $500 without blinking an eye, so they sell well anyway.

Anyway, around the weekend of July 4, one of our busiest times of the year, this one cidiot lady walks in with her designer sunglasses and Louis Vuitton purse, no different than the 500 other clones of her that dress exactly the same that walk in there every day.  She browses for a while and stops to look at several boxes of tomatoes that we have stacked against a wall. She approaches me and immediately asks to speak with my manager.  Even though I am 99% certain I can answer her question or resolve her dispute by myself, I oblige because it's pretty much my policy that if someone is an especially stupid cidiot, I try to give them what they want until they leave.

The lady stares at my manager with her hands on her hips in this confrontational pose and with the smuggest “Gotcha!” look on her face says ""Your tomatoes are in boxes.  That means they aren’t local.”  My manager somehow looks a bit incredulous for a second and then says “Actually, they’re grown right down the road.  My boss buys those boxes so we don’t have to carry them out of the field in our arms.  Quite a few would get dropped if we did that.”  The lady instantly realizes her mistake and the 8 people that are watching the exchange suddenly turn from the shocked witnesses in her mind to the amused spectators of reality.  She turned as red as the tomatoes she accused us of importing and quietly apologized and walked away.  

TL;DR Lady thought she was going to uncover a massive conspiracy, instead got laughed at by a store full of people for being an idiot.",Idiots are okay. Loud idiots are the bad ones.,246

SpeedMetalPunker,24,37,1p9wvz,99,"Hey, you all might remember me from my ranting about my old gas station job. Well, I've been gone from there for about a week or so now. It feels amazing. The company I worked for didn't care at all about it's employees and I had decided enough is enough. Here are my reasons as follows: 

1. Whenever I would close at night, I was alone most nights, which is really dodgy considering I could have been robbed so easily. The only reason they didn't put 2 people on most nights was because it's not a law here yet. 

2. They didn't want you to sit at all during work, which is ridiculous  because if you're on your feet 8 hours a day considering it gets very tiring on your feet. Now I wouldn't be saying this otherwise, but. as the next 2 things I'm about to tell you would change your mind:

3. You didn't ever get a break from this job when you worked. Which was illegal as all hell but the company didn't care.

4. and the final thing, there were no ergonomic mats to stand on because ""they were a slipping hazard"" (I wish I was making that up) once again, illegal. It's a labor board law that if you're standing in 1 place for a period of time, that has to be there. I even offered to bring 1 in so work was more comfortable for everyone working there, and my idea got shot down. And the fuckers justify this by saying ""you won't be standing there for 8 hours straight. If you're not serving customers you have a rag and you're cleaning the store"" this is seriously bullshit because **you're on your feet still.** And those mats are anti-slip mats to begin with.

BenSisko,208,230,1p9wov,840,"Hello TFR! I, like many others, am a long time lurker, and this is my first post. Apologies for the wall of text to follow! 

I work at for a large coffee chain in the UK. I've been at my store for a few years now, and have many tales to tell. This story focusses on one of the worst co-workers I have ever had the displeasure of working with.

My co-worker (who I'll refer to as Tony) is a nightmare. Short-tempered, agressive and generally awful. He's rude to customers and co-workers alike. We've had a LOT of complaints about his behaviour, but one incident really stood out.

It was a really relaxed day- not many customers, and a good group working, with the exception of Tony. A lovely woman came up to the counter with her little girl (we'll call her LW) and ordered a coffee for her and a childrens hot chocolate for her daughter.

At our coffee shop, our kids hot chocolates are cooler drinks served in double espresso cup. 

So, Tony makes LW's drinks (not to a particularly high standard), not making conversation with her or making eye contact and, well, just being generally rude. LW thanks us, takes her drinks, and sits down. 

A few minutes later, she comes back up to the counter. LW's really apologetic, and says that her daughters hot choc is a little too cold. Fair enough, it happens. Better too cold than too hot for a little kid. Unfortunately, the person she goes to to sort it out is Tony.

Tony snatches the drink and spins round to the coffee machine without a word. I apologise to LW for the cold drink and tell her we'll bring it over to her table when its ready.

Tony took the complaint as a personal insult. He was FUMING. I heard him muttering something as he re-made the drink, but didn't think much of it. He pours the drink, goes over to LW's table and slams it down before storming off.

One of my other co-workers, who we'll call Linda, calls me over to the coffee machine while Tony is stomping around clearing tables, still visibly angry about the 'complaint'.

""Sisko, you better see this,"" Linda said, lifting up the jug we use to heat up the hot chocolate and pointing at the thermometer. There was still hot choc in the jug, and the thermometer was reading at *180 degrees*. To put that in context, a normal adult coffee is heated up to about 140-150, and a childs drink to no more that 100. 

He was so irrationally angry that LW had complained, *he had purposefully overheated the drink to burn the kid.*

Before I had a chance to react, I hear the little girl start to cry. She'd burnt her mouth on the crazy hot drink. 

I ran over and apologised profusely, offering a full refund for their order. LW thanked me, but said it wasn't neccessary. She just wanted to speak to the manager.

I went and grabbed my manager, and LW made a formal complaint. My manager apologised and promised disciplinary steps would be taken, but LW said she would not be coming in again while Tony was still employed.

It was clearly intentional. Tony even admitted to it to some degree when he was confronted (""Well, she complained it was cold. She wanted it hotter, I made it hotter. What more did she want?"")

This happened over a year ago. The worst thing about this story? He's still working there now.

sugardrop,43,102,1p9s70,390,"I used to work at a chain Italian restaurant as a hostess. We often had people calling trying to make reservations. Our management would occasionally take them but only if they were at least 2 days in advance and only if the party was 8 or more. For the most part reservations were not accepted, especially not during weekend dinner rushes.

During football season one evening (college football, I live in a big 10 college town) we were absolutely *slammed* with people who were in town for the game that weekend. There was one man who called in and said, rudely, ""Party of 8 coming in. Get our table together."" I kindly informed him that we were on an hour and a half wait for large parties, and he could come in and get a pager. He seemed annoyed but grumbled something and hung up.

Sure enough I hear on the headset a bit later from our greet host saying that a man was in saying he had a reservation. I walk up and recognize him as the man on the phone from the way he spoke.

""I just called in and made a reservation."" he said to the greet host (we will call her Sarah). Sarah had worked there for a while and wasn't really new to this kind of trickery, so she looked at him and told him ""Sorry sir but you must have been mistaken, we don't take day-of reservations on weekends, especially game weekends. It will be 1 1/2 hours. Can I have your name?"" This man looked like he was about to LOSE it. It reminded me of the cartoons where people have steam blowing out of their ears with a red face. He says, ""but I just called and told them to be ready for us."" Sarah sighed. ""Yes sir, I understand, but my coworker told you that you'd have to wait. I'm sorry and we will get you down as soon as possible."" The guy's rage boiled over as he SLAMMED the pager down on the host stand and screamed (and this is my favorite part). ""YOU GIRLS...YOU HAVE A NICE DAY. NO. YOU HAVE A NICE. LIFE."" Being overly sweet to rude customers is my favorite thing ever, and Sarah said cheerfully, ""thanks sir, you too!"" as I smiled, ""I plan on it!"" He left with his pager (not really sure why, maybe an accident. We left him on the wait just in case.)

He came in maybe 20 minutes later and shoved the pager into my hands, saying ""You just lost $200. The steakhouse across the street got us in right away."" 

I heard later from our general manager (referred to now as Steve) who was an awesome guy even though he could sometimes be a hard ass, that a man had called during dinner rush telling him that the young lady at the host stand did him a disservice by turning away their business. Steve asked him what the problem was, and the man explained the situation saying that he would have to wait an hour and a half for a party of 8. ""That sounds about right for a party of 8 on football Saturday,"" Steve replied, ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"" The man said that he had gotten into the aforementioned steakhouse right away. My manager laughed and simply replied ""Thanks for letting me know that they have a hard time going on a wait on a football Saturday."" and hung up. Ha!

meguriau,39,134,1p961l,448,"Hey TFR! I've been intending to make a post but struggled with wording until I came across an askreddit post and submitted my first story as a comment. I'm in the middle of procrastinating from my thesis at the moment so this first one will be almost a direct copy-paste with modifications. 

**Background** 

Two years ago, I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store. Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock, the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals. The majority of the customers I've had have been pleasant, however, there have been interesting characters and even a few ~~nasty pieces of work~~ discontent customers that have come by. If there's any interest, I'll try to make it a point to post a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this time.

This first story is from the early months of this year. It was my first summer working for the brand and the thermometer had not dipped under 30 degrees Celcius for several days at that point. 

My manager and I were working an incredibly busy shift when the motion sensor sounded. In came a local girl, noticeably overweight, disheveled hair, belly exposed from ill-fitting sporting attire, racquet bag over her shoulder and large quantities of chocolate smeared around the edges of her mouth. 

Without any warning or acknowledgement of any sort, she began pulling hats from almost every shelf, making it a point to try on the most expensive hats possible. In a most meticulous fashion, she went about smearing sweat and ice cream on the linen and organza hats, brushing felt hats against the direction of the nap of the fur and jamming them back onto the hat block, amongst other travesties in the process. 

Upon completing the first of her objectives, she made a rude remark about the brand with regard to some of the products then skipped off on her merry way.

A few hours later while my boss was on her lunch break, the same girl returned. As it turned out, after everything she had done, she still had the audacity to leave us her resume. I gave my boss the satisfaction of putting it through the shredder.","Please excuse my behaviour from earlier, here's my resume. [Tales from a Hat Boutique]",582

I work at a hobby shop / game store for context.

I tell him ""We have a large selection of chess sets and boards, what are you looking for?""  
""Just regular chess.""  
I say ""Just a basic set?  I've got some wood sets starting around $50.  Did you need a board too?""  
""Fifty dollars!  For chess?  No, cheaper.""

dayandnightowl,10,16,1p8li9,90,"Preface: I work at an artist supply store (Not a craft store! Trust me, there is a difference), and we sometimes have various art demos on the weekend. This was one of those weekends.

^Also, ^it ^should ^be ^noted ^I ^have ^a ^tendency ^to ^be ^long ^winded ^and ^over ^explain. ^Sorry ^in ^advance...

I was in charge of doing a plaster-bandage mask making demo for my store. I had made a few masks the night before, and planned to do a few more during my demo. I can usually stay at my demo table for the entirety of it, but we were busy so I kept having to get up and help, leaving the table empty. 

During a lull where I wasn't needed at the register, I was sitting at my table making a mask. No one else had really shown any interest beyond ""Oh hey, person, what are you doing? Oh, making masks? That's cool... *I guess...* Oh, man, must be shopping now, so sorry..."".  My demos usually go great, so I was a little bummed out that nobody was interested in this thing I had worked hard to put together. *(Especially you, lady, that interrupted me saying ""I don't care, just tell me where the kid stuff is"". Boooooooo)*

So this young kid comes over, asking what I'm doing, and I give a short explanation. After, I tell him he's welcome to paint one of the masks I made the night before, and I figure he's going to decline and be on his way. Instead, he looks overjoyed and sits down with as much enthusiasm as... a person sitting down enthusiastically. He starts choosing his paints, and talking  to me about all the art things he does, and I notice he keeps saying things are ""boss"", which was cracking me up. He was totally enthusiastic about what he was doing and calls his sister over. He tells her how ""boss"" painting the mask is, and convinces her to start painting too. 

Eventually the parents walk over, telling the kids that it's time to go, but they beg to stay so they can keep working on their masks. The parents are cool with it, and start talking to me as well, asking if I do art, what kind I do, etc. and then both kids are telling me about the kind of art they do, the little boy says that sculpting is ""boss"", drawing is ""boss"", his mask is ""boss"", and he AND his sister are so excited about it, and my heart is growing three sizes, etc. The kids eventually finish, thank me profusely for letting them paint, tell me how excited they are to go home and try making their own masks. The little boy asks if I like working there, I tell him I love it. He agrees it would be ""boss"" to work there, so I tell him when he starts applying for jobs, I will put in a good word for him, and he seems over the moon, and tells me that it would be boss. I almost offer to babysit on the spot. They leave, several more children come in throughout the day who are almost as adorable, and I have enough warm and fuzzies to last me a week.

**TL;DR** Awesome kids love art and proceed to tell me, little boy calls everything good ""boss"", children are awesome the rest of the day, and I am happy.","Little kids are totally ""boss"", and I want to hug them all",106
overitall95,8,22,1p8gj4,33,"Just finished an overnight shift at a fast food restaurant in Australia. This is what happened to my colleague (We shall call her Betty, or B from now on) whom everyone loves, and the aftermath.

I started at 10pm, and as soon as I clock in, 3 other colleagues clock out and head home. I was setting up 2 fresh tills at the time for a mate who started at 11:30, and myself, as the manager on shift had a busy night. He finished at midnight-Not relevant.

I finish the till set up, put one on the printer, and one in #4, and start to take orders. First order was a Diet Coke. No worries. I see a guy hanging around B's till, appx 3 ft away from mine. Think nothing of it. Serve next customer. Cheese burger, large Coca Cola, Ice cream cone.

I set the drink machine to pour the large drink, and go to the ice cream machine to pull a soft serve (This is what it's called, despite people thinking us males on shift jack off into a cup and mix it with the ice cream mix.)

I hear the customer who was hanging around B's till, start to raise his voice. Not softly raise. Go to full yell mode. Considering I'm partially deaf as I'm recovering from an illness, and the ice cream machine makes a god awful racket when in use, I knew something was up..

Now, what the customer said (we'll call him AA for arrogant asshat) has slipped my mind a bit, but the big impacts that I heard and clearly remember were things like.

AA: **WHY THE FUCK HAS MY MEAL TAKEN THIS LONG, I REMEMBER YOU SERVING ME! MY GIRLFRIEND IS PREGNANT AND IN THE CAR, WAITING FOR HER FOOD! SHE DOESN'T NEED THIS STRESS OR ELSE SHE'LL LOSE OUR BABY, AND WE'LL SUE YOU PERSONALLY!**

Now, B is usually very strong against people attacking her, but I'm not sure, and I'm not going to ask what made her crack, but I've got a hunch it's because she's worried about University and her teaching degree, which she's getting at 19, so good on her for that. I saw the manager on shift walk around the corner, and I said.
""Front counter, immediately! B's being torn to shreds and I'm not going to interfere as he's hollering for a manager and xyz.""

Manager goes to front counter, I hand the ice cream to the customer I was serving, as well as the rest of their order, then go to the office, where I see B. In tears. She has the work phone in her hand, and is shaking like a tree in a cyclone/hurricane. Nope. No one does that to her. I'm glad the guy who was working the burger room was not keyed in on what happened. He may be 16, but he is built like a tank, and would kill anyone who hurt B, physically, emotionally or otherwise.

After AA leaves, everyone but the guy in the burger room goes to the office to comfort B. We got her water, soda, lots of compassion, sympathy, and threats of violence to the douche who did that to her. the last part made her chuckle a little. The manager on at the time got her some food, and comped it off.. 2 4 inch burgers, bottle of water and what ever else she wanted. He said himself that the employees or managers don't get paid enough to deal with that crap, and the company would be douches about therapy. ""It's all in the job description."" Fucking bullshit. Nowhere, does it say that we have to deal with fucktards who degrade us and make us feel worthless.

We call B's parent multiple times to try and get hold of her, but we waited about 10 minutes after constantly trying for 15 minutes. Eventually, we get hold of B's mother, who picks her up straight away. The manager, as far as I'm aware, has given her full pay, plus some for the shit storm that she didn't cause.

To be perfectly honest (and I'm not saying it was B's fault, the customer should have been less of an fucktard) we have our fast food outlet where there are unfortunately more people who try to nick things, therefore us getting the blame for ""not paying attention to customers."" Keeping track of 15 people in 10 minutes is a smidge hard, after a full day at uni, starting at 8am and finishing at 4pm, then working from 5pm until 11pm.

TL;DR... Gotta read it to understand the title mate.

I'll be hopefully seeing B tonight at work, and I'm hoping it is a better shift for her. I'll understand perfectly if she's not on tonight though.

**UPDATE: Saw B last night when I got to work, she was much better, and was getting trained in the burger room. Good to see she is keeping her options open so she isn't stuck dealing with people like AA again.**",Manager to front counter. Immediately!,55

Me: Actually we're all sold out but we have space on the 1:00 trip.

BD: Are you sure you don't have any space? There's just two of us.

NejKidd,11,7,1p879v,16,"I've never worked in fast food - or any type of food service tbh - but a while back I had a sitch that I had no idea how to deal with.

So I ordered a burger from [big brand chain]. I don't get it often as most of the time it tastes like cardboard, but occasionally I like them. I bought a burger which was just burger, cheese and bacon, made with no sauces or salad (it's normally like this) and when it came the bun had mayonnaise along one edge as if it had rested against [chicken burger which has mayonnaise] when sitting waiting to be packaged up and sold.

Now, I don't mind mayonnaise, though it tasted weird with cheese and bacon, so I ate it, but then I thought about it and realised that someone might not like/be allergic to mayonnaise and for someone else it might be an issue. It was busy at lunch rush, and I didn't want to make a fuss - especially as I was happy to eat the food - so I waited for it to quiet down a bit before approaching the server and pointing out that there was mayonnaise on the burger (which I'd already eaten by this point) and immediately saw the looks of 'is this lady trying to get a free lunch'.

Did I approach this correctly? How would you suggest I deal with this? I'm always very awkward with criticising when stuff goes wrong because no matter how opened and 'constructive' I phrase it (I don't do it often I swear!) It always is received badly.

So this is a tale from when I worked as a receptionist at a clinic. I still did cash handling, greeting, and all that jazz, so it sort of counts as retail, right? Well my desk was situated by the public computers where people could put in job applications online for our clinic as well as other same name clinics in the area.


A nice young lady (YL) came in and politely and meekly inquired about applying for a job at the clinic. I cheerfully told her that although I was not allowed to take paper resumes (in truth, I could but they just got thrown away and I didn't have the heart to tell them that), but that she could fill an online application using the public computers. 


She smiled and thanked me, plopped down at a computer, and pulled out a flash drive. 

YL: Ma'am, I don't see a place to put my flash drive in the computer. Do you think you can help me?
Me: Sure, let me grab the HR rep and I'll see if she can help!

I ran down the hall to get the HR rep, Isabella, (I) and brought her to help out YL.

I: I'm so sorry ma'am, we can't allow you to use a flash drive on the computer for security reasons. However, if you've e-mailed the resume to yourself, you can use that as well. Also, you can apply without a resume as well.

YL: Well I guess I'm just stuck flipping BURGERS then.

jdpatric,6,14,1p7pv0,51,"When I worked retail I was training a new girl on the cash register (I'm a guy BTW). This one particular regular at the hardware store I worked at was missing his left hand at the wrist. I don't know why/how, but the man only had one hand. I'd never really given it too much thought; he was so good at using just the one hand to do everything that it took me about two or three times ringing him out to realize he was missing his left hand.

The new girl I was training was really nice, and all, but incredibly ditsy. For example I was talking mountains with one of our other coworkers and she joined the conversation. I asked her what the tallest mountain in the US is. (It's Mt. McKinley in Alaska, Mt. Whitney in the continental US and I would have accepted either as a neat trivial pursuit answer). She responds with Mt. Everest. Her sister also worked there and responded in kind. SO, I'm not saying she wasn't the brightest crayon in the box...she was fairly smart...just ditsy.

This guy walks up to her register carrying nothing (needs help with something) she looks right at him and says ""Need a hand?""

I turn pale. I had no idea what was going to come next. To say this was a facepalm moment...really doesn't cover it (I guess the above ""Everest"" thing was a facepalm moment too, but it pales in comparison to this).

She wasn't mad or asking for a refund because it was to fix up a house that is going on the market. I look at what our records show and we go back in the stock room to see if we can figure it out. She points to the one I ""mistakenly"" gave her. I ask her if she can point out what she was supposed to get.

mrjoekick4ss,42,13,1p7nkb,60,"Heu, first post here.
Doesn't have anything to do with customers, but since i've seen a lot of stories here with just stupid or entitled people i thought i give it my share. English is not my native language, nor am i good at writing stories.

This didn't happen to me, but to a friend's father (F) who has a sheepfarm.

On a spring day 2 people from a city drove through the countryside and saw a lamb who couldn't stand on it's hooves. I don't know what causes it, but it's pretty harmless and the lamb will learn/grow to stand on it's hooves. 
(The lamb was basicly walking on it's ankles with his hooves flapped backwards).

The 2 guys parked their car to check it out, because they were worried about the lamb's well being. They instantly thought the owner of the sheep was a lazy hick who didn't care about his sheep. OBVIOUSLY the lamb was very very sick and needed immediate help from a veterinarian.

They chased the lamb around and after 10 minutes or so they caught it. The neighbor saw the city people fucking around in F's land, so he went to see what they wanted.

He greeted them and asked them what they were doing. They said this lamb was walking weird and needed immediate help from a vet. Also the owner should be reported to the police for neglecting his animals.
The neighbor said he knew F and he said he cares for his sheep and wouldn't leave the lamb in agony by ignoring a problem. The neighbor said he would go to F to tell him about the weird walking lamb and the 2 city guys. The 2 guys agreed to wait for the neighbor and F to come back to see if there was a problem.

When neighbor explained the situation to F they both came back to the land where the lamb and the guys would wait. They were gone with the lamb....

Ofcourse F was mad. ""stealing my animals! How dare they!?""
F, with my friend, rushed to the nearest vet to hopefully meet the 2 guys there.
Nope they weren't there. DAMN! To the next one closer to the city were they assumed the guys lived.

When F arrived he was furious. He saw 1 guy outside, probably waiting for F to show up. F parked his car and wanted to go inside. The city guy stopped him, because he thought F would take his lamb who needed treatment. Which 1 punch to the face F K.O.'d the guy and walked past him.

Inside the vet was just finishing up with the lamb and city guy. The vet laughed and said the lamb didn't need any treatment, because it just needed to develop his feet further. 

F tore the city guy a new one, because in most cases city people know what's best for the farmer and his animals. They might know jack shit, about animals or farming but they will always have a entitled opinion about it. Ofcourse F was still mad. He just grabbed his lamb and went home. The city guys wanted to apologise and said atleast nothing bad happend. F said Fuck off and went home.

2 hours later the lamb was dead. Too much stress... F knew this was a likely outcome. That's why he was so angry at the city guys.


Edit: F might seem a bit angry in this story, but he just really cares for his sheep. He also hates city people who think they know what's best for something they know nothing about.

sarsaparillashowdown,16,17,1p7msp,101,"I've posted in this subreddit before and explained that I work in a customer service call position. I take the calls, I field the calls, I answer questions and I provide some low level tech support for our customer website. Not too difficult but people suck so we get some angry/crazy people on the phones from time to time.

One of my favorite (read: most annoying) calls come from people who do not realize we have two offices: one on the east coast and one on the west. I live/work on the west coast office where we take the phone calls. So we'll get people calling in, infuriated that the person they've been trying to call since 9am EST has not been answering their phone calls. When I explain that we're on PST and most employees don't start rolling in until 8am or 9am, most people get it. Others, however, do not realize that we do not live at our desks with a tiny bed underneath that we sleep in so that we can answer their every question as soon as they ask it. Sometimes, you have to leave a message. Not rocket science, right?

So guy calls in, states that he is absolutely INFURIATED that the person he's been trying to reach since 9am EST has not returned his calls or emails. I check the name, and sure enough that guy works on the west coast. Its just now 8:30 am in our office and I explain that most likely that gentleman is not yet in the office. He'll be DF for dumb fuck and I'll be me.

**Me:** I'm so sorry sir, but that gentleman works in our west coast office, and most of our employees don't come in to our office until about 8-9am our PST. He could be out of the office still, would you like me to put you through to his voicemail?

**DF:** I am just so mad, I need to speak to his manager, he has been so rude with not returning any of my calls. I've left him 3 voicemails and 10 emails with no answer!

**Me:** I apologize sir, but again, that gentleman does not get into the office until about 8-9am PST, so he has not been here in the office to take your calls. 

**DF:** Fine. FINE. I'll just call him back another time! *click*

""Hello, I'm calling to see if my glasses are ready.""

We get about one person a day calling about this. We normally call all customers as soon as we get their glasses in (like, as soon as we open the box), but sometimes shit happens and one doesn't get called because reasons. I ask for her name and I put her on hold to go check. No glasses. I check the box of ticket files to see if there's an order placed under her name. Nope. I check the one in our contact lens section just in case someone put a glasses order in the contacts box. Nope. I check the WIP tracker. Nope. Nobody under that name, at all, ever.

""Well, can you tell me when they'll be in?""

""The lab doesn't give us an estimated date, but I can check the order progress and see how far along it is if you'd like.""

I do that. The WIP tracker doesn't have a record of her, but I can look her up in the point-of-sale system and see the status of her order there, too.

POS has no record of her, either. At any store in the country.

""Uhh...ma'am, are you sure you're calling the right store?""

Oops. Wrong thing to say. ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I WANT MY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS BACK, AND I'M NOT PAYING FOR MY EYE EXAM EITHER. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT SURE IF I'VE BEEN THERE OR NOT. LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER.""

Challymo,3,6,1p77zy,24,"To set the scene I used to work in a department store in the uk that likes to count itself as upmarket, the clothing generally was good quality but most of the foodstuffs was made in the same place and in the same way as the standard supermarkets.  
As I can't remember any long stories that I dealt with I will go over some shorter ones and some fun memories.  
1) The Awesome Store Manager - For most of my tenure at this store I worked in the operations department (i.e. Stockroom), this meant that I ended being a keyholder and would often lock up at night. At the time we were very shortstaffed so the evenings where there was supposed to be 2 of us until close ended up being just 1 of us, because of this we very often would end up behind during the day which meant alot of the tasks needed to be done before evening stocking would not get finished in time. Now the scene setting is done on to the incident and result.

About 6pm foods manager comes down in to the stockroom to request some extra stuff be pulled for the (overstaffed) team upstairs to get working on, at the time I was rather stressed and had a list of things to get done as long as my arm, so I politely told him to get lost, at which point he started to berate me about not doing my job and that he was going to call the store manager, being fed up I told him to go ahead and see what happens.

I carry on with my list of tasks for half an hour with nothing more said about the extra stock needed, until all of a sudden one of the floor staff from upstairs comes into the stock room asking where to find a list of items (the same one the manager wanted). It was the next day I found out that when the manager had called the store manager she had told him that I was on my own and had enough to do without more being added on and to get one of his staff to do it or do it himself.

2) The bananas - Around christmas the store would be heaving all the time (as most of you probably know), as such you would end up with people wandering in to the other departments to purchase there food, this was never a problem except for loose produce as the scales for weighing them and pricing them were only in the foods area. Anyway arsehole customer (AC) comes up to homewares counter with a bunch of loose bananas and heads straight to pleasant cashiers (PC) till.

AC - "" "" (doesn't say a word just plonks bananas on counter)  
PC - ""Oh i'm sorry sir we don't have any scales in this department so i'm afraid you will need to take these through to the food hall""  
AC - ""This is fucking ridiculous"" (picks bananas up and throws them at PC then just walks out the store)

3) The tongue - Before I worked in operations I worked on the shop floor in foods but would often pop in to the stock room to catch up with a friend of mine (J) or to grab stuff that needed restocking. So one day customer asks me to see if we have more of something in the stockroom, so I head off to see if we do and as I walk into the stockroom to see the operations team leader (OTL) holding the accident book and J stood talking to him as I walk in I start listening to the conversation,

OTL - So J can you explain to me how you got your tongue stuck to the racking in the freezer (Just to not OTL is desperately trying to hide his laughter)  
J - (sounding like he has his mouth full) I'm sorry I was concentrating on what I was doing and when I concentrate I stick my tongue out...  
OTL and other operations staff burst out laughing at this point

It was the middle of lunch rush with lines out the door and I am in the kitchen area helping cook because we were short handed.  One of my cashiers tells me their is a customer with a complaint so I head up front and see an angry looking guy standing at the counter.  On the counter is a burger wrapper with I would say less than 1 sq inch of burger left, a small bite.

The guy tells me that the burger was horrible and practically inedible (yeah, right).  I break in on him before he can make any demands with a big smiles and say, ""I'm terribly sorry sir!  Please understand that we never want you to feel you need to eat a burger that is not up to your expectations.  In the future please feel free to bring the burger up to us and we will be happy to remake it or refund your money!""

We get a lot of rich, entitled customers, but people are generally pretty nice and our managers are great. This story from a couple weeks ago was something else, though.

I was at the register reticketing a few items, and our accessories manager had hopped on a register to help get through the line faster. A woman comes up to her with a return and puts her bag on the counter. My manager reaches in and immediately pulls her hand out like she'd been bitten. A look of total disgust washes over her face and I see her compose herself before telling the customer, ""Ma'am, I can't return your used underwear.""

""Oh, no, not those ones! The other pair in there! Those are mine from yesterday.""

This lady didn't even skip a beat. I would have been mortified if someone had touched my crusty (as per my manager's description), day-old underwear, but she was completely unfazed. She reached into the bag and pulled out a wrinkled pair of underwear with the tag on them.

My manager originally declined the return but after a little bit of debating back and forth, gave in and gave the woman her money back for them. She double bagged them before tossing them in the trash. I saw her in the back five minutes later practically soaking herself in hand sanitizer.","Ma'am, I can't return your used underwear",81

These two stories happened in the last 2 months and just show how easy it is for a table to stand out.

**STORY 1**

Family of 4 comes in, mom, dad and two kids somewhere between 5 and 10, boy and a girl. The kids were being annoying from the moment they sat down. I have 2 young cousins who I am very close with and I understand that it's difficult to keep them under control when one is doing something so exciting as going out to eat. But I felt like these parents were just enforcing the brattiness. They were whining and picky throughout the whole meal. They weren't doing anything wrong per se at first, just being annoying, but then later when I came out to clear their table it started. 

I dropped a little dish with dipping sauce in it (it was plastic, so luckily it didn't break. My hands were pretty full so I couldn't pick it up just then. The mom asked her son to pick it up for me. He gets up and walks over to the dish. Instead of picking it up, he KICKS it at me. Mom and Dad laugh ""oh kids... hahaha"", I say in a somewhat playful voice ""Well that wasn't very nice"", go inside to put the dishes I am holding away and come back to finish clearing up.

When I go back outside the kids are running around the patio, screaming. Parents aren't saying anything of course. I drop the check and finish clearing off the table. As I am about to leave the kids come back up to the table ""Mommy, mommy, look!!"". I look at their hands. They're covered in chalk. In dismay, I look over to the chalk board. One of our staff members goes to art school and is extremely talented. She does an amazing job at designing our chalk boards. This one has a really nice picture of assorted fruits and was advertising our smoothies. 

Well, *had*. The kids had wiped away the the picture, leaving a mess of little finger prints everywhere. ""Ooooops, hahaha, sorry about that"" laugh mom and dad. And they didn't even tip me well after all of that.

**STORY 2**

This just happened last night. A family of three sat down, mom, dad and their little boy, probably around 8 or 9. I bring them their waters and ask if they would like anything else to drink. The little angel asks me ""miss, what kind of sodas do you have?"" After I go through the list he asks in the sweetest little voice ever ""May I please have a Sprite?"". My ovaries just jumped, I don't even have kids and I was about to cry cause the way he asked was so sweet. 

I bring them their drinks and take their food orders. Later in the night when I come to clear the table he says ""Excuse me Miss, can I ask you a question?"" He then proceeds to ask me how many Red Sox games I've been to and then tells me that his parents just told him that the reason they are in Boston tonight is to go to the game, and it's his first World Series game ever. His parents had told them they were going to pick up something at a store, and surprised him during dinner with the tickets. 

As they were leaving the restaurant he comes up to me (I was at another table taking their order at the time) ""Excuse me Miss, have a wonderful night!"" The other table and I can't stop ""d'aaaawwwwww""-ing. That sweet little angel deserves to go to every Red Sox game.

I work in a store that sells themed glass ornaments this time of year, and some kids (and adults) just can't fight the urge to touch them. 

One day I heard a shatter in that general part of the store, so I headed over to see a mom and her 5-ish year old son kneeling on the ground, and I hear the mom scold ""This is why I told you not to touch. Now we're going to pay for this using your birthday money."" 

When a customer breaks something, we usually don't make them pay for it, so I told her this. This is the part that I love. Her response to me was ""No, I told him a few times not to touch, and he didn't listen, so these are the consequences."" 

Parenting A+ in my opinion.

We have adult customers in there who break things and lie to our faces about it, or just don't bother to tell anyone at all and leave shards of glass on the floor until someone sees it. I love that this mom was teaching her son to be honest, and about the consequences of his actions at the same time. I wish more parents were like this one.  ",Another rare example of good parenting,297
Whisker_Biscuits,23,18,1p6nmz,78,"So this is geared more towards my boss than customers. About 7 months ago, I got a new manager who is incompetent, mean, two-faced, lazy, irresponsible, and a HUGE dick. 
   As a prestory example, I am in the Army reserves, so once a month, I can't work for a weekend. Every single drill weekend I have, he schedules me to come in at midnight, which is usually 4 hours after I get done with drill and have been up since 4am. I have had talks with him about it and he literally said ""It's not my problem, I can schedule you whenever I want as long as it's not on your drill dates."" So yeah.

ANYWAYS, on to my main story. Since he has become the manager, he has been firing people left and right, forcing everyone else to work insane overtime. After working a 70 hour week, and I am finally able to get one nights sleep (nightshifter here) I get a call asking where I was. This fucker had changed my schedule after I got off at noon and scheduled me for that night, the only night I had off for 3 weeks. I get into work, obviously pissed off, but I do my work to the standard and get ready to leave when my shift comes to an end. Then he shows up and tells me that he needs to talk to me. As I sit in his office, he describes how I need to get more sleep and I am making this office look bad with my red sleepy eyes and he writes me up for that. Then, he starts to write me up for coming in late, I told him I had no possible way of knowing I was supposed to work since I was not at work when the schedule changed, and we have no access to a schedule outside of work. His response? ""Why didn't you call in to check your schedule?""

I finally got the courage to call HR, who said they have gotten complaints from other employees about him and they are doing an ""investigation"". It has been a month since they said that and I have not heard anything about it.

Arsenault185,16,30,1p6hue,82,"I lived down in El Paso, Texas for a while. Originally being from Maine, I have a certain soft spot in my heart for a nice Maine lobster, and the ones at the grocery store were always suspect. So one year for my birthday, I went to Red Lobster to get my fix. Obviously this place will do in a pinch, but I wanted my lobster done in a certain way they normally don't prepare it. I told my server in advance that I was going to be demanding. He got very nervous at this point, the poor kid. I asked him if the kitchen could accommodate my request. When he said yes, they could, I laid it all out for him.

Normally when you get a live lobster there, they cut it up, sodomize it a little bit, stick it on a plate then expect you to eat it. NOPE. I told them I wanted them to get a pot, fill it with water and add salt. Bring it to a boil, drop that sucker in (more cooking instructions, etc) and that's how I wanted it. So he scurried off to the kitchen to give the order. A minute later he came back and asked if I wanted it cut and cleaned, and I told him no. From the tank to the pot. 

I also told my sever that I wanted some ""napkins"", by which I meant the cloths they wipe tables with, as a real Mainer eating lobster can get messy. Oh, yeah, I'm also going to need a bowl for all the parts and pieces. Off to the manager he went to find out if he could do that. I swear it was his first day, he was so nervous. 

A little later when he brought my plate out to me, he told me the *entire* kitchen staff, plus the bus boys and whatever servers were not busy, all gathered around the pot as my dinner went in. They were all curious to know if the screaming lobster tales were true. They had all been wondering for a long time, and were very happy to finally get their answer. 

God the mess. If you have never seen someone eat a lobster that knows what they are doing, picture cookie monster let loose in a Mrs. Fields.

They browsed for a bit, and every once in a while I would listen in. The mom kept asking the daughters if they had enough money for what they were buying and the girls would think it over and answer. 

When they picked out the items they wanted to buy (two Disney Infinity characters and a game) and my coworker told them their total, the mom turned to the oldest daughter.

""You're paying for these with your birthday money. Do you remember how much money you have?"" When the daughter shook her head, the mom pulled out her money and slowly counted it with her daughter, letting the daughter add up the 20 dollar bills. When the girl had decided she had $80, my coworker reminded her that she owed $65. The mom asked her if she had enough money to pay for her new toys. The daughter replied yes really hesitantly, and her mom encouraged her to be confident in her answer. So the daughter handed the money to my coworker, who rang up the transaction, gave her the change and helped her count it out. 

The daughter thanked us and began to leave, carrying the bag, but the mom stayed behind to thank us. She was trying to help her daughter understand the concept of money and its value, and at other places, cashiers would get impatient with how long it took the daughter to count her money and decide if it was enough.

BadgerSixTwo,4,5,1p6b9b,19,"Before I had the... ""delight"" of working in tourism, I used to teach guitar so I'd have some extra money in high school. I got my start through my town's community education program and I eventually started lessons without them.

A side story: I found out I was ""fired"" from community education when the seasonal schedule came out and another guy's name was in it, charging twice as much too. Apparently the school district wanted a larger 25% cut. But I digress.

This may belong in r/TeacherTales, but I think it fits better here.

Background: One day before my community ed class starts, a woman comes in and asks about guitar lessons. She wants me to teach guitar to her two kids at the local hotel they own/operate/manage/live in etc.

Kid 1 is was a 7th grade girl and Kid 2 was a 4th grade boy. The problems were 1. She's a 7th grade girl and didn't want to learn guitar, and 2. Cheapo parents only bought one guitar and kid 2 (the one who showed interest) was left handed. Since Kid 1 (""Girl"") wasn't interested (even though she was talented), I said I'd restring it for ""Boy"" if they bought strings from a store two minutes from the hotel.

Story: for the entire month of November, they don't buy strings, so I teach him theory and finger placement for chords, which all sound bad because the strings are backwards for him. When I go to settle up for a month of lessons, they start to barter with me. I relent because I agreed that without proper strings, they didn't really get their money's worth. I leave with them telling me next week they'll have strings, I'll get my November check, and Girl will be back in lessons.

I never did get my November check.

Girl shows up for ten minutes and leaves, never to return, so I focus on getting strings for Boy, and they don't. End of December comes and I go to settle up for December. Again, the parents try to haggle for a deal, but I say no. They already didn't pay once. He gives me a stern look as he hands me my December check for the full amount.

January rolls around. Again, at the end of the month I get a promise they'll have my check and strings next week.

The first lesson in February rolls around and I finally talk the dad into getting strings. Half an hour later he gets back and I restring the guitar in time for me to leave.

That weekend I decide I'm going to quit, so I have my mom swing by on our way home. I go inside and both parents are behind the desk. I tell them I quit because they owed me money and it how everything was a fight with them, from getting strings to dealing with their daughter and I wasn't going to put up with it anymore. the Dad tells me I didn't earn my November or January check because I didn't teach anybody. I told him it was his fault because he didn't get strings and then just walked out.

Something I noticed: this family was Indian-American. I'm the one who posted the story about Indian-Americans not understanding the buy 2 get one free deal. I may be cursed.

KaliRaven,22,12,1p6axr,49,"So, I've been in customer service for about six years now and have worked my way through high school and now through college. I've oddly seen not too many crazy customers, rude yes, but not crazy since manners are a bit of a thing in the south. But I finally worked up the galls to tell of a brat who FINALLY made me break a code of ethic in retail, snapping back.

To start off, 99% of the time I am a model employee. I keep to myself, do my job, stay out of drama, and go home. I do my job without complaining most of the time and I always year that smile that you can't tell is fake or real. I always say ""Yes, ma'am. No sir"" and such. I make customers feel welcome without the conveying the inner thought of ""I hate you all so much. Go away.""

That being said, here we go: 
I'm selling tickets (box, for non theater employees) in the larger of the two theaters in town. A group of five teens comes up to me and all purchase their tickets separate for an R rated movie., nothing too unusual. I am one, however, of the sticklers for checking ID unlike some of the other employees and managers because I don't want to risk getting fired. I get to the third boy in line.

Me: And if I can just see your ID please.

Him: Why do you need my ID?

Me: Because the movie is rated R. It's federal law that I check it or you be accompanied by an adult over 21.

Him: Well, I don't have it.

Me: Well, I'm terribly sorry but we have a strict ""No ID, no sale"" policy here.

By now the boys around him are groaning and looking irritated, oddly enough at him. The boy looks away, huffs, and then grins like he has a million dollar idea.

Him: *badly flirting* Come on, you won't lose your job. Do it, just for me? Come on!

Me: *still professional and a little irritated* As I said before, no ID, no sale. Come back with a valid state issued driver's license and I'll sale you the ticket.

By now about six to seven groups and families and now standing behind these kids and are getting more irritated by the second with more still streaming in. After all, we did get two new highly anticipated movies the day before.

Him: Seriously?!

The group wanders off for about five minutes while I furiously deal with the line they caused. The boys then comes back and the obviously underage one shoves a plain card in my face and in the second he had it there I read fishing license, noticed it was from Jersey (and we're in Oklahoma), and that it had no picture.

Him: *snapping at me like I'm a dog* There! That has my birthday on it! Now sell me the ticket.

Now, at this point I could have taken the fishing license. The nicer manager was on shift tonight but not only did he try and scam me but now he's talking to me like some mangy mutt. So you know what? Screw him. He can wait until it comes out on DVD with all of the other underage brats.

Me: Sorry. I still can't. I don't know if that actually belongs to you because it has no picture and I said Driver's License. That could be someone else's for all I know.

Him: JUST SELL ME THE TICKET!

By now I'm stressed and agitated and do something I have never done in the six years I've been in retail, snap back.

Me: *leaning over the computer* Look! No amount of yelling is going to get me to sell you the ticket, okay?! 

*By now I have a grin coming across my face like a psycho.* 
""Bring. Back. Your. License. And I will sell you the ticket. It's rated R for a reason.""

Him: WHATEVER! Have an awful day! Just whatever.

The stern general manager comes out from the back and asked what that was all about.

Me:Oh, some kid tried to threaten me for a ticket to an R movie. You know, whatever.

FredFltStn,49,236,1p6aku,468,"When I was 17, I got my first real job as a delivery driver with a national red roofed pizza chain. The hours and pay were terrible, but I've always been an over achiever, so i worked hard and quickly rose to assistant manager. 


I was excited...until I figured out the promotion actually meant longer hours, more responsibility, and a set salary, rather than hourly pay. There were some weeks where I figured out i was actually making around $3.50/hour with all of the hours I was working. Still, I did my best, figuring at least I had a job.


The manager of my restaurant was two years older than I was. He had actually started as a driver at that very same restaurant. Apparently, he had knocked up one of the waitresses shortly after he had started, and after a shotgun wedding, they were happily married with a baby. The owner of the franchise had either felt sorry for him or taken a shine to him, either way, he had quickly risen to manager at the restaurant. 


I've seriously just spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how to sum up this manager in writing. As an alternative, I'm simply going to list a series of adjectives that best describe him. Incompetent, sexist, thief, cheater, misogynist, liar, irrational, narcissistic, dimwitted, perverted, lazy, incompetent. I realize I listed incompetent twice, but one really didn't seem to do him justice.


Unfortunately, this gem of a manager drove away all but the most hard-core or insane help. shortly after they were hired. I would go to the trouble of interviewing and hiring help, only to have him quickly drive them away. My favorite was the waitress I hired who never even bothered to show up. She had been warned about the manager by a friend after I hired her, and was smart enough to abandon the job.


After six months of working split shifts &amp; 60-70 hours per week, I was ready to abandon the job as well, but I couldn't bring myself to quit. I had never quit a job before, and my 18-year-old brain decided it would be better to be fired then to quit. Unfortunately my manager knew that he was screwed without me, and I under estimated his resolve to keep me there.


For some reason, I felt loyal to the hourly employees, and I didn't want to just not show up for shifts and make their lives worse. In retrospect, I attribute this to Stockholm syndrome. Instead, I began to act out while I was working.


If a customer was rude or of obnoxious to my staff, I would tell him off and throw him out. If you complained about our delivery times, I would cordially tell you to order your god damn pizza from somebody else. If your children ran around the restaurant screaming, I would offer to have them muzzled. My incompetent manager thought all of these things WERE HILARIOUS!


One busy Friday night we ran out of clean plates, cups, and silverware. Normally, the drivers would wash dishes between runs, but of course they were out on deliveries, and the manager had no intention of washing dishes. As I'm standing in front of the dish sink trying to catch up, a stack of pizza pans falls over into the sink and drenches me. I am officially at the end of my rope.


While I am not proud of what happened next, I feel it is pertinent to the story, so I'm going to include it. I can only hope my mother never sees this.


I stripped off my wet clothes and continued to wash dishes, wearing only my shoes and an apron. The manager came back to get clean plates and saw me in my new dishwashing attire. He looked shocked for all of two seconds and then busted out laughing. The rest of the staff took turns coming back to see what was so funny. Thank God this was before the invention of camera phones.


I was officially a broken man. I figured that if this didn't get me fired, nothing would. I arranged to take a few days off, and one week later two friends and I left for a 3 day spring break vacation in Florida. All three of us desperately needed some time away.


On the day we arrived, we drove by the Disney casting center, where job interviews for potential Disney employees took place. On a whim, we pulled into the parking lot, went into the building, and all filled out applications.  After hours of waiting, we were all interviewed. I decided not to put ""naked dishwasher"" as part of my experience. 


24 years later, two of us are still employed by the Walt Disney Company. The third person eventually moved back home to get married to her high school sweetheart and raise a family.


I quit my pizza job from a pay phone in Florida after we had gotten the news that we were all hired at Disney. The pizza restaurant manager cried during the call. I never washed dishes naked at work again. ""At work"".

3) when they ask for a manager, and I tell them I am the manager, they say I am not because they know my Uncle who is manager, and my Dad who is owner.

Back at my days at a women's store, we had a push one month about American made things.  There was this whole display with some of the American made products we carried with little bio blurbs of the company.

Early one day, I get a customer in who asks about the American made stuff.  I show her over, giving her the sales pitch on evrything.

I gesture to one blurb and comment about how the product was made in New Mexico.

She bristles, saying she thought I said these were American made products.  I assume that she misheard me, so I repeat, emphasizing NEW Mexico.

""I don't care what you call it!"" she responds.  

I realize that the woman is just stupid, but she's also angry.  I try to repeat myself, adding ""as in Santa Fe?"" but she has started to rant about us having to sell American made products and false advertising.  At this point I decide my best course of action isn't to correct her, but to just nod my head, make a placating noise and move on.

She leaves and the day goes on.  We have a line at registers, and I am doing some managerial thing behind the counter.  Suddenly I hear the murmur of indignant upper middle class women.

The woman from earlier that day was cutting to the front of the line.  She leveled a finger at me accusingly and said I had embarrassed her.  Her friend had just informed her that New Mexico was a state in the USA, was this true?

Not knowing how else to answer I just said ""yes.""

She narrowed her eyes at me ""I am never shopping here again."" and flounces out.

There's a stunned silence, then one of the other women in line if she had really just left as a customer because of a state?

I could have explained the situation, but it was funnier not doing so, so I just said ""yes"" again and we all went on with our days.",Geography: The way to customer loss,171
detourxp,22,72,1p5x5q,428,"I work at a general entertainment park, a place with go-karts, mini golf, an arcade and other misc. rides and attractions. To start, i would like to point out that at the time of this story, i was 18 and the youngest manager at this park. 

We do not get very busy during the week, meaning we have a very small daily labor budget. The MOD usually ends up very stressed trying to complete all of the daily chores with only a few employees and keeping the guests happy at the same time. The managers almost always (if they're at least halfway decent) help out by taking out trash and cleaning tables or cooking kitchen orders at the snack bar. 

On this particular day, i was helping the employee stationed at the snack bar clean the cafe as quickly as possible. I'm wearing sanitary gloves and taking out the 5 trash cans that the staff on the previous day left full (boy do i have stories of lazy employees). A guest comes by looking slightly angry, so i set down the bin and ask if there's anything i could help her with. She scoffs and says ""No, i don't think you could."" 

I understand how my appearance could give her the impression that i'm just a trash bitch, so i kindly tell her that i'm actually the manager.

""Sure you are sweetie"" she said as she walks past me without looking me in the eye. She walks up to the other employee, who is ~30 years old, and starts to make various complaints about our park and how we shouldn't be charging as much as we are and blah blah blah. Finally at the end of her rant she adds ""And that bus boy was very rude to me and i would like to talk to your manager.""

""Uh... What bus boy?""

*sigh* ""THAT guy"" as she poins her finger towards me

the woman working with me starts to smile and says ""I'll grab my manager right away ma'am.""

The guest looks at me with smirk as the employee walks from behind the counter and walks towards me and says ""There's a customer complaint sir.""

I walk forward and say ""Hi how can i help you i'm the manager."" The look on her face was pure embarrassment and shame. After that it was pretty anticlimactic.

Retailslave22,33,43,1p5syd,153,"A little background:  I used to work at a women's boutique in a vibrant neighborhood which included, among other things, a breakfast/lunch restaurant which served the most delicious cinnamon rolls the size of your head.  One night I came in for the last hour for training with the head manager(HM), which thus began what I refer to as ""The Cinnamon Roll Story"" 

*I get to the store a little early and proceed to the break room, where one of the night salespeople (Beth) is taking her break.  I spot a box of dozen cinnamon rolls on the table from the aforementioned neighborhood restaurant*

Me: Hey, what's up with the cinnamon rolls?

Beth: Oh, a waiter from across the street brought them by for us.  They were closing and couldn't sell the rest. HM offered one to me, but I didn't want it.

Me: Hm, I'll ask HM if I can have one.

*I go out onto main floor*

Me: Hey, HM, could I have a cinnamon roll?

HM: *rolls eyes. . .ssssssiiiiiiiiggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh* I guess. . .

I’m a bit taken aback, as her response seems more appropriate to if I’d, say, asked her to donate a kidney to my sister’s niece’s ex-boyfriend and she felt morally compelled to comply.  At this point, Beth had come back from the floor and was listening in on the conversation.

Me: Are you sure it's okay?  Did you buy them for something?

HM:  Well. . . noooooo. . .but they're for my dad. . . .

Mind you, these things are enormous.  There are 12 of them.  They were given to the store. They are not hers.  And I’m positive that the waiter didn’t come in and designate that the recipient be the paternal donor of half the HM’s genetic make up. A this point, she is being so absurd that I feel I must stubbornly continue.  On principle.

Me:  So, may I have one?

HM:  *deep siiiiigggggggghhhhhhhh*(As though my wish to have eat a singular cinnamon roll was the greatest and most inconvenient burden ever placed upon her in the history of the world. . .and also, in some way, an unreasonable request and her behavior was totally warranted)  ""I guess. .  .""

Me: All right.  *I proceed to go to the backroom and take one out of the box and note that the frosting is in a separate container* Can I have some frosting?

In a gesture that is becoming more-and-more annoying, HM lets out another long continuous sigh approximately 11.3 seconds long.  She incorporates 1 or 2 eye rolls and another long, drawn out sigh 2 octaves lower than her normal vocal range and replies:

""I guess, but don't take too much."" 

Beth and I are giving each other WTF?  glances all throughout the conversation.  Not one to back down, I heat up a cinnamon roll in the store microwave.  It is wonderful.

tl;dr I make a simple request to eat a cinnamon roll that spirals into the pettiest and most passive-aggressive battle between employee and manager known to man. I get to eat the cinnamon roll.  It tasted like victory.

job_van_dam,27,2,1p5lfr,40,"Hey everyone. 

I work in one of the larger electronic based retail stores in the US. My role in the store is specific to tech support. I like my job and I genuinely enjoy helping people with educational/technical issues. 

From time to time jerks come in for help. I realize this isn't specific to my job, it happens to everyone in retail. Usually I handle them very well and don't let whatever stick is up their behind get to me. Sometimes they do and I usually let it go before my shift has ended. 

Yesterday was hands down the worst I've ever been treated by a customer. This man was without a doubt the most self entitled, ignorant, rude, stubborn, selfish, JERK I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Throughout the entire interaction he was calling attention to himself by whinging, cursing, sighing super loud, and insulting me/my company/the product he had purchased from us. I even warned him twice that if he didnt calm down I would walk away. I made it clear that I was not the cause of his displeasure and that I was doing my absolute best to help him. Regardless of that he threw a temper tantrum that would put a four year old to shame, threw his product at me, and legit screamed at the top of his lungs for a manager. At this point I went directly to the back room to avoid getting myself fired. 

I want to retaliate. I have his phone number, email address, and mailing address. I've never felt this desire before in the three years doing this job. This jerk has got it coming. I'm just curious if anyone else has been in a similar situation before and gotten back at a jerk customer. ",Do you ever retaliate against jerk customers?,42

I end up DRIVING two hours on my day off to a nearby store to try and find this dvd for the customer. Open the case, the disc is missing. Go figure. I tell the customer all I went through to try and help him get this set he wanted, and he tells me just to order him another. (Each time I have to damage out the set he decides ""isn't good""). I told him ""I'll just refund your money. I really can't keep re-ordering the same title over and over again and damaging it out. There's clearly an issue with the packaging so I'll be more than happy to refund you.""

He called my home office and put in a complaint on me because he ""didn't feel I went out of my way to help him as a customer."" He told them he felt I should have ""done more"". (Because driving 2 hours on my day off to another store is doing nothing)

WALL OF TEXT AND POSSIBLE MOBILE FORMATTING INCOMING


Background: I am an LSS, or Livestock Shot Specialist. Sort of like in-home tech support, I go to various ranches, barns, etc, and give shots to livestock. ""But wait, this isn't retail!"" Not specifically, but there is an extensive amount of customer service that goes on and experiences similar to retail, so I hope the great mods and people of /r/TalesFromRetail will allow this.

*On to the story*

I get a call from a prospective client (We'll call her AC or Asshole Client), who wants some shots given to pigs. The conversation goes like this:

AC: Hello, I would like for you to give shots for my son's local 4-H group. There are a total of 18 pigs and they all need these shots: Tetanus, Tylosin, and Oxytetracycline. Could you do this?

Me: I would be happy to, just give me the amounts of each medication you want me to order, I'll submit the order and we can plan the date.

AC: 100ml Tetanus, 75ml Tylosin, 150ml Oxytetracycline.

Me: OK, I will write up an invoice, fax it to you for approval, and submit the order. The total for the medication will be $xxx.xx, the biohazard disposal fee is $x, my fees are $xxx.xx, and the needles/syringes will be $x.xx, for a total of xxx.xx.

AC agrees, I fax the invoice, she signs it, I go about ordering the stuff. Cue shot day.

I have a waiver that is filled out for each animal before I even take out the syringes/meds, so that if something unrelated happens to the animal, they can't just blame me. This scares AC which is somewhat normal. Then I show her and the kids who own the pigs the medication I brought, how to calculate the dosage, etc. Then this happens:

AC: Where is the Mycoplasma shot? I specifically asked for Mycoplasma.

Me: I'm sorry miss, but on the invoice you signed there is no mention of Mycoplasma.

AC: WELL THESE ANIMALS NEED MYCOPLASMA SHOTS! I DEMAND YOU FIX THIS!

Me: If you'd like, I can order mycoplasma and have it here in 5 business days. The cost is $xxx.xx plus $xx.xx freight charge. My fee will be $xx.xx.

AC: OH HELL NO! YOU ARE GOING TO GET THE MYCOPLASMA TODAY AND GIVE THE SHOTS TODAY, AND I WILL NOT BE PAYING FOR YOUR MISTAKE.

Note: My supplier is in Alabama, while I am in California. This lady couldn't pay me enough to ""just go get it.""

Me: Miss I apologize, but I cannot render services or purchase medications without compensation. I'm 15. Livestock shots can be dangerous and complicated, that's why you hired me. Please let me do my job.

AC: I WILL NOT LET YOU TOUCH OUR PIGS UNLESS YOU HAVE MYCOPLASMA.

Me: I am a paid employee, not your child. If you do not stop interfering with my job, then I will be forced to leave for safety concerns, and you will still be liable for payment, minus the biohazard fee, services rendered, and needle charges.

AC: THAT'S BULLSHIT WE WILL JUST GIVE THE SHOTS OURSELVES (Referring to a bunch of teenagers in the group with 0 training.)

Me: Suit yourself, but I must advise you of the risks of doing this without training.

*Cue bio security spiel*

AC: That's fine, we will just do that. *Proceeds to grab MY medications and MY syringes and start filling them*

Me: Ma'am, those supplies are my property and you do not have permission to use them. You can pay for the supplies if you wish, but they are not free.

AC: You billed me so they're mine.

Me(Giving up): Ok I understand your logic, since you cancelled my services the day of, you just have to pay my fees of $xxx.xx plus the other fees we discussed. (I charged fees such that I was still getting paid the same amount minus my services rendered fees)

AC: That's much more reasonable, you should have done that to begin with. *Hands money*

Me: Have a lovely day, goodbye.

AC: Um, what about my mycoplasma? You still have to get that for me.

Me: You fired me. I don't HAVE to do anything for you.

gehjl,19,54,1p4szv,247,"I saw the story about someone not believing they were the manager because they're a girl.  Well being a girl isn't the only thing that'll make them not believe you're a manager.

A bit of backstory: I've posted a story here before and it was from the same location.  I worked in a cash advance booth inside a casino, we dealt with getting people money off their debit/credit cards or cashed checks, but we weren't employed by the casino.  We were a 3rd party company working inside.  We had our own set of policies. I worked there for a bit over a year till I was promoted to manager and was around 25 at the time.  But I look a lot younger than my age, probably 20-21.

We had 2 locations inside the casino, the big main one and a small booth inside the High Roller section.  Didn't need anything special to get in the high roller section, just all the machines were a lot more expensive.  That booth is manned by 1 or 2 people, depending on the day &amp; time.  So I get a call from the employee saying there's a guy there asking to talk to a manager.  I start walking over there and when I get there, the disbelieving customer (DC) comes up to me and goes:

DC: Are you the manager?

Me: Yes, how can I help you?

DC: You're not the manager, you're too young to be the manager.  There must be someone else.  Get me someone else!

Me: Well I am the manager and I'm the only manager on shift right now.  If you want, you can wait for the general supervisor, she'll be in at 8am.  (It was around 1am at the moment).

DC: This is unbelievable, there's gotta be someone else that can help me.

I wasn't aware of it, but there was another person, normal customer (NC), that asked to see the manager while I was walking in between booths.

NC: *interrupts DC* Well you can help me if he doesn't want it!

Me: Sure, what's the problem?

Turns out he used the ATM and if you don't select the right choice or you go over your daily cash withdrawal limit, it'll process the transaction as a Point of Sale, allowing you to go over your withdrawal limit, with a higher fee.  Of course there's notices that come up before it does that, but I mean what kind of people actually read the ATM's notices right?  Well if it does that, it sends you to the cashiers (us) to get your money and we'll need your card and ID.  Turns out his ID was expired by a few weeks and technically we aren't allowed to process the transaction.  He wasn't an asshole, explained the situation, was nice so I made the call to process the transaction for him.  Us voiding the transaction would put his money in processing for 4-5 days, so I try to help out nice people with minor issues.  Had his ID been expired for months/years (I've seen those), I wouldn't have processed it.  Either way, I told the cashier to put the expiration date as today and we'll process this one as a courtesy. I tell him what happens if we void it and if he comes back again, we won't be able to help him out.  I've had that happen as well, processed one out of courtesy and they come back saying ""Well they did it for me an hour ago, just do it again now!"".  It's great seeing their faces when they ask for the manager and they see it's me again.  I void the transaction and send em on their way.

I start walking back to the main booth when DC starts calling after me.

DC:  Wait, wait.  Maybe you can help me.

He explains the situation to me.  He used the ATMs and had to see us to get his cash, but he didn't have is ID on him.  Again, technically we wouldn't be able to process the transaction for people in this circumstance, but I knew who he was, came in here often, and was a VIP for the casino.  Ultimately I had the choice to help him out or not.  I knew the casino has copies of VIP IDs in their system, so I went over to them and asked if I can get a copy of his ID.  They printed a copy of his ID for us, I gave it to the cashier in our booth, and told him to use this for tonight.  I explained to DC that we'll use that for tonight, but this is a courtesy and we won't do it again next time.  He thanks me and heads off to throwing his money away in slot machines.

Great way to start my shift that day...

On a side note, I truly hate entitled VIPs.  Any slight inconvenience and they'd start making a scene, getting their casino host, and sometimes even the floor manager to come and try to solve their issue.  Since we didn't work for the casino, that meant diddly squat to us.  No greater pleasure then telling someone no after all that ruckus and watching their host explain to them that we don't work for the casino and they have no control.

She also refused to share the rest of the treats on the appointed day because it was ""evidence"". 
Then when one employee admitted (after denying it) to eating some of the popcorn, she heavily implied that I was the other culprit. So the manager and assistant came back to me and demanded to know if I had in fact taken the popcorn. When I again denied it, I was AGAIN questioned if the other employee had acted ""suspicious"" or had enough time in the back to eat the popcorn?

I have been accused of being ""hostile"" when I inquired about a ""prize"" I had earned. 

I have been accused of assisting an employee in finding a second job at the same location my girlfriend works. When I said no, it was a coincidence I was told if I had it would be ""really underhanded"". 

I have had to listen to the lamentations of the ""betrayal"" of this same employee who took a second part time job. This employee was getting 10 hours a week, after asking for more she was moved up to 12. So she took a second job that is 11-2 M-F. THis leaves her open 4-CL M-F and OPEN AVAILABILITY on Sat &amp; Sun. . . . for part time that is amazing availability. But the manager can only lament that she has more hours than she can spend for November and December, and this employee would have been issued more hours! How could she do this to us?

My question is what about January and February? I've worked retail long enough to know that it rains hours in November and December, and those hours dry up in January. Better to find that second job now. 

So all this winds up to, after the job assistance accusation I was given the ""It's not you, it's me"" speech. I was told that she (the manager) has a hard time ""trusting people"" because she's been ""burned so often"". So she knows she's been unfairly hard on me, but it's just a trust thing that she has to work through. 

So . . . let me get this straight. I am being shat upon because she is unable to trust me, even though I did nothing wrong. And the only thing that I can do is wait it out and hope she is able to find a way to trust me? 

That doesn't really work for me. So when my new job search ends in success I will have to give her the ""It's not me, it's you"" speech. ","It's not you, it's me.",107
krustywazoo,11,14,1p4fc7,79,"This happened yesterday. While I usually work stock, I was working a cash shift yesterday. I had to go out to the storage room to toss a few boxes of spoiled milk customers returned. When I was walking back to my till, I heard someone call out ""HEY SONNY"" from around the egg cooler. (The coolers are by the back end of the store, near our storage room.)

I turned around and asked if I could help him. He asked if we had any more eggs. I told him that we never. He then went on a tirade about how small the eggs were. ""They're awful small for large eggs, aren't they?,"" he exclaimed. I told him that I don't control the egg size; further, I told them that all the eggs we have are the same size. He tried to argue with me a bit more. I knew trying to re-explain this to him was going to be an exercise in futility, so I politely shrugged it off, then went back to my till.

When I came back to my till, he was one of the first customers I served. He again started on his ""OMG THE EGGS ARE TOO SMALL"" bit. The other cashier overheard his complaints, and asked ""what are you complaining about? We aren't chickens. We can't make eggs. All of our eggs are the same size. If you were so worried about the size of the eggs, you wouldn't be buyin' them.""

He sort of laughed it off and bought the eggs (while still complaining about their size), then came back to buy a couple more dozen. Customers, man. ",The Egg Man,93
simpleahmazing,24,42,1p4f6d,246,"Long time reader, first time poster so please forgive any errors! 

For years, I worked for a well known pharmacy in the front portion of the store. Being a pharmacy, we got our share of crazies and shoplifters. This story, however, is about a thankful customer. 

I'm sure all of you are familiar with ""truck day"" while working retail. This particular story occurs during ours. I was stocking the bulk paper products, which happened to be located near the drink coolers. We'll label me as, well, **me**. The customer will be **C**.

**C**: ""Do you have any more bottles of your brand of water? It is the cheapest and it's all I can afford.""

**Me**: ""Well, we just got our shipment in for the week, I can check the back if there is any there. Can you wait just a minute?"" *And I do mean wait, as the back room gets to darn jam packed with our shipments that sometimes I have to climb over stuff to get anywhere*.

I've never seen someone so pleased to see a warm bottle of water, but to be fair is was summer, and I'm in Florida. It gets hot. Anyways, she goes to pay for her water, and I go back to happily (kind of) stocking our bulk paper when I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turned around expecting a creeper to be there (because that's definitely happened in the past) and it's the water lady. 

**C**: ""What's your name?""

**Me**: ""Oh, it's simpleahmazing. Was there a problem?""

**C**: ""What can I do for you?"" 

**Me**: Oh no. She's going to be a creeper. ""With what, ma'am?"" I have a very good earnest look I can pull off, must be my Midwestern roots. 

**C**: ""How can I recognize you? You really made my day, finding that water for me. I appreciate it so much. Can I tell your manager?""

**Me**: ""Actually, I'm the manager on duty. But thanks so much! I'm glad I could help you.""

**C**: ""No. That's not enough. Can I call your corporate office?""

**Me**: One of our goals is obviously to get great customer feedback. Of course I'll hand over our customer service number. ""Of course, ma'am. You can call 1-800-OURSTORE. They might ask you for our store number, so here it is.""

She spent about a half hour on the phone with our customer service telling them how awesome I was. I had no idea what all she told them (and I kind of feel bad that the customer service rep had to sit there and listen for so long) but it pretty much made my day. And made me wonder how badly she'd been treated before that getting a warm bottle of water made her that happy.

BlueLily54,22,26,1p4ejt,171,"I just wanted to get this off my chest. The recently hired operations manager at my store has been a jerk to me since he started. I don't know what I did to make him unhappy with me, but no matter what I do my customer service and job performance are never good enough. I got nothing but positive remarks on my evaluations until he got there, and now all of a sudden I'm a bad employee. My hours have been cut, I've been refused opportunities to branch into other departments to pick up more, and I'm at the end of my rope. 

Yesterday I got there for my measly 3 hour shift to find out I was only there to clean the registers. I was not scheduled as a cashier at all. Just to clean the registers (we have a ""cleaning crew"" that probably hasn't touched them since the store opened 10-15 years ago). About halfway through my shift, I get called into the office. Apparently a customer survey came back from the day before saying the cashier that checked them out (I was the only one there at the time) appeared ""distracted and disinterested."" So, I had been written up with no chance to discuss it with a manager to resolve the situation. 

Maybe having me straighten up and clean the registers, attempt to greet every customer, face and stock the first aisle, and answer the phone when I'm the only cashier and there's maybe one other employee to help if I get busy isn't such a good idea. I don't know, maybe they were rude to me and put me off. I don't say anything more than necessary to those people to reduce the chance they could report me for smarting off. 

Either way, he immediately jumped to disciplinary action without discussing it with me first. He also took the liberty of saying that I was gloomy, uncooperative, and unfriendly towards my coworkers because I didn't hear him ask me something as I walked out the door that day.

I just don't understand what I've done wrong. I try to be nice and helpful to everyone, and I truly did enjoy my job and working with everyone there until this manager started singling me out. I just can't deal with it anymore. I'm giving the store manager (whom I've always gotten along well with) my two week notice today.

Back when I worked at a Bookstore (part of a chain that No Longer Exists due to the owner family suing themselves into oblivion), we would get some really weird calls.

One day, I answered the phone to this:

Me: Good afternoon, this is Tiara Books, Thornnuminous speaking. How may I help you?

Dude: ""Uh...yeah...um...do you have any books about masturbation?""

Me: (in my head) oh shit, here we go.

Me: (Out loud, and brightly) ""Why, yes, Sir, we do. The computer shows that we have a copy of Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving by Betty Dodson.""

Dude: (a bit breathy, and slightly startled) ""Oh...oh...you do...could you...tell me about it?""

Me: (bright and chipper, as FAR from sexy as I could manage) ""Well, it's a self help book written by feminist Betty Dodson. She also offers classes for groups in New York.""

I sort of hoped 'feminist' would be a damper, as it sometimes is for jerks who happen to be male. No such luck.

Dude: (breathing heavier, lots of rustling noises) ""Oh...that sounds...good...um....*pant* what else?""

Me: (still brightly but getting a bit brittle) ""WELL...I haven't read it. Do you want to come to the store ((*oh god please no*)) and see the copy?""

Dude: (slight moan, soft pant) ""Um...I can't right now.""

Me: (In my head) Jesus tapdancing christ...

Stickmanslim,15,15,1p3y3a,10,"Edit: sorry for misleading title...cant change it &gt;.&lt;

So, hi all and welcome back. I have made a few posts and put my background there but I am too lazy to link it at the moment so here it goes.

Background: I work in a retail / entertainment environment. We try to make shopping a unique experience, be it a party or walk in guests. We specialize in certain toys and I really cannot give any more specific details without making it too easy to guess. 

Story:

So this was a day just like any other. Kids come in and go with their stuff, and I am just happily watching the clock waiting til the glorious time that we lower our mall store gate and leave this crazy place ( I love my job I swear, it is just some days....). So I have a group of 4 come in. 3 teen girls and I guess one of their mothers. They each select a toy and as we are personalizing them we do a special 'ceremony' or ritual if you will. 
-Side note- I am a mid 20 year old male, and the only male working at my store at the time. This is important to remember.
So, I instruct the girls to do a certain step and one misunderstood basic human anatomy, and put a piece of this toy where it really shouldn't be....reference the title of my post..

Now being the only guy in a child's toy store has taught me a lot about double standards when it comes to my communication with kids. I was not about to get fired or be labeled ""pedophile"" for any reason whatsoever. So I ignore this bit of the interaction and continue on...BUT...the mother will not do the same. Here is the dialogue (edited a bit to try and hide store identity...pft)
Me: (right after the incident) ok, and next you can go and do this before checking out today-
Mom: HAHAHA, she put it on her boobie : turning to daughter; That is NOT your heart...
Me:.....(oh god why)...
Mom: :to me: it's ok, her toy will be ""blessed""
Me: (i rarely get speechless at work but I try to make light of it...) Oh, ok, well that just about sums it up for this part, I will see you all at check out, have fun!
 
Thank heavens I was working with my manager that knows me very well and how I conduct myself around people...So I tell her I need a minute to grab a monster before closing. She got the hint and let me run off to hide for a few minutes. (I really didn't mind ringing them up, but honestly I was in no mood to even hear about some teenage girl who looked under the age of 18 and her 'blessed' toy). On my way back to the store I had to arrive just as they were leaving and the mother....MOTHER....had to yell at me from all the way across the (thank god) empty mall walkway ""THANK YOU STICKMANSLIM, MY DAUGHTER WILL REALLY ENJOY HER BOOB BLESSED TOY!!!!""

I had to explain myself to my manager....who basically just laughed and said she was glad it was me and not her that dealt with them..My job might be...unusual...but at least I have enough rep. with my managers to cover my ass in these kind of situations, I just lose a little piece of myself every time....

TheAmazingFailure,8,15,1p3xmq,114,"Tonight I had a somewhat regular customer come in and beeline straight to me at the register. Usually this just means a return and it's no big deal. However, this was nothing of the sort.

PolarisX,6,6,1p3xc8,23,"This story/concept is from back when I worked at a deli counter at a higher end store. 

This story here prompted me to write it out http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1p3vy4/never_assume_never_assume_and_do_you_know_why/

We used to make ""Store Baked Ham"" that people went bonkers for. All we did was take a domestic ham, put some glaze, cut X's through the top with a knife, on it and throw it in an oven for a few hours and jack the price up a few bucks. It was okay at best, and over cooked at worst. This also meant I had even MORE types of ham than normal (We did two kinds of ""our own""). I think we had about twelve in total when I left. The ""Store Baked Ham"" was wildly popular along with the cheapest domestic ham. We had literally about ~8 feet of just ham display, with two tiers on each of them. Not counting any cured hams that we had to store separate because they were so huge.

The thing that got me was that people would ask for a pound of ham. Which would spiral into this...

Customer - I'd like a pound of ham

Me - What kind of ham would you like today?

Customer - The ham.

... The Ham ... A beast only know to those with spinning death blades and a pile of cheese dust 4"" tall. A mammoth creature of pork, salt, along with a mix of dead hopes and dreams.

Me : What kind of ""The Ham""?

Customer - Uh, regular... What kind do you have?

Me - Well, a whole lot... (I'd list them all if I wasn't dead tired.)

Sometimes people wouldn't care and make me pick, some people would just say the cheap one, and some people would just actually get confused and order something else. We seriously stocked way too much. The samples were totally out of control. Lets just say we had a lot of cheap ham sandwiches in the case a few times a month.

To this day I still joke with an old co worker who left shortly after I did about ""The Ham"". We had talked about starting a brand of ham called ""The Ham"" to instantly take all the sales when customers requested... You guessed it ""THE HAM"".",The Ham!,29

iwrotedabible,11,15,1p3vy4,80,"Several years ago I was working at an upscale grocery store in the deli/food service department.  When I say upscale, I mean it is a very expensive store in an extremely wealthy neighborhood.  It was that special time late at night near closing when single guys and weirdos do their shopping, and of course we had more customers than employees.  Never underestimate the late night weirdos.

My co-workers and I are all busy completing orders; slicing meats and cheeses, boxing entrees, etc. About 50 ft. down the counter from where we are there was a steam tray with hoot foods ready to go, self serve.  All that should have been put away for the night by this point but it's too busy to send anyone over there.  I notice there's a guy down there, staring at us.  I shout ""need any help?""

""TURKEY!""

I replied ""All out until tomorrow. Sorry!""  We had been out of roasted carving turkey for several hours and had turned away a few people already.

I go back to slicing my customer's order.  While weighing one item I notice the hot food guy is standing right at the case and glaring.  This is also when I notice that this guy is gigantic, at least 6'4"" and massive in gut, shoulders, and arms.  He's rocking a huge beard and a fanny pack too.  (This is right when Epic Beard Man was a thing, so that was a fun coincidence)  From here on out, he will be huge beard fanny pack or ""HBFP"".

Noticing he looks unhappy, I offer him a piece of sliced cold cut turkey that I have on the machine.  Samples usually soothe the savage consumer and this is standard operating procedure for us employees; our wealthy customers love nothing more than free food and who knows, we might make an extra sale.  

I make the slice, put it on wax paper, and offer it to the fuming hulk with my passable fake smile.  This is when it gets nuts.  The guy starts yelling at the top of his huge lungs.

HBFP: ""I thought you said you were OUT of turkey!?!?""

Me: ""Well, we're out of the hot roasted turkey, but we have plenty of sliceable deli turkey for sandwiches.  We won't get more whole turkeys until tomorrow's delivery.""

HBFP: ""If you're not out of turkey, then WHY did you tell me you don't have any?""

At this point, all eyes are on us.  My co-workers and the customers are wondering what the commotion is about, and as HBFP's volume rises the customers all take a step back.

HBFP: ""NEVER ASSUME!!!""

Me: ""What?""

HBFP: ""NEVER ASSUME! And do you know WHY?!?!? BECAUSE YOU COULD BE WRONG!""

Me: ""I thought you wanted the hot turkey, because you were standing by the hot case.  Did you want some sliced turkey instead?""

HBFP: ""No, I wanted the other turkey, but you ASSUMED!!!   NEVER ASSUME!!!  And do you know why?!?! Because you could have been WRONG!""

Me: (being a smart ass) ""But you wanted the other turkey, right?  Not this cold cut stuff?""

At this point, I realize he is crazy and I am off the hook, consequence wise.  No way is this guy going to be able to complain about me to my bosses without betraying the fact that he is insane.  All of the other customers gave this dude a wide birth as he continued to rant for another minute or so.  It was all gold, but it was so long ago I don't want to write it out as I can't remember the specifics of the rest of the craziness.

Eventually the guy tires himself out and walks away, though he lingers in the area shooting me dirty looks.  I can see the wheels grinding away in his head trying to think up some fresh indignation.

The icing on the cake was the short middle aged middle manager guy I had been helping during the debacle.  He skulked away the second the big dude started yelling, but as soon as the threat was gone my customer came back and said: ""If I were you, I would have kicked his ass!""  I didn't laugh in his face, somehow, but quietly noted how this middle aged guy was the first to flee the scene when a real life maniac started going off.  Yeah bro, you should have kicked the ass of the gigantic bearded man who wore a fanny pack and was really upset about how there are different kinds of turkey.

bekahbbydoll,4,6,1p3vjw,12,"So I'm not sure if it's because I've been in a lot of pain lately because of my recent surgery or if I'm just starting to notice these things more. But this is a two for one tonight! 

**FIRST:**

When I close I usually go on my 30 around 8, but tonight because we had an extra front lanes manager we'll call him Asian Persuasion (AP from now on) on the clock they wanted me to go at 7:30, that's fine no skin off my teeth. Well I didn't end up clocking out till 7:47 because I had to wait for my front lanes team lead to get back from her 30. 

Now I believe it was a combination of the pain I was in and my meds or what but I'm so use to just clocking back in at 8:30 so that's what I did. Well before I even get back to the guest service desk Loud Mouth (LM from now on) had told me that I took a 50 minute lunch. I was so shocked, I didn't think it had been that long. I immediately started apologizing. She told me that I needed to go talk to Passive Agressive Manager (PSM from now on) . I found her 2 seconds latter and went straight for an apology. 

Me: PSM, I am so sorry. I didn't realize that I had taken so long at lunch. 

PSM: well, I mean, it just is a real inconvenience cause AP was suppose to leave 30 minutes ago. 

Me: I really am sorry PSM, I guess I just lost track of time. I also had to clean out my sockets. 

PSM: well, this isn't the first time it's happened. Just try to be a little more conscious of when you clock out please. 

Me: yes ma'am, I understand. 


First of all, I genuinely had no idea I had been gone for so long and I felt really bad because I know that AP wanted to go home. Secondly, if I did something wrong, reprimand me for it. Don't beat around the bush and constantly say ""well, I mean..."" or ""well, Um..."" grow a pair of balls and tell me. I also had no idea that this wasn't the first time this had happened. So how am I suppose to magically know if you don't tell me? I'd rather get yelled at and be a little butt hurt after words than it feel like you don't have the balls to confront someone when there is a problem. 



**SECOND:**

Super bitch woman (SRW from now on) comes in to do a return. I tell her I'll be right with her because I was busy working on something else. She was literally waiting no longer than 2 minutes and when I finally walk over there she sighs loudly, like she has been waiting for longer than 30 minutes. I chalk it up to it being late and she probably just wants to go home, I can sympathise with that.

Me: you just have a return to do tonight? 

SBW: *scoffs* Um yes, that's why I'm at the Guest Service Desk. 

Me: Alright! Well what do you have tonight? 

SBW: *points to the bag and then slides her receipt across the counter towards me*

Me: Alright! Let's see what we got here. 

I take her items out of the bag, even though technically it's company policy that the guest takes items their returning out of the bag. I scan her receipt and notice neither of the shirts she's returning have tags on them. No big deal, there are tiny tags on the inside that have the DPCI number on them. I put the first number in and no problem. Type in the second number and the register is prompting me that this item has already been returned. 

Me: well ma'am it looks like this item has already been returned. 

SBW: I have the item, so it's obviously not been returned yet. 

Me: Well ma'am, my register is saying that it's already been returned.. 

SBW: Did you not just hear me? Are you dense? I have the item right here, therefore it hasn't been returned yet. 


I try to ignore her overly rude comment and try to fix the problem. Sometimes cashiers will ring one of two items that are similar twice, even though the DPCI numbers are different. So i try typing in the number of the first item again to see if that's what had happened. Nope. 

Me: Well ma'am, I'm not sure what the problem is but my system isn't letting me return this item because it's saying that it's already been returned. 

I'm just about to tell her that we can do a no receipt return, but that she might just get a little less than what she paid for. And she starts flying off the handle.

SBW: HOW IN THE HELL COULD IT HAVE BEEN RETURNED IF I FUCKING HAVE IT! 

Me: Ma'am, I totally understand where you're coming from and I get it, but when the system shuts down like this and won't continue, there isn't anything I can do to over ride it. 

SBW: Just give me my fuckin receipt, my mom can come in and do this tomorrow. 

Me: Ma'am, it doesn't matter if she comes back tomorrow or not, the system is still going to say that it's already been returned. 

SBW: *stares at me like I'm speaking a third would language* Just give me my goddamn receipt, this is fucking ridiculous. 

I tried my hardest to hold my tongue and because of that, I rolled my eyes. Which she noticed. She snatches the receipt out of my hand and her items off the counter. I just walk away cause I'm done dealing with her. She muttered something under her breath and nearly rips the bag caddy off the counter trying to get a bag to put her items in, and then storms out of the store. 

HAVE A GREAT FUCKING NIGHT MA'AM! 

**TL;DR** I have the worst passive aggressive front end manager ever. I tried to help a woman with her return but the register said it had already been returned. When told this news the woman flips her shit and nearly breaks store property during her hissy fit.

Edit: just for a little clarity PSM is our Front Lanes Team Lead who was closing that night, our extra front lanes manager who is AP was schedules from 10 until 8. They wanted me to go to lunch at 7:30 instead of 8 so that there would be coverage at the Guest Service Desk so that PSM wouldn't have to attempt to watch the front lanes and the guest service desk while I was on my meal.",Passive Agressive Bosses and Bitchy Guests,18

The other day this guy came in, claiming that after he updated his phone his third party cable no longer would charge his phone and that the Fruit Company was cornering customers into buying their products and theirs alone. 

I doubted the validity of his claim, but didn't know for sure so I just say ""I'm not saying your wrong, I'm just saying that I haven't heard of this being an issue"" and then asked if he minded me checking his liquid contact indicators, to which he vehemently refused, claiming, of course, that he has never taken it near water (with a beach setting selfie background pic proving otherwise), launching into a tirade about god-knows-what, belittling me and my apparent lack of knowledge, swearing AT me, blaming ME, threatening law-suits... you know type, a real winner with everyone.

hannahprettyinpunk,14,8,1p3rz3,25,"I don't exactly work in retail, but I may or may not work at a place of eating that has two golden arches in its name. I'm a minor, but I'm a crew trainer at my job and I'm starting management training soon so I can be a certified manager in March. Why? Not trying to sound conceited but I work pretty damn hard at what I do. You want drive thru times under 120 seconds? You got it. Want me to work an eight hour shift on my day off? Noooo problem. Want me to work six hours into an eight hour shift with no breaks? Fine by me (Sadly, this does happen. **alot**.


So, today at said job, I was training this girl on the front counter. It was slow tonight, so I showed her the procedures on cleaning everything, how to stock everything, taking orders, etc. Both of our shifts ended at 10pm. In ours state, minors cannot work more than 7 paid hours or later than 10:30 on a school night. Since this WAS a school night, we needed to get out of there asap. So 10:05 rolls around and the manager finally says we can pull out tills out and count them down. I take the girl to the office, count my drawer, then show her how to do hers. We get done at exactly 10:13pm. Then my friend N, another minor (MAN this place loves minors), *frantically* runs into the office.

""Hannah! We have to hurry! We have to get out of here!"" 

Me with a blank face: Why, what's wrong?? (silly me thinking that idk my boyfriend is pissed because hes been waiting over half an hour for me to get off work).

N: ""*Manager's Name* is freaking out and sending everyone home because it's after 10!!""

Me (exasperated): Okay well first of all, minors can work until 10:30 so I don't know why she's freaking out. Secondly, I'm kind of in the middle of something. 

N leaves, I finish counting the drawers all the way down, then I ask the person who is taking orders in the back to buzz the manager over the headset and let her know we're ready, which is the **PROCEDURE** at our store. I couldn't leave the office because there was well over $500 just sitting on the counter. I can't even leave or clock out until she has the till in the safe. 

About two minutes later, I can hear the manager SCREAMING from the front, 

""**I DON'T HAVE TIME TO CATER TO Y'ALL, I NEED SOMEONE IN THE FRONT SO I CAN COME TAKE CARE OF Y'ALLS TILLS.**""

So instead of doing what we're supposed to do, I leave over $500 sitting out on the counter and I go to the front. She is STILL screaming

""**Y'ALL NEED TO GET IT TOGETHER BECAUSE I DON'T GOT TIME FOR THIS, THERE'S LIKE FIVE PEOPLE HERE I CAN'T JUST LEAVE AND COME DO THIS FOR Y'ALL.**""

Okay, I'm sorry that whoever did the schedule wanted ALL the minors to work and didn't bring anyone in at 10pm. That's not my fault. I was just trying to hurry up and get out of there, because apparently everyone was freaking out about the fact that the minors were still there past 10. Soorrrrryy. So now it's about 10:23, I already have my hat off and my shirt untucked. Whatever. I'll watch the front while you take care of our tills. 

She decides to take almost **half an hour** to log into the computer and put two drawers into the safe. It seriously takes about 5 minutes to do it. I have NO idea what she was doing back there, but I handed out a grand total of THREE orders while she was gone. It would have been perfectly fine for the order taker in the back to come to the front and take care of those orders. Part of the reason I'm so pissed is because I'm a senior, and I have three AP and two dual credit college classes. I work 3:30-10pm every weekday except Tuesdays and Thursdays, because I have two and a half hour long cheerleading practices on those days. On the weekends I work 8 hour shifts on both days. I have come into work EVERY single time they've EVER asked me to come in, except for once because I had a chemistry exam to take that night. Nevermind the fact I'm always exhausted and a little behind in school. If you're going to freak out because there are still minors on the floor at 10:05, DON'T ask them to stay until 10:45 so you can take your time sitting on your ass.

retailgirl222,8,8,1p3rqg,17,"Hi there! Long time reader but first time poster. I worked in retail for over a year and am taking a short break currently. I worked as a sales associate in a fairly upscale children's clothing store. As you might imagine we had a ton of screaming little kids and crazy parents on the regular, but this woman and her family took the cake.

It was a very busy day in the shop as usual when Super Scammer (SS) came in with her howling brood of rugrats. I helped her for almost an hour in a perfectly cheery manner- grabbing sizes, helping her get everything in the fitting room, smiling at the kiddos even. SS was borderline polite throughout. By the end of the time they were in the store, we had stacked up a very respectable pile of clothing. Although I was not paid on commission, my average dollars per transaction was recorded and raises and the number of hours employees would get was linked to it.

After ringing up and bagging the entire purchase (a tedious task given the number of sensors on everything) I tell SS her total which is around $500, which normally prompts the shopper to present a method of payment. At which point everything goes down hill.

SS: Umm right. Credit. Oh yeah I don't have the card with me so I wrote down the number here.

SS hands me a slip of receipt paper with a number scribbled once, then written neatly below that on it. Sketchy as hell.

Me: I'm so sorry but we have to have a physical card in order to run the transaction. Do you have another form of payment?

SS: No. This is my credit card number and this is what I am going to use.

Me: I understand Ma'am and I apologize for the inconvenience but company policy does not allow me to accept anything other than the physical card.

SS: Well this is ridiculous!! Let me speak to your manager.

Me: No problem.

Enter my angel of a manager (AM) who repeats exactly what I said.

SS: Are you kidding me?! You are going to pass up a $500 sale just because I don't have my card with me?!

AM: Yes, I am so sorry for your inconvenience but since it is against company policy I am afraid that is what we are going to have to do.

SS then refuses my manager's offers to keep the clothing on hold so she can return with the card and storms out of the store leaving her unruly offspring's destruction in her wake. And $500 worth of un-sensored, un-hung clothing which was then my job to re-sensor and re-hang. Gotta love retail.","It's company policy, Ma'am..",25
genericname11,1,2,1p3o5p,16,"So a few years ago I was working in electronics at Some Random Superstore. It was mid-afternoon and I get a phone call from someone looking for a portable dvd player. We'll call him CG. He starts asking about the features of dvd players we have. Then he begins to tell me he wants to mount the dvd player to the ceiling of his car, and he needs AV inputs so he can hook his xbox up to it to play while he's driving. I politely answer his questions as best I can, even though obviously we don't have any dvd players you can hang from your car ceiling.

As if his ""plans"" weren't clue enough, he starts asking the same questions over and over after I had answered them. At this point I pretty much know it's a prank call.  He finally decides on one and asks me to hold it for him and he'll come in in a couple hours. Whatever, i humor myself and I set it aside and put his name on it. Low and behold he never shows up.

The next day I'm telling my coworker about him. My coworker gets excited and says he had a call from him earlier in the week, but says CG wanted to put it on the roof of his car, so the helicopters had something to watch while they were following him.

Over the next week we get a couple more calls from him, asking the same questions about AV inputs and chargers and such and of course never coming in. This guy was persistent for a prank caller.

Then one day I opened and found a portable dvd player on hold from the day before. I locked it back up and went on my merry way. A few hours later an older man with cornrows came up in one of our store scooters and asked for help. My jaw dropped when he told me his name.

CG ""My names CG. You have a portable dvd player on hold for me""

Me ""I just locked it up, I'll grab it for you""

I give it to him and he looks it over.

CG ""This isn't the right one. This isn't the one they set aside for me""

Me ""This was the one on hold from last night, but i'll show you some of our other ones to see if one of those was the one he described to you""

He looks at every one in the case and length fully reads their features. 

CG ""No, none of these are it. Can you look around and see if he put it somewhere else?""

At this point my manager is over and she begins looking too. He has us look in the backroom, under the counters, in our supply drawers. He keeps demanding to us recheck everything. Loss prevention is watching him the whole time.

Finally my manager goes back into the backroom and grabs a random one that was just overstock from what was in the case. 

Manager ""I found this one, maybe this is it?""

CG proceeds to open the box and look over every piece. He takes out the instruction manual and starts reading it front to back. No exaggeration, he sits there and reads this manual for an hour.

Finally he gets done and goes back over to the case. My manager asks him if he made his decision. He points at the VERY FIRST ONE that we gave him, the one that had been on hold from the night before.

CG demands ""What about that one? You haven't showed me that one!""

At this point it's been a good 3 hours of dealing with this guy. My manager was irritated and made some remark about wasting our time and not wanting to show him anymore. I guess that startled CG and he hastily says he will get the one he had been looking at. We check him out and he leaves. I've never seen him after that.

wafflesandeggs,189,265,1p3m13,901,"Woo, first post here!

Not my story, thankfully. A friend of mine just told me what happened at her work today, and since she isn't a redditor I thought I'd share. 

So, friend whom we'll call S is a manager at a crappy gas station chain. She has been at her current store for about a month, before that she managed another store of the same chain for over 2 years. She was also the assistant manager at her old store for about as long before the promotion. 

Customer comes in today and asks the clerk if he can break a $100 bill on $15 worth of gas. The clerk explains she doesn't have the change in her till, but if he can wait a minute the manager can come out with enough change. 

S comes out, and as she's walking to the register she stops another employee to tell him to go change the trash outside. Customer apparently overheard her and was offended.

C: Instead of telling him to take the trash out, you could have done it yourself you know.

S: *shrugs and begins counting the change to the clerk* 

C: I thought a manager was supposed to do this. They just let anyone play with the money here.

S: Sir, I am the manager. 

C: *slams his hand on the counter*  You're not a manager! You're a girl!

S: And as soon as you pay you're not a customer. Please don't come back.

S stood there and waited for him to pay, all the while he was glaring at her, then watched him march out of the store.

boredatwork87,4,5,1p3ihr,43,"So I work at a movie theater, and the layout is almost like a long, wide hallway. You walk in, buy your tickets, keep walking, and at the end of this hallway is a larger lobby with the concession. 

Usually we have someone working box office, but today we didn't, so I (the manager) was. Now, I dress appropriately for this job. I wear nice black work pants, button up shirts, and blazers. I don't wear anything that resembles what our concession staff or box office staff wears. You can pretty much tell I'm a manager.

Tonight I had an old lady (OL) buy her ticket, and she says to me ""Last time I was here your popcorn was extremely salty, and I meant to tell someone.""

Now, there are two movie theaters in this town. While we're smaller, we definitely have better popcorn. It's made the exact same way every single time. We get compliments from people at least *once a shift*. It's kind of a big deal. 

This is where the conversation went from there.

**Me**: Oh, I'm sorr-

**OL**: It was just so salty I could hardly eat it.

**Me**: Well our popcorn is made the same way every-

**OL**: I mean, don't you always get people telling you how salty it is?

**Me:** Oh, not really, most people really like the flavor of our popcorn!

**OL**: I liked the flavor, it was just way too salty.

**Me:** I'm really sorry, but it's made the same way every time, so if you didn't like it las-

**OL:** I never said I didn't like popcorn, I said yours was too salty.

**Me:** Well ours is made the same way every time, so if you didn't like it last time, it'll be the same this time.

**OL:** I should probably go tell the girl in the concession instead.

My mind is blown. You just interrupted the person who was trying to explain it to you multiple times, and you're going to try and convince the girl in the concession to just change how we make our popcorn for you? Really?!

PhaelonCorrespondent,4,3,1p3cdz,35,"I have the olfactory bliss of maintaining the fragrance wall at a cosmetics retailer in the US.  I also have the bliss of dealing with, at times, homeless people that use our bottled scents in lieu of bathing.  Having slept in my car before, I am not judgmental, but I also didn't exchange Chanel for a shower.  Today I had the pleasure of dealing with not only one of our homeless regulars, but one with a recent hospital admittance bracelet and a major miscalculation of his much needed dose of schizophrenia medication.

I usually use the mornings before we generally get busy to do price updates, file things, upstock, and dust.  As I am filing away price tiles, I see my homeless pal enter the store.  He normally bathes in Armani spray deodorant as soon as he hits that particular section of the fragrance wall.  In the past, he'd ask for samples while holding up his beltless pants and I would cheerfully make them, thinking I might possibly be the only person who would be nice to him that day.

Today he came my direction as usual and asked for samples.  I said, ""Sure thing, pick your three and I'll make them.""
He muttered something about me being quick to say only three when he's had up to six before and then I heard him say to someone, like an aside in his head, ""I told you before these bitches is mean. And I tell you what, this bitch here hates n******.  I've seen her around before.""

No shit you've seen me before, I help you all the time, but I'm a wage slave, so I inquire if he wants a sample of the fragrance he's currently holding.  ""I told you, I'M STILL LOOKING!!!""  He then starts to throw the bottle of Gucci Made to Measure in my direction, then changes mid-swing and slams it on the counter.

At this point, I'm on a headset in mid-sentence asking for a manager.  I'm not going to be on the local news tonight.  I step away as he douses himself and bathes in the rubbing alcohol we keep to sanitize lipsticks behind my station.  When my tiny manager emerges from the office and observes his behavior, she decides he has to go.  Now she has to get him to leave.

""You've been abusive to my staff and I'm asking you to leave.  I have already called security.""

Guy seems unfazed and is still talking to himself.  When he does realize that my manager is asking him to exit, he starts to lunge for her.  She yells for one of us to dial 911 and that seems to make him shrink back.  She and one of the larger cast members physically block him from entering deeper into the store or continuing to douse fragrance.  He still lunged at them repeatedly before retreating, alternately calling the three of us (white, Asian, and African-American,) racists and bitches, then pointed at us through the front glass and said we would ""get ours.""

Security of course shows up about five minutes after the fact and using our description locate him in another store in the mall. 

I thought like bloodhounds they could use a blotter of his favorite scent to sniff him out and then book him for being a fragrance-crazed asshole, but it was less dramatic than that.  A bike cop physically rode beside the loud-smelling guy as he walked to the bus stop and made sure he was on it.  All they can do is issue a ""no-trespass"" warning, and if he comes back, then he's arrested.

So he's out in society, with a hunger for Armani Code and no fear in obtaining it.

1.) The place where I serve as Mother Bread's bitch is located just outside a major city, in a snooty little white suburb. One thing that really gets on my nerves is the amount of working mommies that prance in after work in their pantsuits and stilettos.

""Um, yes, could I please have X salad and Y sandwich, oh and five kids grilled cheeses?""

Oh, I'm sorry. Do you not have bread and cheese at your house? Is your life so busy that you'd rather spend 25 dollars on grilled cheese and go-gurts alone, not even including your salad and sandwich, instead of spending 10 minutes slapping together some bread and cheese and throwing it in a frying pan for a few seconds until the bread gets toasty? Heaven forbid you should spend all that time slaving away over dinner for your family. 

Even worse are the peanut butter and jellys. If you have a kid, odds are you have both of those things in your house.

If it's a one-time ""I didn't get to go to the grocery store today"" type of thing, fine. We've all got those days. But these women come in several times a week and order the exact same thing. 


2.) Also, if people could stop getting mad at us for using microwaves, that'd be great. If you come into a fast-food restaurant and order a special pasta with fancy meat sauce or sausage and peas or something, do you honestly think that we can throw that together in less than 5 minutes for you and NOT use one? The amount of glares I get when I take a bag of pasta out and put it in the microwave is astounding. If you don't like that, don't spend the 8 dollars in the first place. 

3.) If I am on break, I am not doing anything for you. Don't try to flag me down while I eat my meal in the dining room. The other day, I had a middle aged lady come up to me while I was eating, after yelling ""WAITRESS? WAITRESSS!"" at me for a few minutes. I'm not a waitress, so I didn't respond. Eventually she came over to my table.

""Excuse me, could you bring me a knife?""

""Oh, I'm sorry ma'am, I'm on my break, if you walk up to the counter where you picked up your food and ask, they will be happy to give you one."" 

""I can't leave my table, I have 3 kids who need supervision.""

""...Then aren't they alone right now?""

""If you don't go get me a knife, I'm going to take it up with your manager.""

I got her a knife and made a big show of getting up, walking the three steps over to the counter, and bringing it over to her table.

Syd35h0w,8,7,1p39wb,12,"I think this can be x-posted in /r/paranormal, but since it happened during my overnight shifts in a local grocery store chain, I'll post it here.

Story Number One

I was with one of my employees one night and we were together fronting the shelves to make the store look pretty. The entrances are locked but the exits are open to please the fire department. 

Just as we were in our last aisle of fronting do I hear a loud shatter of glass. Turns out, the meat promo case blew up. No one was around to affect it or tamper with it in anyway. The glass was firm in the frame and the glass was still in the frame, but the middle of it was destroyed. The security camera pointing at it didn't show anything strange happen to it for 24 hours.

Story Number Two

We had double doors that wouldn't latch correctly in the back of the store. We put a wooden shovel handle in the handles to keep it from opening up. The handle was approximately 2inches in diameter. These doors weigh around as much as a CHEP pallet each and open outward. About 5 hours after arming the back doors and putting the handle in it does the handle snap in half and the doors fly open. Again the doors weren't tampered with from the inside or outside as our security cameras showed us this.

Just some creepy shit that happened. I have more stories of seeing shadows when I was alone in the aisles and I was the only one in the store. Hearing my name called from my boss when he wasn't there. I even heard a low guttural growl in my ear when I was alone in the aisles. I told the store manager the place is haunted but my goofy demeanor made him chuckle.",A couple of... Interesting Stories,19
darkenseyreth,8,5,1p39vv,28,"I used to work in a camera store in one of the larger malls in the world, where we offered a print service. One of our services was a canvas print that you ordered off of one of our photo kiosks (basically a touch screen computer with our ordering software on it). Customers sometimes need a hand navigating the software, so when a gentleman asked for a hand on how to order a canvas I was happy to help. 

Usually they just need to be pointed in the right direction, be shown where they need to go to find the right product and how to access their files, etc, so i did just that. He asked for a little more help, and I was happy to oblige. I showed him where to find his files, and he clicks on it, next thing you know there are dozens of pictures of his wife popping up... that look like they were part of a nude glamour shoot on a beach. 

Nudity happens from time to time, so i politely avert my eyes as if it were a mistake, but no, the guy starts asking my opinions on the photos. We go through the entire gallery (which I honestly didn't mind, because his wife was pretty hot for a woman in her early 40s), and finally settle on a picture of her lounging in the sand.

zoinox,14,7,1p3752,23,"I'm a 17 year-old cashier at a grocery store in the south. 

I was checking out my first customer of the day. Normally I'm very patient with my customers, however I could hardly understand this woman's thick southern drawl (normally not a problem but she was mumbling like a fuck.) 

She immediately starts of by telling me that the $22 ribs I had just rung up were ""way to expensive."" and to ""take them off"" This is particularly annoying because all of our meat products are clearly labeled with their normal prices and their sale prices. Because the ribs are over $20 I have to call a manager to come void it off. 

After I got the ribs off I scan two packages of 20 ct. hotdogs which she promptly mumbles out are BOGOF. I inform her that they are in fact not, however they are on sale for 40% off. She insists that they're BOGOF, so wishing to rid myself of this woman I override the price so that they're BOGOF. 

She has a few more items now and by this time a large line has formed behind her, all giving me evil stares. I quickly finish up and tell her the total which she informs me is incorrect. She proceeds to take my pen out of my apron pocket and total it up on a pad of paper I have sitting by my register. I read off the individual prices, and she adds it together. She is quick to let me know that I'm overcharging her by 3 dollars, I ask for the pad of paper and notice that the addition is severely flawed, a little more than forgetting to carry the one if you know what I mean. I then rewrite the individual prices and tax and add them together getting the same total as the register, to which she says ""You're wrong but I'm in a hurry so I'll just pay what you want."" 

Finally she pays and as she's leaving she thanks me on how patient I was and says she loves me. Needless to say  I hate my job.",Sucks at math.,30
ragdollsandzombies,31,21,1p36in,117,"I've had monthly doctor appointments going on for six months now, I make sure to request those days off over two weeks in advanced.  Today on my day off I was at the doctors and one of my labs came back abnormal.  I was pretty much told it was a nonemergency  emergency.   Meaning that because I’m pregnant I need to go to the lab tomorrow and if in between then I have x y or z symptoms then off to the hospital, but otherwise I’m told to try not to worry or stress over it.

I do the responsible thing and call my work as soon as I get home to let my manager know that I won’t be able to make my shift tomorrow because I have to get test done, I give her a brief run down without going into graphic detail.  Well because of being understaffed and because no one wants to come in on their day’s off or trade shifts there is no part-time employe to cover me (and honestly I don’t blame them for not wanting to come in when not having to).  So my manager tries to tell me that I don’t really need to go to get lab work done tomorrow I can put it off until my next day off (which isn’t until Saturday)  and when that doesn’t work she gives an exaggerated angry sigh and tells me that she guesses she will just have to come in on her day off then.  At that point I was about to lose it, my shift is only for four hours and yes it sucks coming in on your day off but by god how many times have I had to do the same because the schedule wasn’t done right, or someone called in at the very last minute?  (Here is a hint, a lot).  I so wanted to tell her that she should just put on her big girl panties and be a freaking manager and deal with it.  But I held my tongue until the call was over and then screamed into my pillow in frustration for a good minute.  I am so over this job.

jbh007,34,18,1p32uy,95,"About a week ago, the door to the freezer that holds the cakes and pints cracked. No impact on the door, it just cracked in the corner (possibly from the cold and bad construction), and soon spread like crazy spiderwebbing the laminated glass. Suffice to say, it's bad and very dangerous.

We took the standing store signs and put caution tape between them and placed them front of the freezer. We didn't know if the door would shatter, so none of use wanted to risk having a customer break it. 

You'd think that police tape would stop people from trying to opening it.

Lol nope.

______


Two days ago, two people, a man and a woman, come into the store, presumably a couple (or relatives, etc.). They cause a usual fuss I see about the lack of flavors (we run out of some of the more popular flavors fairly often), the prices, the scoop sizes etc. Just not entirely pleasant people, but I'm polite.

They go to sit down after ordering. I start helping another customer out when I hear the sound of something large being dragged against our tile flours.

I turn to see the woman moving one of the standing signs with the caution tape and going to open the freezer door.

I start freaking out and practically scream at the lady.

""Stop! *Stop!* *STOP*! Do not open the freezer! Step away from the freezer!""

She continues to open the door and look at the pints. I tell her to back away as the door is broken and could shatter any moment.

She and the guy just stare blankly at me and ask me why, and stated that they just wanted to see if they wanted a pint to go. I tell her again that the door is close to shattering and we do not want anyone to touch it.

She just could not get that. She still has the door open too.

I tell her to close it gently and step away, and to *not cross the caution tape*. She slams it shut (I heard a few more cracks form in the process) and goes behind the tape grumbling.

The guy then chimes up with his wisdom on the subject. Apparently they thought that the yellow police tape only means we do not want people to go behind the counter, and that the freezer was not clearly labeled as off limits. I tell him that since it's in front of the freezer, that means accessing the freezer would be off limits.

He gets mad at me, practically yelling, that the door wasn't that bad [(you guys judge for yourselves)](http://i.imgur.com/yyfvtGi.png), and that if we wanted to clarify we meant the freezer was off limits, then the tape should have been on the door.

I explain again that to access the freezer, one needed to pass the tape, but he jut kept going on how it was unfair that not allow access to a ""perfectly fine"" freezer.

I told them that we have to get the pints from our walk-in, they just could not get them from the freezer. That was not acceptable, so they left.

TL;DR Yellow caution tape forming a blockade is ok to pass if you want ice cream.

Note: the pic is actually of the door, but a small section to make sure the name of the shop is not seen. Imagine that spread over at least 10 square feet.

SiliconLemming,4,12,1p2y5g,77,"This is not SiliconLemming's proudest moment.This is a the time I managed to almost kill myself with a mop. This harks back to my time working at my local cinema, and the kiosk area had laminated flooring that required daily scrubbing to remove all the post mix and trodden in popcorn. It was the kind of duty you could just switch off and do at the end of the day. Understand I am by no means making excuses.

I put the mop into the bucket, and it had a little bracket that prevented the handle from falling down. This left the tip of the handle at a slightly below face level. The handle was made of wood, and had a rounded end. I had finished the job and was just turning around to makes sure I had cleaned everything. At that moment a screen emptied out and my manager called over to me see if I had finished. I turned and managed to trip over my own feet ( I was a clumsy,clumsy kid) and started to fall over. 

Towards the mop handle.

As I fell forwards, it hit me in the mouth. I had managed to turn my head enough that it ended up grinding up my gums to the corner of my mouth. At this point the pain hit me, and most likely prevented worse injury. I was suddenly aware of the very real possibility this could punch out of my cheek or something, and in pure fear I managed to free one of my feet and stamped down hard, hurling myself away from my foe.

Unfortunately I somewhat over committed to the move and ended pinwheeling myself onto my back, where I stayed for a while until the pain in my mouth had reached acceptable levels. 

Moments later, I looked to see dozens of people including my manager just staring at me, stunned into silence. He came over to make sure I was okay, and after making sure that I was okay could only venture 

""How...I mean, how did you jut beat yourself up with a mop?""

To this day, I've tried to answer that question. Sometimes  I wake in the middle of the night, and have to bite my knuckles for a couple of minutes. I can't deny, however, it made me the man I am today.

TL;DR Kitchenware has an agenda, and I for one am not going to stand for it any further.

IUpVoteYourMum,16,12,1p2ty4,62,"As some of you may know from some previous posts I work for one of the larger supermarket groups in Australia as a duty manager. 


Last night [the ABC aired a program](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-23/an---bangladesh-to-improve-working-conditions-for-garment-facto/5041398) regarding the working conditions in Bangladesh and Australian retail chain's hand in said conditions. I was stuck with the late shift so I didn't watch it, however it was brought to my attention by a phone call from an outraged customer. It follows nearly word-for-word (sorry about the massive wall):

Me: ""Good evening GenericStore (GS) this is IUpvoteYourMum""

Armchair Activist (AA): ""Good evening may I ask speak to the manager please""

Me: ""Sure that would be me, I am in charge at the moment ma'am""

AA: ""And what was your name?""

Me: ""Iupvoteyourmum"" 

AA: ""And your last name?"" 

Me: ""er.. yourmum"" 

AA: ""Okay I just watched a program on the ABC highlighting the working conditions over in Bangladesh and how 
your store and other major retailers are responsible for the death of those workers""

Me: ""Okay I'm not actually aware of the situation over there so i'll have to refer you to a customer service representative who is qualified to deal with this complaint""

AA: ""Do you understand the situation over there?""

Me: ""No Ma'am I'm not personally familiar with the situation""

AA: ""Do you know how many people died over there?""

Me: ""I'm sorry I haven't been briefed on that, but I can get you in touch with--""

AA: ""--Can you tell me why your company is doing nothing to help these people?!"" 

Me: ""I'm sorry ma'am I cant help you with that I just work at the store level I don't make those decisions, however I can refer you to --""

AA: ""-- What do you mean you only work at the store level? Aren't you the store manager?""

Me: ""No. You said you wanted to speak to the manager, I am the duty Manager and I'm in charge at the moment but I'm not authorised to comment on the company's behalf""

AA: ""No you told me you were the store manager you're lying to me""

Me: ""No, I said I was the manager in charge at the moment I am not the store manager and I apologise as I didn't mean to insinuate I was the store manager""

AA: ""No you told me you're the store manager when you answered the phone I want to speak to your manager.""

Me: ""Ma'am It is 10pm and the store manager has gone home, I am the manager in charge at the moment I can give you the store managers name and you can call him back in the morning to discuss this otherwise I can give you the number to the customer service team who will be able to help you with your query""

AA: ""That isn't good enough. You've told me you're the store manager and I have it recorded. You do realise you're being recorded?!""

Me: ""No I didn't ma'am, I didn't give my permission to be recorded and it is actually against the law to do so without all party's permission"" 

AA: ""You cannot speak to me like that, I know my rights. You do not care about the working conditions of those working overseas for less than nothing!"" 

Me: ""I'm sorry but I can't help you any further if you like I can give you the number for customer care, otherwise I wont be able take this conversation any further""

AA: ""You sound like you're about 21?!""

Me: ""I'm actually 24 ma'am""

AA: ""See I'm not bad *Laughs* It just shows what kind of Fucked up company you work for if they let a kid run the store at this time of the night"" 


She went on to hang up and she never got the number for customer care. I'm going to wait to see what becomes of the recorded conversation as it would be illegal for her to use that against me or the company in any way. I've had to leave a written word-for-word statement for the company to ensure I cover both of our asses. 


If you ask me she just wanted a confrontation and wanted a reaction out of me - I mean, why else would she record the conversation and keep pressing for these things even when I've tried to facilitate her as much as possible?!


By far she was the most self-righteous bitch I've ever had to deal with in all of the years I've worked for my store. To be fair I am young, but I've also been there since I've been old enough to work and have more experience than most managers you'd have to deal with on a daily basis. This on top of my qualifications in my fields and my ongoing study, but I guess because I'm less than a quarter of her age I'm no where near as competent of running a store as she is.

kyp,15,14,1p2tmb,11,"Hello. I have started a [blog](http://anthropologyandbooks.wordpress.com/) about bookselling. 

Here is my first page. It is long.

I have recently discovered that I can’t keep doing the Masters degree in Medical Anthropology I just started about a month ago.

This means I have to sell books full time, instead of part time.

This means my anger levels will rise. It is something that cannot be helped. It happens, I am sure, to everyone who works in retail.

At the moment it’s worse for me, because I thought I had a way out. I’ve been a bookseller (full time and part time) for nearly seven years now. I thought I was going to escape, to discover new things and become enlightened and intelligent and loving and patient. I was going to find a way to help people. I was going to make the world a better place (I mean, I hadn’t quite figured out how yet, but I was going to).

Oh yes. I was going to be someone.

But that is not happening. Not yet. So I am back in the bookshop five days a week, speaking to people.

Please do not misunderstand me. I mostly like people. I mostly love books. But sometimes it is difficult.

So I am thinking that I need an outlet. Some way of preventing me from taking out my frustration and anger and confusion on customers. Some of them may deserve it, but it would get me in trouble eventually, and I would not want that.

I came close yesterday. I spoke to a few customers in a not so happy way. I became frustrated and confused and unsure of how to cope. ‘But why?’ you may ask.

Here are a few examples.

The phone rings, and I pick it up.

Me: “Bookshop Bookshop” (I say the name of the bookshop in real life)

Customer (And older man, a bit difficult to understand): “Hello. My name is Claude. One of you put a book aside for me. I have the flu and I can not collect it. What I want you to do is keep the book. I will send you a cheque. When the cheque clears, you will send me the book”

Me: “We don’t take cheques, unfortunatley, but-”

Claude: “No, no, NO. You are not listening to me. I said, I will send you a cheque. When the cheque clears, you will send me the book”.

Me: “…..we don’t take cheques. We can’t take cheques. That’s all I can say about cheques. But there are some other things that we can do. I can keep the book aside for longer, or-”

Claude: “How long?”

Me (getting a bit tired of being interrupted): “I can choose the date of when you would like to collect it on our system. OR, I could take payment over the phone now, and get the book sent out for you tomorrow. You would pay £3.50 for shipping.”

C: “How would I pay now?”

M: “With your bank card…”

C: “I know how this works. You will take my details and then other people will find them and use them”

M: “Your details go into the card reader, and the payment goes through. No-one else sees them. It goes straight to the bank”

C: “And who will you tell?”

M (Knowing that somewhere, in some way, this is amusing): “…..I will not tell anyone else your bank details. I promise.”

I took the details, after reassuring him that I would not steal his identity. After the payment was accepted, I made the mistake of saying “Ok! That’s gone through-”

C: “NO! We are not finished yet!”

M: “I know this. I still have to take your address.”

And so I did. And then we were done. At which point Claude said: “So have I paid?”

Oh, wow.

But I survived. I did it. Claude hung up, and I went on with my day.

Shortly after, as I was shelving travel guides, a gentleman did that thing of looking at me, trying to make eye contact, but not saying anything. So I looked back at him and smiled.

Gentleman: “I have this book here. It is the newer one, because the one I own is from 2003.”

Me: “It’s important to have the newest travel guides.”

G: “I go to Italy because I’m a celiac.”

M: “Oh…”

G: “You say ‘celiaca’ to any of them, and they immediately know what you mean.”

M: “…That’s good.”

G: “Has a widow read the new Bridget Jones?”

M (slightly taken aback by the sudden change of subject): “I don’t think anyone who works here has read it yet…”

G: “Because I know a woman who’s husband has died and I think it might be a good present for her.”

M: “….OK”

G: “But I worked for people who looked at behaviours of widows. It’s amazing what books get wrong about widows. You would laugh.”

M: “Well, research is important in books.”

G: “Yes. Men get into classical music. Women become interested in football. I am a widow (he actually said widow there. Just in case you were wondering if I didn’t know about the word ‘widower’) but I did not listen to classical music. Not all widows do.”

M: “I see…”

G: “I went to a footbal match once in Italy. The crowd was full of older women.”

M: “…..”

G: “I think that they feel safer travelling with football fans”

M: “Well-”

G: “It was a tour, you see.”

M: “Yes. That is safer.”

G: “I’m going to get this, then.”

And then he left. And I was left dazed, looking around for support. But nobody was there…

Finally, I was behind the tills, being approached by a chap, when a woman called out “Where’s the new Bridget Jones book!”

I replied “It’s on that small table right next to you there. The one with the sign that says ‘Bridget’s Back’ on it”

The woman looked at the table, and I turned to the chap to serve him.

“Which one??” the woman called.

“The hardback on that table just in front of you, calle-”

“What, Mad About the Boy?!?”

“Yes. That book just there.” And again I turned to the man now standing directly in front of me, as the woman picked the book up to look at it.

“Why’s it half price?!?!”

My customer man smiled at me in amusement as I looked over at the woman again.

“…Because it is a popular book.”

And so I turned once again to the amused man, and served him in a polite, professional and curteous manner.

I think if it had been a few years ago, I would have been more jolly. I might have said to the woman “Well, you can pay full price if you want!” or some such chummy amusing thing. But not at the moment. At the moment I am struggling to be jovial with customers.

LRGinCharge,51,78,1p2qnn,321,"So, this is just more of a head scratcher incident that makes you realize people really have no idea how retail stores work. 

I used to work at an arts and crafts store that also has a custom framing department, which was my assigned department. If there were no framing customers to help, I was in the back room doing framing stuff, but had a wide open doorway where I could see if a customer came by or where customers would poke their heads through to ask me for custom framing help.

One day around the holidays I am working and it was incredibly busy. The holidays also means the store itself is much busier, and there are lots of custom framing orders, so I had a ton to do. If we get backed up on orders then people won't get their artwork by Christmas and that's bad. 

I'm working away and a woman pokes her head in the doorway, which at first didn't strike me as unusual because customers did this a lot. 

Woman: Excuse me, can you come out here and help?

Me: Yes, did you need help with a custom framing order?

Woman: No, the lines at the checkout are insanely long, can you go up and help?

Me: In the front of the store, or right here at the framing counter? (I did have a register right out there, but it was just for ringing up the framing orders.)

Woman: At the front of the store, it's ridiculous, I can't wait that long to check out. 

Me: Well... I'm the only one in framing right now and we have a lot of orders, so I have been assigned to work back here...

Woman: Well the lines are really long, you should be up there helping. 

Me: I'm sorry, unless I'm told by my manager I can't just start ringing people up. 

She just huffed and walked off. I cannot believe the nerve of this woman to interrupt me while I'm clearly working on something to tell me to go across the very large store and ring her up on a register. 

Clearly she never worked in retail, because she would know it's not as simple as me just walking up to a register and checking people out. 

Plus, she seriously had to seek me out because the room I was in was literally as far away from the front cash registers as you could possibly be without going in the back where only employees were allowed. I can only assume she saw me back there earlier, saw the lines, then decided I just wasn't working hard enough and came back to give me shit. 

This was years ago and her sense of entitlement still astounds me to this day. ",How about 'No' because you're not my boss?,399

I've worked in retail since I was 16 (am now 22) and have had a LOT of negative experiences, although most of my dealings with the public have been nice, or at least tolerable.

Currently I work at a ""high end"" grocery store, similar to Central Market or Whole Foods. It's the first like it in our area and at least half, if not more, of our customers are entitled, inconsiderate and selfish. Most days I am either checking or at the customer service desk, but occasionally I will cover a shift in our fuel center.

Last week, gas prices went down (under $3) and then mid week went up to $3.09 and then $3.19. Typically, our store stays a penny cheaper than all of the other gas stations on the same highway where we are located. Our customers also earn points with loyalty cards at other stores owned by our company which they can use to get a discount on their gas.

Friday I was working in the fuel center and our price was still at $3.19 while everyone else was 10cents less than us. Several people commented on it but no one made a huge deal of it except for one man..

I was walking up to the store to take my lunch break (this was very obvious, I had my purse over my shoulder and keys in hand) and he stopped me and the following took place:

Him: Excuse me, I just want to voice a complaint.
Me: (I already know what he is going to say) Alright, what seems to be the problem?
Him: All the other gas stations on this road are at $3.09 and your price is $3.19.
Me: Yes sir, I'm so sorry for the inconvenience, but I can't change the prices until my manager tells me to.
Him: I understand that, but you need to pass this along to your GD managers. You're screwing me out of a dime!
Me: Yes sir, I will talk to my manager about that as soon as I get into the store for my lunch break.
Him: Yeah, you better let them know. I'm about to call corporate and file a formal complaint. You're screwing me out of a dime!

This wasn't a huge thing but the idiocy of it just irks me. Don't give us your business if it matters that much!! There are AT LEAST 5 other gas stations less than 5 minutes from my store in either direction. If you want your dang dime, go to one of those! Ugh.","""You're screwing me out of a dime.""",108
rabblefish,39,44,1p2eoa,192,"When I was slogging my way through my undergraduate degree, I worked part-time in a computer store.  It was a fun environment to be in.  I got to play with the latest tech toys, and my boss was an awesome stand up guy to work for (still good friends with him to this day).  Because of this, I felt very loyal to this store, and I always endeavoured to do my best to keep the business afloat.  That included scaring away potential thieves.

One of the problems with working in a computer store is that you sell a lot of expensive products, which attracted a LOT of people who tried to scam us by purchasing products with fake credit cards. Presumably, they'd pay for the product with these fake credit cards, and try to sell it for cash on sites like Craig's List or Kijiji.

These fraudsters were usually pretty easy to spot.  Their body language was usually a dead giveaway (shifty eyes, fidgeting, constantly eyeing the exit to the street etc.), but the most major red flag was when they would ask for the most expensive machine in the store without asking the sales staff any in-depth questions.  Most legitimate customers talked to us extensively before plunking down their hard earned money for a machine that cost upwards of $2000.00.  I usually spent at least 30-45 minutes answering questions when a computer sale was involved, and sometimes customers would come back 2 or 3 times with follow-up questions before making their purchases.

On one particular day, I had a woman come in to purchase a top of the line 17"" laptop, which retailed for $2,199.  She smiled and tried to qualify this by telling me, ""I need this because I'm an interior designer.""   Now I generally try not to judge a book by its cover, but internally, I snorted and said to myself, ""Yeah honey, and I'm the freakin' Pope.  God bless you my child.  Interior designer *my ass*.""

For starters, she was wearing a hot pink leopard print tube top and a black ruffled micro skirt that barely covered her assets.  The skirt could more accurately be described as a wide belt.  A violently green g-string was poking out of the top of it, and she teetered precariously on a pair of 6"" lucite platform stilettos (because nothing screams interior designer like lucite heels).  Her skin was practically covered in crappy biker tattoos.  They had that trademark DIY ""stick and poke"" look to them.

I smiled, and played along with her ruse as I usually do in these cases.  I asked her if she had any questions before I grabbed the computer from the stock room, and she fidgeted, and brusquely told me that it wasn't necessary because she had already done her research ahead of time.  Once I got to the stock room, I gave my manager the head's up, and told him to keep our loss-prevention officer on standby.  I waited for a few minutes, and returned to the sales floor with the computer she wanted.

I processed the transaction as I normally would, and she handed over her credit card.  I stifled a laugh.  Suspicions confirmed: the card was fake.  I could tell by the dots that it was printed using an inkjet printer.  It looked like it was printed at the lowest quality setting to save on the cost of ink.  The holographic sticker one usually sees on a genuine credit card was also peeling off.  With a straight face, I asked her for a piece of government-issued of photo ID to verify that she was the cardholder.  It's standard procedure for purchases of this size.  I had to try really, really hard to stifle another laugh because what she presented was barely a step up from [this](http://ih2.redbubble.net/image.12169805.1741/mtd,375x360,n,s,TWNMb3ZpbiE%3D,ffffff.jpg)

Then I feigned puzzlement and frowned at the screen on the register, telling this ""interior designer"" that we were having ""technical difficulties"".  I called K., the aforementioned loss-prevention officer, and told him ""Hi K.  We have a code 10.  Would you mind coming up and making sure that my register is in good working order?"".  While we waited, she fidgeted quite a bit, eyed the exit about half a dozen times, and texted non-stop on her BlackBerry.  I smiled, and told her we should have it sorted out in a few minutes.  A poker-faced K. came up, and I handed over the card to him.  He went into the back office, called merchant services, and verified that it was indeed a fake.

Ms. Interior Designer seemed to sense that the jig was up.  She didn't even wait for K. to come back with her fake credit card.  (Good thing too, because if she had waited around, he would have arrested her.)  She excused herself, power walked as quickly as one could in 6"" lucite heels, and practically RAN towards a car parked outside the store.  K. dashed out after her, heard her yell, ""ALLEZ! ALLEZ!"" (French for ""GO! GO!"") to the man in the driver's seat, and managed to jot down the license plate of the car before it screeched away.  K. reported the incident to the police, and a couple of weeks later, he tells me that they were arrested.  Apparently this wasn't an isolated incident for Ms. Interior Designer and her gang of accomplices.  They were doing this in computer stores all over the city, and it finally caught up with them.  

**TL;DR** Trashy biker chick dressed like a stripper pretends to be an interior designer, attempts to purchase a $2200 laptop with a fake credit card, tries to prove her false identity with a laughably fake ID, gets thwarted by salesperson, and is eventually arrested.

Edited for crappy French.  Thanks /u/bsievers !

terattt,30,10,1p2b6o,42,"A woman came in today with both barrels blazing to make a complaint about how she had returned a coffee pot a few days ago and had just now noticed that on the receipt she didn't receive all the money she ""should have"". It had been on sale when she purchased it and she claimed that we refunded her as if the sale had been applied to the item price *after* taxes instead of *before* taxes (turns out this makes no difference since multiplication is commutative, so she was completely wrong). But she came in so angry and was so condescending to me that I could barely even speak. She intimidated me and started saying how I had no idea what I was doing when I took even a second to try to follow her logic and didn't understand all the confusing things she was throwing at me immediately. ""Do you REALLY not understand what I'm saying?"" she said as she gave me a look of utter disdain. I just apologized and tried to figure it out but luckily another more seasoned employee came over and handled it for me.

But I want to know. How do you handle people like this? If I had been able to keep my composure I would've been fine, but the way she had me against the ropes by insulting me, insinuating I was dumb for not getting it immediately, I got flustered and fell right into her trap. And I felt horrible afterward. I don't want this to happen again. Please help me!","New to retail. How are you supposed to deal with angry, condescending customers like this?

Antigon35,38,40,1p2ajd,175,"A lot of people seem to have what I call a reaction word or phrase.  When something happens and it surprises you, this word/ phrase seems to be the first thing you utter when the ability to talk is regained. Mine is “Really.” It usually sounds sarcastic but my little brother swears he can tell you my next course of action based entirely on how I say this one word. Working in customer service, I have used this word at least a million times. I tend to at least make the attempt to seem polite however not always. 


So at the time, I am working at a small store in the mall which carries jewelry, small toys and mostly pre teen based merchandise. It’s usually a pretty laid back job with one or two crazies and an occassional teeny bopper shoplifter that I make cry. One day Ms. Scuzzy comes in pushing a small child in a stroller (about two years old). Ms. Scuzzy is about 50 something with matted hair and wearing a dress about 3 sizes too small. I was working with a newer employee and demonstrating how to pierce a little girl’s ears. I noticed that where ever I was in the store, Ms. Scuzz was on the other side. Ms. Scuzz also seemed to be staring at me a lot and every once in awhile, would lean forward towards the stroller. Scuzz was always behind a “tower” containing merchandise when she did this. I began watching the tilted mirrors that were above the sales floor.  The next time Scuzz leaned forward, I watched her shoveling merchandise behind the child into the seat of the stroller.  I point this out to the newer employee (NE) and ask her to call the mall security guard. By now I have finished with the paying customer and ring her up. NE apparently noticed that Scuzz is making a roll for it. NE stops her in front of the store. I don’t hear exactly what took place however, I see Scuzz **KICK NE** in the shin, and try to run out of the store **WITHOUT** the child or stroller! Scuzz then sees a manager from the neighboring store running towards her, turns around and runs to the back of our store. I follow her and I guess she thought we had a back exit but all we have is a storage closet.  So now she’s in the doorway of our storage closet, NE is holding the sobbing two year old and I am standing between Scuzz and the exit, holding the door to the storage closet. Scuzz raises her arm over her head and makes a fist like she is going to hit me. One word comes out of my mouth “Really.” Not sarcastic, not yelled, just disbelief that I am going to have to fight a fifty year old lady over cheap jewelry. She lowers her fist …and spits in my face. WHAM. I slammed the door I was holding full into her. She’s knocked back and blood just pours out of her nose. 


Long story short, Cops show up, she’s charged with assault and shoplifting.  I get tested, clean bill of health and I get fired for hitting a “customer” in the face with a door. The charge against her for me was dropped because it was “mutual combat”. Oh and she had about $200.00 worth of merchandise. Apparently she had been doing this at multiple other locations and returning the merchandise later for cash.  The 2 year old was her grandkid that she was not supposed to be left alone with so hopefully that got dealt with as well because child services showed up.
	
TLDR: Don’t spit on me.  The door will hit you on the way out.

DubiousKing,11,35,1p29gi,140,"I've been working for a small shop in my local mall for the better part of a year now. I've been told by multiple people higher up the chain than me that I'm considered part of the store's ""core staff"", but I've been passed up for promotion a few times. Not necessarily the happiest of campers, but I still work hard and get the job done. Pretty recently we had what I would call the biggest scheduling CF to date.

See, our employees in each location are mostly divided into 4 main positions, in order of hierarchy: team member, team leader, assistant manager, general manager. By the book, team members are never allowed to man the store by themselves, there always needs to be a team lead or manager there, and no one is allowed to be there alone except for the one person who preps the store before opening.

On most weekdays we'll have one of them open and one of them close, with their hours overlapping to allow for breaks. This day, however, the opening team leader had to leave early and the closing team leader couldn't arrive until much later, which meant a third had to be scheduled to cover the time inbetween.

I was on opening shift and we receive a call at about noon. It's the team lead who's supposed to come in to cover for the afternoon and she's bedridden with some illness (I didn't answer the call, so I don't know the details). Our general manager is out of town, so we commence panic mode as we call other stores in the area to see if someone can lend us a team lead. No one's available, so I'm given a crash course on managerial duties (contact numbers, PoS overrides, how to process returns, etc). We manage to get the closing team member to come in early, but I'm stuck running the store with no formal training for 3 hours.

Our store also has sales goals, both for the store itself and for each of us individually. Making these goals earns a commission-style bonus at the end of the month. Usually these are pretty tough to hit, especially since our store's products are what most would consider purely luxury goods. By the time the closing team leader arrived I had gone well over my personal goal for the day and covered almost half of the store's goal single-handedly.

I think I did good.

**TL;DR** - Left for 3 hours without a manager. Given a crash course on how to be a manager. Did a damn good job.","Sorry, we don't have a manager here right now, just me",175
jdpatric,74,89,1p293f,391,"After reading [Layaway 101](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1p1twd/layaway_101/) I thought of my time at the hardware store and rentals...I was going to post it there as a comment but it's just really long. 

I used to work at a small hardware store in a med/large town. We offered a few in store services and one of them was rentals. We had two different types of carpet cleaners we rented along with pressure washers. Each rental had a form we had to fill out on the computer. We didn't require an email address but we did require an in state drivers license (or some form of military ID), two phone numbers, and a credit card (we charged the deposit to the credit card). Note: If you're reading this you probably know that a debit card can be run as credit provided it has a major logo on it. I can't tell you how many people I've had to explain this to. Especially when cashiering. 

Here are a few stories of people doing rentals:

**Number one**

Angry guy comes in (AG).

AG - I need to patch a hose.

Me - OK, here's the aisle where we sell hose menders.

AG - No. It's for a pressure washer.

Me - What? Like gas powered 2000 PSI pressure washer?

AG - No; it's 3000 PSI.

Me - We don't sell anything to patch that kind of hose.

AG - Why?

Me - Because it could kill you.

AG - Oh...how much to rent a pressure washer hose?

Me - I don't think we rent just the hose out; let me check.

Me - Sorry you have to rent the machine. It's $50 with a $20 deposit that gets refunded when you return the machine.

AG - That's not too bad...sign me up.

Me - I need a drivers license and a credit card sir.

AG - Well I don't have a credit card; just cash.

Me - Sir the deposit is required to be on a card.

AG - I want to see a manager.

Manager tells him the same thing. Finally the guy gets agitated.

AG - If your store wasn't so cheap I could just use my Visa and this wouldn't be a problem.

Me - That'd work.

AG - No it wont! It's a debit card you idiot.

Me - Actually it will run quite nicely as either credit or debit; I have the same card from the same bank and use mine here at least once a week.

AG (obviously flustered and embarrassed as hell now) - Fine. Ring me up.

He called back later to complain that it wouldn't start. It was out of gas...he'd been trying to figure out what was wrong with it for an hour.

AG - What do you mean **I** have to put gas in it.

Me - Well sir, it runs on gas...? (didn't really know what else to say).

AG - You guys don't put gas in them for me?

Me - Sir, we don't sell gas here.

AG - *hangs up*

He tried to get a refund for the machine later. Was turned down.

**Number two**

A guy wearing a Bluetooth and a full business suit comes into the store in a HUGE hurry. (HH)

HH - I need to rent a carpet cleaner and I'm in a rush.

Me - Ok, I've done plenty of these and will have you out of here in no time. I need a drivers license and a credit card please.

HH - OK. *hands me the stuff*

On the rental form I was required to get a home and a cell phone. It was OK to get two cells...heck, even a relatives cell/home just so long as we had two legit phone numbers. This was a CYA for the cashier as much as for the owner; If the machine goes missing the owner has two places to call looking for it, and if the cashier puts two phone numbers (even if it was just a neighbor) then the cops had a second thing to go on...or so the owner told us. I was OK with it, it was the rules.

Me - OK, last thing; I need a home and a cell phone number.

HH - My cell is (when he said this I kind of expected the worst) 867-5309 (not really), just use that; you don't need my home phone.

Me - Sorry sir, the form requires two phone numbers for the rental. 

HH - Well, we don't give out our home phone number to anyone; we don't want telemarketers to call.

Me - We don't give this information out to anyone, in fact this particular computer isn't even connected to the internet.

HH - Well, I don't have a home phone. (lie?)

Me (slightly annoyed at being lied to) - Sir, I can use another cell...does your wife have one?

HH - Yes, but I'm not giving you that either.

My manager (who knew I was a veteran at this) had seen the debacle beginning to unfold and had stepped over to assist (thankfully).

Manager - It's the store policy from the owner sir. I'm afraid there's nothing we can do it you wont give us two phone numbers.

HH - This is insane. Fine. Here's my work cell. (really? all that?)

I ring him up and set him on his way. Didn't think anything of it. I the next had three days off due to the way my semester was scheduled at the time and then was on for four days. When I returned the owner was on the phone yelling at someone (not terribly unusual; owner was great but occasionally he had to call people and be ""that guy"").

The next day someone goes to return a carpet cleaner using the form the guy had rented it with the previous **WEEK** (at this point). There's a huge late fee which the guy had negotiated down a bit with the owner. Note: the guy returning HH's machine is not HH.

New guy (NG) - I need to return this.

Me - OK, do you have the card it was rented on? (expecting the worst; we needed the card to refund the deposit).

NG - Yeah, HH wont be needing it anymore. He's been fired.

Turns out the guy was a really mid-level fairly new employee at a local company who had invited a bunch of friends **to his office** to watch college football (they had several rather large TV's and projectors for conferences and such apparently) and party on Saturday with the intent of cleaning up the mess on Sunday. Something went awry when he tried to use his company card to pay for the rental and got caught.

**Number three**

 On a really cold day a sketchy guy and his equally sketchy wife/partner/not even sure what walk into the store and ask to rent a pressure washer. This is in Florida so cold is a relative term, but it was legit winter and the high was in the low 50's. I wouldn't want to pressure wash on a day like that.

Sketchy guy (SG) - I need to rent a pressure washer.

Me - OK, I need a drivers license and a credit card.

SG - Uhhhh, one sec, (says to sketchy lady (SL)) dig my license outta your purse for me. (Back to me) Can you fill the rest out while she does that?

Me - Ummm, sure; I don't see why not. I need a Home phone and a cell (moving to the next open brackets).

SG - Uhhhh, my cell is (insert number here) and I don't have a home phone.

Me - I need two numbers sir.

SL (very quietly and under her breath to SG) - Just make one up quick hun.

SG (Thinking that for some ungodly reason I couldn't hear SL) - Yeah uhhh...my home phone is (insert some obviously made up number here).

Me - Yeah. I'm not going to put that in. You just made that up.

SG - How do you know I didn't make the first one up?

I was about to reply saying ""because you didn't pause for 3-5 seconds between each number and forget our area code with the first one,"" when SL picked this moment to ""find"" SG's drivers license.

SL - Oh here's his license!

I take one look at it and I see the saddest excuse for a fake ID I've seen. Probably ever. It was beat to death. The guy on there, while also a very sketchy individual, was **NOT** SG.

Me - Sir, I'm sorry, I can't rent you this machine...this is not you in the picture.

The computer we used for rentals was LITERALLY on the wall of the owners office and the walls didn't connect to the ceiling so he could hear whenever we had a problem with a rental, and he had one way glass so they could see it too.

Owner (comes out of the office and tkaes the fake ID) - Sir, I'm going to ask that you hang around here for a few minutes until the police arrive or I wont be giving you ""your drivers license"" back.

SG - KEEP IT! *runs away with SL in tow*

Owner didn't really call the cops but pinned the ""license"" up to ward off future attempts to steal our machines.

**Number four**

This is one of my all time favorites.

A couple in their late 60's early 70's walk in the door and right off the bat I can see something is off. They just look a little confused...something's just different...I could tell. 

Me - How're y'all doing today (yeah southern drawl; I'd put it on for retail lol)? Can I help you with anything?

Confused couple (CC) - *Utter silence.*

Me (now confused myself) - Can I help you?

CC - *Still silent.*

At this point they began to sign to each other and I determined that they were both deaf. Well, that explains a lot. Found out that they were both INCREDIBLY proficient at reading lips (to the point where they warned me not to mutter anything negative under my breath as they'd probably pick that up too). We communicated via writing on slips of paper. They need a carpet cleaner. Ok, no problem; I write that I need  a drivers license and a credit card. They gladly provided me with both. Since they could read lips I would usually just ask them questions and they'd write.

Me - OK, I just need a home and a cell...phone...number... (I realized how ridiculous this was as I was asking for it...they were **DEAF** why would they have a phone?!?)

The man just looked at me with a stare that said ""what the fuck am I going to do with a phone?!?""

Me - Ummm...sorry...one sec.

I go straight to the owner who happened to be there that day (obviously he hadn't heard much if any of the one sided conversation I was having with CC). I explain the situation to the owner. At first he doesn't budge.

Owner - We need two phone numbers no matter what.

Me - Owner. They. Are. **DEAF**. They don't **HAVE** one phone between them, let alone two.

Owner - Yeah...I guess we've never had this come up before...ummm...Yeah...Uhhhh...just fill in the blanks with numbers.

Had anyone but the owner told me to do that I'd have told them to pound sand but that came from the tippity top and it was already an odd case so I punched it right in.

They didn't give us any trouble at all, returned it same day and everything went fine.

 A very heavily muscled man in his mid-thirties came through my line buying four containers of the BOGO ice cream. He looked at the screen and asked me why there was tax on the ice cream. Just as confused as he was, I told him I wasn't sure.   

He got mad, ""Well, I want the tax removed! Take the tax off!""   

Nonplussed, I informed him that I am not able to do that, and that the store does not decide what gets taxed.   

""I want to see your manager!"" He was getting visibly red in the face.  

 ""I would be happy to get you a manager, sir. Wait just one moment."" My tone was nothing but pleasant and polite.  

 He looked at me, incredulous (why he gave me this look when I was willing to do what he asked is beyond me). ""Forget it, I'll get my ice cream else where!"" and then he left.

stillalurker112,64,109,1p24c1,508,"So a couple people asked for more about the manager at the orange home improvement store, well here you go.For those that didn't see the last post, I work as an order picker for deliveries and will call. Basically you order something, I'm the lucky guy that gets to find it in the store, put it on a pallet, and then shove it on a truck. So a customer went through management to place an order for about 250 linear feet of molding (they normally come in 15 foot lengths). Apparently after talking to this manager, she created the order and pulled it herself. But she didn't put the order to the dispatch, so our delivery trucks don't know they have an order to deliver. She didn't put a location as to where she left the order. And she didn't put a purple tag on it to say that it was for deliveries/will call.So going through the store picking the order, we are only able to get about half of the molding. Great. So I call the customer to see if they want to wait, or if we want to try to get it from another store. She assures me that we have enough, and to talk to my manager. So I dial 101, manager picks up and I explain the situation. She quickly snaps back at me that the order is by the managers office on a cart. This was surprising because when you complete an order, you put a tag on it, and you put it by the door that we load the trucks out of, not the managers office. So whatever, I go pick it up.Once there, she tells me that she told me about this yesterday and that I'm wasting time. I paused and reminded her that I don't work on Tuesdays, that you must have told someone else. She said that she knew she told me. So I go and print out my punch times for the last week, and none were made on Tuesday. I shove it on her desk, and kindly tell her to let us handle deliveries because it wastes her time. She looks a little embarrassed.So we get the order and are all set too put it on the truck. But the driver says that he doesn't have room for it and that its not in the dispatch route he has. Well fuck me. Nothing we can do about it, he's right. So we call the customer and inform them that we have the material, but that we can't deliver it today. Lady flips a shit and asks to speak with management.Couple minutes later, I get a call from this bitch of a manager. And she is screaming at me for not delivering it. Then I explained how it wasn't in the dispatch and the driver didn't have room, so he couldn't have taken it. Here comes the face palm moment. She asked what the dispatch is. Ohhhh boy. She had no clue that you need to let the fucking delivery truck service know that you have an order or orders to pick up! So I end up walking down to her office again to show her what she didn't do. And I told her that she can call the customer back and tell them why we can't deliver it. And I stood there and watched her sheepishly explain how she didn't know what she was doing to the customer.Moral of the story, managers have no clue on the day-to-day operations of store employees.

afleabag,11,29,1p20in,120,"So I work at a food retail and I typically am a stocker. I grab a blue cart, and wheel all the cases off a pallet onto the shelves while customers walk throughout the store. I also have to inquire whether every single customer needs help. It kind feels like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU8eCAa16jo

Back on topic though. So I was roaming through the freezer aisle when this old Italian man walks up to me and asks about our chicken breasts. ""Uh Uh, what is difference between these?"" he asks with a thick accent, pointing at two of our items. After having to ask him to repeat for the fifth time I understand him and promptly say ""One is larger than the other."" He then asks me ""Does this one have the black stripes the other one does?"" referring to the grill marks on the chicken in the packaging. First of all, you can have grill marks on anything you grill, but I politely say ""Yes, both have them once cooked.""

Apparently that wasn't enough, and he starts asking me more unintelligible questions until I decide to tell him I'll get my manager. Right before I leave he grabs a woman near us - a customer -  and asks her about the product saying ""Excuse you are woman, you know kitchen, can you tell me about these chicken breasts?"" The woman had to tell him three times she didn't work there and that she didn't know. My manager comes and tells the guy the same thing I did, which leads to him walking away obviously displeased.

mittens12,26,23,1p20hc,101,"I worked for a rather large makeup and skincare company outlet store. I'll admit...it f-ing blew. However, it paid the bills and some of the people were cool so I stayed for a few years while I went to college. 

Because the prices are so discounted we have this rule where each customer could only purchase 3 of one item each day. However, the way the rule was written on the company signage it could be taken many different ways. Some customers would think that it meant per trip...so, they could come in and purchase the items as many times as they wanted as long as it was separate transactions. Others thought that the rule applied to each shopping party...it was always a mess. However, one particular day we had a woman who was quite a maroon. 

Woman walks in and finds her items for purchase. One of which she buys the entire stock on the shelf because it's discontinued. So, we're talking like 10 of the same eyeshadow. She then approached the register where I was waiting.

Me: I'm sorry, but you can only purchase 3 of one item per day. 

Her: What do you mean three?

Me: I mean that you can only purchase three of this particular eye shadow...if you'd like to come back tomorrow you can certain purchase another three. 

Her: I live very far away...I can't come back tomorrow. 

Me: I'm sorry, I can't give you more then three.

I begin to ring up three and as I begin to bag them she actually has the nerve to grab another and scan it. 

Me: I'm very sorry. But, I could lose my job if I sell you more than three. It's a corporate rule...(I point to the sign behind me)

I then proceeded to remove the eyeshadow from the order and she begins to open her purse. 

Customer: Listen, I need this eyeshadow. And yes, my life does depend on it. Can you please call your manager or some kind of corporate person and let me talk to them. 

Me: I can call my manager at home, but she will tell you the same information. 

Customer: Please call her

Manager: Okay, put her on please.

Customer: Listen, At this point....I can find no other eye shadow that does the trick. I need this eye shadow...(she begins to tear up)...my daughter recently found out she had a miscarriage and nothing would make her happier than having this.

Urbaniz3d,34,16,1p1yxk,90,"So I work in the essentials/food section of a well known UK pharmacy brand and where we're situated in town we receive a lot of custom from tourists taking tours, of all things, as we're the designated start/stop point for most of them. Normally I enjoy helping the Chinese count money or teaching them basic English or having a laugh with the Americans and Australians we get through the door.

So the other day I was serving a lovely American woman who was taking advantage of a BOGOF offer on some disposable cameras. Light chit chat, nothing special, just about the views in my town and where she could take photos and how good the deal was. Then her partner or friend, also female, was next in line and placed a large bottle of mouthwash on the counter.

Me: ""Ok that's £3.65.""
Her: ""No.""
Me: ""....sorry?""
Her: ""No it's not. It's two for £6.""
Me: ""Yes...I understand that but you have one here.""
Her: ""So if two are £6, one must be £3"" (can't fault her maths)
Me: ""That's not entirely how it works, see, that deal is to save you money in the long run and to promote more purchases on our end. You buy 2, you save a few pence, it's how most deals of that nature work.""
Her: ""I'll have to see your manager.""

At this point I'm flabbergasted. I don't know how I could have been clearer or friendlier or how this could have made more sense. Anyway so my manager comes down and I serve a few more people whilst she talks to him and when he comes to get me I'm sent for my break with the words ""I hear you were rude and condescending"". Great, now I'm in for it and I'm still on a probationary period at work.

Here's the kicker - on my way to the staff room she COMPLETELY RELENTS to a female member of staff and says that actually the price is entirely reasonable and that she will take the large bottle and the whole party leave the store laughing happily ever after. I get a bollocking.

JealousyGrey,44,21,1p1twd,127,"First, a little background. The big box store I recently started working at just changed their layaway policy, so it is now a free service. The information we need to put into the computer is different also, as we were soon to find out. Myself and an electronics guy named J needed to learn how to do it, so the customer service manager (CSM) promised she would call us over when she had one to show us.

Eventually, in walks the first layaway customer of the season (LC). She seems nice enough, one of those customers who is quiet and polite but not overly friendly. She has a cart full of items, and right away J and I groan internally. You see, to qualify for layaway, an item must be $15 or over, and most of her items we knew were not. This fact is clearly displayed on all the layaway advertisements in the store and in our flyers. Needless to say, she was not happy about this fact, and any facade of politeness dropped, leaving a quietly fuming customer standing in front of us for the rest of the transaction.

Once we sort out the things she can put on layaway, J hops on the ancient artifact that is the layaway computer. The OS is so old that it is black with green type, and you have to type each command in. It takes J a minute to reach the Layaway screen, with a few instructions from the CSM. Meanwhile, LC is staring him down silently like he is the cause of all the evil in the world, punctuating the quiet with loud sighs.

Finally, after ringing her items, we get to the point where we have to enter her information. She seems to be more cooperative with the prospect of the end in sight, and gives us her name and phone number and all that jazz without complaint. J and I are relieved, and we zoom through the rest of the information quickly... until he asks for an email address. Her face went from bland to absolutely stone cold in a split second.

LC: ""They didn't ask me for that last year, you don't need that."" 

(Really? you've done this before and you still brought us a cart full of &lt;$15 items? That rule has never changed, but I digress.)

CSM: ""Well you see, when they made the layaway free they also made a few other changes to the process. Now we need an email address to process the transaction.""

LC: ""Well you're not getting it.""

CSM: ""... I'll see what I can do.""

So the CSM calls the manager and asks if there is any way to override it, but of course there isn't. We absolutely NEED an email to do layaway.

J: ""You're sure there isn't ANY email address you can give us?""

LC: ""For the last time, I'm not letting you people have that information. I don't want to get junk mail or viruses from you. Just skip it, you don't need it, and I won't let you have it.""

CSM: ""Well we need one to process the transaction, so...""

There's an extremely awkward silence while LC just stares at the CSM like we've asked for her social security number or something. She isn't giving it up. Me not being so good with the awkward silence thing, I softly ask

""You don't have, like, a junk email you could give maybe? I know some people have one just for that, maybe you could make one when you get home and it will work? It's usually free...""

LC: ""Well of course I can give you THAT. My junk email is 1234@1234.com.""

After about 20 minutes of trying to override and trying to reason with her and pleading for LITERALLY ANY email she could give, we all just stare for a second

J: ""... that would work.""

So we finish the transaction, she goes away vowing never to do layaway again, and we go away hoping she doesn't. The End.

**TL;DR: I learn layaway, lady learns that a junk email address is still an actual email address.**

EDIT: I told my CSM what /u/TheEllimist said, that the store has a default email for layaway. She admitted she hadn't read the revised rules, and apologized to me and J.",Layaway 101,148
FredFltStn,172,511,1p1o2q,1243,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven.

**STORY:**  You can’t imagine the things people offer to trade for fireworks. In my business, the barter system is alive and well, and I'm always willing to listen to a trade proposal. Heck, I’ve even made more than a few barter offers myself. Here are a few of the things I’ve bartered for over the years.

* My 6 x 12 dual axle utility trailer was paid for half in cash, and half in fireworks.

* This past year, I had a gentleman trade me Silver Eagle coins for fireworks.

* I’ve traded advertising and promotional spots for fireworks.

* I’ve traded pizza and catering for fireworks.

* I’ve traded on site electrical work for fireworks.

* My chilled water dispenser was a trade for fireworks that I bartered off of Craigslist.

But my favorite trade by far, happened three years ago this New Year's Eve.

A guy walked into my tent and asked to speak to the manager. The company he worked for was throwing a New Year's Eve party, and he wanted to know if I would be interested in doing a trade for fireworks. I told him maybe, and asked what they wanted to trade.

He led me outside to his SUV and popped the back. 

I can only hope that one day, when I eventually die and I arrive at the pearly gates to be greeted by St. Peter, that I experience the joy and amazement that I felt at that very moment.

There, beaming up at me from the back of that magical SUV, were more than 3 dozen bottles of premium spirits. There were a dozen bottles each of Makers Mark, and Knob Creek. The rest were assorted high end bottles of Scotch, Vodka, and Whiskey, with two bottles of whiskey in a plain white label that were sent to distributors for tasting and we're not on the market yet (they were FANTASTIC).

It turns out that he worked for a local liquor distributor, and I can guarantee you that they had an amazing fireworks show that New Year's Eve. My employees were also VERY happy with their additional NYE bonus.

bekahbbydoll,15,8,1p1bup,21,"**BEWARE: WALL OF RANT!!!**

So a little bit of background. I have lots of health problems. The immune system of a 5 year old, chronic headaches with migraines at least once a month, and chronic back pain as well.


This past Friday I was scheduled to get my wisdom teeth out. I had already requested off for Friday through Monday, but the closer it got to Friday the more I really had wished that I had requested off for Thursday as well, just to be able to prepare myself for my surgery. I was scheduled to close that night which meant that I wouldn't have gone on meal till 8:30 and I was told by my oral surgeon not to eat at least 14 hours before surgery. I tried my hardest to get someone to pick up my shift, but no luck. I even tried to switch with someone who was working Wednesday. I had mentioned that I was trying to get my Thursday shift covered to one of my managers, we'll call her Loud Mouth (LM for short).


Well flash back to Thursday. I always wake up with a headache, there's no escaping it. No amount of medication seems to help. Some days are a little more bearable than others, some days I can't get out of bed. Well this particular day my head hurt so bad that my vision was blurry and I was running to the bathroom every hour almost to vomit my guts out. So I called out. There was no way in hell that I was going to be able to function at work if I couldn't stand, let alone see. 


Flash forward to today. It's my first day back after my extraction, I'm still in a considerable amount of pain and I'm not in the best of moods. LM happened to be there tonight and I ran into her when I was coming back from my first 15. I had mentioned to her that I was trying to get my shift for next Saturday picked up so that I could spend some time with my grandparents who are coming into town next Wednesday. The following conversation took place:


LM: Speaking of covering shifts, why did you call out last Thursday?

Me: I had the worst migraine ever. My vision was blurry and there was just no way that I would have been able to drive to work.

LM: *long pause* You know, you don't have to make up excuses. I know that you had other plans for that day. We all have other things we'd rather do than come to work, but if you want that GSA position (basically a front end assistant manager position) you're going to have to be better about attendance.


Now, I NEVER call out for stupid shit. The only time I call out or go home early is if it's absolutely necessary. Half of our cashiers will call out or go home early if they have a hangnail. 


Me: LM, first of all you know I get really bad headaches sometimes. Second of all, I had no plans. I even told you that I had absolutely NO problem just working the shift if I couldn't get someone to pick it up. 

LM: I just want to make sure that you aren't slacking on your responsibilities. You know this store has a zero tolerance for pour attendance. You have to have at least a 90% or better. And last month you had an 85%

Me: Last month I had strep throat AND the stomach flu. I'm pretty sure that it was better that I called out instead of coming to work and getting more of your employees sick.

LM: Look I'm not trying to scold you. I'm just trying to help you be a better employee and better for the GSA position. 

Me: *very sarcastically* well thank you EVER so much for doing everything in your power to make sure I'm the absolute best employee that I can possibly be. 


I just start to walk away after that. I'm so perturbed that she had the audacity to try and say that I was just calling out so I could basically sit on my ass all day and watch TV. I wanted to scream at her that I'm pretty sure if her head had been hurting as bad as mine, she probably wouldn't have been able to function long enough to pick up the phone to even call out. She knows that I bust my ass every fucking day to make sure that our guests are getting the best possible service that they can as well as making sure that our guest service area and our dollar section look SPECTACULAR and not like shit. Which is how it looks most of the time because most of our Guest Service team members couldn't give two shits about anything. They think that the Guest Service desk is the easiest position in the store because all you have to do it process returns. How fucking dare her try to accuse me of that kind of shit. 

The worst part; she knows me personally, like outside of work. She knows for a FACT I would never do that kind of shit. UGH!

Rant: OVER

**Me:** Wonderful, if I could just see any ID, I'd be happy to give you that discount.

Vasite,11,2,1p0y80,35,"Its Tuesday, i love working Tuesdays because people seem to be happier during the week and easier to work with. I work at a fairly large department store than gives out $10 coupons at random in the mail and people come in and use them, but get confused on our return policy. Since we gave them the $10 as a ""gift"" when they return a item we have the right to not refund them the $10, only what they paid for the item. With this being said a middle-aged women walked up to customer service to do a return..

Women: Hello! i'd like to return this shirt i purchased *for $19.99*

Me: sure let me get that for 

*Many clickly sounds later*

Me: Okay you'll get $7.14 for the refund on your visa card.

Woman: Um, why? i paid $19.99 for it

Me: Well you had a 20% off coupon so we take your ""savings"" back on the refund (as i point to the screen to show her this) and it appears you used a $10 gift which you will not be getting back in the return

Woman: Why not? i want it in MDC (merchandise credit) it was a $10 and I should get it back. 

Me: Since we mail those out as a ""gift"" coupon not a earned one we reserve the right to not refund it to you. It doesn't work like our store cash does.  

* For those who do not know, we also offer ""store cash"" $10 for every $50 a customer buys in which they would then get that back in MDC if they wanted to return a item they spent that Store cash on*

Women: No, change it now or get me a manager to do it. 

Me: i will happily get a manager for you but i can assure you they can't change it to give you the MDC. *phones a manager*

So i'm cutting this short but i had to explain the concept of her not getting the $10 MDC several several times to her before she demanded a manager. At this point she gets very upset that manager will not give her the $10 and leaves saying semi-loudly ""I can't believe you guys are keeping my money from me!

Wow! I'm surprised that I got such a great response with my first post to TFR. 

Thanks again for reading, everyone. This is a two-story post, so buckle yourselves in! Buy popcorn before reading!

Like I said before, I worked in the 'burbs. This resulted in a lot of soccer moms and very entitled teenagers coming in, just not getting our policies. 

One of my jobs is to stand and take customer's tickets, letting them know where their movie is. It's boring (seeing as I have to stand for several hours), but hey, it's easy cash. The other part of that job is checking IDs for R-rated movies. 

These are usually checked by the box office, but many people ordered tickets from our ticket kiosks in the lobby. As a result, these tickets needed to be checked by someone like me. Otherwise, we'd (once again) get in trouble with corporate.

One evening, a group of teenagers walks in to see a certain R-rated movie. If you've been to the movies at that age, that means being asked for an ID before we can let you in. 

And without fail, there's always that one person. That one guy or girl who is offended that you had to get them to show their ID. And then they don't have it.

""But I'm 16! You gotta believe me, I'm not lying to you!""

""I'm sorry, but you need to be 17 in order to see this movie.""

""But I don't have my ID with me.""

""Once again, I cannot let you into this movie. You can get a refund at the box office, though.""

""I'm with all my friends, and they have tickets too!""

""Then I need to see their IDs as well.""

Surprise, surprise, none of them have an ID.

""I apologize, but I cannot let you guys in, either."" Cue huffy attitude.

""You should just let us in. We came all this way, and now YOU had to ruin our fun.""

At this point, I have stopped caring. Clearly, this group wasn't getting it.

""Sorry, everyone. You can get a refund at the box office.""

Thankfully, the group leaves to go get their money back. Shortly after, two other teenagers show up. I check their IDs, which they have! And...they're old enough! Huzzah, responsible teenagers!

""Okay, you guys are all set. Enjoy the show!""

One of the girls from the previous group emerges from the bathroom at this point, noticing the two teens that just entered. Turns out, she knows them from her school. From the corner of my eye, they start talking.

Cue one of my managers, who comes over to see what had been holding me up at my station. I explain what had happened, to which he nods and empathizes with my (temporary) plight.

""DID YOU CALL HER A B*#%#?!?""

This sudden exclamation makes the both of us turn around. One of the boys that the girl was talking to starts yelling at us, insisting that I had ""torn up her ticket into tiny pieces and made fun of her.""

Now, TFR, I am not an angry person. People who have come to know me describe me as ""mellow,"" ""a human puppy,"" and ""calm."" I have not, in any way, treated customers like this. This is something my manager also knew, so he immediately knew this group was trying to start something with us. He directs the group to leave and collect their refund, to which they begin to comply with. 

...Until one of them throws their plastic cup of water at the both of us, and missed.

Now my manager is really ticked off. He immediately starts forcing them out of the lobby, sans refund, with nothing but words alone. 'Twas a glorious night.

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!

The morning following the incident, the girl who had started the whole thing has her uncle, of all people, come on down to chat with my general manager about what had happened. While I wasn't there, my managers let me know how it went down:

The uncle demanded to see a manager about the way ""we had mistreated my niece last night,"" followed by a surge of profanity. My manager managed to settle him down and get him upstairs to our offices. After telling my manager about what he had heard, my manager showed him the footage from our security cameras to confirm that such an event had taken place. 

Suffice to say, it did not. The previous night's events were all on there, in full color, in clear detail. It then became obvious that someone had lied to this girl's uncle, and it sure wasn't us.

The uncle's reply?

""Sorry for wasting your time. Thanks.""

And he promptly left, no questions asked.

------------------------------------------------------

Story two begins a few years before the above incident, back when I first started working at the theater. I was a newly-christened ticketer, all set and ready to direct customers to their respective theaters. 

One of the movies we had out at the time was *Slumdog Millionaire*. If you haven't seen it, it's a fantastic look into life in the slums of India. And their version of *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire*, apparently. It was also noted for some pretty violent and graphic scenes in the first half-hour or so, giving it a much-deserved ""R"" rating. 

Our box office has ratings of all of our movies up on several displays, and the movie posters have the ""R"" notification, courtesy of the MPAA, stamped on each copy we own.

With that in mind, let's continue our story.

A family with a boy no older than 9 years old angrily comes back to the box office, approaching me. This had been about 30-40 minutes after the show had started.

""We want a refund. This movie was inappropriate for our son.""

""I'm sorry it wasn't to your liking, sir. Could I ask what movie you were seeing?""

He hands me his ticket, and I immediately see the ""*Slumdog Millionaire*"" tag on our ticket.

""This is false advertising! There's not a single dog in the movie! And it was so violent!""

whut.

It takes all of my willpower to not laugh at how silly this was. 

""I'm sorry, sir, but our box office has ratings next to our movie. Please be sure to check with us next time if you have any questions about the film.""

Suddenly, a little voice comes into the conversation.

""I TOLD you it was rated R, Dad! Why didn't you listen?""

The man's son was clearly a notch brighter when it came to ordering tickets. Face reddening, the man and his wife head up to the box office to recieve their refund. 

After they had left, my co-worker turns to me and says, 

""Did that...just happen? Are people really that dense?""

""I guess so. Wow.""

We both start laughing and continue into the night, without a single person complaining about the lack of dogs in *Slumdog Millionaire*.

HeresJerzei,13,3,1p0wim,27,"I worked in a music store for a few years, and loved it.  It was a locally owned store, but bigger than most. It had a great rep, and I'd been going there and buying stuff from there for many years. To get a job there was the most awesome thing to ever happen to me. 

After a while, the store was getting too big for the premises. The owner wanted to expand the product lines and make significant changes, but there just wasn't the space. He'd looked around for a new building, but there was nothing suitable available at the time. As a short-term interim solution, we ended up splitting into two stores for a while. The drums and audio/PA gear went to one store, while the rest of the departments stayed where they were. I went to the drum/PA store. 
There was no ""internal"" phone line, so calls from the other store came through the usual line, or went to one of our mobile phones. As a result of this, we often answered calls after closing, because it could be the other store calling about stock orders or the daily takings or whatnot. But often it was customers calling after closing. One call went like this:

Me: ""LocalMusicStore, this is HeresJerzei.""

Caller: ""Hey man, I need to buy a snare drum.""

Me: ""Sorry man, it's nearly 1:30, and we're closed."" (We shut at 1)

Caller: ""But I've got a gig tonight, and I need a new snare drum! Can ya wait a few minutes? I'll be down there with cash.""

Me: ""Sorry, man. I'm on my way out the door, and I'm about to put the alarm on.""

Caller: ""Aww come on, dude! Can't ya stay open? I need a snare drum!! Where can I get a snare from?""

Me: ""Well, you could always try OtherMusicStore. They're not too far away, and they're open till 5.""
 
Caller: ""OK, what's their number?""

Me: ""I couldn't tell you, mate. I don't call them very often.""

Caller: ""Well, you're about as useful as a hatful of arseholes!""

Point 1) This is the back. Notice that there are no shelves. If we say it's not in the store, we are not hiding it in here.

Point 2) If there IS anything being stored in the back, we can't give it to you anyway because we would be breaking the street date for the product. Side note: No, we will not break a street date for you.

Point 3) If there is anything we don't have which you want, we would be happy to order it for you immediately to get it for you as quickly as possible!

Point 4) Pursuant to Point 3, if ordering within days of the following, we cannot guarantee the order's arrival beforehand: Christmas, New Years, Birthdays, Anniversaries, anything you probably should have taken care of before now.

Point 5) Really, it's not in the back. If you insist on an employee checking, they will go in the back and enjoy a tea or coffee and a quick break. They will then tell you that it's not in the back.

kamikazeboy514,11,4,1p0tw9,51,"I work in loss prevention and I regularly encounter idiots. Here is the story of the dumbest guy I have met so far this month.
First I spot this guy pushing a cart full of random crap towards the front of my store about to boogey on out of my entrance doors but he spots me before he actually gets out so he ditches the stuff and leaves.
A few hours later while I’m in my office writing the report for that incident and sending his picture out to my other stores THE GUY COMES BACK IN!!
This time though he is wearing a red jacket and red pants because you know if you change your clothes nobody will recognize you. So he walks into my store carrying a backpack and some delectable chicken goodness in a clear plastic bag. So he walks around my store as my boss and I are watching him, he smears his greasy hands which are covered in bbq sauce all up on some of our items. Like seriously, this shit was stained for good. 
He eventually makes his way into the boys clothing department where he starts loading up on some boy’s jeans because obviously, if men’s skinny jeans aren’t constricting your balls enough, you’ve got to squeeze into them boy’s pants.  So this guy grabs roughly $160 of jeans with his dirty chicken hands and walks into our shoes department.
He finishes his chicken and starts loading up our jeans into his CLEAR PLASTIC BAG. A clear fucking bag as if I won’t know that it’s my stuff in there.  Anyway after putting all the stuff in the bag this guy puts a smile on his face and begins to walk towards the back of my store. Eventually though he figures out he is being followed. This guy goes back to the boy’s jeans and places the jeans back one by one with his greasy ass fingers and then he starts walking towards the front of the store after trying to steal my merchandise.
I decide that I don’t want him ever coming back unless he’s bringing me some of that fucking chicken too.
I print off a picture of this guy walking around with my merchandise clearly in my bag and I take it out to him as he’s walking to the front of my store and the conversation goes as follows…
Me: “Hey man you put all my stuff back right?”
Grease Fingers: “Yeah”
Me: “Good, what were you trying to do earlier?”
Grease Fingers: “Nothing what are you talking about?”
I show him a picture of himself carrying around his CLEAR PLASTIC BAG FULL OF MY STUFF to which he has no reply.
So at this point the guy starts acting like a dick and he is told to leave. We tell him he is trespassed and that he can’t come back to this store or any of our stores FOREVER and to which he says “Nuh uh”…. Holy shit this guy must have been the smartest guy on his high school debate team. Never has anybody said that while being trespassed before, so I’m a little dumfounded. 
I tell him yes he is in fact trespassed and at this point he needs to GTFO.
He starts calling me cupcake and blowing kisses to me and such as he leaves. As he passes by my door he starts rubbing his own ass with his grease fingers and he says “Is this the merchandise you were looking for??”

I would like to say that it’s not often that thieves hit on me….but it’s a regular occurrence. Gross.

I go through the motions of gathering a price list for the guy, all the while the son is fighting back tears.

FC: see... Isn't the cost of having unprotected sex a lot. You don't even have a job. You'll need to work like her to support this baby (I wasn't offended). 

SC: I get it, can we go?

FC: not yet. Can you please take us over to pharmacy to help us pick out a pregnancy test?

I was stunned. Good on the father, but fuck. The most awkward customer story I've ever encountered. ","I'm not a tool in your parenting, man.",101
Kitty2228,25,41,1p0si2,278,"I have worked for a big retailer for many years and this happened a few back when I was working as the supervising cashier/key holder.  Every now and then a product would be recalled and pulled from the shelves to be sent back.  VERY occasionally one would be missed and a prompt was set up on the cash register so that when you scanned it it would freeze the register until a key holder took posession the item and cleared you to continue.  This happened when I was called in this type of situation.

Cashier: ""kitty2228 I need your help, this item came up as a safety issue.""

Me to customer: ""Oh no sir, I am so sorry we can't sell you this toy it came up as a safety recall.  Let me run and get you the replacement we just received.""

customer: ""no, I want that one.""

Me:""I can't sell you this one it has been recalled for safety issues.  If you hang on a minute I will just run over and grab the new version.""

When he came to the register there was no line up but as we were talking another man came in just behind him.

Customer: ""I don't want a different one.  I want that one for my kid. Give it to me and hurry up.""

me: ""But sir it isn't safe, we can't sell it.  I'll be right back in just a second.""

customer: ""listen lady. Just give me the Effing toy so I can give it to my kid.""

At this point the man behind him chimes in.
Nice Guy: ""Wow you are a terrible parent.  Who wants to give their kid an unsafe toy. What the he'll is wrong with you?""
At this point the customer decided to leave cursing us all out.
My friend on cash declared the nice guy her long lost cousin. I processed a family discount on his purchase thanked him and had a great rest of my closing shift.

menmenlymen,5,6,1p0o7m,57,"Throw away account. 

So I work at a specific retail store that sells office supplies. One evening, literally 4 minutes before we close, I had this very young lady, lets call her Y, come in and wanted to return a huge bag of merchandise. Here's how the conversation went...
 
Me: ""Hello! Welcome to [insert store]. How may I help you?""

Y: ""Yeah I work at a lawfirm and my boss sent me here to return these items since we have like 60 of each of them. He says he don't need these anymore.""

First off, she came in with a competitors bag filled with a bunch of ink and padfolios. And second she had a mouth full of cold sores and bruises down both her arms. And I don't believe those were ""I accidentally fell"" bruises. But giving her the benefit of the doubt, I continued. 

Me: ""Okay not a problem! Did you have a receipt for all of these?""

Y: ""No, he just told me to return them. I don't have one.""

Me: ""Oh, unfortunately we are not going to able to return these without a receipt. I can give you...""

Y: ""Did I do something wrong?""

Me: ""N.... No you didn't. But like I was saying, I can give you the receipt research number and your boss can retrieve his receipt and I can return them.""

Y: ""Why won't you return these?""

At this point she started to look franctic and confused. Almost as if she was about to cry.  

Me: ""Ma'am I cannot return these without proof you purchased them here. These items are common items, you could have gotten them at ""X"" store.""

Y: ""Wait, I can return these at ""X"" store?""

Me: ""If you purchased them there, then yes. But without a receipt I cannot return these items.""

Y: ""What did I do wrong?""

Me: ""You did nothing wrong."" I wrote down the number for our receipt research. ""Here is the number, your boss can give them a call to retrieve his receipt for these items.""

She just stood there, just staring at me. So I looked passed her and then back at her 

Y: ""Ummmm excuse me. My eyes are up here.""

Me: ""I'm sorry.... What?""

Y: ""I said my face is up here.""

Me: ""Oh, I was just looking outside.""

Y: ""No you weren't, but that's okay.""

She grabbed her stuff and tried to leave but she didn't know how to work the automatic doors so she ended up pushing the door, causing it to go off it's hindges. 

I'm sorry it may have sounded uninteresting. But it was the most confusing yet funniest customer I've have had all year.

TL;DR young lady, around 18yrs old and who I assumed stole it all, came in and tries to return merchandise. Turned her down and she accuses of me staring at other things.

Jinxy_Minx,24,8,1p0ltr,56,"Peeping tom symbol thrift store. I worked both register, and production.

Production is working the back. Taking in donations, unload the trucks, putting stuff out, etc.

Of course this requires heavy lifting at some points. I'm about 5'5, a healthy weight, etc. I'm also a woman(this is kinda important later on).

Anywho, this would happen at least a few times a week after I started working in the back. I'd be carrying a TV, helping move a couch, whatever, and a guy would come over and offer to help. I used to have some male customers watch in the background, sometimes just taking the items from me.

Had an older female regular customer(I didn't really like her but I was kind/civil), who would sometimes try to get guys to help me. I really remember one time where a guy took the TV from my hands while saying ""They shouldn't have a little thing like you doing work like this.""

PopTheButterfly,60,17,1p0ks3,135,"In this story I was not the employee (although I used to work in retail for six years), but rather the next customer who just has to rant about another customer. 

I had to stop by some pharmacy to pick up my mother's medication. I get there and line up behind a lady that was talking to the pharmacy tech (PT). Lady has like 10 bags of medicine she was getting. Total comes up to nine dollars and some change (must have been on some good insurance because it was the huge bottles of pills). Lady looks at total on the screen and starts ripping PT a new one about the price of the pills.

Lady: Nine DOLLARS?!?!

PT: Yes ma'am (side note: PT had surgery on her voice so she couldn't speak above a whisper)

Lady: SPEAK THE HELL UP WHEN YOU TALK TO ME!

PT: I'm sorry ma'am, I've had --

Lady: Why is this nine dollars!!!

PT: Well, the (some medication) was $1.50 and the --

Lady: I don't care how much each of them cost I want to know why it is nine dollars!!

PT: I don't know ma'am, maybe you can call your insurance --

Lady: You know what, give me just (2 of the same types of medication and 1 different one).

PT nods and puts up the rest of the bags. At this point, I was worried that Lady was a broke single mother (five of her crotchfruit were running around the store and destroying some of the displays). I was considering asking the lady if she wanted me to pay for the rest of her medications when I see her pull out a huge wad of cash (not 100s, but I did see 10s, 20s, 5s, and 1s), throw a $10 dollar bill onto the counter and berate PT further for the price of her medication. By the time Lady left, PT was shaking and I spent about 15 minutes there calming her down by trying to make her laugh at some of my horrible customer experiences.

I can get that Lady may have been trying to keep enough money for groceries or such, but was it necessary to berate some pharmacy tech who was just doing her job? 

Had to share because I left the store so mad at Lady for making PT upset that I probably would have yelled at her... and I usually do not yell at random strangers.",Nine DOLLARS!?!?!,152
Broniba,58,106,1p0b7t,452,"Backstory: So, at my little corner of coffee house bliss, we have an extra room attached to our main shop that used to be a liquor store - when it closed, we bought it and turned it into an event room that people could rent out for meetings, parties, what have you. It's not part of the general shop and we reinforce this by keeping the door closed - however, it isn't always locked because potential renters often want to see the space to see if it'll fit their needs, what they need to rent so far as furniture, yada yada. All this to say, room is there, not supposed to be used unless you have reserved and paid for this room. 

Well, last night as I was manning the bar, I notice two ladies open that door and walk into the room. Now, these ladies had been sitting (just the two of them) at our largest table for over an hour at this point sipping their free cups of ice water. They were both very obviously well to do - they gave off that ""vibe"" of 'I'm rich and you're not and we both know it'. Well, they'd been there until I'd gone to the table about ten minutes earlier placing down the ""reserved table"" sign and letting them know that, no rush, but in about thirty minutes a group was coming in that had previously reserved that big table. They didn't seem to have any problem with that at the time, so I went back to work. 

Didn't think about them again till my co worker says ""I wonder what they're doing."" I look up, and see the ladies disappearing into the room. Well, co worker is very new, so I told him that if he'd watch the bar for a minute, I'd go ask. I honestly figured maybe they'd seen the room and were wanting to rent it or something. So I walk back, and was thoroughly puzzled to see them sitting at one of the tables in there still sipping on their waters - in the dark, I might add. No event equals no lights on in the room and only the light from the shop coming through the door window. I open the door, and the following conversation occurred with Rich Lady (or, RL from now on):

Me: Hi there, ladies. Can I help you with anything?"" 

RL: We're just having a conversation. There were getting to be too many people in there. 

Me: Haha, I understand, it gets a bit crowded sometimes. I'm sorry to tell you, though, that this room isn't part of the general shop area. It's a special room we save for reservations. 

RL: But we're just having a conversation (kid you not, same phrase twice, as though I somehow missed it the first time)

Me: Ma'am, I'm sorry, but this room can only be used for folks who have reserved and paid for it. 

Cue facial expression that lets me, the minimum wage plebe, know exactly that she, Ms. Rich and Fancy Pants, does not appreciate my trying to tell her that she can't have her way. 

RL: ""Ugh, I know what this room is for, I've paid for it before.""

...Wait...so you know what the room is for, you've used it and noted that no one from the main shop wandered in and crashed your party, yet you can't seem to understand why I'm asking you to leave said room? Honey, Sugar pie...use the brains so well concealed by your bad dye job. 

I think my confusion must have shown a lot because she rolled her eyes and huffed again. I tried one more time. 

Me: I'm really very sorry, ladies, but I'm not allowed to let our regular customers use this room without reservation for any reason. 

One more big huff and they start to get up. And leave their cups on the table as they stiffly walk out and flounce out the door. 

I just...I don't get people! Seriously! You came into a very crowded, very public shop, but somehow deigned that your conversation was so deep and dark and mysterious that you literally needed to go through a closed door into a dark room and have your talk there...and then you're gonna act surprised when we notice.

I'm not surprised, as it's a shitty pan, and you'd be better off just throwing eggs at your stove and hope they make their own omelet. Anyway, here's the kicker: she's early 60's, and wearing an Avenge Sevenfold shirt. I knew she was going to be either awesome or stupid! So I escort her over to the frying pans, show her a much better one (it's more expensive but I did a customer accommodation and marked it at the same price as the piece of shit she returned), then as she were finishing up, I commented about her shirt. Apparently, she was out shopping that day, and I was the first one to say something about it. Her son took her to that concert. Even better, he took his teenage son to that show. Even better, they were all in the mosh pit! 3 generations in a mosh pit! Her kids (all 5 of then) decided that they would take their mom to concerts and let her have fun that her husband never did!

Procrasteraptor,32,32,1ozsvk,199,"First post, but I thought of you guys after this happened. 

I've been working the register at SOME STORE for one year now. Most people would describe me as patient and friendly, especially towards the customers. I have gone through all of the holidays and back to school craziness. But I have never had this type of customer until yesterday. We'll call her Godzilla, or G.

Started off with a good day, two hours into an 8 hour shift and I already had 3 credits. I was looking good and feeling good.

Godzilla came up to the register.


G: ""Hey I get 30% off of everything today, right?""

Me: ""Sure! All I need to do is see the coupon and I can give you the discount.""

G: ""Of course, I have it on my phone.""


Crap, one of these customers. See, this is during the scratch off at the store /peel off mailer deals where SOME STORE's advertises getting 15, 20, or 30% off. It's exclusively for SOME STORE's card members. There's no possible way for it to be on her phone, but I know from experience if I tell them it's not on their phone they will look anyway. 

I started to ring up most of her items when she showed me the advertisement.


Me: ""Oh, I'm sorry, this is actually just an advertisement. It says that you can either bring in your coupon that was mailed to you or I can scratch off a percentage for you.""


She looked at her phone as if it was turning into something else. She's a bit upset about it.


G: ""Oh well that's a little deceiving...""

Me: ""It is. But I guess for future reference if it's talking about getting 15, 20, or 30% off, it's about the peel off/ scratch offs. But I can go ahead and scr-""

G: ""Why are you still talking about this?""


You could say she's angry, but that's no reason to take it out on me. Honestly, I'm a little shocked and I stammered for a little bit. 


Me: ""Oh.. umm... I, I was just trying to let you know for next time, so we don't disappoint you.""


She's yelling now.


G: ""Why do you have to repeat everything twice??""


Yeah. Now there's trouble in River City. The people around me fell silent and I could feel them staring at us. I'm slowly turned red and my legs were literally shaking. 


Me: ""I'm sorry, I was just trying to help y-""

G: ""Why are you still talking???!""


I was flabbergasted. I never knew I could feel so angry, shocked, and scared at the same time. 

I figured the best thing to do would be to stop talking and just continue to scan her last few items. Better to bite your tongue, especially when everyone can tell that you're dealing with a monster. 

But frick, I was finished with everything and now I have to talk again. 


Me: ""So did you want to use your SOME STORE's card today?""


Godzilla had calmed down a little.


G: ""Well that depends on the scratcher.""


Makes sense. I grabbed the little stack of scratchers and there she went with her claws before I could hand her a penny.

Frick. 15% as usual. Now I had to ask if she's going to use it.


Me: ""So did you want to use your SOME STORE's card today?""


It's a pretty fucking reasonable question when you get the lowest percentage. But she couldn't handle it.

Oh you know she's roaring now.


G: ""WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME THAT?! I ALREADY TOLD YOU I WAS USING MY CARD!""


I couldn't take it. But I couldn't let her have it full force.


Me: ""I hate to disagree, but you said it would depend on the scratcher. See this is the 15% off one, so that's why I'm asking you."" 

G: ""I am so sick of you!""

Me: ""Would you like to speak with my manager?""

G: ""No! I just want to get out of here.""


Good enough for me. I told her the total. She slid her card and stomped out of there.

It seriously ruined my day. I felt like I was annoying all of the customers after that, so I didn't ask anyone if they wanted a SOME STORE's card. Manager still doesn't know, and I'm hoping no one talks about it too much.

internetmexican,3,20,1ozrgd,81,"Background: My family owns an automotive shop in Hayward, CA

While I was out: 
We get a customer, let's call him Ed, who tells us he recently hit a pothole which resulted in one of his really nice, and very expensive rims getting messed up. He informs us that we took his rim to some rim repair place where they told him it was really fucked up and probably would not be able to do much. He tells us that we told them to try, but that they said that they might not be able to get rid of all the damage, and even if they get it working that they might not be able to get rid of all the superficial damage. Ed is now asking us if we think they fucked the job up, our manager says he would not know, we did not see the rim in its previous condition, and we are not involved in rim repair. Ed tells my manager that he thinks they messed it up because the tire keeps going flat. Manager tells Ed we can look at it, and see if we find the problem... nothing is free of course so for our time we will charge $20. Ed says ok, and so we begin to look over his rim, in the very end it turns out that the rim was really dirty so our guy just cleaned it, mounted the tire again, gave the tire back to Ed, Ed paid and we asked him to go on his way.My tech noticed that the rim had a couple superficial dents here and there, some scratches, obviously from the damage he had told us about earlier, Manager made note of it too. 

While I was there (3 days later)

Ed comes back, says we messed rim up. Says he demands not only a refund, but $1000 to replace his rim. Manager (my uncle) says no. Manager reminds Ed that he told us that the damage was there from when he drove through a pothole, and that we would not be paying for damages we were not responsible for. Ed says that he had the rim fixed so there was no damage on it, Manager gets annoyed and reminds Ed that he HIMSELF told us that the repair people were not able to get of all the damage considering how badly he claimed to have banged his rim up. Ed says no, the damage came from our tech dropping his rim on the floor, and that he saw wheel weights on the floor, and those caused the damage.

Manager gets annoyed, tells Ed to hold on. I get called from the back, it's my uncle (the manager) He tells me the situation, and asks me to go deal with it. Ok. I go to the front to talk to Ed.

Me: Hello Sir, what seems to be the problem?

Ed: Are you the Manager?

Me: I am the owner (not true, but I like the POWER of saying it, plus why not, my Dad owns it and he has already told me to say that when dealing with difficult customers.)

Ed: Well I brought my rim here (blah blah the story I already told) and you guys messed it up.

Me: According to my employees you told them that you hit a pothole, messed up your rim, took it for repair, they did not get rid of all damage, but now you are saying we caused the damage that was already there. I mean, sorry but it just seems like you are trying to get some free money out of us.

Ed: No, no. See I took it to get repaired, and yes they could not get rid of some of the damage, but you guys made it worse.

Me: How so?

Ed: Your guy was too rough, he was throwing the rim around, there was those metal weights on the floor, and those damaged the rim even more.

Me: Do you remember who was working on your rim?

Ed: Yeah, it was the Mexican guy (gee.... 8 employees... all Mexican....) 

Me: Which one? the guy with the mustache, the short guy, or the tall dude with a flat top?

Ed: Tall guy.

I go and call Tall guy (TG), he comes over. I brief him on the situation. He shakes his head.

TG: That's stupid, there was no weights on the fucking floor. 

Me: I know, but he keeps saying there was.

We had just finished working on some 11r24.5 tires, and so yeah, right at that moment there was 1 big tire weight that had fallen off the 24.5 inch rim. Ed goes and picks it up.

Ed: It was one of these

Me: doubt it, those get picked up and placed by the tire balancer for the big trucks all the way over there. 

which is true, we never leave them on the floor because, yes, they could damage those expensive rims. 

Ed: Well, it was the small ones, but yes it was a weight that damaged it.

TG: doubt it, we never have weights in this area, the balancer is not even out here, and your tire was never on the floor to begin with. You weren't even back here. 

Ed: well I walked out for a sec, and saw you throwing it around. 

This argument goes on for a while, till TG says ""Fuck it, bring your rim, i'll put a weight on the floor, we will drop the rim on it like you are saying I supposedly did. If we get the same damage on the rim as we see on it now i'll buy you a new one"" Ed agrees. 

Me: Uh...I don't recommend you do that, I am telling you now that we here at **Family Business** will not take any responsibility for your guys' little ""agreement""

TG: Don't worry boss, this is all on me. 

Tg then lets the rim drop on the weight, picks up the rim. No damage. Ed grabs it, points to some scratches and yells ""SEE!, where's my money"" 

TG: Wtf, it didn't even fall on that area. Fuck this I got work to do. 

TG went back to work, so I tell Ed to let me talk to my Dad and i'll call him back later.

Later in the day Ed calls me, tells me if we are going to pay him back. I tell him.

Ed: Well after listening to the Manager, the techs, and your story, it is clear that the damage on your rim was due to the pothole you hit, you yourself told us that they were not able to get rid of it completely. Also your claim that we dropped the rim as we worked on it is completely unbelievable because we use a machine to take the tires off the rim, the tire comes off, but the rim stays on the machine. This machine is specially designed for dismounting tires, and has special rubber attachments to prevent damage to rims such as yours. Considering all of that, and statements from my manager and techs that you were never even in the back while TG worked on your rim I will have to dismiss any and all of your claims that the damage is our fault. I mean seriously YOU told US that they could not get rid of it all, but now you want to say we caused it? 

Ed: WELL AT LEAST MAKE TG PAY ME! YOU HAVE TO

Me: no, I don't. You entered that agreement with him on your own after I told you not to, and that we would not take responsibility for your decision. Also you two entered that agreement together...have a problem..talk to him.

Ed: Give me his number

Me: No **hangs up**

he never came back after that. ",Tales from Hayward,101

I don't usually become a smart ass with people when I tell them we are closed, just a nice ""Thanks for calling but I'm sorry we are closed"" but when people get stupid with me I will get stupid with them. So this is how this particular conversation went down.

wittyithinknot,13,34,1ozdc8,198,"My head manager has a bad habit of coming to the fast food joint I work at to yell at a lower manager about supplies, our drive-thru times, or co-workers who don't show up for work. It would be ok if he would come into the store, have a quick word or two with a shift manager, help out a bit (you would not *believe* how often he shows up during a rush and just stands there, taking up space in the kitchen), and leave. Instead, he most often comes through the drive-thru to talk to shift managers. This sparks confusion from customers sometimes, who have no idea why this dude pulled in front of them while their order was being taken and then didn't get any food.  
Yesterday was the last day for one of the shift managers. (On a side note, I am not unhappy to see him go-he would poke me in the side inappropriately and often pulled my visor over my face. The visor pulling got so bad that I traded it in for a ballcap that wouldn't budge if I had my ponytail in it.) Another shift manager told him to go home early, since another co-worker would be coming in early. The other co-worker was told by head manager not to come in because there were too many people working that day anyway.  
Co-worker doesn't show up for work, we're short-handed, shift manager calls head manager to call co-worker. The head guy decides to come to the store instead of talking to people on the phone like a normal person.  
Here's where I come in. I work at the register, taking orders and money at the drive-thru. We start to get so busy that a line forms. There is no place to cut in front of someone to get to the second window.  
Head manager decides that instead of coming in, he'll pull alongside customer cars to yell at the shift manager.  
A middle age woman comes up to my window and sees head manager hurling abuse. As I read out her total, I can't figure out why she looks so appalled. She hands me her money, and says, ""I cannot believe this!""  
""Um, pardon?"" I think she's talking about the price of her sandwiches.  
""The rudeness of some people!""  
At this point, I think she's talking about me. I try to be as polite as possible, but I can get spacy sometimes. I look up from the change I'm trying to total, and she looks fucking furious. She has tiny flames in her eyes. Her hand is on the door handle, and she looks like she's about to get out and verbally attack me on a face-to-face basis.  
""Ma'am?""  
""Just to clarify, did that customer pull up just to insult your co-workers?""  
""Uh, that's my boss. Unfortunately, he's allowed to do that.""  
""Oh,"" she puts her hand back on the steering wheel, her flamey eyes turn to hot coals. ""He shouldn't do that in front of customers. You shouldn't be rude to fast food people.""  
""Ma'am, were you going to confront him?""  
She looks a little ashamed. ""I was, but I guess your boss is allowed to be as unprofessional as he likes.""  
I was so happy that she was going to get into a verbal altercation over someone being rude to fast food workers that I gave her a free ice cream.

Curious I go to take a peek before hanging the closed sign on the door. Hah, I'm gagging picturing it again. 

Someone had actually just shit in the middle of the floor. Now this happened quite often, we're by the high school and high school boys think this is funny. After said person pooped on the floor they got down on their hands and knees and scrubbed it around. All over the floor and the walls, even stood on the toilet to reach the ceiling. They also took two smaller dumps, capturing the turds on a couple women's sanitary napkins and stuck them to the wall and ceiling. It was unbelievable. I may or may not have thrown up in the sink. 

I hung the sign and gladly called the cleaners and told them it was a hazmat suit job. Which they normally assume since they know we normally clean the bathrooms ourselves.

It was disgusting and I super showered before bed that morning. My boyfriend (who has been working there for three years) was so glad he missed it because our manager would have made him clean it instead of calling the cleaners.",Nose goes!,77
BadgerSixTwo,9,6,1ozcl6,53,"Background: I work in tourism at a place that offers different length excursions. I mainly sell tickets and answer phones at the ticket window which means I get to deal with everyone.

These excursions are staffed by two employees to deal with tourists and a volunteer (usually older) who knows how to work the equipment. The staff get steady shifts but the volunteers are retired from their other jobs and come in once or twice a week.

Story: For the month of June, there was one Volunteer (known here as CJ) where whenever something was wrong, he'd come tell me at the ticket counter. One day in late June on a weekend, we sell out the trip about 15 minutes before it goes out. It's all loaded and ready to go 10 minutes ahead of schedule and I tell him they're good to go since I've been told not to add space unless one of three managers okays it.

Me: You're all clear to go, have a good trip.

CJ: No, we'll wait longer in case anyone else shows up.

Me: Okay but we're all sold out.

CJ: No we're not, I see space right there (points to the open area we don't count into the capacity in case of bad weather).

Me: (thinking no one will show up anyway) Okay, if anyone shows up before departure I'll try to get them on. I have to talk to J (my manager who is at a meeting).

Ten minutes go by and no one shows up.

CJ: Are we good to go.

Me: You're all clear, have a good trip.

CJ: Oh wait, I see some people running up.

A sidenote: my system allows me to sell tickets on past trips if there was still space. It'll stop me if I try to sell on a sold out trip and if it's after departure time, I can't add space. I've also gotten in trouble for overselling trips before.

Enter a group of nine one minute after scheduled departure.

Dumb Leader (DL): Wait! We want to go!

CJ: Okay, you have to go inside and get tickets.

DL: We thought we wouldn't make it. I need nine tickets.

Me: I'm sorry, we're all sold out.

DL: Aw man. Are you sure?

Me: Yup. We sold out about 15 minutes ago.

DL: You don't have any extra room?

Me: No, it's sold to capacity.

DL: Okay. (walks out and tells his family standing by CJ. I gt called on the radio).

CJ: Yeah Badger, this group says you're all sold out but I see space right here.

Me: Yeah, we're sold out and I can't add space to a past trip.

CJ comes inside.

CJ: Why can't you add space to this run? I see space right there.

Me: Well you see, this system won't let me add space to this run as it is considered a past trip (about 7 minutes after scheduled departure at this point). I also can't go over capacity without permission from [three managers, two are in a meeting].

CJ: Is there anything you can do? They drove all the way from [halfway across United States] just for this.

Me: The best I can do is get them on a trip tomorrow unless you get a manager to approve it.

CJ: (radioing to Manager 3 (M3) Yeah, Badger says we can't let these people go because we have no space but I see space. They came all the way from [halfway across US] just for this. They say I need to get your permission to say they can ride? I don't really understand what Badger means.

M3: (Who doesn't work in my area and doesn't know the system either) Yeah, I see space so you can put them on. We gotta get going.

Me: (on radio) I can't sell them space since it's a past excursion and we're sold out.

M3: Do what you gotta do but we gotta get going.

CJ: Okay he needs nine ti...

Me: I can't sell them any tickets. Just put them on and go. We're 15 minutes late already.

CJ: Well, let's go then.

M3 is a good friend of mine so when I showed him the system and the situation he put in, his reply was ""Haha, whoops."" Since he manages the volunteers and the technical aspects of the company, he explained to CJ about what happened. HE did come by and apologize, saying he didn't understand it but now that he knew he would remember it for the future. Never had an issue with him since. I actually didn't before then, it just was coincidence I was working when he was there and things went wrong.

TL;DR a group of nine drives halfway across the States just for us, I can't get them tickets for a sold out trip, they complain, they go for free.",We're Sold Out,59
flarpy59,31,115,1oz9nd,509,"This previous summer I started a new job as an ice cream man. My job consisted of driving my converted school bus around town and peddling my wares to anyone who would buy. One of my favorite areas to drive through was this dingy little back road that housed some of the strangest people I ever interacted with. 

The first odd experience happened right around my second week on the job. By this time I had become pretty familiar with my route and was now focused on building relationships with my customers. I remember encountering this one kid who shall be referred to as ""Kingpin"" in this story. Now, Kingpin was this adorably small blonde haired boy who was probably around 8 years old. The couple of previous times he had bought from me I could barely hear him order, so I naturally assumed he was just a meek mannered boy. This day, however, turned out to be quite different. As I pulled up to Kingpin's house, I could see 3 older kids wrestling in the front yard. The all had Kingpin's blonde hair, but were much larger and seemingly more aggressive than him. So, Kingpin comes strolling out of the house, bypasses the violent tussle in the yard, and comes straight up to my truck. 

""Are those your brothers?"" I asked (attempting to foster some relationships and all that jazz). 

""Yep. Three ice cream sandwiches,"" he replied, without giving a glance to the MMA exhibition happening behind him.

I figured he was just being a nice brother and buying ice cream for his siblings, but I was surprised when he unwrapped one of the sandwiches and began eating it feverishly. Now, my boss trusted me to give out ice cream when it would help build a relationship with a customer, so I figured that Kingpin just didn't have enough money to buy one for all three. As he began to walk away I called out to him.

""Hey! Take an extra one so all your brothers can have one,"" I said, feeling confident that I was doing my good deed for the day.

Imagine my surprise when Kingpin unwrapped a second ice cream sandwich and began to demolish it despite the fact that he hadn't finished the previous one! 

""No, I got one for them,"" which was spoken with the biggest smirk on his face. Then, he leaned in close to me, and delivered the line that quickly cemented his place in my ""Hall of Favorite Customers. ""

""I'm gonna make em fight like dogs."" 

And then Kingpin walked away into legend.",The Ice Cream Truck Tales PT. 1,624
FredFltStn,250,468,1oz05u,1060,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven.

**STORY:**  We get lots of strange questions at my store. Since it is a temporary location in a tent, I can understand some confusion, but really people?!?

**Do you sell Christmas Trees?**  -  No, but since that’s common around the holidays, I’ll give you a pass. You would think that the absence of trees would have tipped you off.

**Do you sell Tools?**  -  No, but I’ve seen tents that do, so I understand your question. However, since you’re standing in the middle of my tent, surrounded by fireworks when you ask the question, I’m going to be snarky when I tell you no.

**Do you sell puppies?**  -  This one was bad. What was worse is that you INSISTED that you had purchased a puppy from us before. Not from another company in a tent, but specifically from my company, at this location. You even claimed that my casher was the exact woman who had sold it to you. As the final act of insanity, you screamed at my cashier and called her a liar when the cashier denied it.

**Do you sell gasoline?**  -  I don’t even know how to answer this question. Have you purchased gasoline from a tent before??? This one was so bad; I didn’t even bother to answer you. I just stared at you until you got flustered and walked out.

**Do you sell drugs?**  -  I was so dumbstruck, I actually had to ask you to repeat your question. You would think that the off duty police officer, sitting behind the counter 10 feet away, dressed in full uniform, would have made you pause. But you actually repeated the question, and then seemed confused when the officer asked you if you were stupid.

**Do you sell toilet paper?**  -  No, no, and hell no. I don’t even want to know why you asked the question.

**Do you sell Fireworks?**  -  Really? You’re standing in my tent, surrounded by fireworks, with firework videos playing on a twelve foot screen suspended from the ceiling, underneath the enormous banner that reads “FIREWORKS – BUY 1 GET 1 FREE”!!! No. I sell pets. Would you like to buy a puppy?

Anyway Older Lady Bitch (OLB) comes into the store and want to buy two notebooks. So sale goes through, I've got my cheerful happy face on and tell her to have a good day etc. etc. then shit goes down

**OLB:** This is wrong.

**Me:** Sorry?

**OLB:** You've charged me the wrong price, this is $2.50 (tapping book angrily)

**Me:** Sorry, what did it scan up as? 

I hold my hand out for the receipt to double check what was on there but she refuses to hand it to me. Instead she taps the book again and speaks like I'm slow.

**OLB:** This is meant to be $2.50. It scanned up wrong so I get it for free.

**ME:** Sorry ma'am we don't do that here.

**OLB:** No. It's policy, I get it for free.

**ME:** I'm really sorry, but we don't do that here. The most I can do is refund the difference if you still want the book.

**OLB:** I would expect that anyway.

**ME:**Let me just get stationary to double check.

I call stats and they check the price on the shelf, which is $3.50, the price it scanned up as. When I tell the customer that she huff and puffs and goes to check it herself. I make a kill me gesture to my co-workers. 

OLB comes back with three other notebooks and drops them on the counter.

**OLB:**See, all $2.50!

**Me:**Okay, would you mind showing me where you got them?

OLB leads me to the area and upon seeing the places where the books are, slaps the top one stating ""$2.50, $2.50, see?""

I kneel down to double check the barcodes and lo and behold, someone has put the wrong notebook in another slot, hence the difference in price. 

I pull out the right notebook and show her the difference (one had two pockets, the other had none) and explain why there was a difference. Noticing that the book I have in my hand is damaged I go to grab another when QLB interrupts me.

**QLB:** I don't want that one, that one's broken. See, up there (pointing out the obvious bend in the wire as if i was a child). I bet you were going to give me that one!

**ME:** I just need to grab the one behind it. Let me go put through your refund.

I hand her the book and walked quickly back up to the register, noticing my coworkers trying not to laugh at this pompous dickbag of a customer.

So I quickly refund the money, giving her the huuuuge refund of one whole dollar and wish her a good day against (god knows how I kept smiling). 

Then (if you remember she brought extra books up to 'show' me that they were all $2.50) she reaches over, taps the books she's not taking and gives me this soul killing smile of petty self-rightousness.

**QLB:** I'll leave you to put these back. 

She didn't even apologize for being rude, and made it seem like it was our fault that the book was in the wrong spot. The book wasn't even the wrong price! She just picked up the wrong one. ARGH!

internetmexican,14,9,1oyor3,54,"I feel like the last post was LONG as hell, so I decided to give this story it's own post. 

One Saturday morning these two Indian guys came in, one old, one new (young). Old was old as fuck, had that wise sage look to him what with the long beard and all, the young guy looked to be about my age (23 at the time...last year) We shall refer to them as Old and New

So they come in Hino truck, you know, those small ones with the 17.5 inch tires that are a BITCH to change (since we keep it old school with the bars). They get off the truck, and right away it is clear that they are fresh immigrants due to the terrible English, and the THICK accent, but it's cool we WILL make this conversation work. 

Old: New Tire

Me: You want new tires? Ok let me check the size. Yup we have those in stock, how many?

New: We want 2 new tire for front (his accent is a little better than Old's, and his English is not as bad, but still pretty bad)

Me: Well Ok, we have several brands, it depends on how much you are willing to pay.

New: Brand?

Me: Yeah...like Michelin, Firestone, Goodyear

New: OH! uhm... We want cheapest

So I go out and show him the cheapest one, I forget how much it was, but he was not happy. He relays the information to Old, Old is not happy either.

Old: No Amigo, too much

New: Yeah, too much, you give to us for $x.xx

Me: No, I give to you for the price I told you, or I don't give it to you at all. 

Old: Says something to New, which I assumed to be ""What did he say?"" 

New: No, c'mon my friend, too much, you give discount please.

Me: Is this your first time here? (he looks confused)...You come here before?

New: No, first time

Me: So...why would you expect me to give you a discount? look man, this is the cheapest we can go. These tires are good, if you have ANY problem with them just bring them back, and we will replace the tire. However, I can NOT go lower than this price.

They talk it over in their language, and finally agree to pay the price. I ask them to go the office to wait while we work on their truck. They sit there, uncle offers them some coffee maybe a pan dulce if they want it, chats em up, the usual thing we do to keep guests entertained. One of the guys, and I work on the truck. Once we have the tires mounted, and balance we dunk them in water to make sure there is no leak anywhere, all is clear, and so we put the tires back on the truck. I inform Old and New that they are all set. They get into their Hino and drive off happy as can be.

About an hour and a half later see the same Hino coming back, think to myself ""There is no way in hell there is anything wrong with those tires, THEY WERE BRAND NEW!"", but whatever I have to deal with this. 

Me: Welcome back gentlemen, is everything alright?

Old: (in a pissed tone) TIRE NO GOOD! YOU CHANGE!

Me: What happened?

New: We go to work, we park truck. When we go back to truck, all air is gone. You say tire good, but no good. 

Go over to the truck, left side is perfectly fine, but right side is flat. no problem. Tell my guy to go get another tire, while I work on taking this one off. This is when I noticed it. The tire was all scuffed up, like when you get too close to a sidewalk curb while parking, The rims are scratched up, and still have some dust on the from the concrete curb they hit. I get up and walk to the tires in the back, same pattern: Tires scuffed up, rims scratched and scraped, but all is good. Think ""well their warranty covers the tire so whatever"" I go back to the front tire, I notice the reason that their tire is flat is because when they hit the curb they destroyed their valve stem. This shit is not our problem now. 

Me: Ok guys, the reason your tire is flat is because you guys hit the a curb or something, the tire is good-

Old: NO GOOD!

Me: It is good, but you guys FUCKED up your valve stem.

New: No, tire no good, you change.

Me: no, tire is PERFECT, your valve stem on the other hand is DESTROYED.

They look at each other, and talk in their language. They look at me and finally New says ""Show me, what you say"" So I take him to the side of the truck, and show him the valve stem.

Me: That is your problem, you guys hit a curb, and destroyed your valve stem.

Old: NO!, WE NO HIT, IF HIT NO MIRROR!

wait, what? I ask New what the old guy means

New: We got mirror at junk yard so no is too sturdy. If we hit wall the mirrors are fall down, but they are not. We no hit wall (then he pissed me off when he said this) YOU break valve.

Me: If I had broken the damn thing off like this, you would not have been able to leave because it would not have held any air (I keep calm, but I am annoyed that he would blame me for this).

New: We come here, valve ok, now valve broken, we no break. It no break when we come... so how it broke? you break.

Me: No I didn't...listen If I broke it, how would you have left with a fully inflated tire? You guys hit a sidewalk or something because I mean look at the scuff marks on your tires, and see the rims are all banged up now too?

Old: NO HIT!!, MIRRORS NO BROKE!

Me: Ok, but how would the mirrors have hit the damn sidewalk when they are all the goddam way up here? Look if you want the valve replaced then it's going to be $15 bucks ok?

Old: NO! YOU CHANGE TIRE NO GOOD?!

New: YOU BROKE! WE NO PAY!

At this point, my Dad came to the back and asked what was going on, I explain it to him while telling him to deal with them because I am losing my patience. My Dad talks to them, he tells them the exact same thing I did, they get pissed, and keep saying we broke it. Finally after about 30 mins of this my Dad comes to us and says 

Dad: Just change their damn valve and get them the hell out of here. (he was obviously frustrated but was trying to keep his cool)

We change their valve, for free all the while Old kept saying ""WE NEVER COME BACK!""
Once we finished we sent them on their way, New says ""We never come back here again"" before he leaves. We just ignore them, and go back to doing other work.


Fast forward about 5 months. New and Old are back again. See them looking at some used tires. I go over. 

Me: Hello gentlemen how can I help you?

New: We want used tire for back.

I help them choose some pretty great used tires, we start talking price. Once again they are NOT happy with the quote and start asking for a discount. I say no, then New says

New: No discount? I come here before

Me: Oh...is that right?

New: Yes, I come here before I buy tires here.

Me: OH YEAH!!! NO I REMEMBER! You were the guy who hit some concrete with his tire, broke the valve stem, blamed it on us, refused to pay and then cried about how you were ""NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN""....of course, I never forget people like you.

New: (he is standing there, looking at me with this smile on his face like he is thinking to himself ""oh shit"") Yes

after that though he bought the tires, but he didn't ask for a discount again. Funny thing is they became regulars they are there every couple months.  ",Tales From Hayward 3,63
sulkypotato,122,219,1oyogs,881,"It should really be /r/talesfromhospitality, but I thought I'd share anyways. :)

**Background:** About 4 years ago, I was working in a restaurant in a large mall. I had several duties (Hostess, waitress, clearing tables, bartender) for 13 hours a day, every day. Just finished high-school, and decided to spend some time before uni to get some extra cash. 

**What happened:** I've been on shift for about 9 hours and the dinner rush was just starting, with all my combined duties, I was exhausted and customers were being..customers. (Snapping their fingers at me to call me over, changing orders last minute, not giving me two shits, letting their kids run around like the tiny fucktrophies they are etc.) Whatever, perks of the job. 

In comes in a middle-aged caucasian man who seemed quiet and pleasant enough. I sit him down, and he's never been in our restaurant before, so I recommend dishes, take his order and make small talk. Throughout his entire dinner, he gave me absolutely no trouble and every time I had a moment to spare, I made sure that he had everything he needed, and we actually started talking about his work, why he was in Malaysia, turns out he was from France. So we practiced our french together, and we both had a grand ole time. 

The bill came, and unfortunately, I was busy with another table so I couldn't say goodbye to him personally, but I did give him a wave and a smile as he went out. He left a $5 tip on his $40ish meal. This is extremely rare as they don't practice tipping here, and it'll mostly be loose change. Heck, we'd be lucky to even get a dollar on a good day. 

Needless to say, I hoped he would come back again one day. And he did. An hour later. I was hostessing at that point and he came up to the little podium (the one with the menus &amp; reservation book) with a bag in hand. It was from Godiva: uber fancy chocolates, and I joked that whoever got that was a super lucky lady. 
No joke, he gave me the bag. He just handed it to me and said ""This is for you, it's for the amazing service that you gave me and for the nice chats that we had over dinner. It was the most pleasant dinner experience I've had since coming to this country."" 

It was like someone had pantsed me. My mouth fell open and I turned redder than a ginger in summer. I could barely stammer out a ""thank you"", but he understood and went on his merry way. 
Now, by this point, everyone (my ""colleagues"" and some diners) was staring at what just happened, and demanded what happened. I ""spark-noted"" the whole story and just..couldn't stop grinning. 

My entire day was made. And the chocolates were DELICIOUS.

I work in a government liquor store. Some days, and people, are great. I've met some really interesting people on the job, and I know several of the customers enjoy me sassing them. However, there will always be those moments and individuals who dampen your spirits. This past Saturday was one of those days.

I must note, the store I work in is situated beneath a couple of apartments. In one of the apartments lives a rather trashy looking couple. They look like a pair of meth heads...

My manager was on her lunch break and had stepped outside to have a smoke out back at the loading area. That is also where the entrance is leading to the apartments upstairs. She was the one who witnessed the whole thing.

The door opened up. It's the guy.
He tossed out two kittens. One orange, one grey. He yelled at them. ""I never want to see your fucking faces ever again!"" The orange one turned to run back in, and he shoved it away, then tried to kick it (missed, thank goodness). The grey one ran off to where the front of the store is, but someone was able to grab the orange one and take it home.

About ten minutes later a friend of mine came into the store. I told him what had happened and he said he would go look for the grey kitty. He came back empty handed, so when my break came I went to a couple of the stores in the area and mentioned the grey kitten and his tale of woe. Everyone said they would keep an eye out for him, and I had even taken to asking some of the customers if they had seen a little grey cat. No sighting. I convinced myself the little one had hid under the porch of the house next door to my work.

After work I visited my parents and told them the 'heart breaking tale', as I was calling it. My dad said they would be happy to take the little meth kitty in and give him a home (I already have a cat) if I happen to come across him.

Today I had decided that I would check around on my lunch break, as well as pester more people about said cat while at work. However! In a surprising turn of events, it did not have to come to that. As I was heading towards the entrance after parking my car, I saw a small grey kitten perched on a fence post of the next door house. He was right beside the building, sort of blending in with the grey of the walls, and a bit of a plant was sort of blocking him. If I had not turned to look at the porch I would not have noticed him at all.

He was a cold, hungry grey ball atop that fence post. I snatched him up, and went inside. I did feel a little shifty taking a cat off the street. Also, I may have had the teeniest adrenaline rush over rescuing him too, I will admit. My coworker and me took turns loving him, and since I had meat in my lunch today I shared some of it with him. Poor thing was hungry. Too young to hunt.

I called my mom to come and get him. I tried to confine him to the lunch room in the meanwhile (it doesn't have a door), but he ended up following us around instead. Tripping hazard! oops. He seemed to have fun exploring the pallets in the warehouse at least. My coworker decided if people commented about hearing a cat we would simply say ""Cat? I don't hear a cat."" Thankfully Mondays are typically slow in the mornings. She also decided the next time that guy comes in he will be given a stern talking to.

He's a very affectionate little critter. Just wants to nuzzle and snug and purr and be loved and give love. How someone could just toss him out like that is beyond me. My mom figures him to be no more than two months old. I am so glad we have been having a very mild October. Such a small, skinny thing probably wouldn't have lasted very long otherwise. Also glad none of the dogs that wander around that part (sort of like community dogs) got him. He has ear mites, but they're not overly bad. Least we were able to book him an appointment to see the vet on Saturday.

I think we will name him Atlas.

Edit: Alright, so I lied a little about when I would upload pictures of him. I wound up having a busy afternoon, then imgur wasn't feeling particularly cooperative.

Story 1: The Snap 1

When I first started working at the shop I had this ""the customer is always right"" and ""ALWAYS! be polite and happy"" attitude. One day I got this arab guy, a trucker, come in to the shop we will call him DB (Douche bag). This guy wanted some new tires for his truck which he had parked at the diesel pumps next door. 

Me: Cool, just bring the truck here and we will get started on it

DB: No, you bring truck to gas station, work there.

Me: We can't do that sir, just bring your truck here.

we are literally next door to the pumps, like, we share a DRIVEWAY. Like he can pump gas, drive forward, make a left and he is in our lot.

DB: YOU BRING TRUCK TO PUMP! 

Me: Look, if you make us drive the truck I will charge you a road service fee.... (because don't be a bitch and just bring your truck into the damn lot so we can work on it!) 

DB: It will not fit through gate

Me: Dude...truckers are like our BIGGEST customers, believe me your not the first guy to bring a truck through the gate...

he keeps on going that no it wont fit, then he says he cant maneuver it because there is not enough room on the lot. Our mechanic at the time (before he quit) was a former trucker (Mech)

Mech: give me your keys

DB gave him the keys, mech went to the guys truck and drove it into the lot, parked it, and gave DB his keys back. So we start working on DB's truck. While we are changing the tires DB opens the hood to his truck and starts to fiddle with the engine. Once we finish the work, DB continues to fiddle under the hood. Bu this time we have 3 more customers waiting to get tires, and one more trucker, we need the space DB is taking up. DB has already paid, and so we just want him to move on so we can start helping other guests.

Me: Sir, we need you to move your truck please.

he ignores me

Me: Sir, we have other guests waiting we need you to move your truck

DB: I MOVE WHEN I'M READY!

Me: ok.....

after like 5 more mins DB left.




Story 2: The Snap 2

DB came back, wants new tires, an oil-change, and some of the other tires retreaded. No problem. The things is, my Dad wants us to get certain information from customers: Name/Driver name, Company name (when it applies), Year/Make/Model, License Plate (not sure why, but comes in handy when people try to bounce before paying), and finally Miles on the odometer. The reason we take miles down is for warranty reasons as well as we want to check your miles every time you come in so we can be like ""oh look its been so and so many miles want to get an oil change and/or other services so that you can give us more money?"" So because DB has requested New tires, and an oil-change I have to go and ask for the miles. At this point I am still in my ""be super polite"" attitude

DB: (lists all the stuff I said earlier)

Me: Cool, let me get my guys on it. 

As my guys start their work I go around the truck taking down the information. Company name: Check, Name: Check, Make and model: Check, Hmm no unit number, don't know the year, and still need the miles. Ok ill go ask the driver for this information

Me: Sir, does this truck have a unit number? 

DB: no

Me: ok...uhm what year is the truck

DB:(mumbles) 87

Me: Thank you, oh and if could just get the miles on your odometer please.

DB: (mumbles)

Me: Sorry sir, I did not catch that. How many?

DB: (mumbles + shop sounds = can't hear this guy)

Me: Sorry, can you repeat that one more time please

DB: WHY YOU BOTHERING ME WITH THIS SHIT!? JUST GO WRITE THE DAMN INVOICE AND WAIT FOR ME IN OFFICE, DON'T BE BOTHERING ME!!

I am kind of just standing there like, uhhhh.... My uncle looks at me all like ""fuuuuuuuck"" and says ""it's ok, i'll get that info later.""

Me: Ok, i'll just be waiting in the office when you are ready to pay. 

I start to walk away, but all of a sudden I get super pissed, like all my rage decided it wanted out NOW.

Me: No, you know what, it's no ok. I am doing my fucking job...why am I bothering you with this? BECAUSE IT'S MY FUCKING JOB! My boss sets the rules, my says I need to get this fucking information, so I am getting it, I don't need some fucking asshole yelling at me for doing my fucking job. 


DB: YOU JU- 

Me: NO! SHUT THE FUCK UP! we are here to serve you, but we aren't your fucking slaves, so don't be yelling at me and acting like a bitch when i'm doing my fucking job. If you don't to give me the information, that's fine say so, but don't act like a douchebag


DB: I WANT- 

I turn my back to him and walk towards the office to write the invoice, so as I walk away I say

Me: Yeah, yeah, tell it to someone who gives a shit you fucking prick! Come pay your fucking bill when you're ready. 

After a while DB comes into the office, completely quiet.... not looking me in the eye. 

Me: Cash or Credit?

DB: Credit

I process that shit, he says something along the lines of how it is sunny out, I ignore that mother fucker, give him his receipt explain his the warranty on the new tires he bought, and then start helping another customer.

sabersar,46,5,1oyhv8,20,"Share anything that gets on your nerves or rubs you the wrong way.

I'll share a few of mine. 

I work at a popular office supply store. Customers love to pull the price tag from its location and bring it with them to the front so they make sure they get the price listed.

Customers often obliterate the binder wall leaving it nearly impossible to recover at the end of the night without dedicating 100% of your time to it.

When I'm facing(recover, block, etc.) the store and a customer walks up and messes up a whole 4 foot section that they JUST saw me straighten, just because they had to take a closer look at EVERYTHING.

When customers leave trash around the store. (Cups, paper wrappers, gum wrappers, etc.)

Customers who make you their personal shopper.

Customers who have no ability to read signs and use common sense.
","Working in retail, what are things customers/co-workers do that really get on your nerves?",25
dredsina,10,9,1oyd33,66,"I work at the customer service desk for a large home retail chain. I live in an area of the country where people can be a little aggressive about being environmentally friendly. A few neighboring cities have outlawed plastic bags (though they are still legal in my city), and a large portion of my customers refuse bags. 

On the weekdays, I am usually the only cashier (other than backup). One fateful day a few months ago, I was helping a woman with a very large transaction. She didn't seem in the best of moods, but it didn't seem like a big issue. I was friendly and working quickly. I was confident my work would be satisfactory.

Because she had a lot of items, we rolled an extra empty cart behind me to put things in once I'd scanned them. About halfway through her order, I wasn't sure whether she would want the smaller items I was scanning in a bag, or if she wanted me to just put them in the cart with some of her other items, as this was what she had asked me to do. Normally, with so many items, I would automatically put them into bags, but some people really just don't want bags, and she had, after all, asked me to put items into the cart behind me. I wasn't sure.

The next thing I did, apparently, was an **unforgivable mistake**.

I asked her if she wanted a bag.

She looked me dead in the eye and asked, ""Do you think I'm stupid?""

I sputtered, not knowing how to answer her accusation.

She launched into a full-blown rant as I started to scan and bag as fast as physically possible. ""*Do you think I'm stupid?* Do you think I don't know how to recycle?? Do you think I'm not going to reuse these bags once I get home? Of course I want bags! Look at all this! I can't possibly carry all this! Why would you ask that? What a stupid policy! Why do you think I shop here and not in [neighboring city that has outlawed plastic bags]? I live there! Do you think I voted for that aggressively green mayor and those stupid bag laws? Of course not, and nobody I know voted for him either! Where is your manager? I want to talk to a manager! This is my protest right now! I'm taking a stand! NO, I don't want to talk to just any manager, I want to talk to THE STORE MANAGER, I won't leave until I've talked to them!""

Now, the store manager was not there at the time, but my supervisor and the manager on duty were only a few feet away from me. They had not heard this rant, though, because we had become very busy and they were both helping customers. I was trying not to look panicked, though I eventually got the attention of the MOD, who swiftly took over the situation. Crazy bag lady started ranting again. ""It's ridiculous that you have this policy of asking if we want bags!""

MOD: ""Well it's not really our store policy.""

CBL: ""Then why did your cashier ask if I wanted a bag?"" [Thanks for that, MOD] 

MOD: ""Our cashiers just like to ask that because some people don't want bags.""

CBL: ""Well does she think I'm stupid?? Anyone with this much stuff would want a bag! I'm green! I've been green for longer than you've been alive! I recycle!"" [Note, CBL is probably in her 40s and MOD is in his 30s, though looks to be in his 20s.]

MOD: ""I'm very sorry this happened, and I agree, it is very ridiculous. I live in [a different city that has outlawed bags], and it's very annoying.""

MOD kind of just apologizes over and over again and distracts her rage from me as she ""makes her stand"" and ""stages her protest"", and I finish scanning and bagging. Her rage subsides a little, and we manage to get her to leave.

To this day, one of my coworkers will tease me and ask aggressively if he can have a bag.

Fast forward to a few weeks later, I'm the only cashier and I'm close to finishing my transaction when I see CBL come through the door with something to return. (Amazingly, ""Trouble"" by Taylor Swift was playing in the background when she walked in.) When we have any sort of line, we are encouraged to call for backup cashiers, though if we think we'll be done pretty soon, we usually just rush the end of the transaction and avoid calling for backup.

Luckily for me, a coworker is walking by, and I call to him, ""Can you backup?"" as I slow down considerably, trying to avoid a confrontation with this woman. Coworker doesn't know what he's in for. Poor guy. He says, ""Sure!"" and takes her to the first register. After about 10 minutes of cashiering, I look over, and her return is still on the counter, and neither she nor my coworker are doing anything. The MOD (different one than last) is talking to her, says, ""When we don't have a receipt or the card it was originally paid with, we have to give store credit. There's nothing else I can do.""

She yells, ""I don't want store credit! I don't want to ever shop here again! Everything you sell here is crap! Why would I ever want to come in here again!""

MOD says he will look through all the purchases for that item in the last several months to see if he can find her transaction [otherwise he will get in trouble with regional management for returning an expensive item onto a card without the receipt]. It takes about twenty minutes, and my coworker is trapped at his register, all while this woman is still ranting at him about how crappy the item was, how it broke suddenly on her, and how we're a terrible store.

MOD is able to find her transaction and returns the item onto her new card, CBL leaves, supposedly to never return.

I apologize profusely to coworker after she has left, he says it's alright, but mentions the shoe rack she was returning had broken along the screws in the wood, which meant *it was her fault it had broken because she had over-tightened the screws*. He said, ""I agree most of the stuff we sell is crap, but it was really her fault that this broke.""

She did, however, break her promise that she would never shop at my store again. I wasn't the one to ring her out, but I saw her again, though she seemed to leave without incident. I have never seen her after that, though. 

*Good riddance.*

Foxbatt,8,19,1oybao,93,"I work as a car dealership photographer so I'm not sure if this qualifies for TFR or TFW but seeing that I deal with customers sometimes I'll drop this firebomb here.

I was taking photos of cars, just like I do every weekday when I start taking photos of a Prius. The distance from the front line to the shooting area was about 70 yards in this car, with no speed bumps or inclines - this will be important later on.

There was a slight smell of gasoline but I ignored it - some cars just smell a little more of gas than others, especially fresh arrivals. As always I park, get out and start taking photos of the exterior. Most of the interior went smoothly - till I got to the trunk.

In some horror movies they show the door slowly opening, revealing a terrible scene, giving your mind time to process all the awful details. Well that wasn't my mind - I was just disappointed that someone had left random shit in the trunk. A [jump starter](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51opJI4Pt3L._SL500_AA300_.jpg), a big box of keys, a fuel funnel and last but not least a [gas can](http://images.lowes.com/product/converted/044549/044549800059lg.jpg) with the pump bit and cap beside it.

Then the smell hit me - the trunk cover had done well enough, stopping most of the evaporating gasoline stench from getting into the rest of the car. This was a pretty explosive mix so I recapped the gas can, took it and the keys into the managers office, pissed as hell.

As I went to pick up the jump starter I noticed the worst bit that made this into an almost fatal combo - the idiot that left these things and forgot about them hadn't even put the jump leads back onto their holders, and they lay there one almost touching the other. Yep one bump, hard acceleration or braking and BOOM. Some random website tells me 1 gallon of gasoline is equal to 14 sticks of dynamite so yep I could have gone home from work today in a very small urn or just via wind currents.

Heather_Avery,7,22,1oxiqx,132,"Recovering from sickliness (my lungs/breathing organs hate me, no big deal), so I thought I'd share another story.


Once again, I was working at a woman's clothing store when this occurred.

It was a busy evening, and I was working the register when this ""Busy Woman"" (BW) came to my line.


Now we all know and lovingly despise this type of customer. ""Busy Woman"" or ""Busy Man"" is the customer who is always one the phone, always in a rush, usually meticulously styled and primed to their liking, and almost always in a bad mood.


BW was no different. She walked up to me on her phone, and without saying a word, she tossed three items of jewelry on the counter and began to tap her manicured fake nails on the  counter. 



Unfazed, I scanned her items and relayed her total, which was less than $15.00.

BW made no eye contact and paused her fingernail orchestra  to quickly toss me the hundred dollar bill that was in her hands. 



Being the dutiful little wage slave that I am, I discretely checked and counted out the change to give back to BW. I had just landed back into the retail jail after a year of freedom, so I was a little rusty on cash handling, so I took a little extra care to ensure the correct change. 


As I reached over to hand her the change, BW finally made eye contact, whipped her immobile and multicolored bangs and snapped, "" GURL, you SLOW"", and went back to her phone conversation about how slow this cashier girl was being in front of her.


Now I could have gotten angry, I could have gone and cried, but without missing a beat, I chirped back , "" OH, Thank you SO much"", (with not a hint of sarcasm) and gave her a crazy smile (think OAG without showing any teeth). 


BW saw my face, got wide-eyed and sputtered, ""But I...but...wha.. (to her phone)I gotta go, gurl"", and took her stuff and booked it out of the store. 



Got a good laugh with my manager after that &gt;:)

""Yeah, that's what I said! X half sandwich, Y half salad, and Z cup of soup. Weren't you listening the first time??""

""...OHHHHHHH so that's why it's called a Pick Two??? Oh my god hahahaha etc.""

My store is also really close to a college campus, so we get a lot of sports teams coming in after tournaments and such. Usually we make enough that we're fine, but on this particular day we had a 3 hour non stop rush. We ran out of baguettes and sourdough rolls, which are usually our bread choice of side. So instead, we improvised and started giving out slices of some of our specialty breads if the customer asked for bread on the side. Keep in mind, we did notify them that we were out of the traditional bread side and made sure they were okay with the change.

One lady in particular comes up to the counter. 

""What is this on my plate."" She states, staring at me.

""Sorry, that's your pick two with X salad and Y soup,"" I say, while I'm rushing around to fill other orders.

""I mean this,"" she pokes at her bread slices.

""That's sourdough bread, that's the side you asked for.""

""No it's not. Where's my baguette?""

""Well, like your cashier told you, we're out of baguettes today.""

""What about sourdough rolls?""

""No, ma'am, we've had quite the rush today and we're out of those options.""

""Can you substitute a bagel then?"" by now she's giving me a death glare. I'm trying to ignore it and continue being chipper.

""You know what? That's a great question. Let me go ask my manager.""

""WELL FUCKING FIND OUT YOU LITTLE BITCH."" She grabs her plate and storms off. She ended up getting about 3 bagels from my manager just because we were sick of her reaming us out. Do people really get THAT upset over a small chunk of bread? Chill out.

toxlab,10,4,1ox5kp,45,"I worked at a certain big blue video store just after high school and the level of suck was very, very high.

VHS was so big that many a technophobe, luddite, and wrinkled granny owned one. And they had no idea how to use it.

The clock on the unit would flash ""12:00"" so they would fix it by putting tape over it.

They would try to insert tapes backwards and when the unit wouldn't accept them, they would use an object to try and jam them in.

The kids would feed the unit Cheerios and get sticky garbage all over the heads. The junk would transfer onto the tape, and anyone who tried to play it would contaminate their unit. Then they would try to sort it out by checking if another tape would work, and that tape would become plagued as well, and the disease would spread. Suddenly, a big part of your inventory was garbage.

Head cleaner? What the hell is a head cleaner? I'm not paying you three dollars to get a maintenance device for my pricey electronics! I'm going to burn my unit up until it stops working and then it will be all your fault!

That little ""tracking"" knob would be unnoticed on units that people had for years. Trying to explain that they needed to turn the dial a little for optimum quality resulted in headdesk phone calls I'm sure tech support people are familiar with. Then the autotrack models came out and muddied the waters further.

Oh, and mustn't forget that the bits of the tape that got regularly fast forwarded or replayed would wear out first, so people would freak out when the trailers at the beginning were warped, or that moment in the film when the hot teacher's assistant finally peeled off would be destroyed.

The complaints about content were annoying, but I imagine people still get huffy about things they dislike about a film and demand something be done about the horrible offense they suffered. As if we were shooting the pictures in the back room.

So many shitty VHS memories.

EDIT: Oh, I forgot about the magic of sell through.

When big summer pictures and kid's movies came out, the studios knew they could sell millions of units to Middle America and priced them at an affordable 19.99.

But most movies weren't sell through. They were sold almost exclusively to video stores, and selling fewer copies meant a higher price point. It was usually around sixty bucks.

People would lose tapes, or the dog would eat them, or Junior would use them as a tub toy, and they would own up and come in to pay for their sins. Mostly.

Tell them the tape is going to cost sixty bucks to replace, and tack on a hefty three dollar a day late fee the company was unwilling to budge on, and the kid's Magical Bathtime VHS Adventure would run them any easy hundo.

People would shit their pants. Many a temper tantrum was had. Actually had an officer stop by the store after someone demanded to file a police report accusing us of extortion.

And since most people never rented anything outside of a vehicle or heavy equipment, they were mystified by the concept that it was actually a crime to not return rented merch, and the long ass paragraph they signed under when they first came in spelled out their responsibilities and liabilities. Oh, so many wonderful conversations in which they thought they were the first person to try and wrangle out of their duties.

chesterfeildsofa,31,96,1ox4ap,456,"When I turned 21, my mom got me a job at a gas station where one of her friend's son was the manager. I grew up with him until i was around 8 and he would randomly come by our house to see my mom from time to time. Of course, like some mothers do, she tried to set us up numerous times. I rolled my eyes and ignored it. 

After working there around 9 months, my manager was being promoted to the IT department of the company. Suddenly i realized how much I would miss him being around all the time and asked him out. We've been together for over 3 years now and have a 1 year old daughter.

Anyway, back to the story. His replacement as our manager seemed like a nice guy. He said he liked me because before anyone knew who he was, he had come into the store as a customer and I went above and beyond to help him. 

Turns out, he was a douche. Any little thing we did wrong he would belittle me and my coworkers. We had a store meeting in the back room one time and he bought food for everyone...except me. I had to run the registers while everyone else sat in the back room eating and discussing things that were going to change at our location. A few days later, i was doing something and he bitched at me saying ""We just had a meeting and talked about this multiple times, chesterfeildsofa. I know you're not as stupid as you look, but you need to work on listening."" I reminded him that I wasn't in the meeting, I was running the registers. He said it wasn't a good excuse because he had posted a summary of everything from the meeting on the cork board, yet no one even mentioned that to me. 

The final straw came when one night, he was about to go home. He asked me if I knew how to deal with vendors and that Pepsi was coming later that night to pick up a case of stuff that went bad. I said yeah and he said if I had any problems to call him. Pepsi came, and the paper work confused me. It said he was taking 24 20oz bottles of Pepsi, but the case set out had other kinds of bottle on it. I called my manager and he doesn't pick up. I don't know what to do, so the Pepsi guys says he will just get it the next time he comes to the store.

The next day i come in for my shift and my manager calls me into his office. he asks me what happened, I explained it all to him, and he says ""If you didn't know how to do it, you should have just said so instead of just making yourself look too stupid to do something so simple."" Then he sent me back out. 

I stood at my register for around 30 minutes contemplating walking out. I asked my coworker if she could handle the customers by herself, and she said yes. i told her I was leaving. I close my register and walked into the office to get my stuff. My manager immediately yells t me to leave because he was conducting an interview. I said ""Andre, I can't take you anymore. I'm sick and tired of your shit, so you can go fuck yourself, I'm out"" and walked out the door. 

My manager comes after me as I am getting into my car. he tries to get me to come back and I scream ""No, I'm done! I'm tired of you making me feel miserable all the fucking time so you can just shove this job up your ass"" and took off. 

Later, my coworker told me when he walked back inside he immediately told her I was banned from the store. After hearing that, i realized i need my last paycheck stub. I had direct deposit, so I needed to get on the office computer to print my stub out. I emailed the company via their website, explained what happened, and said I just wanted my last paycheck stub. I got a phone call from the district manager, explained again what happened, and she said she was sorry I felt I had to leave like that. Then she offered to talk to the other district managers around the city and see if I could be hired on at a different store. I said yes, and got my job back working with a super awesome manager lady. (Also my boyfriend had nothing to do with getting my job back. He could have helped, but he told me he wouldn't because it would mess with his reputation in the company and possibly get him fired. I understood that and didn't even ask)

That really pissed my old manager off. He felt like me walking out on him should have made me blacklisted from ever getting a job with them again. I felt all happy inside knowing that he was pissed.

Oh it gets better

Remember how he was conducting an interview when I walked out? He ended up hiring the guy. 6 months later, they realize cigarettes are missing as well as some money. They catch the guy on camera, fire and prosecute him. Then my old manager gets fired for not catching the guy sooner.","Final Straw from Mr. Asshole Manager, sweet turn of events",552

Background: I work in property management. We're one of the biggest in our city and manage an apartment complex and houses all over the place. We have an on site manager at our apartment complex who has been going through some health issues and is not available this week (relevant). We also try to be accommodating. We have people call in desperate, they need to move in a week, they got screwed over by a scam and need a place as fast as possible etc. We really try to help them and do everything speedy so we can get them in. But every time we try to help someone out, we get stood up. They don't call us back most likely because they've found something else. So we've stopped bending over backwards for people.  
So a lady calls in and wants to see one of our apartments. That's fine. I give her the on site manager's number (I didn't know he was in the hospital at this point). She calls back a couple minutes later and says he didn't answer and that her and her dad need to see the place as soon as possible. I told her the best way to do that would be to call the on site manager. She says fine I'll leave him a message. Cool. Let me mention here that In every conversation she has cut me off when I'm trying to talk to her.  
Between that and her next call I find out our on site manager is out of commission.  
Lady: So [on site manager] still didn't answer his phone.

Lulu_belle,7,10,1owzey,50,"After college, I worked as an assistant store manager for a large, nationwide retailer.  I was told I was being ""groomed"" for a district mgmt. career with said retailer.  After I started, I was given several promotional-type items (pen, business cards, notepads, etc) each emblazoned with the slogan, GREEN SIDE UP!  

So I asked the district manager - what is GREEN SIDE UP?  Why is this slogan all over the stuff for managers?  He told me the following story:

A woman hires a paint contractor to come and paint her house.  When he arrives, she leads him through the house.  In the living room, she stops and hands the contractor a paint chip with the color ""Living Stone Neutral Beige"" on it, telling him, ""I've thought and thought, and I think this is the best color for this room.""  

The contractor glances at the paint chip, shoves it in his pocket, and walks over the window.  He throws up the sash, leans his head out the window and hollers, ""GREEN SIDE UP!""

Puzzled, the woman leads the contractor into the dining room, where she gives him the ""Williamsburg Blue"" paint chip.  Just as before, the contractor glances at the chip, puts it in his pocket, walks to the window, leans his head out and hollers, ""GREEN SIDE UP!""

This continues in each room.  The master bathroom, Sunflower Yellow:  ""GREEN SIDE UP!""

Kitchen, Babbling Brook:  ""GREEN SIDE UP!""

Guest Room, Purple Passion:  ""GREEN SIDE UP!""

Finally fed up, the woman stops the contractor and asks him what the hell he is doing.  ""None of my colors are green!""

The contractor sheepishly looks at her and explains, ""my men are laying sod next door.""

The DM explained to me that GREEN SIDE UP was intended to help store managers rally their employees to drive sales.  He wanted to remind us to keep after our employees, because they needed our help to stay on task and do what we ask them to do.  ""Oversight is critical,"" the DM said.  ""We have to be on top!""

tl;dr:  management thinks employees are morons.  ","""GREEN SIDE UP!""",60
pikachu_the_thug,54,53,1owyo6,259,"I work in a gas station chain. I have dealt with a lot of odd people, but this woman yesterday was definitely one of the strangest.

She was a short, round lady, probably in her 50's or 60's. She was wearing sweatpants, a gaudy floral print shirt, and a floppy hat.

She came in with one of our gigantic refill mugs (44 oz) and asked the other cashier how much a refill costs. He told her that after tax it came to $0.96. She proceeded to go fill her mug. She came up to my register and I rang her up. I told her it would be 96 cents.

She dumps out change on the counter, which isn't abnormal I get paid in change all of the time. I reach for the change to start counting out 96 cents. She screeched at me: ""NO NO NO I like to do it a certain way!"" Meanwhile a line is forming behind her. So she slowly counts out all of her pennies, carefully inspecting them before sliding them towards me. Then she continues with her nickels, doing the same thing. Then she pushes her dimes towards me after looking closely at each one.

When she had finished this all she had in front of her was about $4 worth of quarters and one dime. She had only given me $0.90. I politely asked her if she had six more cents. She started muttering about how she didn't want to break a quarter but she guessed she had to. I pointed out that she had a dime. Her face brightened and she said ""oh yeah okay that's fine then"". So I take the dime and cashed her out. Then the lady said ""Wait... what year was that dime?""... it didn't look special to me, it just looked like a normal dime. I look at it and replied that it was a 1986. She snatched it out of my hand and said ""oh no, no, no I can't pay with that"".

She started slowly putting all of her change back into her change purse. I reminded her that she still owed me six cents. She started pleading with me. ""Please ma'am, this is all of the money that I have. This is my laundry money. I need to do laundry...""

1) She asked the other cashier how much the refill costs so she *knew* it was 96 cents before even reaching the register.

2) She had a perfectly good dime that she could have used.

3) I don't think breaking one quarter is going to prevent her from doing her laundry.

I told her that she could give me back the dime. She got upset, almost on the verge of tears, and said ""Please ma'am I can't use this dime. Please, this is all of the money I've got"". She looks down and sees that I have a penny cup for when people go a couple cents over on their gas. She starts begging me to take six cents out of there. Finally I take the pennies, shut my drawer, and tell her she's all set and to have a nice day. She stands there for a bit thanking me and telling me god bless. She promises that she'll bring me six pennies one day. Finally she leaves and I can get to the people who were waiting behind her.

She comes back a few minutes later and asks if she could use a pen. I told her sure, usually people borrow them to fill out lottery tickets. She got upset because none of them had caps on them and I realized that she didn't want to *borrow* the pen, she wanted to *have* it. She finally selects which pen she wants out of the cup of identical pens and then she says ""God bless you, I promise I will bring you a pen someday. I promise."" And then she walks out the door.","""Wait what year is that dime? 1986? Oh no I can't pay with that then""",312
_Jake_,11,5,1owx6b,66,"backstory: I worked for a large coffee chain for a few months over the summer.  This was my first job and I was just wanting experience getting a job/getting out there and learning work ethics.

Anywho, early on in my employment I had just gotten off ""training"" and was put on register. My shifts usually consisted of myself and my supervisor (small shop) so running register/preparing food/drinks was all apart of my duties.  The shift was moving along swimmingly when a guy comes through the drive through.  He orders a custom sandwich on a bagel with everything modified/changed. He wanted this like this, the bagel cut this way, only mustard on this side of the bread. The bread toasted at exactly 437 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Ok, the last one was a bit of an exaggeration.  The other guy in the truck with him ordered a cookie-cutter sandwich.  I start to work on his sandwich while more orders are coming in through both the drive-through and the front register.  I'm buzzing around the tiny work area preparing this and that. We realize that the orders behind the truck are small (small coffee black, 1 plain bagel) so we ask the guy in the truck to pull forward and we will run the food out as soon as it is done.  He says something about ""not having time for this sh*t"" but pulls forward regardless.  We finish up the remaining orders in less than a minute and finish his sandwich and his buddies simple sandwich.

My supervisor runs the food out while i take the next drive-through order and then returns without fuss.  As I'm greeting the driver I hear some yelling coming from the front door. Both myself and the driver look over and see an angry-faced guy burst into the front door yelling.  He strides straight over to the counter towards me(since I rung him up and cashed him out) complaining that we screwed up his sandwich.  I apologized, finished cashing out the guy in the drive-through and asked him what was wrong.  He claimed that we hadn't toasted it properly and the bacon we put on it was as crispy as he liked it.

AC:I don't have time to deal with this I have to go to a REAL job and make some money

ME: I'm sorry about that I can make you a fresh one if you'd like

ME:Oh I'm terribly sorry would you like a refund for the sandwich?

*Seeing I was in a corner my epic supervisor stepped in and began tell the customer off about her job and why he thinks hes so much better than us for having a ""real job"" and how if he wants his sandwich hes going to have to wait

Disgruntled he stood there while I handled another drive-through order and then re-made his custom sandwich(which we normally don't do but it makes the customers happy). I never saw him after that day.

supersporky,9,9,1owwg6,58,"I don't know what it is about Saturdays where I work. It seems like people wait until I am not working and then all hell breaks loose.

This Saturday, a customer calls and ~~asks~~ demands to know about her order from Company A. My fellow associate Kay, who has no training on how to call and check it out because **all** of the Companies we order from are closed on the weekends, takes her name and phone number for me to call back on Monday (today).

Monday is here and I do all the necessary checks to see:
 
*1: Who this customer is

*2: What their order history is 

*3: When they were called last to let them know that their stuff is here. 

Except, she hadn't ordered from Company A. She ordered from Company B. In August. And left us an incorrect phone number. That I tried calling multiple times.

**Rage Mode Engaged**

She tells me that she *knows* that she ordered from Company A because thats all her daughter wears (its not, her daughter has worn nothing but Company B for the last year, I know, I checked) and how this was a birthday present for her daughter and how **I** ruined it. 

Its been sitting here for 3 months now. I attempted to contact her 4 different times and got a disconnected number.

We have receipts to show that customers know what they are getting and that they have provided us with a correct and working phone number. She signed it and it clearly says its from Company B. I asked her to bring in all of her receipts to show me where it says she ordered from Company A.

**Will update when she comes in**

TL:DR Customers are wrong until they can prove they are right.

**Update 1** There is an hour left in the work day and still no customer. Haven't received a phone call either.
**Update 2** She just came in claiming it was from Company A. She showed me the tags, you guessed it, from Company B. **HOLY CRAP GUYS!!!!! She also apologised!!!!!!!!!!!!**

hogglethebear,13,29,1owqxp,167,"*This unfortunate incident happened several years ago, in a bar in some dark corner of England. Apologies if my shoddy memory means some details are vague.*

This story starts off in the most ordinary of ways; I was a student and working as a bartender in a chain pub/restaurant. It was one of those bars that isn't classy, but also isn't a complete dive at the same time. 

Most of the the time, we had no trouble keeping everything in control and doing our jobs well. However, this was the kind of place where a situation will escalate out of nowhere and leave the most dedicated of employees confused about whether to run away or stay until the end of their shift.

It was a Sunday, quiet as usual and everyone was just waiting for the evening to end. Thanks to my bad clock-watching habit, I can tell you it was about 11:15 at night. That gave us 45 minutes until the bar closed and, with everything as quiet as it was, we'd finished almost all the cleaning and closing down.

Of course, in traditional ""fuck you, Mr. bartender"" fashion, a rowdy group of middle-aged men sauntered in, singing some football chant and demanding jagerbombs. After I'd helped them learn what jagerbombs actually were, but not before they'd downed them, the team leader on duty (let's call him John) took the chance to ask them politely to quiet down.

It was then, while we both waited for them to chill out, that I noticed something I really did not want to notice. Above one of the men's heads was rising a thin column of smoke. Oddly, it was originating around his straw hat. Not so odd if you were looking at it from a different angle and could see the bloke's friend holding a lighter up to the hat with a mischievous grin on his face.

""John, is he on fire?"" I said, too bewildered to react.

Unfortunately, before I could get a reply, the hat was more fire than straw and everyone was shouting something. I was shouting at the men to put the fire out, John was loudly asking them to leave before they burnt the pub down and several of the regulars were cheering in surprise and amusement.

Luckily, one of the men was sober enough to agree that they should probably exit and find another place to burn down. The guys started to file out, but the arsonist decided now was the time to complain loudly that he shouldn't have to leave for setting his friend on fire.

After all, he explained, they were out celebrating their graduation from police academy. You can't throw police officers out of a bar, he reasoned, even if they're lighting each other on fire.

Somehow, while confused beyond belief, we managed to get them to leave and, after a reasonable period of stunned silence, every person near the bar burst into laughter and we made a note to watch the whole thing back on the CCTV.","""You can't throw us out, we just graduated from the police academy.""",196
Rudedoggg,6,13,1owmjq,28,"This story revolves around my run in with a pizza employee, technically at this point I am no longer a retail individual but rather “That CUSTOMER”, as it will become apparent. 

Me=Asshat=AH for short.
Cashier=teary eyed teen, TET for short
Manager- Man for short “duh”

One evening as I am headed home from a long day working (just got off a double shift, 16 hours) it’s about 7pm on a weekday, way too tired to think about fixing anything to eat so I decided that I would enjoy a treat and get me a HUGE pizza from 
 “a snap-e business”, I go in and place my order with TET she takes the order, repeats said order to make sure of correctness (so far so good) asks if I would like a drink, I say thanks but no. (I did say thanks too)

Now all is done and right with the world and things should be great the only thing left to do is trade money for service’s rendered for the food right?

She (TET) then looks at me and asks for my name. 
( innocent enough right?) 
For whatever reasoning my mind decided that her request was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay off base, (wtf brain?) 
(AH) what? Why the FU** do you need my name?  just make the pizza and give me my change, and go away.
(yuup, I said that.)
She (TET) looks at me with what I can only describe as a rage building up and she is about to pop, her face was as red as a bullfighters cape, however she controls said rage, takes my cash, gives me change, and still looks at me waiting for my name.

(AH) in a moment of clarity my brain decided to come back to reality (why it left I don’t know) I looked at her and gave her my name (AH), she typed it into the system, then left the counter.
About 15 minutes later the pizza arrives and a different person calls out my name,

Now for the time that I waited for my pizza I was able to get a grip on my “issues” I felt soo bad/awkward for whatever reason I reacted like I did, ( would love to blame it on the level of tiredness I was at, but even that didn’t seem help me feel better).
As it turned out the person that had replaced TET at the counter was the manager, and as I sheepishly walked up to the counter I asked the manager to forgive me for my Assholiness (that’s a word isn’t it?) and is TET available for me to apologize?
He stated that she was on break and she was unavailable, I asked him if he could please ask her to come to the counter and you can stay as well to ensure that I will attempt nothing.

He kinda mulled that over for a bit finally made a decision and called her to the counter,
TET- yes? (very hesitantly)
Man- this “gentleman” wants to speak with you.
TET-ok.
AH- I want to apologize immensely for my idiotic behavior, I just got off of a 16hour shift and I guess my Brain decided to go to sleep before the rest of me, You obviously know that you did nothing wrong and/or started that tirade of mine.

TET- Its ok.

AH- no its not, and I am ashamed for my actions, but I understand your concerns you need to put up with a lot and I did not need to stress you out like that, I know it doesn’t mean much but I want you to take this tip, (I slid her a fifty and put it in her hand).
TET- wide eyed she stated she could not accept it.
AH- I looked at the manager and told him she will have to keep the tip because I won’t let her NOT take it.
The manager looked like he was gonna argue this but agreed to let her keep it.
TET- thanked me and told me not to worry about the incident.

So that ended my run in with being “THAT CUSTOMER”, needless to say I make it a point to not be the (AH) customer anymore, so far its working.

In comes a very nice guy who was looking to exchange an item that broke on him, I ask him to get a new one and a few moments later we are ready to do the exchange. 

After a wholly unremarkable transaction I go to tell him to sign his name on the pad and that will be it. Now.. that is what I should have said but I try to be myself at work and just let things flow. So I quickly grab one of my many transaction ending lines and send it on out but what my brain got right, my mouth got wrong. I said to him ""Alright, just sign your name on the pad and then you'll be outta my hair."" Oh Shit.. this isn't good. Why, mouth? why!? He paused and looked up at me inquisitively with a hint of a smile. I said ""I uh.. I got that one backwards didn't I?"" He let out a good laugh that broke whatever tension there was between us and said ""you don't have much hair for me to get tangled up in anyway.""

rock-it-science,21,15,1owid5,114,"This is my first TFR post. I work dairy at a grocery store in the US. The particular store at I work at is pretty small compared to the other locations, so associates who are in grocery, dairy and frozen will rotate departments every few months, or have to work a different department for a few hours if there's a major load that needs to get worked asap. When I was first hired back in May they had me in grocery, but a little over a month ago the manager started putting me in dairy for my shifts.

Now, there's a regular who comes to the store a lot. He's a bit of a short man, a bit older but not *old*. If I were to guess, I'd say he's in his mid-50s. I have no idea who he is, but he knows a lot about me. I figure he is a friend or former co-worker of one of my parents, because he always asks me about things I did as a kid that I have no interest in right now--the kinds of things my parents would talk about but not me. I've never asked his name because 1) he knows exactly who I am, so it would seem rude to not know who he is and 2) he kinda creeps me out.

I hadn't seen him around for a while when he came into the store yesterday. He saw me working and came up to me. He has a funny way of speaking. It's like every word as an exclamation mark and an ellipsis tacked onto the end and a random heavy exhale every now and then. We had our typical exchange:

""Hi Rock-it...!""

""Hi! How are you?""

""OK...! *mmhum*""

""Have you...! Been...! Working...! Mornings...! or nights...!?""

""Mostly evenings. Why?""

""OK...! *mmhum*

Then he walked away to continue shopping. This is normally how our exchanges go. A little while later he came back.

""Have...! you...! (exhale)-ever...! done...! any modeling...! nude...! or...clothed...! or...!?""

""No.""

""Ok...! *mmhum*""

And he wandered off. 

I was pretty weirded out. I'm a 19 year old male. I think I'm reasonably attractive, but I've never been hit on by old men before. I wasn't sure how to respond to that question, so I may have come off as irritated (which I don't want to come off as at work).

Jinxy_Minx,9,23,1owex1,100,"I worked in a pretty well known thrift store. The sign kinda looks like a peeping tom to me.

There was this manager hired on a few months after I started. I shall call her E. E was hired into the company, had done retail  but never worked in one of our stores before. Why was this a problem for those of us working under her?

Cashiers at our store are also expected to hang a certain number of clothes every day. When I left it was around 700 pieces of clothes a day. When you're on register it really can be a pain in the rear.

With sometimes 3/4 people putting out 700 items of clothes things get tight on the racks. When that happened we had to 'snake' things around but it had to be in a certain way/order.

One of the tipping points happened when a co-worker and I were trying to snake t-shirts on Es orders. So, register on a pretty busy day, snake the entire store, and keep hanging the 700 items of clothes. Easy, right? Not really. Thing is we were the only ones working that time of day, and E was the only manager at the time and she never helped unless the head manager was there.

E pretty much felt it was beneath her to be out in the store helping.

You'd think she'd be a little understanding about why our normal hanging was going so slow, right? *sigh* No. She kept threatening to write us up if we didn't meet our quota, saying we needed to work harder, etc. She loved to do that shit.

Well, our company was/is really strict with time. If you're one minute over on time your ass will get chewed out. So our managers were very very strict with when we took breaks/lunches. E threatened me when it was time for lunch, whereas I wanted to keep working until someone else got there for my co-workers sake, she demanded I clock out then.

This left my co-worker working register, snaking by himself, hanging, and E had added something about counting the T-shirts to prep for Sunday. My co-worker snapped. He stormed out, smashed a box of crackers, screamed, it was. . pretty crazy.

Kalcaman,24,52,1ow5gn,229,"MooBg: I'm a pizza manager running a popular pizza delivery store. I see all kinds and as I am the boss, I usually am the end to all issues. My motto is - All problems can be fixed by throwing pizza at it. 

Story:

This one is fresh out of the oven, and since the nature of the conversation had with this particular customer was so wild and ridiculus quoting it is near impossible.

So I get a phone call at 1 minute till close and start up with my usual script, even if its a minute from close ill still take that order. Right out of the gate the man on the opposite end of the line starts telling me how he had just recieved his pizza from us and it was covered in bugs and how disgusted he was. Mind you this man was speaking as if he was an actioneer, fast and monotone. 

My initial reaction is always a straight up apology and then to find the order a customer is complaining about, and fix the issue (while documenting the case). 

Now our computer systems are very up to date and all orders and phone calls are recorded in our caller I'd/order system. i can see what time a call came in even an order wasn't placed, and can look up past orders recorded under numbers. 

Well I attempt to get as much info as possible from him to see where this order went wrong. Soon several lies start to surface as well as some odd things being said. 

His story: (since he was talking like a meth addled junkie I pieced it together from our 10 minute convo bit by bit) He had placed an order from our store no less than 45 minutes ago and had been delivered a large all meat pizza (pepperoni and sausage and xtra cheese) it had been delivered by a young guy, and his pizza was covered in bugs. He had thrown up, his friend almost died, and he was about to call the police. He did not want a refund and only wanted another pizza.

Inconsistencies: at this time of night all pizzas are made, cut and boxed by me. And its slow enough that I can pretty much track all orders well. Not ONE order has gone to the hotel he is calling from in the past 5 hours, which was later conformed by the front desk clerk there and my computer system.

Then there was the pizza itself. I had not made a single pizza matching any of his descriptions let alone sent it there. 

There was no young men running orders that night. Just two girls, and a 40 y.o. male.

Computer system no phone calls to or from any of the numbers he supplied yet he swore he called in. 

He claims he paid cash and the reciept he had proves his order BUT on cash orders here we actually do not give reciepts (unless asked) and those are memorable requests because I print those reciepts. 

Final was the kicker. Each box contains labels on them that has distinct information on them such as address, time, price and ordrer number. When I asked him to look for the very large order number at the top left (to verify his order) he gave a sob story about how his eyes were bad from recent surgery and he couldn't do that, THEN proceeded to read off our address and info from his reciept which is honestly smaller that the label. (Which the info that he read was actually from our special made hotel cards) 

Really it's not that hard to get a free pizza from me, you just have to have a previous order from me and some complaint about anything (my extra sauce extra cheese pizza was too salty) and I would rather throw a pizza your way and ensure you are a happy customer. 

This man would not stop and threatened legal action, police, a lawyer, the news, anything to scare me. I told him that it was his right but since he was now threatining legal action I would need to have his full name, perminant place of residence blah blah....

Finally it ended with me telling him straight that this was sketch, since we had zero records of this transaction he would not get a free pizza, and he would not get a refund. His reaction was then that he will come in tomorrow morning, and I sad ""excellent, ill be there bright and early, I happen to be opening as well so please bring the pizza and reciept by and ill gladly fix this for you!""

He hung up.

The whole mess agitated me because while I do make mistakes and will gladly fix them, I cannot stand blatent scams.

Cosmic_Hitchhiker,22,15,1ovxxh,65,"I work for a grocery chain in the Midwest United States. We are a large store and almost every customer uses coupons. Today an older woman came to my register and after getting all her items scanned she begins to hand me her coupons. One. By. One. After about 3 minutes of her handing me coupons the register tells me one won't work. This conversation takes place.

Me: ma'am, this coupon isn't working, did you get the regular tuna?

Woman: yes. I'm sure. 

I ask for the tuna to double check, the woman rolls her eyes and sighs audibly. 

Me: ma'am, this is the light tuna, you need to get the regular.

Woman: are you kidding me?! It's right there on the coupon!!!

The coupon shows regular albacore tuna.

Me: no, ma'am this is for the regular albacore.

Woman: fine can he go grab it for me?( gestures to my bagger)

Me (happy we have reached a conclusion): sure! 

My bagger is new so this takes some time. In the meantime I scan more coupons. 3 more don't work, so far her order has taken an insane ammount of time and we were in the middle of a massive rush.

Me: ma'am these don't work either, you're sure you got these exactly? 

Woman: yes. Positive. 

I call my manager over for a coupon check and override (we often need overrides for coupons) 

Manager: are you sure you got this one in the 9 oz size?

Woman: Well no! You didn't have the 9oz so I got 9of the 1oz. 

Manager: ma'am you can't use this if you don't have the proper size. 

My manager is a no bullshit kind of lady and hands the woman her coupon back explaining that she needs to have the proper size and that no we cannot just ""make if work"" she then leaves.

The woman turns to me: fix this. It says right here in the coupon. 

Me: *flustered and a bit surprised* I can't do that. I don't have the authority. 

Woman: but IT SAYS ON THE COUPON!

Me: ma'am it says you need to buy ONE NINE OUNCE package. I cannot fix if for you. My manager just said the same thing. I can't fix it without her approval. 

Woman: I can't believe you. You should be fixing this. I can't believe you can't just make this work for me.

Me: your total is $xxx.xx 

Woman: you are awful. I can't believe this. 

Me: ...

Woman: I know this isn't your fault but you should be fixing this. 

She then goes to have the same argument with the service desk person. Her order took more that 8 minutes which is absolutely ridiculous for a hundred dollar order, especially in the middle of a rush like that. I still don't know what she expected me to do.

I've been working there for 16 years, so plenty of experience and plenty of stories.

This happened yesterday morning, and it took stupidity to a whole new level.

 I was working on a boxing game (if you have never seen one or played one, the point is to hit a ""speed ball"" as hard a you can) I was standing on a ladder working on the ball return mechanism, 3 guys walk up to another game(NFL 2 min drill) and start with their macho/alpha male/frat boy bullshit- goading each other into playing, and I just know they are going to be trouble.

let's called them douche 1,2, and 3 (D1-D2-D3)

D1- put's in a dollar bill. (I know it was a bill because the game makes a very specific sound) 

all three of them are standing there waiting for the game to start. (note: there is a start button)

D2- hey man this shit don't work

D3- yeah man, he put his dollar in and it don't work

D1- what the fuck man your shit don't work

(yeah, they all talked like james franco in 
""spring Breakers"" I swear every other word was 'shit')

me- just push the start button, it will start

D1- no man you don't get it, I put my money in and it don't work

me- I heard you, just press the start button. it's next to the 

D2- what are you stupid. it's not working come fix this shit

D3- this place is a fucking ripoff none of this shit works

(I'm still on a ladder, my hands are covered in grease)

me- sir, just press the the start button.

D1- do you speak english, I said it's not working. do your fucking job


I get of the ladder walk over to the game, using my elbow I push the star button.

me- like I said, push the start button. now play your game and get out before I call security. I was lucky they all left without further incident. just a few more choice words from D3.

the whole thing took all of 2 min, longer than it took to play the game. they all left after the game was over, great start to a busy weekend.

Furfaidz,35,62,1ovrmd,294,"I work in a grocery store doing a couple different jobs, depending on what they schedule. One of them is cooking samples, where I'm in one spot for about forty minutes, cooking. It's the best way to meet the weirdest people.

Today I made a recipe called maple mustard glazed chicken, and with the side it takes about, well, forty minutes to make.

During one of the cycles an older gentleman in sunglasses walks up to me and asks about the recipe. I tell him what it is and how long it takes to make (a generic response to a generic question). 

That's when he decides to confide in me something I wish he had kept to himself.

He starts off by saying, ""You are a good person. I can see it in your eyes. I trust you.""

I smile, because I believe I'm a good person and I have a big ego.

He says, ""I've always been the black sheep in my family. My mother never liked me and I was always getting in trouble with the law.""

""I'm a black sheep, too."" I reply, ""My mom always wanted a boy so I was trouble ever since I was born. I try to do good to make up for it, but it's never worked. At least I still try.""

He's ignoring me, I can tell by the way his sunglasses observe my counter as I'm cooking. 

He says, ""I'm a good person, too. But I get in trouble. I went to an AA but it didn't help.""

*'Here it comes'* I remember thinking, because that type of statement never ends well.

He continues, ""Not too long ago I went to a night club. Alcohol has a way of making you come back to it. Been addicted for over twenty years. I met a pretty girl, around your age. She was very pretty. She had a brother who had cancer, so when I felt death that night, I thought it was going to be him."" 

""Oh?"" I smile, trying to mind my busy work and being kind at the same time. 

""I believe in God."" he says, looking me dead in the eye and holding a fist to his heart. ""I'm a good man. I believe in Him.""

I assumed by the way he looked at me through his sunglasses that he thought I believed in God, too. I didn't say anything, allowing him to continue. (BTW I respect all religions).

""When I went home with her that night, I didn't do anything to her. We just talked and went to bed. The last thing we talked about was God and the bible. 

The next morning I woke up and took a shower, you know? Made coffee, but she was still in bed. I got worried. I tried waking her up but she was purple and blue. She was dead. 

I called the cops and they looked at my like *I* killed her! I didn't kill her. But it looked like I did because I was the last one with her when she was alive and then she was dead, and naked. I could have had sex with her body. I could have taken advantage of her, but I didn't, because I'm a good man.""

""That's good."" I say, swallowing, but my throat was dry. (Today I learned not committing necrophilia requires more than common decency).

""They said she had morphine in her system. She could've died from a heart attack, so I didn't kill her. I didn't."" He says, his face inching closer to mine, over the hot pan. His black sunglasses glaring at me. ""You believe me, right?""

""Yes, I believe you..."" I look down at the pan, ""But it is odd.""

""What? What is?"" He says, moving away and speaking louder, ""You don't believe me?""

I shake my head, ""No, it's not that. It's just funny that you're telling me this in October."" I point with my eyes at the pumpkins nearby on the floor. ""So close to Halloween.""

His shoulders relax and his mouth wrinkles into a smile.

""Yeah."" he says, ""I guess you're right."" 

He watched me cook until the sample was done and handed out, then he followed me to the back of the store but I took a random isle (that one with cards, people rarely go down that isle) and he lost track of me. 

I think he asked the deli if I was there because two or three deli people, and people from costumer service, told me a man was asking for me but no one knew where I was.

 ""What? You couldn't wash the windows or hand dry it?""

I looked at him and said

 ""Sorry sir,  I'll take care of that right away"" 

I got in his car,  put my seatbelt on, turned the car on as to look like i was going to  take the car back to car wash. I made eye contact with him, he looked at me like I was a peon. I smiled and turned on the windhield wipers. I watched his smug smile turn into a frown as the wipers did they're magic. 

I then proceeded to roll down all windows and rolled them back up leaving water lines and ugly streaks.

dichotomies,14,9,1ovbqt,76,"Years ago I worked at a local shoe store chain that had just started liquidation. It's times like these that bring out the worst in people. Anyway, of the few stories that I remember this was the best. It was probably the most innocent way I shut a customer up. The store is in a mall, so all the stores are set to open at 10 am. I was standing near the gate, prepared to open it when my manager gives the all clear. A woman who was impatiently waiting for the gate to open tells me ""You guys should be open, it's 10am already!"" Then I retorted, while nodding to my manager, ""not by his watch."" Needless to say my manager started cracking up. 

That is a great thing about a liquidation: employees at all levels don't have to put up with any crap, nor do they have to pretend to. I didn't mean to be so dismissive, because I was technically correct. But it was great seeing my manager just laugh in front of the customer while I realized what I had said. Needless to say, we waited a couple more minutes before opening.

A couple of weeks ago, my store was having a huge promotion, as well as a one-day sale. Needless to say, the lines were long and the complaints were plenty. One of the cashier's and merchandiser's breaks overlapped a little, so my manager was forced to jump on front cash. No problem, right? 
 
One customer (C) I was ringing through commented how there didn't seem to be much people on the floor. I explained how our manager and a merchandiser were acting as cashiers while some people were having their lunch.

This story takes place a couple of months ago. Our store closes at midnight and our manager, although pretty laid back, really doesn't like it when we punch out later than we have to.  
  
It's a couple of minutes to midnight and all the tills are pulled except for one at front cash. This means that the pharmacy can't cash out prescriptions any more. Although they're closed, we have a 24 hour store literally *right down the street.*   
  
Peering down the aisles, I don't see anyone and figure that it's going to be a good night. All of a sudden, I catch a glimpse of them - a couple at the pharmacy counter. I know that pharmacy won't be filling out any prescriptions this close to midnight, but I still do the customary, ""Our store will be closing in 5 minutes..."" call. I figure this will get my point through. They leave pharmacy - and start shopping. FML.   
  
1 minute to close - they're still there. I do the page again, this time forgoing any 'pleases' and 'thank yous.'   
  
Our lights go off. They're **still** here. My manager approached them and let them know that we're closing up *now,* but the man had stuff in his hands and said that he was going to cash out now. Awesome!  
  
12:05. What.the.fuck. Obviously the woman can see our merchandisers standing at front cash, unable to leave until signed out. She starts telling her husband, ""Let's go - they're closed!"" His response? **""What type of chips do you want?""** We're not allowed to *make* them leave, so all of us just stand there in disbelief.  
  
12:10: Their stuff is loaded on my counter and I start ringing them through. All of a sudden, the husband makes a dash for our seasonal aisle. I ask the lady how she wants to pay and she sheepishly responds, ""He has the money..."" Fuck.  
  
12:15: He comes back with a *chocolate lollipop.* Apparently, that's what was so important. He's taking his sweet time, trying to make small talk, all the whilst his wife is trying to get him to hurry up. Then he dropped this gem - **""It's ok - they get paid overtime.""** WTF. At this point, I was so close to losing it and informing him that **none** of the people he was holding up were getting paid overtime. But, being the non-confrontational person that I am, I kept my mouth shut and cashed them out with a smile on my face.  
  
My manager and I didn't leave the store until 12:30 because I still had to count my till and close down the store. Seeing that I still had a lot to do, my manager took pity on the rest of the staff and let them leave asap. I could tell that she was pissed but, luckily, she didn't say anything.

&gt; Me: I can't think who you could be talking about. All of our staff are usually accomodating. I'm sorry for your experience, I'll run and get your milk now.

I left the till for a moment and came back with the milk, sold it to her and as I'm finishing up the transaction she got a bit overexcited as she pointed over my shoulder, practically shouting across the store.

&gt; FB: that's him! That's the man who didn't know where the milk was and was very rude about it!

&gt; Me: *I turn to see a man in a mint green shirt looking my way sheepishly. I've never seen him before in my life. I turn back to FB* I'm really sorry, madam, but that man doesn't work here.

BadKitty1011,45,115,1oughl,587,"It's not funny, just sad.  Background - I'm the owner of a small salon, and a stylist.  I had a visit from one of my regular clients two days ago, and it's still on my mind.  Our stylist/client relationships are more personal than some other fields, these things affect us.  Those of us with any sense of compassion, anyway.

She's in her late sixties, early seventies maybe.  It's her third round with cancer, the leukemia has returned after 11 years of remission.  She calmly tells me during her blow-dry that her doctor has stopped her chemo.  She calls it a ""super-bug"" - the chemo is no longer treating it, only killing the rest of her cells.  There are no other options available.  She might have three years, she might have three weeks.  She doesn't know.

I remain silent while she speaks.

She tells me that she wants four years, to make it to her 50th wedding anniversary.  She's spending time with her family, taking each day as it comes, *living*.  All of this in a calm, collected voice, as if she's talking about the weather.  She's made her peace with it.

I don't know how she does it, really.  Having never been in her situation, I can't say how I would react, not that she expects a reaction, pity, anything.  It's a fact of her life now.  She thanks me, pays her (discounted, because she really is one of my favourite clients) bill, and leaves with her husband.

I walk into the back room, out the back door, and stand in the rain.  I don't know if I should cry, or scream, or curse someone or something.  It's not fair.  She's a good person, shse doesn't deserve this.  Then again, who does?

The rest of the day is a blur of clients and services.  When I am alone, closing the store at the end of the day, the phone rings.  It's her.  She has a favour to ask of me.

She wants me to style her hair for her funeral, when the time comes.  If the funeral home will allow it, of course.  Would I be able to do something like that?  If not, she understands.  It's not an easy task, she says.

The tears are running down my face in torrents now, like the rain on the front windows.  I struggle to keep my voice from shaking, to not let her know this is hurting me terribly.

Of course I will.  If the funeral home allows it.  She thanks me, bids goodbye, and hangs up.  I sit there at the desk, still crying and staring out the window at nothing.

frenchtoested,16,14,1oug6z,63,"This didn't happen to me, but rather to a friend of mine.

**Background:** My friend, we'll call him C, works in a large superstore in a fairly decent part of town as a cashier and shopping cart returner.

**Story:** The other week, C saw a young girl (around 15, from now on YG) walk in the store, browse the front of the store for a bit then disappear into the store for a bit. C assumed she was alone since I saw no one else walk in with her. 

Meanwhile, C was continuing to check people out when YG shows up at his register.

YG shows up with 3 bottles of wine. Now, C says that she looked no where near the age of 21 and doesn't really attempt to make herself look 21.

C asks for her ID (part of store policy, duh) and she hands her Driver's Permit to him. He checks her age and sees that she isn't old enough to purchase alcohol.

C tells YG that she can't purchase the wine and returns her ID. YG proceeds to calmly exit the store without saying a word to C or anyone else.

Apparently the woman had misplaced her keys in the store somewhere and then got pissed when the cashier told her he wasn't allowed to leave the register to help her find her keys. She went to look for her keys (she found them) and then came back up to ask for a manager (so she could tell him how rude the cashier is?). The cashier calls the MOD on the walkie talkie and he tells cashier that he's a bit busy on the dock and he will be up in a few minutes when he is free.

That's apparently what set her off screaming and swearing... Telling us we are useless and rude because we wouldn't help her find her keys. She tells us she is the manager at the store next to us and that we are all terrible workers. She then says ""whatever I'll figure it out."" and proceeds to leave.

robertdowneyjrjunior,21,23,1ou8d6,96,"Hello TFR, I bring you a story from when I first started working at a head shop.

We had one of those glass refrigerators that you can find in convenience stores or pizza joints. I feel like there is a better word for it but I can't think of it. 

Anyway. This day it was filled with a shit ton of soda cans of different kinds.

I was helping a couple choose a grinder when two guys come in. Both of them are obviously higher than Mount Everest. I don't mind if people come in having smoked earlier in the day, as long as they aren't obnoxious about it. The couple leaves with a nice grinder and I ask the two new guys if they need any help. One of them is transfixed by the soda cans. 

""Those are only two bucks if you want one."" I tell him and he looks at me absolutely baffled.

""Two dollars for **this**?!"" He looks back at them like they're the vast treasure of Erebor. His friend perks up and looks at the case, suddenly looking amazed.

I feel terribly confused. Why are they so amazed by $2 sodas? Are they that high? Do we have a soda that is hard to find? 

The second friend inadvertently explains why they're so excited, ""(competing store) doesn't have stash cans. Dude, we gotta get some of these.""

I finally understand and almost immediately feel bad for them. ""Oh dear, those are just regular sodas. We don't sell stash cans.""

I have never seen two men look more disappointed. I point them towards some small glass jars that could be easily hidden but they're too distraught to buy anything. They shuffle out of the store, defeated.

This popped into my head today because I was sweeping and noticed two beers and four cans of soda sitting in on one of the shelves. I had a moment of *WHY CAN NO ONE IN THIS GODDAMN STORE CLEAN?* until I picked them up and realized the top screws off. Apparently we sell them now.

ps. for anyone who doesn't know what I'm taking about, it's one of [these](http://i.imgur.com/36mThZX.jpg).",Soda cans of disappointment.,119
MrEtchASketch,14,25,1ou83a,59,"I understand this sub is for people who work in retail, but I had an experience as a customer that I'd like to share.

As anyone who is looking for the best quality product for their money, I decided to shop around for an electronic hookah (think of an e-cig, but no nicotine; only flavor) in an area where they're sold abundantly. I go from store to store with my girlfriend, looking for the product. 

To understand the full context you must know that she is a petite girl who you could easily confuse for a high schooler (she's 25). She is dressed as if we're ready to hit the town, while I am dressed down in a hoodie and sweats. On top of that I'm sporting this untrimmed, scraggly beard, which makes me look way older than I really am (27). Culturally, she is West Indian and I'm East Indian, but I am often mistaken to be from the West because of my burly look.

We arrive at the last store there is, a smoke shop dedicated to selling mostly bongs, and decide ""I'll just settle for what I find here, since they mostly carry the same stuff"". We look around at the shop for a minute until we're greeted by one of the workers. He asks us if we need help, and I say ""yes, but just give us a minute"", wanting to browse just a bit. He stays with us while my girlfriend and I look at the crazy looking bongs they have behind their glass displays. 

Then we heard the man down the aisle start speaking in a foreign language. Without turning to him, this man begins speaking loudly down the aisle to the worker assisting us. they exchange a quick conversation between each other while I continue to browse. I look at my girlfriend and smirk, and she knows something is up. 

I tell the sales guy helping us what I came here to buy and he shows me the products. Of course, it's the same stuff that I saw at the other shops. We go up to the counter and and he's just about to ring me up when I stop him.

Me: Wait, what were you guys talking about back there?

Sales Guy: Oh, nothing. He wanted me to make sure I get you what you wanted.

Me (I begin speaking the same language they were speaking): No he didn't. I heard him. He wanted to make sure that you requested identification if I was buying anything, but not to ask for ID if she was buying something.

Sales guy (looking like he saw a ghost, while looking over to the manager he was speaking to earlier): Oh, no! He wasn't talking about you!

Me: We're the only customers in the store right now, and since we've been in here. AND you made sure you heard him correctly.

At this point, the manager and the sales guy are both silent. I just look at them with dissatisfaction and my girlfriend and I walk out of the store without buying anything. The whole ordeal just turned me off from buying what I wanted at all.",A tale from the opposite side of the counter,84
diinomunster,11,47,1ou2ge,140,"A little background (I'm on my phone, don't mind auto correct): I used to work at Reddits most hated pizza place as closing manager. This was my first time managing ""fast food"", I have prior restaurant management experience (sushi bar), but in between those I worked day side at a gas station. 

I hated managing that shit hole. It was a delivery only location so at least I didn't have to deal with eat in people. We had done a full tilt rehire. We kept about four of our veteran drivers and one other manager. The franchise owner hired a brand new general manager and assistant manager. They are freaking useless and are horrible with the customers who ordered pickup leaving nothing but a pile of half explanation notes of comps with account numbers for me to credit. Also, they put me on the pay roll for almost four dollars an hour LESS than I was promised when hired. (always get that shit in writing) 

So long story short I got fed up by them selling expired chicken in all forms (seriously by like two weeks expired. West WI/ Rochester MN don't get chicken.), dealing with their horrible people skills, and working awful hours for little pay. I'm never doing fast food again. I put in my two weeks and went to ask for my job back at the gas station. 

I was told that they never took me out of the system so I was still technically employed but all they had was third shift open. We had a lot of trouble before I left keeping third shift and my boyfriend who's been there fur three years assured me it hasn't gotten better. They offered me a substantial raise (10.50/hour), thirty hours a week (only three nights of 10p-8a),and my favorite part is that it pays weekly and auto deposits into my bank account right at midnight every Friday. 

My first overnight last week was rough. I knew what I was doing (there's only one third shifter on a night) because I had covered a few when they had been in a bind previously. It's just so slow, I see maybe 10-15 customers a night until about four am when the commuters start rolling in. 

The manager gets there about 615a and the first shift cashier gets there at about 7a. So I normally go do my finishing chores (remake coffee and breakfast mostly) and during that time I saw all my favorite regulars come in and say how excited they were to see me back. It was really flattering seeing as I'd only been gone about two months. One even bought me a donut when I told him I writhed third shift and was just leaving. 

I dunno, I guess it's the little things.

Raymobile,79,73,1ou02g,320,"Its that time again! Procrastination time!

This is not so much a story as much as a general rant. I've worked at my store for a good solid number of years, and I can  no longer count the amount of times i've found unaccompanied children wandering the store.

Lets clarify why this is a bad idea. I once chased a dude who was touching up a little girl whose mother left her in front of one of the TVs in the store. I feel that is a great indication for keeping your hellspawn with you!

I once had a father come up to me with an exchange that went..

Dad - Hey i'm just going to run upstairs, can you keep an eye on my Daughter?

Me - Yeah, thats not going to happen, take her with you or stay down here, because as soon as you walk away i'm not standing here anymore. I don't get paid to babysit.

Dad - Oh....you sure, I won't be long?

Thats the sort of thing you have to put up with it seems. Earlier this year I kept seeing these kids just sitting in one of the rooms of the shop, just reading quietly, which is fine, but after 3 hours I went up to them and asked where their parents were

Kid A (radiohead joke LOL I kill me *sigh*) - Why what time is it?

Me - Well, its only about 1, why?

Kid A - Oh they must still be in (shopping centre opposite us)

Kid B - They said they will be back at 3 to get us.

Me - you've all been here since 10 by yourselves? what the hell!

luckily one of my regulars was in that day getting his book fix, he is actually a member of the constabulary, and he said if it happens just call the cops and get them a talking to for child endangerment. Which is what we do now, because its just a law suit waiting to happen, totally frivolous and would get thrown out but people are getting stupider it seems.

Which now brings me to the last type of people, the people who don't realise out closing times, and therefore don't come back in time to get their hellspawn out of the shop before it closes. One night we had this kid, he would have been 5-6 years old, bawling his eyes out because he was now locked in the store, I left him with the MOD cause fuck that, and walked outside and found a woman frantically banging on the doors on the other side, so I asked if she was the irresponsible parents of a young boy crying inside, and if she was that she needs the other doors. these parents are the same sort of parents that let their kids play on the escalators, and then i'm the bastard for telling their kids to stop running up and down the escalators. 

Right final story! We have a graphic novel section, its my baby, I love it and I love my hardcovers, I also love the fact they are shrinkwrapped to prevent damage and issues like that, the fact that most of them are pretty expensive, anyway one day I found this kid who was trying to undo the shrink wrap, and I told him politely to please not do that, and he kind of nodded his little head. I wander away, and come back and find him still opening it, and I told him seriously not to do that, so he put it down and I wandered away again, third times the charm, I walk past just as he rips it open, holding the book by the dust jacket but the book itself goes flying and lands on the top of its spine, I walk up grab the book off the floor, grab the dust jacket out os his hands and stare him dead in the eyes and tell him ""This is why you listen to bearded men!"" and storm off. little shit.

spergus,38,61,1otmww,166,"Hello, my fellow retail minions! I have just returned from work. However, today was not without its pitfalls. *Just* as I thought my day was over, well... someone came and ruined my bitch-free afternoon. I have posted before, but will refresh your memories. I work at a coffee chain, situated in the middle of a busy shopping-centre food court. So I have had my fair share of drama. 

Let us begin.

It's almost 3pm, time for me to whip off my apron, toss my visor skywards, and gleefully drive home for a well deserved Sunday afternoon nap. I've been on the coffee machine since 10am, pumpin dem out for the caffeine-hungry people. The day had gone without a hitch, in fact, I haven't had any trouble lately with customers. My faith in the general public was slowly being restored. Until, let's name her, Honey Bitch, came a-squawkin.

I was about to be relieved of my coffee duties by our supervisor (she had gone off to the storeroom, so she was not present in the store at the time). I'm just going about my business, churning out coffees, when suddenly, someone's bitching and moaning catches my attention.

**Honey Bitch:** ""WHAT??! YOU DON'T HAVE HONEY??? WHAT KIND OF [insert coffee chain name here] ARE YOU?? OMG?? ARE YOU FOR REAL??! BUT I NEEEEED HONEY... OMG THIS IS SHIT.""

Some 20-ish year old girl, with an attitude problem was having a go at one of our youngest (and quite competent!) staff members, who also had a new trainee at her side. This was the trainee's first ever shift here.

**HB:** ""CAN YOU GET THE MANAGER FOR ME?? THIS IS BULL SHIT, HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE HONEY, WHERE ARE THEY, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.""

Mind you, my mum was standing right next to her. I glanced towards my mum, who wore a look of disgust upon her face. This bitch needed to pipe down. Also, we have a $10 minimum on EFTPOS, so she had to pay cash (Seriously, chill out, there are ATMs 20 metres away, use your legs). She wasn't happy, to say the least. But it was what she said next that really riled me up.

**HB:** *Throws arms up dramatically in the air* ""THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED!!!"" Really, bitch? In front of customers? Most of whom are regulars. Regulars *because* our customer service is exceptional. 

Straw on the camel's back. I put down my coffee tools. 

**spergus (me):** ""Excuse me, can you please not insult our staff? I understand you have a problem, but there is no need to swear or say our customer service is bad. It is in fact, exceptional, however, you have totally taken this too far.""

I am *awful* when it comes to confrontational situations. I like to avoid them at all costs. But I had to assert my position and defend my girls, who had worked very hard all day. It's not easy working at [insert coffee chain name here] on a Sunday arvo. I felt my face flush up, adrenaline rushing. I get very, very defensive. It wasn't a personal thing, more that I knew these girls who had served her were young and probably didn't know how to handle **HB's** aggression. 

**HB:** ""Look, I just... this is ridiculous, I mean, what if people can't have sugar?? (we have artificial sweeteners available) Where's your manager, why isn't your manager working on the weekend?????!?!""

**spergus:** ""She works on the weekdays, so if you would like to talk to her, please come in then. We have a supervisor today, who will be with us shortly."" (Our manager bakes all the food very early every weekday morning, then goes on to coffee/service, usually working 'til early afternoon).

**HB:** blahblahblahblahblah

**spergus:** ""Josie, here-"" (gesture to Josie, our new trainee) ""-has only been working here for an hour. Please do not speak to my staff the way you are speaking now. It is insulting and disrespectful. I get you have a complaint, however, that does not grant you the right to yell at my girls.""

This seemed to hit a nerve with her. She shut up for a second, I had to go back to making coffees. 30 seconds later, I'm serving up some cappuccinos, when, here comes **HB** with the perfect retort.

**HB:** ""You've been really standoffish with me, I can see it in your body language. Look, I've worked in retail for 6 years-"" (bitch, please, I've been working at this place for 4, and judging by what you're wearing- black lace top, black pants- where you work is no where near as demeaning as our job. Don't treat me like I'm a kid or something- I'm 20. I know how to handle customers like you.) ""-and you can't treat me like that.""

What?

""Now I can just go off and tell all my people about how rude the service was here, you should think of the customer-""

**spergus:** ""Please do not lecture me about customer service. I have worked here for a long time, and have had my fair share of crap (Oooh, I said crap! How provocative of me...) to deal with. I am only upset at you because you insulted my staff.""

She continues her lecture, repeats the word 'standoffish' several times- yeah, well what do you want me to do? Writhe around on the ground and evoke the honey gods to come to *you*? I'll just go outside to check on that beehive we have, laden with fresh honey. Then, this gem.

**HB:** ""Ok, I'm sorry. Sometimes people just have bad days, ok, and you don't know what they've been through-""

Umm, what?

**HB:** ""-what if something really bad has happened?""

No excuse. I don't care. I once came to work straight after my grandpa's funeral, and soldiered on. Keep it to yourself. I still wasn't impressed, just told her I didn't want to deal with her anymore, because she has gone on way too long and my shift is over.

adamandatium,22,28,1oti9w,112,"I work at a Chicago-based grocery store that is closing down completely at the end of the year. My store in particular is the smallest one ever built, and the oldest one still standing - which means that our store will most likely be closing down sooner than the others. Hooray.

By now, all of the employees know and have stopped giving shits about their work, especially the younger ones - including myself. It's actually quite liberating; I'm free to be rude back to customers who are bitching at me. It's every retailer worker's dream.

So anyways, I'm hanging out with some other coworkers near the meat department when a cashier, Amber, comes up to me and tells me that a girl just sprayed about an entire bottle of Axe on herself and her friends, put it back on the shelf, and started walking away. 

Oh, I thought. Oh. These kids just picked the wrong day to fuck with me. I stride to the front of the store and Amber points out the culprits to me. The only intentions I had was to bitch them out and have the manager bitch them out as well and make them pay for the Axe.

I stop the three people: there's a blonde white girl (BG), a light-skinned black guy (LSG), and a white dude who literally looks like a meth addict on those adverts against meth (MA). 

Me: Did you just take a bottle of Axe off the shelf and use it?

BG: ...what? Noooo....

Me: Don't bullshit me. The entire aisle reeks of Axe, you three reek of Axe, a coworker saw you, and we have you on camera. *Did you take a bottle of Axe of the shelf and use it?*

BG: We thought it was a sample.

Me: Did it say ""Sample"" on it?

BG: What...?

Me: If it was a sample bottle, it would have said ""sample"" on it. The bottle did not have ""sample"" written on it, or else it would have been a sample.

MA: YOU JUST SAID IT WAS A SAMPLE

Me: No, you misheard me. There was no label on it that said sample. You took it off the shelf, used the whole bottle, and put it back. *That is stealing*. You just stole product off my shelf.

While I'm confronting them, I hear the intercom go off: ""GREG COME TO THE FRONT IMMEDIATELY"" *Thank God* I thought to myself. *Greg (the manager) is coming).*

Greg comes sprinting up front and I fill him in on the situation. He glares at the three people and starts yelling at them, telling them that they're the reason our business is shutting down. MA gets pissed off and whips out a credit card, claiming that he'll pay for it and ""get done with this bullshit""

As we're escorting him to the service desk to pay for it, MA is glaring at me.

MA: WELL AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE A SHITTY RETAIL JOB

Me: At least I didn't get caught stealing.

MA and BG are glaring at me, but I just laugh to myself and walk off to find the bottle of Axe so they can pay for it. I'm so high off adrenaline that I accidentally knock into the plastic bag holder and it kind of hits BG.

Me: Did that hit you? I didn't mean to, I'm sorry. My bad.

MA: YOU'RE NOT SORRY

I just laughed and went to get the Axe. They pay for it and head out, still bitching about the entire situation when Greg notices LSG has something under his jacket. He grabs LSG by the arm and drags him back into the store. LSG's friends see him being taken and run, abandoning him to the wrath of the store.

Turns out, LSG was an employee of one of our stores in a different location. What did he steal? A grand total of one box of Cheez-Its and a liter of Coke. Greg calls the cops and LSG is forced to sit in front of the service desk and wallow in his shame and misery.

When the cops came, Greg decided not to press charges. The store was going down, and he wouldn't get paid to go to court, so there was no point for him to do anything. The cops hauled LSG off and I celebrated.

It was my dream since I started working there to catch a thief, even if it was accidentally. I got my dream. I got my wish. I moonwalked from the deli to the baker, singing ""WE JUST CAUGHT A THIEF"" to the tune of Blue's Clues ""We Just Got A Letter"". Elaine the special needs bagger said I deserved a medal. I was on cloud nine for the rest of the day. It was awesome.

submarinedreams,12,12,1oteni,62,"I work as a shift manager at a corporate convenience store/pharmacy. The store I work at has been open for 8 years, and for all 8 years, the hours for the front store as well as hours for the pharmacy have been exactly the same. The pharmacy closes at 9pm on week days and 6pm on weekends. I have never been to a store in my life where the pharmacy does not close early on the weekends, but whatever.

I generally close on the weekends since it's the less desirable shift and I am the newest manager, and it never fails that I get somewhere between three and ten customers a night (on weekends) that are upset that the pharmacy is closed early.

Tonight a lady screamed at the top of her lungs that she was irate that the pharmacy closed even though the sign at drive-through clearly stated they closed at nine on Saturdays. I went out to check the sign because we had a ""floater pharmacist"" (a pharmacist that is paid to fill in at various stores when needed) and I thought maybe he put up the wrong sign. Nope, the sign clearly stated that the pharmacy closes at 6pm on Saturdays. I don't know if she read it wrong or just lied, but either way, I hate being screamed at.

About a month ago a man came in bitching about the pharmacy being closed, despite the fact that it has closed at this time since the store opened. He needed morphine for his wife, who he insisted would not make it through the night without it. I pitied the man and did everything in my power to help him. I called the store 5 minutes down the road that was a 24-hour store who said they had it in stock and would be happy to fill it for him. Unfortunately, he said they wouldn't be able to take his insurance off as it had already been filled and insured at my store. He said he didn't want to spend the $150 to get the prescription refilled. He never came in the next morning for the morphine, either. And as it turns out, my pharmacist doesn't keep morphine in stock except enough for the few patients she knows who need it who come to our store regularly. She said there was no morphine prescription needed, ready, or available for any of those customers, though, so the man was lying about having his script at our store. I spend a good hour helping out this jackass and regret every second of it.

But seriously, I get several complaints from customers every Saturday and Sunday night after 6pm when the pharmacy closes about how disappointed they are that they can't get their medicine, even though the website, and several signs posted inside and outside our store are posted with our pharmacy hours. I am just a shift manager. I don't hold the key to open the pharmacy. It is against the law for me to open the pharmacy.

I was building a new parking brake mechanism for my truck (long story short **rust**) I needed to basically rig it together from scratch. I knew this would take me about 20-30 minutes but I had a pretty good idea of what I needed and just headed straight there from church...wearing jeans and a white polo shirt tucked in.

I'm in the back room using an angle grinder to cut part of my old mechanism apart when a guy pokes his head around and looks in (I assume he heard the noise). He's ~70 and looks like he needs help. Looks RIGHT at me and says ""Hey, I need a bunch of nuts and bolts; think you can give me a hand?""

I figure what the heck, I got plenty of time. They were super busy and there was somebody outside screaming at a manager because their propane tank was out of date and the store couldn't legally fill it. From the sounds of it the tank was far older than the guy was willing to admit; he was just trying to save a few bucks over the exchange. (The tank was screw onto instead of into for those who know what that means; old).

So I leave my stuff on the bench in the backroom and go help this guy with nuts and bolts. He needed a bunch of oddball ones, but knew EXACTLY what he needed. Since I still knew where everything was it took me like 5 minutes tops. The way they did pricing there was they'd write the number and the price of the bolts on a bag and give it to the cashier up front. I did this for the guy and put my initials on it (like I used to when I worked there).

He thanks me for all of his help and says that I've saved him a world of trouble. I say no prob and go back to hacking into rusty metal with a cutting disk (fun stuff). 

After about 15 more minutes I've rigged myself a new part for the parking brake on my truck and I'm ready to take my own stuff up front to be rung up. I go up, talk to the cashier, we laugh cause I helped a customer and I don't even work there anymore.

My next stop was the grocery store next door. Where I promptly ran into the same guy I helped earlier. He sees me and I see a slightly confused look on his face (it's maybe 10:30 AM) he asks if I'm on lunch. I kinda laugh and say ""nah, not yet."" At this point it kinda dawns on him.

""You don't work there do you?""

Me - ""Nope; I used to about a year ago.""

The guy starts to apologize and I tell him it's really not a big deal at all and that I really enjoy those kinds of projects. It makes ya think. We talked for a while and finally he looks at me and says:

""Well, the worst part is I can't even tell your manager that you're doing a great job!""

I said ""You could, but he'd be very confused!"" 

Bonus: The guy goes to the same church as me. He goes to the late service, but occasionally I see him in passing at special events and such. Always really nice. Not often that stuff like this happens in retail (and after apparently). Gives ya the warm fuzzies.

TL;DR: Helped a guy with nuts and bolts a year after I stopped working at the hardware store.",Nuts and bolts...? One more time? Why not.,168
Lenquo,8,60,1otdfi,251,"I work in a grocery store bakery with a lovely view of the sales floor, so I see most of the customers that come through. I don't know if it's a cultural thing, and income thing, or just plain douchbaggery, but most of the adults will bring in a passle of small children and let them run rampant. Poduct gets ruined, displays get knocked down, and the parents just walk away with their spawn in chaotic orbit. 

This afternoon I noticed an older woman browsing the shelves with two young children floating around her. This is hardly unusual, but as I turned back to my cakes there was a crash. A cardboard display of pepperoni had been toppled, and preserved meat lay scattered at the feet of those two kids. As I rounded the counter and aproached, something amazing happened: the grandma held out her hand and told me to stop, I was not allowed to do damage control. That saintly lady made the kids pick up everything and set the display back up, then apologized for the mess and thanked me for letting the kids clean it up.

sneak156,20,17,1otcee,100,"So for background, I'm a sales associate in a big box tech store, specifically the computers and tablets department. It was a fairly busy day and I was bouncing from customer to customer. In my scramble between customers, I had one of the sales associates from digital imaging (cameras) pull me over and explain that there was a customer who needed help with a kindle. No problem, I thought to myself. I ask her, ""how can I help you today miss?"" She was a woman in her mid 40s, a slight hispanic accent and was wearing a low cut shirt. (not attractive imo) As soon as she opened her mouth, I knew I was going to be there for a while. She sounded like one of those smoker chicks that serves coffee at the local diner with the raspy voice and everything. The first thing she says to me ""Are you a nice man? I only work with nice people."" ""Sure"" I responded hesitantly. She tells me how she wanted a kindle to read her books, nothing out of the ordinary. After I ring her up and about to send her on her way, she literally begs me to show her out to use it and to help her set it up. Things had slowed down, so I was like whatever it shouldn't take long to set up. Big mistake. I hold the kindle in a way where she shouldn't need to turn her body to see the screen. Yet, she insisted on approaching up on me. She puts her arm around my waist and slowly crawls down and grabs on to my belt. At this point, I'm thinking to myself what the fuck. I back up a little bit, and she's at it again. I only wear dry stick deodorant that doesn't have much of a scent for antiperspirant reasons. So to help you understand how close she was, she leans in and whispers ""You smell wonderful."" I'm trying to keep my cool as I'm explaining how to use the kindle, and she's clearly not paying attention. I'm still trying to back up and be polite but she's still making her move. She's still latched onto my belt on my waist and then starts rubbing her cleavage on my shoulder and then whispers into my ear ""I love nice people."" Nope. Nope. Nope. I'm fucking creeped out at this point. The demo and setup was done at this point and I was trying to send her on her way. Nope. ""I love nice people, babe. When do you get out of work? Let me buy you dinner."" No, thank you it's seriously okay, just enjoy your kindle! ""Come on, it will be fun I want to buy you dinner!"" She's basically yelling at me at this point. After I turn down her numerous approaches, she goes and starts to plea with me. ""Let me introduce you to my daughter! She loves nice people, she'll love you!"" If her mother is like this, I can't imagine what the daughter is like. I turned that offer down to, and essentially bolted to the break room so I can catch my breath over how creeped out I was at that point. Here's the most interesting part, I was only 17 when that happened. (Turned 18 about 3 weeks ago). The woman was essentially making a move on a minor. Albeit, I do look a lot older. Women can make men feel uncomfortable too, I can say I have never been more uncomfortable in my life.

Thehealeroftri,27,56,1ot887,148,"So today I was at work and I work in the produce section of a very large chain store that you've definitely been to.

The big one.  We all know the one.


Anyways, today had been a fairly uninteresting day aside from a middle aged man who told me that I was evil and responsible for the Salads moving from where they used to be but that's a different story.

It was about an hour before I was going to clock out and go home.  I was walking along the aisle when suddenly I spotted something in the corner of my eye.

Someone was eating the cilantro out of its container without paying for it.

So I took out my camera and snapped a quick, low quality picture of the culprit and walked over there.

Before I could say, ""Excuse me sir, you're going to have to pay for that."" the customer took off and flew away.

So it turns out that this customer was a bird. 

http://imgur.com/L0KfuZw

I promise that this is a picture of a bird eating cilantro.  I know it looks like someone decided to take a dump in the lettuce or something because my phone took a low quality picture and I was a far way away but that is a common sparrow eating cilantro.

He started to fly around the department, not going to meat or deli because you know, that would be too easy for me but instead he circled around produce deciding which food item he would eat next.

I kept my eye on him as I was putting the cilantro in a throwaway RPC because I can't sell cilantro that had been defiled by a bird's beak and feathers.

As he was circling the produce section he was chirping and although I don't speak bird he was telling me, ""You're not going to catch me.""

I went into the back room and found a manager and alerted him of the situation and he said he'd be right back and he'd help catch the bird.

15 minutes later and still no manager and I was by myself to try to get the bird not to land on any other food.  

Every minute or so a customer would assume I'm blind and deaf and say, ""Excuse me, there's a bird in the store."" while pointing at the very obvious chirping, scared, hungry bird who was circling above us and I would smile and say, ""I know.  I have alerted a manager and I he will help to bring it outside as soon as possible.""

No manager ever came and the bird ended up finding its way out of the store.

He left and he didn't even pay for the food he ate.

ignacioruiz22,93,158,1ot594,674,"First of all, i must apologize for any mistake (English is not my first language) and, second, i don´t work in retail but this story happened to me in a large store in Spain. 

**Background:** here in Spain there is a large company that sells pcs, games and everything refered to technology and it´s employees wear red shirts. They are like Polo shirts and with the company logo like the brand of the shirt (this is important).

**Story:** In college, the day before i had to present an assignment, my printer decided to finish its ink cartridges so i had to go to get some ink at this store.

Now, i´ve always been a football fan so i was wearing a tshirt from the Liverpool team. For those who don´t know how it is, picture a red sport tshirt with a large shield-like logo above the heart and a VERY large beer company logo on the front in white.

Well, here i am, ducking in front of the cartridges isle to get mine (they where at the bottom shelf) when a 40-50y woman comes to me and asks: ""Hey, could you tell me where could i get randomobjectidontremember?"". (I understand that being my tshirt the same colour as the store´s she could possibly be confused as she only saw my behind). I got up and answered: ""Sorry madam, but i don´t work here"". I even managed to point at the beer logo and the Liverpool´s logo but, here she comes: ""Don´t be rude, of course you do. Your shirt is red, isn´t it? So you work here then.""

Now, i am a very expresive man and my face shows what i´m thinking more often than it should, specially when dealing with stupidity so my sacarstic grin came up and, with that smile, i said: ""Sorry but no, do you think that an employee would wear a tshirt advertising an alcoholic drink and a football team?"" 

And then, people imagination bursted: ""You must be a company´s experiment to get more money. So, where is this product?"". I got angry at that point and said: ""For the last time, madam: I DON´T WORK HERE!"".

She just gave me a long look and said: ""Soooo, where is it?"" I sent here to the opposite part of the store.


PD: when i was checking and going out of the store, i saw her speaking angrily with what it seemed a manager and then she saw me, so i waved her goodbye. Her face went blank so i figure she realised the truth finally XD

wolfgirlnaya,8,13,1ot4dj,44,"Not very confident about posting this, but what the hell.

I've been at my job for almost a year. It's the lowest of the low at the place, but hey, it pays (some of) the bills. It pretty much sucks, though, so I would like to take the time to vent as much as possible about it. There's not much about the job that I hate, but the little bit is enough to make me want to leave. Now.

When I was job hunting I applied everywhere I could think of, including the local grocery store that my family had been frequenting for most of my life. I always had fond memories of the place, especially since they had kid-size shopping carts that I absolutely loved growing up. I was so excited when they called me for an interview. I figured that, as nice a place as I remember it, it must be nice to work at!

It started off really well. I looked forward to work and enjoyed getting some physical work in and chatting with the other employees. Everything was grand. At least, it was grand until reality sank in.

There were 5 managers: The owner's sons (Son 1 and Son 2), the front-end manager (FE), a secondary manager (SM), and a night manager (NM). NM was the coolest of the cool. Everyone loved her. She had a great attitude and treated *all* employees like important team members. SM was strict, but fair and reasonable. She was stressed from her workload; we all understood that. Son 2 was always working on something, and Son 1 kind of just wandered around doing his job.

FE, however, is absolutely intolerable.

Let me start off by telling you how she talks. Everything she says drips with condescension. You ask a question? She answers it **slowly and clearly** while staring at you with her head just a little bit down, in a sort of irritatingly patronizing way. She gives you that kind of look that an exhausted parent gives a kid when trying to say something seriously to them so they actually retain it. You know that look? I get that look every day.

She also seems to disfavor my position. There are a lot of young people in my position. Do the newer ones need guidance and to have rules spelled out to them? Absolutely. Do the ones who have been working there for more than 6 months need to be told what to do? No. We know what to do. It doesn't take long to figure everything out, and it doesn't take much to be good at it, yet she insists that we're all bumbling idiots. She also advocated that my position be denied raises of any sort. We get a flat pay of barely over minimum wage. And she wonders why we hardly try. (To be clear, we hardly try to impress her. We always try to make customers happy. It's just part of the store reputation. That rep doesn't include making the manager happy. We find it funny when she gets pissed.)

Ah, yes. Then there's the fact that she lets her emotions decide who does what work. We can all tell when she's in a bad mood. We get shit for it. She barks orders at us at every opportunity. And I do mean barks. I can't tell you how many times she practically glared at us and said point-blank, ""Carts."" That's her way of sending us out to get carts. ""Carts."" Apparently we're dogs. Dogs who can't do anything right. To add insult to injury, lately, she's gotten pissed off because we bring in *too many* carts at once. You read that right. We do our job *too* well. We haven't run into anything to warrant concern, and she only does this when she's in a bad mood. I'd be tempted to bark at her every time she says ""Carts,"" if it weren't for the fact that I'd lose my job.

That reminds me. Remember NM? The awesome one? She got fired. For using her phone. Can you guess who caused that? Bingo: FE. She caught NM on her phone and decided she should fire her. That would be understandable if not for the fact that she has *caught other people on their phones* and *ignored it*. No one else has gotten fired for using their phones. No one. Just NM. Probably because everyone liked her and FE was butthurt. I. Was. Pissed. Everyone was pissed. NM filed a lawsuit. I never heard how that went, but I hope she won and gave FE one hell of a time.

I could really go on for days about FE. There are other things about the place that I don't like, but I only want to quit because of FE. There's not even much that I could complain about to get someone to fix it. It's a culmination of the millions of times she's been rude or condescending that makes me loathe her and my job. I can't say ""she's done this"" because anything she has done would be written off because it's such a small thing, but it happens so often that it pisses me off every time. I'll cut off here.

Me: I'm so sorry sir, the box office is only open Monday thru Friday. We don't actually sell tickets in this office. However, you can buy them online at the box office website and pick them up from will-call one hour before the showing. 

Customer: I just want four tickets. 

Me: I'm sorry sir. We don't sell tickets here. I can look up the website for you and give you the link.

Customer: Fine

Me: (prints out website front page and URL) Here you go sir. It looks like they don't have many seats, so I would recommend buying them as soon as possible. 

Customer: Just click the link on your computer and I'll give you my credit card. 

Me: I'm sorry sir, I'm not allowed to do that. 

Customer: Then get up and let me do it. I need these now. 

Me: Sir, I'm really sorry. I'm not allowed to let customers use this computer. It belongs to the university and has sensitive information on it. However, there are computers in the computer lab upstairs that anyone can use for free. 

Him: Just let me use the computer. Seriously. It'll only take a minute. 

Me: I'm sorry sir, I really can't do that. I would get in serious trouble and they are monitoring the cameras behind my desk. You can use the computers upstairs for free. 

Him: I have my wife waiting in the car, so no. (Walks out)

_______________________________________________

About an hour later I get a call on our phone. As soon as the guy calls, I recognize his voice.

Customer: Hi, I need 4 tickets for tonight's (insert group name here) show at (insert location here). 

Me: Hi, this is still alohomorgan. I talked to you earlier. We still don't sell tickets in this office sir. 

Customer: Really? I only need four tickets. Why isn't your box office open today?

Me: I'm sorry, it's just not open on weekends. I did give you the link to buy tickets online sir. 

Customer: Well that link didn't work. It kept taking me to the ticket page but not the buy ticket page. 

Me: I'm really sorry, but that's the only website that sells tickets. 

Customer: Well it doesn't work. Email me the link

Me: Sure, what's your email?

Customer (takes him a solid 2 minutes to decide which email address to use) Send it now so I can buy tickets since you said there weren't many left. 

The guy then proceeded to berate me on the telephone while I was finding the website for a second time using google, which he could have done. He said it was ""unacceptable"" to have this bad of customer service and it was ""irresponsible"" for our ticket office to not be open. I don't remember everything he said while I was googling the website because I tuned him out after a minute or so.

Now, it's winter season so we're basically really slow and I can dedicate more time to cakes when we get an order. So I took off Friday last week, which is kind of unusual, and another girl worked for me. 

She took a cake order for this woman who wanted a really custom cake. The inside was 3 flavors and 3 mix-ins that really did not jive together, but whatever... not my cake. I make the base and toss it in the freezer come monday morning. Friday rolls around, and I'm on a cake decorating frenzy! I probably make 12 cakes that day. Also note that when working with ice cream cakes you really have to work fairly quickly because they will start melting. 

This isn't too big of a deal with normal frosting procedures but she wanted sprinkles on the outside (at least according to the order form) and ""cow print"" on it or a ""barnyard theme"". Well, I don't have any of that going on, and I did not have the time to order from decopac since the order was taken a week ago, and I wasn't in the store till monday. So, I opted for cow print. Whipped out my airbrush and did a decent cow print on the top. If you've never worked with an airbrush, it's a little tricky to do evenly sometimes but my cakes generally turn out okay. I am also only working with buttercream, I don't think people understand I can't mold them anything out of fondant/etc because 1. we don't have it, 2. we don't even offer that EVER. 

So, whatever, I finish this cake and toss it in the freezer to be sold today (on my day off, so I'm not in store). The lady comes in and starts bitching up a storm because she doesn't like that cake. 

I'm not offended, I really don't care. But, I can imagine that attitude she is giving my poor 16 year old at the front counter right now. This girl calls me and says, ""Hi, uhm, can you like come in a re-do this cake? The lady say she doesn't like it."" (This cake for meant for a 1 yr old's birthday party, BTW)

YEAH OK. I'll be right in on my day off to spend an hour re-decorating a cake and I wont get paid nor will I get a tip...(and on top of that I'll be bitched at about how she doesn't like her cake) no, no I wont be coming in to do that, sorry. (not sorry) 

I told her to give the lady 20% off an apologize, but that's the most I can do. Ridiculous how she had the nerve to ask for me to come in on my day off to completely re-do her cake. It's a huge process, since the icing is already frozen.

I mean, feel free to tell me I'm being whiny, but I did the best I could do to make this cake and I totally admit to being a complete amateur and I have never once (in 1.5 years) had someone tell me I should re-make a cake because they didn't like it.

For those of you that haven't seen it there's a scene featuring a mutant woman that has three boobs. For four weeks I waited patiently for my set up. Then one Saturday afternoon my moment finally came. 

A middle aged woman comes in and orders three breasts, fried. Right on cue, I delivered my line:

""You mean like the chick from Total Recall?""

I stood there beaming in anticipation of the inevitable, uproarious laughter my joke would elicit. Most likely another customer would ask what was so funny and the joke would be repeated. Eventually the entire store would be consumed by laughter, then everyone would applaud. A co-worker would give me a congratulatory pat on the back as I stood there observing the joy and happiness my wit had brought into the otherwise tedious and mundane suburban lives of my customers.

""huh?"" she said. 

She must not have heard me so I repeated myself.

""Oh. You mean the movie? I haven't seen it. Actually can you throw a couple wings in there too? Do you guys have ranch?""

I was crushed. Defeated, I half-heartedly placed her chicken into the paper bag, handed it to her and gestured towards the ranch dressing. Over the next several weeks the opportunity to repeat my joke presented itself a number of times but I was too disheartened to follow through with it. Too afraid of reliving the disappointment. It was probably the most anti-climactic moment of my life.

jpbcosby1162,15,14,1osib3,53,"As a cashier, I do notice how some people can be very stupid, angry, or just unaware of their surroundings. Send these people to fend for themselves in the wild, most would not survive. Some of the angry people might survive, but others I question their logic. I've got many examples.

It seems that when I am checking and bagging the customer's merchandise, I have to pay close attention to make sure they actually take their bags. It seems that whenever I let that customer fend for themselves, they forget their bags. I then have to write it down in this notebook where we keep track of left behind bags. Fortunately, some customers come back for those bags. Sometimes, a customer will even leave some merchandise inside their carts when they go to empty it. If it's a food item, we have to claims it out. 

I've also had customer who ask where their stuff is. Umm... I don't know, maybe in the bag. I remember one guy in particular, I put all of his things in a bag. He then screams ""Where the hell is my stuff!"", looks down at the bag, then angrily takes the bag. One of my supervisors witnessed this, and we both made fun of him after he left. Sometimes if the customer has only one item, I place it on the little table next the the card reader. They then cannot find their item. I have to point it out to them even though it's clearly in front of them. 

Another time, I put a customer's merchandise in one bag, I let him know he has one bag. He picks up his bag, then asks ""Is this one bag?"" 

And let's not forget the classic the lights on and the customer asks ""Are you open?"" along with the lights off and closed sign is up and customers come as they please. This one gets on my nerves so much. There was a time I was trying to close my register so I can help a physically disabled person with a carry out. It took me about 10 minutes before my line cleared. Sometime during this, another customer was nice enough to help the disabled customer.

offbeathamster,206,219,1oshit,768,"I Work weekends on the information desk in a large shopping centre, and during my time there I have met all sorts of odd people, but this guy has to be the worst.


He lost his 10 or 11 year old son in the centre at a peak time on Saturday, no sweat, just look for the kid and if all else fails get us to send out an announcement, or at least check his kid wasn’t at the desk, right? Wrong. This fucknut waits a full 15 minutes for the kid to find him before deciding fuck this, and going home.
The kid had more common sense, he found his way to us at the desk and we attempted to find the father, no luck. After 45 minutes of security searching we were unable to find or contact the father and were ready to call the police.


Then, the father rings us and tells us “I’d like to report a lost child, lost about an hour ago.” He doesn’t sound worried, or even interested. This is clearly just an inconvenience to him. But we match up the descriptions and ask him to pick up his offspring.



This is where I really lost faith in humanity. The guy tells us, honestly and openly that he will not pick up his lost son because, and I quote: “I’ve got home now and I have started dinner”. He even goes as far as to tell the child to walk back (the journey would take at least an hour and a half, probably more). 
It took five minutes of us threatening to get the police involved for him to finally agree to pick the child up.



EDIT: The boy said he spent 20 mins looking on the different levels for his father, initially he only wanted to go up onto the next floor and back down again. The neighbourhood the boy said they lived it is relatively good,However the thing which is most significant and really annoys me is that it had been raining, it was dark (4-5pm) 

The reason why we did not call the CPS is that we were letting security handle it. They were assessing all the options and were about to call the CPS when the father agreed to pick up the child, but 3-4 guards had a long word with him escorting him to the car park.

kthekool,9,42,1oscs6,123,"So I'm still pissed about this.

I get a phone call Thursday morning from a large drug store chain telling me they received my application and asking me to come in for an interview. 

I had applied to a number of locations, so I asked the person (who I assume to be the manager) which location. She specifies which store, and tells me to be there at 11:30, since she'll be coming in at 11.

I get there and tell them I'm there for an interview. Manager isn't there. She took the morning off to do something. The Assistant Manager calls the manager on her cell, but I can't remember if she got her or not.

The assistant manager or whatever says that they're actually over their payroll hours, and that she'll call the other stores in the area to see if maybe I got the location wrong.

Calls three other places and sure enough, they don't have any interviews scheduled. Nobody can figure out what's going on, so I just leave. 

When I get back to my car, I call other places around, just in case I misheard the name of the store. Nope no luck.

Okay. So this guy invited me to participate in the hunt but I couldn't because I had to work. He offered to bring by a finders fee (a couple nugs, yespleasethankyouverymuch) when I was off. As we were texting back and forth about the logistics, he asked if I'd be interested in a place inside their collective. 


*More about the scavenger hunt:* This is a local underground scavenger hunt. It is in it's beginning phases and is a pretty cool concept.
Local artists, musicians, crafters, growers (yes, that kind) and other creative talent come together and provide arts, gifts, and services for profit from participation.
Hunt takes place every full moon at a random location in the city. You sign up through their site and are added to an email list that informs you of the spot. Participants pay $20 for entry and are given a token (a simple little plastic container with a neat picture on top, of which there are many varieties), a map, and a gram of weed (for those with medicinal marijuana licenses.) Tokens are collected based on the map and clues and traded for the aforementioned prizes, in addition to things like tickets to the local amusement parks, restaurant vouchers. You'll find gift bags on the hunt with things like bubbles, panties, small pieces of artwork, and a handful of tokens.

*For those who are thinking this is shady - well... it is. But that's the nature of medicinal marijuana in the golden state. It's so damn close to legal, but you piss off the wrong person and your collective is raided the next day. Just the way it goes until it's decriminalized by the state.*


By the time I got off of work, I was so focused on having a ride home that I forgot he was going to stop by. I didn't see the text from him saying they (him and a game host) were on the way until I jumped into the car and was already headed home. I offered to meet him the next day since I was out of the city and we started to plan on that.


Then he said they were actually gonna be in my general area and could come by my place if I was okay with it. I wouldn't have been if I lived alone, but I have three roommates and one of them was home (we'll call him Frank.)


So I run it by Frank and he says that's cool and that's what happens. Coincidentally this guy and Frank have the same name in real life. Guy and game host show up with finders fee in tow. 


It was like Christmas in October. 


A gift bag that would have been found on the hunt, plus a few bonuses. The bag included hemp lotion, a cheap lei, a big bubble wand, a rainbow-brite style glow in the dark star wand, and eighth of sour diesel, four tokens, some coloring stuff...


Bonus gifts included a twelver of Steel Reserve and a bag of chips. And a pineapple - *which was fucking delicious.**


So guy launches into explaining the hunt to Frank while I unload this gift bag, eyes wide. He then goes on to tell me (us) about how we can get involved. Since this thing is in beta and expanding rapidly, they have more work than workers right now. They need manpower for all positions. 


They'll pay you $1 per token that you stash.


They'll pay you for your artwork.


They'll pay you if you run their facebook fan page/twitter/instawhocares.


And they want to give us a job. Frank got included by extension and I feel much safer as a result of that. 


But it still feels a little rapey. Or culty. Or god forbid a rapey cult. *Those are the worst.*

ppnguitarist,17,31,1os60s,125,"Background: I am a manager at a fairly large retail pharmacy chain. Its one of the slower ones in the chain so we don't really have any kind of LP officers or cameras or anything so we have to do all the apprehension of shoplifters ourselves. One problem though, we have to actually see them steal for us to be able to say anything. This story is from when I was in training. It didn't happen to me but one of the other managers but she told me the whole thing. I'm gonna tell it how she told me.

The story: So I was setting a new planogram and Kevin, the cashier, approached me and said he thought a customer was stealing. I had him point her out and started following her. Sure enough, I see her rip open a pack of headphones, stick them in her purse, and throw the package back on the shelf. After I saw that, I went back up front and made an announcement over the PA, ""Security scan all aisles."" (This is of course a load of bs because we have no security at all. Its company policy though instead of confronting the person, we're supposed to try and scare them out of the store without causing a scene)

Instead of going out the front doors though, she went over to the cosmetics area and started wandering about. I walked up to her and asked if she needed assistance, which she of course refused and walked away. Now I'm following like a hawk and I kid you not stuffed something in her purse like ten feet away from me. This time I go up front and call the non emergency number for the police. I tell them what's going on and they said keep following her and that they'd send a cop as soon as they could. I make another security announcement, to no avail, and go back to following her. She's in the diet section now, putting some five hour energy shots in her purse. I approach her again and offer assistance, and again she just walks off. I'm still following her and she would not stop stealing. It was ridiculous. I would follow her somewhere, she'd stash something and walk away. This went on I kid you not for another 20 minutes until the cops came.

When they got here we went to the lady and got her to come into the office. The cops had her empty her purse, and there was so much stuff in there. She claimed it was all hers but I had literally seen her stuff most of it into her purse. The cops cuffed her and took her away and after scanning everything that was stolen out of the inventory (company policy again. It was now evidence) it totalled to almost $200.

And that's it. The manager had to go to court and testify and she got some hefty community service after she paid for all the shit she took.

bslidepark,10,14,1orty0,23,"Background: I work at a grocery store. I've been there for a little over a year. This happened during my second month of working there so I was still fairly new at the job. This is my first post and from my phone so hopefully it's not too bad!

Characters appearing in this story:
Boss-woman: my manager
Typical teenager and first job: myself
Friend/co-worker: his self
Minimum wage minion: as his self
And staring the drunkard: alcoholic keeping that buzz goin'

From my view: It's a Sunday morning and I had just finished sweeping the lot of all the inhumane garbage that is littering the parking area. It was freezing. After about an hour of this I went inside and starting cleaning and whatnot until business picked up enough for me to start bagging for the customers. I had gone to the back of the store again for more miscellaneous tasks until I went up front for more help. There apparently was some sort of hubbub that occurred in my absence but I was unaware of the situation. Boss-woman comes up to me: ""I have a fun job for you"" with a smile. I was sent to the stock area to get a cleaning agent labeled as purple peroxide. I could only imagine the disgusting mess I was about to battle with considering the cleaner we normally use was apparently not good enough and the back of the bottle calmly noted that it was capable of cleaning up things such as aids and other strong viruses and bacteria other cleaners cannot. I return to the front. Over in the liquor section was a massive mess of bottles and alcohol. BW tells me to wipe down one of the carts that was recently brought back by one of the other two thousand part time minimum wage workers currently at the store. I grab another worker who was a friend of mine to help break the monotony of bagging for several hours on end. We begin scrubbing it down and notice an odd smell but did not know what it was. After we finish we had one more task, we grab some buckets and clean up the vomit that was in the parking lot. Only then had I been told what had happened.

What happened: That morning an old man had come stumbling in reeking of whiskey.  His drunken ass decided it would be a swell idea to use one of the smart carts (electric scooters) and that he really needed to keep his BAC levels high enough to avoid the health risk of being pissy from a hangover. After poorly maneuvering about the aisles, being a danger to himself and other customers, he managed to find the liquor section which is at the front of the store right where his drunken escapade had begun. Unfortunately, while making a b-line for the jack daniel's (and I use the term b-line lightly), he crashed into one of the liquor shelves and destroyed around $300 worth of alcohol. Thus he responded the way any normal human-being would have in that situation by pissing his pants. For some odd reason he somehow was still allowed to buy alcohol and was then helped to his car by the minimum wage minion that I had previously mentioned before. At that time it was too late to warn him not to sit in the smart car that the drunkard had previously soiled himself in. The poor bastard had rode the cart back like we normally do, noticing an odd smell along the way. This is when he also said the man had thrown up in the parking lot which we (my friend and i) had to wash down the drain. At that point we managed to find it after someone had driven into it and got it all over one of their front tires. This too, we had to clean up.

tehtreats,57,150,1ormqr,445,"[UPDATED]TFR, after 10 years of dealing with customers, I would not believe the story I am about to tell (it's a long one, folks.)

**Background:** I work at a hardware store in the middle of a big city. I've been at this store since it opened a bit over four years ago and have climbed our tiny franchise ladder to assistant manager. Due to our location, our customers are composed of every walk of life - from those who carry all their worldly possessions on their back to those who have a half-a-million dollar view as a vacation home. As a young, attractive female, I get to deal with a very special breed of creeps and assholes.  Needless to say, I deal with *a lot* of weird shit.  I get to meet a lot of really interesting/cool/awesome people, too . 


**Just another ordinary day? No.** It's another beautiful day in the city and I'm standing near the front doors at the paint desk, working on reports n stuff.  One of the sales guys is lurking nearby, waiting for the next customer to stroll in. 


This fella walks in and notices our bag policy sign near the bargain bins. In his late 30's to early 40's and something about him says Biff from Back to the Future. Maybe it was the bowler shirt. Anyhow. He walks right up to me and hands off his shopping bag, saying he noticed the sign. I thank him earnestly as most people put up a fight about leaving their bag up front. 


(Sidenote: for the love of the gods I do not give **fuck** about what it is in your backpack/shopping bag/rolling luggage. It needs to go behind the register because we are not about to babysit you for the duration of your visit. Yes, some asshole ruined it for everyone else. Yes, I'm okay with losing a customer over it.)


I digress. He drops this bag with me and walks off with the sales guy in search of a battery for an RC car that I know we don't have (might as well let him see some inventory.) As he does he says, ""Oh, and help yourself to something from there!"" It was then that I looked at the bag and realized it was from Fredrick's. Of Hollywood. The delightfully naughty lingerie shop. 


Immediate dafuq.


I take the shopping bag over towards the registers (where they go) and start looking for this battery through our ordering site. We have a pretty decent selection made available to us through a third party and I'm just trying to figure the best way to search for it when he comes back up front. 


Again he offers me something from the bag. At first I laugh and give the standard, ""Oh that's alright, but thanks. Now let me see if we can find this battery....""


He then goes on to explain that they are for a scavenger hunt taking place in a few nights and it's the least he could do for my efforts since the last few places just said ""we don't have those"" and sent him on his way. At this point I thought *fuck it* and rifled through the bag. Save the embarrassment of pulling out a pair of sexy underwear out in front of staff, customers, and the like, I looked for a tag that was my size, balled them up, and stuffed them in my apron. 


We laughed about it as he gave me a business card so I could follow up and let him know if I could find the battery in time. I did and it might actually have landed me a lucrative job opportunity. Happy to post about it for those interested, but not sure if it's still appropriate for this sub?

Kaspariano,17,31,1orkmm,103,"So this was from the time I worked as a sale assistant in a sport shoes store (as in sneakers, running shoes, basketball shoes, etc.) in a mall near where I lived, it was around 4 years ago.

The mall was in a neighborhood that had a Orthodox Jewish community, they were usually the nicest costumers. You could always tell them apart as all men wore Kihpahs and the women wore skirt that went almost to their ankles.


So this women came in with her 3 daughters youngest was 11 oldest was 15, and one of my colleagues got them on the rotation so he went up to them and asked what they were looking for, all as usual.


Apparently they were looking for some sneakers for the older girl for gym, he asked the size and went up to get her, all as normal. I later become aware of them again when the woman was raising her voice. I went over and hovered nearby, see if my colleague needed help and I was just curious.


So the mother had told my coworker that her daughter was a size 34 (this is in Brazil, so feel free to look up the conversions if you want) so we usually bring a bigger and smaller size along just in case.


So size 34 was way too small for the girl as was size 35 (this isn't weird btw, those are pretty small shoe sizes). Noticing this my friend went to get a size 36 and 37 just in case when he was stopped by the girls mother who didn't want her daughter wearing bigger shoes, she thought sizes bigger than 35 were unladylike and then she started n her own daughter for ""pretending"" the shoes were too small. 

I went and called the manager over, who is awesome, she basically went over and tried to convince the mother to let us measure the poor girls feet and get her some proper sized shoes, the woman was not convinced but she allowed us to get her a size 36 for her daughter, the manager then sends me to the stock and tells to get a size 38, take out any size indicators and put it in a box for a size 36.

I ran up and do this the best I can, the mother is suspicious but eventually relents, we even fake the receipt so the mother doesn't get suspicious, we are afraid of getting in trouble with corporate over inventory inconsistency but its all worth it for the huge look of relief on the girls face when she wears a she that actually fits.",Shoe Size,134

RedHeadedBug,6,13,1oreht,33,"One fine February evening in 2012 while I was covering our primary cashier's dinner we had a very nice woman (NL nice lady from now on) come in to return a bag of mylar cat balls. She just wanted a straight return but her receipt was from December. Very much over the 30 days we have on our return policy.

I paged into the office to ask if the policy this week was to give a gift card or cash for the return because our LP and DM refuse to agree on the procedure for such returns. Despite our return policy we are to never ever *ever* refuse a return unless the person returning is on our list of problem people.

My manager, whom we will call J, tells me to wait just a moment and he will be right out. I tell my customer and all is well so far. J comes out and scans the balls with our inventory gun before scuttling off onto the sales floor. 

I exchange a confused look with NL and we wait for him to come back. When we does come back he tells NL that we will not be doing the return because we should have three packages on the shelf and we only have two and that her package looks brand new ""as if it had never left the store."".

Holy shit on a shingle what the fuck are you doing J?! He argues back and forth with NL while I am trying to tell him a saw her walk in with it and it just has an old receipt. Finally poor NL says that she doesn't need the return but wants our customer service number, his first name and our store number all of which he refuses to give her before he locks himself in the office. I'm freaking out and apologizing to this woman like my very life depends on it. I give her all the info she asked for and keep apologizing. NL lives up to her name and is very nice to me and keeps telling me it isn't my fault and that she isn't mad at me. She leaves but tells me she will be right back in to get cat litter.

She does come back to get her cat litter and comes through me line again. As I am just about to process her payment J come bursting out of the office (which is just behind my register) and asks very loudly and very forcefully if there is a problem. I tell him no that NL just wants to get her cat litter and go home. Then I'm pretty sure J lost his goddamned mind.

He starts in on NL demanding she give him the mylar balls and telling her that he had checked the camera and she didn't walk in with them. He tells her that if she just goes and gets them he wont have to call the police. NL is understandably upset and keeps saying she doesn't appreciate being accused of something she didn't do. All this is happening as I am trying to tell him that NL did come in with the balls and I saw her. He eventually tells NL that he is contacting the police and that he needs to speak with me in the office. NL tells him go ahead and that she has done nothing wrong.

In the office J calls our GM and explains while I pace and freak out and try not to pull out my hair. He gets off the phone and shows me the camera footage of her coming in with a cart to get her litter. I have to explain to him four times and then find her coming in the first time through our secondary door to get him to believe that she didn't steal those stupid mylar balls. Now he is freaking out as badly as I am and keeps asking me what he should do. I of course have no idea how to make this right and am still freaking out myself.

J finally goes out and apologizes for his mistake and has me finish the transaction which I took 5 dollars off of because that was the highest amount I can take off without a manager. I keep apologizing the whole time. She leaves and again assures me she isn't mad at me.

GM comes in and we tell her everything that happened separately. By this time I am off the register and our primary cashier is back.

GM leaves again but not 10 minutes after that NL's husband comes in. In full police uniform. He is furious and demands to speak with everyone in the store. He yells and screams about how dare we treat his wife like that, totally uncaring of who he is directing his anger at. Now between my nerves from the whole incident and now a very large, very armed man yelling at me and my coworkers I am crying. He points at myself and our primary cashier and demands to know which one is RedHeadedBug. J of course points me out.

I'm terrified and crying so when he lifts up his giant hand and sets it on my shoulder I almost pass out. He tells me that he is sorry he yelled at me and that his wife was very happy with the way I tried to handle things before turning to my manager and tearing into him again. 

He finally leaves and I am seriously wishing I wasn't pregnant so I could go have a cigarette. J doesn't look much better. The whole thing took just over 30 minutes but it felt like hours.

I found out later after talking to one of our other managers that J told GM when she came in that there was no receipt and that NL did not come in with the balls. He also said that the lady threatened him and myself. Apparently he did get in trouble and got a write up for the whole thing but they defended him to our DM when he heard about it. His story totally conflicted with what the customer said which would have been in J's favor had it not been for the fact that my story lined up perfectly with NL's. I got a ""caught in the act"" which meant I got a nifty little multi-tool with a flashlight and a knife on it with out store logo.

madgirlinabox,6,10,1or885,31,"Hey there. So some background, I'm a manager in a plus-size clothing store.

So there was a sales associate who was fairly new and just didn't get things. We'll call her Jessica. She seriously lacked any bit of common sense. The other manager (we'll call her Alana) was working with her, showing her how to fold denim. There was excess, and Alana told her to put the rest in the back. Alana goes to attend to customers, about 10 minutes later realizes she didn't hear Jessica go into the back room (the door is super loud). She goes and asks her what she did with the extra denim, because Alana didn't hear her go in back. Jessica responds ""oh, you meant the back room?"". Dumbass shoved the extra denim behind the other stacks of denim in the wall. Alana had to try so hard not to just straight laugh in her face. 

She was also like hardcore Christian (in a predominantly ~~LDS~~ Mormon state). One of my girls (she'll be Kaylee) said god dammit on a Sunday, and Jessica turns to her and says ""Really Kaylee? On the Lord's day?"" 

She's since been transferred to another store and I heard from her new store manager that she was openly mocking/talking shit on the ~~LDS~~ Mormon religion, while clocked in. Dumb dumb dumb. 

Other shit she did: never taking sensors off clothes, wearing skirts so short we had to have several dress code conversations with her, not processing clothes before putting them out, not to mention she was slower than my granny on a tricycle. So glad she's gone. ",Backstocking Issues,41

ppnguitarist,6,34,1oqtrx,110,"First time poster and all that jazz... So a little background: I work at a fairly large retail pharmacy chain, in the front end so I'm dealing with the actual merchandise and not the drugs. Our company has a policy on shoplifting that says if we don't physically see someone steal something we can't say anything to them, even if we're 100 percent sure they stole.

The story: I'm the manager on duty on a fairly slow night just kinda walking around making sure the store looks straight, everything is pulled forward, etc. So as I'm making my rounds, I see a lady with some teeth whitening strips in her hand, still in the box. I ask if she needed help finding anything and she says no, that she's waiting for a prescription. Ok, that's cool, I continue walking around and sure enough a couple minutes later I see her at the pharmacy counter paying for her script...one problem though...there's no whitening strips in her hand anymore nor are they on the counter. A red flag goes off in my head and I meander back to where they are normally kept. Sure enough, there's an empty box on the shelf behind all the unopened stuff. AHA!! I gotcha!!!......wait.....I can't do anything about it.....or can I? I quickly grab the empty box and take it to the front where the registers are. Now our store's registers are literally right next to the door so you have to walk right next to them to get out. I place the empty box on top of the one closest to the doors and wait. In the meantime I'm apprising the cashier to the situation and just kinda hanging out behind the tills.
Finally I see her. She's not making any kind of eye contact, actually physically avoiding looking at the registers as she beelines for the door. She's on her phone or at least pretending. She wasn't talking or anything as she gets kinda close I say in the most chipper voice I can muster,""Bye, have a great night!!!"" She turns and looks at me. Simultaneously, she sees the emptied box at the register. Her face drops and she practically ran out of the store. I turn to my cashier and we both start laughing. I haven't seen her since.",By the way....I know you took it,144
kaggzz,9,10,1oqqzu,52,"This is a story from my time owning and operating a small Video Game Store.  Since so many of you are posting about thief stories, I thought I'd share a story

My store was in an outdoor mall with a number of great places to eat in it, and the mall backed right in to a high school.  Those high school kids make me fear for my country's future.  Sure some were good, but there were enough there that... well- I was dumb in high school but never THAT dumb.

One day I had on a non-work shirt because I had planned to clean the back room and did not want to dirty my work clothing.  Taking a break, I went out to get a bite at a the nearby Mexican restaurant*.  School was out, and I had been hoping to get my cleaning done before the kids descended like locus on my poor baby, but since I didn't make it in time, I was getting myself lunch and taking a bit of a break.  Some high school kids came in.  Now I worked pretty much every day and I'd say that 90% of the kids know me and who I am, but this group did not I suspect.  We'll label them as *Dumb Kid 1-3* , also for the fact that calling them DK in a story about a video game store makes me happy.

**DK1**:  Dude I went in ta dat game store and I gots me dis 2K! (as in NBA 2K)

**DK2**: But Dumb Kid 1, you ain't got no money!

**DK1**: Yea I grabbed it when dat biatch at the counter wasn't looking!

**DK3**: Yea Dumb Kids, we bad!  We got to go to Chewey's place!  He got the 3!

Chewey is actually a good kid who went to a high school not that far from the store.  He and his dad were both collectors of fine video game and video game accessories, but they ran a side business selling retro gaming stuff on eBay.  When I got something extra special in or had an overstock of retro gold, I'd give them a call.  Chewey is also the reason I only ever ran one Pokemon tournament.*^1

**DK2**:Yea we bad thiefs!

Well they are.  And I've had about enough of them and enough of my awesome Queso dip.

**Kaggzz**: Hey um... so you guys know- You're sitting in front of the owner of that video game shop.  Also it's never a good thing to talk about your criminal exploits in front of others.

**DK3**: Who said we stole anything? 

**DK1**: Yea we ain't saying $#!!~ to you.

**DK2**: Turn around and mind yo own bidnas before we make you!

**Kaggzz**: Probably should also tell you that we don't keep live merchandise on the floor, so you've got an empty box in your lap there as well.

This goes on for a bit before the restaurant owner came by and told the kids that if they didn't return the game, they'd not get served the food they paid for.  The NBA 2K they stole was five years old and worth about $3.  When I had the box in hand, I laughed my ass off and show it to the manager, who is also laughing.  I went to the store and told my assistant Minion about the whole thing.

**AM**: Yea I saw the kid acting all weird but it's not like we have any live product that isn't locked up so I just kept helping the customers we did have.  Did he really try to steal that game?  Isn't it in the BoGo bin outside?

**Kaggzz**: Hey guess it was misplaced inside.  Huh, there's a couple of them here.  Good catch kid!

*TL:DR* - Master criminal steals $3 game and brags about it over chips at the local eatery in front of the store owner.  Master criminal helps find inventory that is out of place.

Shawntae85,13,14,1oqlc5,29,"This aren't exactly ""stories"", but rather a few of the things I'd like to apologize for during my time in retail. The Karma for these things has not yet caught up to me (that I know of), so maybe if I apologize Karma will let bygones be bygones. 

1) I worked for a well known company as a ""Sandwich Artist."" The shift before me had been busy and they did not get to prep for my shift. Among other things, I had no unfrozen chicken patties. I put some in a container, put the container in warm water and prayed no one was in the mood for chicken. About 15 minutes in, a customer wants...you guessed it...chicken. I grab one of the thawing patties, throw it in the microwave (located under the counter which prevents customers from seeing what you're doing) and hope it doesn't turn into chicken jerky. I make her other sandwiches, leaving the dreaded chicken for last. I open up the microwave, thank god, its unfrozen and edible. I grab it out of the microwave, thank the sandwich gods, burn my hand on the hot chicken and drop the it, along with my hopes, on the floor. I couldn't stall for another chicken patty so it was either serve her a frozen one or wipe the floor chicken off and be done with it. Yup. I gave the lady floor chicken. I'm not proud of it, but the manager would have flipped out if a customer complained about us being out of something because of lack of prep, and would have flipped out even more over someone biting into a frozen chicken. It seemed like my best option. So, dear lady who got floor chicken from me in the summer of 99, I'm sorry.

2) Also working as a ""Sandwich Artist"", when I started there was a promotion going on: 3 footlongs for $9.99. This was many moons ago before super fancy automation that would automatically ring up promos, so you had to manually discount each sandwich to give them the promo price. A very nice couple came in, ordered the deal and when I rang it up the total was like $13. The guy hands me cash and his girlfriend stops him, saying that's too much for it to be the right price. I delete the order, ring it up again, same total. The guys says he doesn't care and pays me anyway. I'm sure he felt bad for 14 year old me, first week on the job, looking like a deer in headlights. It dawned on me later that night, but I'd forgotten to give the discount on each sandwich. I will say though, that because of his understanding I've always been very kind to all people working in retail, mistakes happen, it's not always intentional. But to the couple who I over charged and did not bite my head off for it, I am sorry.

3) This last one is not so bad. It kind of depends on how you look at it. Working in fast food, things can get hectic and sometimes you have to make hard choices. There were several occasions where I was trying to get the current car out of my drive-thru but waiting on french fries to be done because we were short. (Like they ordered a large, but we only had enough to fill a medium.) Well, I'd shove a crisscut or two in there to fill up the container and finish it off with the french fries that were ready. Technically, the crisscut costs more, and whenever I get a stray onion ring or crisscut fry in my container, I'm stoked. I'm a fry-french is half full kinda girl. But it was kind of a dick move and for that, I would like to apologize. 

4) Quick one, when I worked drive thru during graveyard hours, I would wait to give people their sodas until the very end because on more than one occasion I had people chug the soda and demand a refill then yell at me when I tell them it was corporate policy to not handle the cup after they'd drank from it. To my thirsty customers who longingly stared at their drinks through the window, I'm a little sorry.

missgray,17,19,1oqj0e,96,"For about four years in high school, I worked at an ice cream place. For a few weeks each summer, we would be contracted by a larger company to work at the local horse track. I always worked at the horse track, and for my last two years, I was in charge of it.  

At the end of everyday, we need to restock from the store in town. This requires someone driving their car to the store, picking up a large van, loading up any good needed for the next day, and driving back to the horse track. This is in August and the van in not refrigerated, so it's a race against time to get the ice cream back to the track. During the off-season, it's a five minute ride, tops. But during racing season, it will easily take 20 minutes. And that day, it was my turn. You can imagine I was pretty aggravated due to traffic and it was a long, very busy day. I was ready to go home and shower and crawl into bed.

Eventually I made it to our stand and I began unloading. This gentleman comes up to me and asks when the chair rental stand next door to us closed. He had some chairs in his hand, so I assumed that he had waited a little too long to return his chairs. (Nice camping chairs too.) I politely apologized, telling him I wasn't really sure, but I thought that the closed shortly after the last race, maybe a half hour or so. That was easily an hour ago. He then asked me, in a very angry tone, ""Well what the hell am I supposed to do with them then? I just lost $40 on these chairs! Maybe I should just stick them up your ass? It's a very nice ass too!"" I gave him the dirtiest stink eye ever, told him that it was incredibly rude and ignored him. He tried to apologize after I had gotten back into the van. He's lucky I didn't hit him.",Well what else am I going to do with it?,115
