methamphetabean,0,1,1r94rl,1,Just a rantI work at an artists market where we sell screen printed baby clothes and Tshirts When we print our shirts we buy wholesale of a certain color and print about  shirts with the same color ink on that bunch of same colored shirts Pretty basic conceptEveryday somebody will ask me if we have the shirt they like in a different color or with different inkI dont understand why people ask me this because if I had that color I would obviously have it out so people can buy it I never think to ask that whenever I am at a store It is one of the most irritating questions because people dont recognize how much labor goes into the hand printed shirts yet they like to go to these kinds of markets so that they can feel unique and artsy,I dont have this tshirt in any other color than the one you are looking at,2

Jasonresno,2,2,1r8zpa,14,After  years of slaving away at a job in retail working my way up to management while I studied and completed school I finally got to put my two week notice in Some background info on where I work We sell supplies that can be utilized for illegal purpose hydroponic gardening supplies and as such I have to deal with a few very particular types of customer The burnout  The guy who has no idea how to do anything but googled How to grow weed and stumbled to my store  inane questions that hell never let you finish before asking another one The experience with this type of customer culminates with him asking where the nearest Taco Bell is The paranoid grower  The guy that thinks there is a cop hiding behind every shelf Wont come in to the store if there are police nearby Wears sunglasses extra hoodies parks behind the store and will only purchase things if I agree to load it out our back exit The hippie  My favorite They know what theyre talking about and as long as you arent prone to headaches via tyedyepretty decent Smelly But decentThe Caller  My least favorite They never show their faces in the store They never purchase anything But they always call my store to ask us to troubleshoot their problems These can range from  minute calls to  minute calls We are instructed to help them no matter what This is where our story beginsSo its my last day of work and Ive been relaxing and laughing with everybody The phone ringsMe M Customer CM Hello this is XXXX How can I help youC Yeah I see this product online Its a XXX Do you have oneIts not something we carry exactly I do have alternativesM No Im sorry sir We dont carry that line of products I do have aC You dont WhatM No sir we dont work with that companyC Seriously You dontM No but I do have an alternative and C Listen kid Ive been buying from you guys for years And every year you have less and less in your store Why are you even open if you dont have what I wantIm taken aback and instantly angry Ive gotten to the point where I dont react well to rude customers on the phoneM Due to a number of economic reasons weve focused more on products that are already popular in our market and tightening our shelves It helps small companies like us stay competitiveC Really Really So youre telling me you just sell garbageI pause in disbelief and just wait The man is silent tooM Is there anything else I can help you withInstantly angry he respondsC Apparently not since all you sell is trash Really can you evenAnd then Im pretty much seeing red and I interrupt him Sarcasm so thick I almost choked on itM Yep Youre right sir All we sell at my store is garbage Nothing useful just trash Thanks for calling and please dont call backAnd then I hung up Went over to my manager explained what happened and that was that My boss didnt care Im done there Feels good,So you guys pretty much only sell garbage now right or how I happily chewed out a customer on my last day of work,16
Sapphires,5,5,1r8o2i,26,I work the jewelry counter at a department store  Were a standalone store and more low end than some of the other department stores at the mall across town  We dont actually sell that much fine jewelry  I spend most of my shift straightening clothes and helping in layaway   We wear radios and the jewelry counter is near the service desk so they just call me up when I have a customerOkay so the other night Im closing  I hadnt actually been there more than  minutes when I get my first jerky jewelry customer  An old lady is standing at the counter holding a ziplock bag with an old looking watch in it  The watch has a leather band that looks like its just disintegrated and fallen off of the watchMy first thought is that she wants to pick out a new watch band to math the old one as closely as possible  I can do that  I am prepared to start showing them to herNope  She asks if I can put a band on the watchWe cant  We dont do any jewelry repairs in the store  We dont have the tools or the training or the coverage   Were low end and our jewelry counter is almost an afterthought and definitely not one of our most oftshopped areasI personally would be down to try doing it technically I know how but were not allowed  Its a liability issue  And I can see why  If an employee were to try and then fuck up and break the item the company would have to really kiss the customers ass in order to dissuade any legal actionSo I explain to the woman that we sell bands but cant install them  She is not actually very jerky and goes on her wayNEXT  Id say this was about  minutes later  I get called to the jewelry counter again  This time there are two customers waiting  An older woman and a middle aged man  Theyre not together so I kind of look from one to the other to try to figure out who was first  The man indicates for me to help the woman firstMe  Hi what can I do for you  Woman  I need my watch battery changed  Me  Oh Im sorry  We cant do that here  Woman  sour face You cant do that  Me  We dont have any tools to take the watch apart and we dont install watch batteries or repair jewelry at this store  Woman  Since when  You used to  Ah the dreaded you used to  My particular store asbestos and all no seriously we have a notice in our back room about how the floor tiles are made of asbestos so dont go snorting them or anything is forty years old  The company has had its ups and downs and changed in all kinds of ways over the years  You cant expect a store to stay the same forever  I dont know when my store stopped changing watch batteries but I know that it was some time before I started working there Me  We havent done it since Ive been working hereWoman  Well where am I supposed to goMe  Youd probably have to go to a jewelry store  I dont know if big box superstore that we all love to hate does it anymore either  Woman  You cant change my battery and you cant even tell me where I can get it done other than a jewelry store  Me  Im so sorryWoman  You spend  on a watch and it runs down after a year  What am I supposed to do just buy a new one every yearI attempt to repeat that a jewelry store would be more than happy to fix her watch  Woman is not listening she mutters that this is ridiculous and leaves  I turn to help the man  He has our weekly sales ad and is looking for a particular ring shown in it  I start looking through the diamond ring case which is particularly full right now and cannot spot it anywhere  Hmm  I start to explain that sometimes not every store getssells every item shown in the ad since the same ad is released across the whole country but I keep looking for the ringAnd then I see my daytime jewelry coworker who has already ended her shift and is on her way out the door  I flag her down and ask if we have that ringwhere it is  Bad news  They only sent us one and she already sold it earlier that day  AND its not even orderable because it was discontinued hence why it was on sale  Man is not amused and turns to leaveThe rest of my night goes fairly uneventfully  Until almost the end  I happen to be going by the counter when I spotted a couple around my age late s looking at the clearance jewelry case  So I stop and ask if theyd like to look at somethingMan  Actually I need to get a battery put in my watch  he holds up a small tin presumably containing his watch  Me  Oh we cant actually install watch batteries here  We dont have any tools to do so  Man  But do you sell batteries  Me  Yes they have some at the electronics counter  But we cant install them for you  Man  Okay thanks  And then they went off toward electronics and I went back to what I was doing  About ten minutes later the guy running electronics gets on the radio and asks if we have a screwdriver or something at the jewelry counter to get the back off of a watchI felt like screaming  I just told that guy that we couldnt do it  Fortunately my manager gets on the radio and says No we dont  And we cant install watch batteries hereBut apparently this guy was adamant about not leaving the store until he got his watch battery installed  I sat and quietly fumed while my manager and the electronics guy went back and forth talking about screwdrivers for a good  minutes  My manager asked the woman at the service desk if there are any small screwdrivers up there  There werent  And finally everybody relented and electronics guy basically told the guy the only way he was going to get a screwdriver out of us if he went to the hardware section and bought oneTLDR  No we DO NOT install watch batteries here  And when I tell you that we do not have the tools to do so dont go ask the guy at electronics,Do you have a screwdriver  Tales from the jewelry counter,31
phantommusic,0,5,1r8l8x,23,So Ive posted on this sub before about when I worked at a cajun restaurant  but this fine tale hails from my days at an accessory shop at my local mallAt this store  there are TONS of tiny little items earrings bracelets ect That tend to go missing pretty often but its to be expected as the store is so small and under staffed there is no way to keep it from happening You know those mirrors of the ceiling that some people idiots think are hat mirrors Nope Shoplifting mirrors And on this day I may have seen the funniest attempt at shoplifting ever This pair of kids walk in one looks  the other maybe  and they browse for a bit while the older one eats an ice cream cone Well manager and I are standing at the register and I happen to look up into one of the mirrors and see this girl hiding earrings in her ICE CREAM I poke my manager and we can barely hold in our laughter as we call mall security Of course when she gets caught she pretends to not speak english and begins to SCARF down that ice cream  He stops her calls her mom who comes in SCREAMING at her in perfect english and makes her spit out those earrings We only got  out of  back She can keep the last oneTL DR girl hides jewelry in ice cream becomes human earring dispenser a week later,That looks like some yummy ice cream,28
Fixer,3,3,1r8gem,45,BackgroundI work at a popular electronicsappliance store as a Computer amp Tablets Sales Consultant I love my job However we get our fair share of nasty customers Yesterday I approached a man and did my normal greeting Asked him how he was doing if he had any questions on the tablets ect He asked me about some of the tablets and I showed him our selection I found out the tablet would be for his wife whose birthday is tomorrow Oh boy  I thoughtThe Nook HD Tablet caught his eye because of its relatively low price  for the size of the tablet I explained to him the pros and cons of buying a Nook but he didnt seem interested I inquired about his wifes smartphone and learned she had an LG android phone I reccomended a full Android based tablet so she could easily get used to the system and carry over all of her apps The guy basically ignored me and said no I want thisMe Alright sir let me go make sure I have one of these in stock as far as I know we only have a couple of the  GB models left which are about  dollars more In the mean time you can look at a few of the cases ectHe said something along the lines of Well you BETTER have it Otherwise you can give me the displayMe Im sorry sir these display tablets are demo models and do not have the full functionality of the real onesAt this point he just gave me a really bizarre confused look I head to the lock up cages and to my expectations we are out of the  GB model But being the incredible employee that I am I go above and beyond to check the stock of local stores None Every store on this side of the state is out I check to see if we can order it in from one of our various ordering reserving systems Negative The item is deleted which means we wont be getting any more in I return to the man with the bad news and offer to show him some of the other comparable tablets or to get him the GB model He becomes aggressive instantlyIf you dont have any why is it out on display I want this one I need it for my wifeMe Im sorry sir but we just recently sold out of them and are waiting on a vendor to take the display down besides we still have the GB model Man Well you better give me the  for this price Im not paying any extraAt this point i offer to go get my supervisor and the man accepts I call my supervisor up the front and give him the rundown At this point I dont interact with the customer again Apparently my supervisor went up to him and restated everything I said He Being the awesome supervisor he is refused to give the man the item for the cheaper price saying Sir its mid November we cannot possibly keep stock of everything that we have on displayAccording to my Sup the man said nothing but Ill be back and walked out of the store Im not sure when he will be back but I hope he isnt as big of an asshole next time,Ill be back,48

a girlfriend Finding one has been difficult On the few occasions I managed to work up the courage to ask a girl on a date I was rejected And do you know what is NOT helping My work uniform Black slacks white buttonup red apron and a black clipon bow tie I look like a butler than go dressed in the dark so he accidentally took his kids church bow tie and his wifes apronIt is the day before my junior year of high school starts grade  and Im bagging groceries Its Labor Day so Im constantly confronted with happy people buying food for cookouts and beer for well cook outs I desperately do not want to be hereA small order begins its crawl down the belt toward me side note I believe there is a correlation between the number of feet of conveyor belts at any location and their effect on wages Anyhow I start loading up bags when I hear my nameHey are you unminedI look up and see that a customer is talking to me Shes my age Pretty Really long brown straight hair Deep brown eyes that seemed a

first time someone my age has every started a conversation with me at the store and yeah is all I can manageIm Elizabeth I go to school with a couple of your friends at other high school in the areaThats cool I have no idea who she is talking about but I learn later it was a good friend Ive known since elementary schoolYou working all day todayYeah It kinda sucks since we go back tomorrowBummer Were having a pool party You could have comeNow Im really depressed Pool party with cute girl who voluntarily talks to me and Im here I get wrapped up with another irritation that I forget Im totally scared of talking to girlsI wish I could I hope youre having a good timeIts good My parent are there but they are staying out of the wayWell maybe we can do something next week Oh shit did that just come out of my mouth Not only to cute stranger girl but in front of my fellow employees who may or may not be listeningTotally You have a penYes Yes I do I pluck one from my pocket and hand it to her Im both elated and suspicious This does not happen to me Ever Murphys Law looms in my mind so I halfexpect to be stabbed in the next with the penInstead she writes her name on number on a paper bag and hands it to meCall me Well set something upGreat thanksSee you later She takes her bags and leaves the storeI sneak back to the break room and sit for a few minutes I want to hyperventilate My mind resolves to thinking its all going to lead to disappointmentMy name is called over the PA in an obvious attempt to get me back to work So I head to the front of the store and bag awayIt takes me two days to buildup the courage to call her She agrees to dinner and a movie on Friday I get someone at work to cover my shift Im feeling moreandmore like this is going to happenThat Friday may have been the slowest day to arrive in my life But the evening rolls around and I get ready for the date Im so nervous that I sneak a half of Xanax from my moms stash dont do drugs kids It takes the edge off so I head out to pick up my dateWhen she answers the door shes just a pretty as I remember herOur conversations over the course of these evening are a blur Yet they were unforced and natural Very few awkward silences Not at all what I expectedIn the dark of the movie theater I reached out and held her hand She gladly took it and leaned into my shoulder Thankfully the movie still had an hour to go because I would not have been able to stand at that momentWhen I pulled up to her house at the end of the evening she said Im bummed This went by took quicklyIt has I saidMy heart was hammering I could barely hear over the racket it was making in my chest The rest of my body felt like I was being propelled into herOn instinct I reached out and stroked her hair I pulled her in and kissed herMy first kissOver the next two years Elizabeth would play various parts in my life First girlfriend First homecoming date first breakup first reconciliation Another breakup or two Even the first friend I saw drive off to college in another stateElizabeth is now long gone I think back on her with equal parts of affection and sadness But I will never regret the time we had togetherSo TFR  next week is Thanksgiving here in America I thought Id give the day an homage by noting that even shit jobs can sometimes bring a small measure of joy even if its indirect Bagging groceries brought me Elizabeth She in turn opened up a world I never had access to The job is gone and so is the girl but both their good and bad are part of who I am nowHave a great weekendIll get

AAEmmerson,64,64,1r7jes,485,Okay so I used to work in a little coffee and sandwich shop in a British airport It was past security clearance so only those flying could attend When I got the job I thought id be dealing with lots of happy people going on holiday Boy was I wrongThe story that really sticks in mind though is that we used to serve bacon mezzalunas Which is a weird half moon flat bread a bit like a taco shape They were about   but thats because they were good quality and you were a captured audience with no where else to go So one day a guy came up and he asked me to grill  of these sandwiches hes tall like really tall So I do him the  and start plating them on his tray hes waiting for So  in he picks one up and goes errr whats this inside  I reply its a sunblushed tomato sauce sir trying to be as polite as possible Well you didnt tell me it had that in I dont want these anymore I apologise and take them off his tray but I do point to at least  signs with descriptions of exactly what they areAt this point Ive put them on the back counter ready to be binned as we cant serve them again and I ring up his order   and put the sandwiches in bin Just as he sees me do that he goes actually you know what I will have three so inwardly sighing I cook him another  off  Get them all plated ring them up he then decides actually I only want two so I cant take it off the order without my manager so I shout for him hes this little Indian dude quiet as a mouse and only ft  and explain to him the problem Turns out hed been listening in the whole time when the customer starts getting shirty about the time its taken my manager lets ripDo you know how many of these sandwiches you have now wasted you are ridiculous and you shouldnt be rude to my staff new policy you ether pay for ALL  sandwiches or you leave my cafe With this the guy looks fairly shocked but starts shouting back and starts causing a commotion so everyone in the airport is looking at him When the guy finally calls my boss a fucking useless piece of shit without breaking stride my manger jumps over the counter and marches straight over to the security team The guy is still hollering and screaming at my manager from the spot when the security team arrives and literally drag him out of the secure area with his poor family in tow and have him thrown off his flight No idea where he was going  but was never so proud of my manager at that point All for a bacon sandwichTLDR Man wastes lots of grilled sandwiches starts cussing us out we get him thrown of his flight for aggressive behavior All for a bacon sandwich Edit American dollars corrected,Thrown out of the airport  all for a bacon sandwich,549
themonkeyone,33,40,1r7frc,213,So I am not sure if this belong is this sub or not but I feel the need to include it  This incident recalls the moment I finally decided to quit my old job and find a new oneSo here is the set up  I have worked as a maintenance associate which is just a fancy word for janitor  for this large retail store for  years now  I completely hate my job it makes me miserable the people I work with annoy me the managers dont care about me as an employee and the customers hate me since I am keeping them from using the bathroom while I try to clean them twice during my shift  Now most people just ignore my sign telling them to not use the restroom while it is being cleaned and there is a second restroom in the back  It is annoying but oh well  However on this day it was a much different type of customerThis happened on a Tuesday  I remember this because Tuesdays that quarter were when I had to go straight from my college classes to work  School that day had already annoyed me and left me in a bad mood and work was not helping  I start my day with the usual routine cleaning the restrooms  Now this day like most others someone decides to ignore my signs and come in anyways  However this guy is different then most guys as the entire time he is ranting about how unfair it is that I am trying to keep him from using the bathroom how much I suck how stupid I am ect ect all while he is using the toilet  I try to ignore it it comes with the job after all  He finally finishes and I go to clean the stall he was using only to hear him remark now you have a real mess to clean up  I llok into the stall to see that this guy has wiped his feces all over the toilet seat  he continues to mock me about it while he washes his hands and I just stand there in disbelief which start turning into rage  Like the title says  I was very sorely tempted to beat this guy over the head with my mop handle  It passed quickly however I just stood in the bathroom for a good  minutes trying to figure out why I just did not walk out at that very moment  After that day I started looking for a new job  Which I found and am much happier at for the most part  Sure I still have stupid customers and stupid coworkers but I am doing something I love so it is worth it,The one time I almost assaulted a customer,253

had a customer today that made me walk away for the first time and I thought that maybe youd appreciate what I did and maybe you could learn how to deal with this kindve thing  So Angry Lady comes in AL about five pm asking if we pricematch  From the way she was asking she obviously knew we did indeed pricematch other competitors and Id definitely seen her in the store before  Me Absolutely miss did you want me to see if I have something in stock for youAL Yes your Samsung  smart tv Its on for  at Lamewad other store on the other side of townMe Ok well Ill just pull it up on our website here and print off the price for you one secondNow our computers are running a windows so old well I guess Im not funny enough for some comparive humour  Our computers are old and clunky and take long periods of time inbetween inputs just to decide if they like the way you clicked somethingAs were loading through the Lamewad website they list no television fitting the criteria  This is after five minutes of Oh my god I went through this last time you guys are terrible I show her the other Samsung  the nonsmart version going for  on their website and she angrily just says no before insisting I open Lamewads flyerI gladly open the flyer finding indeed the same television without smart advertised for   I point this out again I get a No before AL points above the tv at a different model An LG and says THAT tv  That ones smartWell I point out that the television is listed at  and that we dont actually carry LGThis puts her into a silent anger and she just turns and walks away  I as mandated by my company say Have a nice evening before forgetting about the whole thingCUE many hours later about  pm when we get called to go outside  Now when this happens its because our LP Loss Prevention Security Officer has pursued somebody out of the store and were to go outside and just stand there for visual support  Getting outside after everybody I find LP on top of a girl screaming and yelling to her friend telling her friend to take her stuff while LP yells not to let her take it and sure enough one of our staff goes and grabs the little pink box from the girls purse and holds onto it for LP  Now after some minutes weve got a large van coming  LP is in the middle of our little road but he cant move this girl shes flailing and screaming not letting him cuff her Anyway Large Van drives right up to about  feet away from about  employees all standing in full white shirt and tie and honks her horn repeatedly  Our manager proceeds to hold up her hand asking the van to wait or to just turn left and go around  Who gets out of the van but AL  GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER YOU ASSHOLE ARE YOU TRYING TO RAPE HER  SOMEBODY STOP HER YOU employeesAt this our manager tells everybody else but her and LP to go inside the police are now audible coming in a very fast way  We all do and sure enough coming in  seconds after myself is ALI found the ad now you HAVE to price matchShe indeed whips out a printed ad from a competitor and I start processing the paperwork  During this I notice our inventory is out one so I dont actually have a boxed unit for sale I let her know this and she does that LOVELY derisive chuckle Man you guys really have no idea what youre doing the last time you couldnt find my tv eitherTo this I apologize let her know thats unfortunate but that Id be happy to get a tv in within a few days after purchase So at this point as Im walking away grabbing more paperwork I ask Awesome Coworker AC if shes able to intercede  Im starting to get hot under the collar and I want to distance myselfAC replies that shed be happy to so as we both walk back to AL I hear AL talking to another customer in our store Oh god you shouldve seen it he had his hands all over her it was brutal  God I dont know if Ill shop her again their security seems so violent etc etcI shrug it off but it stings a bit  Our LP is a contracted service theyre not a part of our company and theyre some of the nicest guys Ive ever met  The one in particular is a little  guy hes new and hes got a lisp  Now because they dont work for our company this means weve never had to worry about them reporting us to managers or such so any strictly noncorporate actions go over easy  Nice guys I play video games with quite a few of themAnyway so at the till just as Im clearing everything for AC miss AL turns to me and stares me down as she says I hope you feel safe here and I hope the police watch the video on your cameras your LP was completely outve line and violentI was done now  I didnt respond  AC saw and she immediately said Oh Foliagus would you like to go speak with COMPUTERS EMPLOYEE he said he wanted to see youI nod say Enjoy your evening miss and walk awayI hid until she was gone and I was commended for the calm manner I showed in the face of what I found out is a disreputable repeating customer  Thank god for my coworkers she was just poking me over and over againAnyway so I find out later the girl outside  Crack dealer  The little pink box  Full of crack and needles  She was so crazy because she was desperately trying to get her friend to pick up the evidence before the cops arrivedThanks for listening TFR you guys keep me saneTLDR  I singlehandidly rescued a hostage victim from a man strung out on compressed air before selling  dollars of merchandise at  margin

partinobodycular,14,6,1r701h,33,Im an assistant manager at a shoe store with a free rewards program You get  points for every dollar you spend and every  points gets you a  off certificate One of my associates A had just signed up a customer who was leaving the country the next day and I guess wanted to take shoes for everyone back home The customer ended up spending about  Normally the points are added to the account when we close the registers at the end of the day and it can take a couple of weeks to actually see your certificate But since this girl was leaving I did some quick math and gave her  off After she left I pulled A aside to show her how to fill out a points adjustment form so we could email customer service and say Hey we already honored a bunch of these points so you can deduct them A is fairly new  I think she started in September She was kind of a slow learner but is pretty good now Most of the timePart of the form is to explain how many points need to be addeddeducted and why so I asked out loud how many points would get you  off I could have figured it out in my head but hey this was a teaching moment I was lazy and wanted to see if A could figure it out so I wouldnt have to Turns out she didnt know how many points it takes to get a certificate Okay this is kind of Rewards  I ask a few more questions to see what she does know Turns out she also doesnt know details about how points are earned This is really basic stuff Any customer could ask her these questions at any time So I give her a quick rundown and then toss an easy one her wayHow many dollars do you have to spend to get  points She doesnt know Im getting frustrated so I grab some paper and write it down thinking thatll help her see how simple it is  points per dollar how many dollars for  points All you have to do is divide  by  but A cant do it Shes starting to get a blank look and I realize I need to back off I believe she has the capability to solve this question but shes shutting down I feed her the numbers she absolutely needs to know and let her goA few minutes later its time for As fifteen so I look around to see where shes gone to I dont see her on the floor Im starting to get a bad feeling I ask her friend C if she knows where A is and C says shes in the bathroom Something about the way she says it makes me think this is not a call of nature I started worrying that I had been too harsh and that A was now crying in the bathroom Id never made an associate cry before I watch for A to come back out onto the floor and the longer I wait the worse Im feeling Finally I see her come out and she looks composed I wait a minute to give her some space  I dont want to pounce on her the minute she comes back out  and then head over to see if shes okay and tell her to go on her fifteen She says shes already gone so I guess she decided to take advantage of her break to settle down Fair enough though I would have given her time to calm down before taking her break She mentions that she felt too much pressure and then says that B the main cashier had laughed at her This is kind of unsurprising B is one of our biggest troublemakers I have plenty of other stories to tell about B but Ill save them for another nightTLDR Made an associate feel stupid To be fair she was being stupid,Basic skills are hard to grasp,39

ToniCipriani,9,3,1r6mbw,28,This isnt so much a tale as it is something Ive been curious to hear some other opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of chain vs independent I work for a small independent cornerliquor store but the owner and his brothers have a few other small grocery stores and liquor shops in the areaI have worked for retail chains too namely a major electronic retailer in the US and a major drug store chain  Some pros Ive been noticing are that working for an independent storeMuch more laid back on certain things have to look presentable but otherwise I can wear what I please Certain customers who the owner has known for awhile have tabs when they are short on moneySmaller obviously so alot less customers in the store at once which makes it alot less stressful I tend to find the atmosphere more pleasant I try my best to go above and beyond but its more of a social and friendly vibe with workers and customers Dont have to worry about things like returns etcI  get to know customers on a more personal basis since alot of the same people frequent the shop I get paid in cash weekly instead of a check every two weeksA few cons Ive picked up onThe owner is a bit cheap when it comes to certain things like a leak in the back cooler which his solution for is a bucket  which needs to be emptied every  days pretty muchNo benefits like health coverage or anythingNo holidays off only  people work in the store other than the manager and owner so the hours are pretty set in stoneRealistically speaking I probably have alot less job security  I have a  really positive relationship with both the manager and owner and feel Im well liked but I ever made a huge mistake that made them really upset or even if they decided they wanted to cut down on people working for them I very well could get let go instantly My work doesnt have things like write ups its what the owner wants at the end of the day This is hypothetical since I get along well with everyone at the shop but if I was having a problem with someone else working there especially those who have been working there longer than I have Id probably have to either ignore it or leave people close to the owner are essentially untouchable Id imagine Most retail chains if they are under good management would likely try to take some sort of action for conflict mediation I would hope ,Pros and cons for working in a small local business over a retail chain,31

ixiduffixi,4,2,1r5xvj,18,So I was reading through another users lot stories today and was reminded of one of my own In my teenage years my first job was working for the blue vest mafia My job description was something along the lines of Customer Service Specialist which amounted to cart pusher cashier stockman and basic maintenance Eventually I also took up duties as an overnight unloader This tale involves one of those nights When I worked on unloading my shift started at  pm We would unloaded trucks piece by piece and any pallets of merchandise was left on the truck to be unloaded later and moved to an attached warehouse The typical protocol was to have one unloader use a pallet lift to move the merch to the outside dock where it would be taken by the Forktruck driver and driven around the building to the warehouse There another employee would be waiting with another pallet lift to move them inside The reason for this is the warehouse entrance was also on the store entrances sidewalk This meant that during these times one or two parking spots would be blocked off using upturned shopping carts so that the forktruck could reach the warehouse door This most commonly took place during store hours Not all of them are hrs Any way on to the storyOne day I had the responsibility of moving the pallets off of the truck and on to the back dock This had been going smoothly for the better part of an hour Then the forktruck didnt return I stood waiting at the back dock for almost half an hour and eventually decided to go see if there was any help needed in the warehouse When I got around I found the forktruck parked in the middle of the lot with no driver in sight I went to the warehouse entrance and found a crushed shopping cart lying on its side in one of the unused parking spots we had marked off The warehouse was locked and no one was around so I went back inside to find where everyone had gone I found my direct manager and my coworker standing at the front desk with the store manager and a very angry customer They had apparently been talking for quite some time because by the time I got there the conversation was already ending and the manager escorted the customer to the back office When I asked what happened my coworker got very very upset To the point of cursing in the middle of the checkout area What had happened was that the customer had intentionally ran through the shopping cart blockade while my coworker was there trying to wave him down The customer had driven into the cart so hard it had actually thrown it up over the sidewalk and through the warehouse entrance Then he started claiming that it was our faults and the company was going to pay for it I found out later that they had and we had to change the unloading policies to only operate the forktruck after store hoursBONUS STORYAnother tale of the blue vest mafia One night I entered the restroom and saw a young man slowly washing his hands in the sink giggling while his friend was in the stall also giggling I took my time using the restroom waiting them out which eventually worked While I waited I heard packages being ripped open and plastic being shoved into something After they left I entered the stall and found open packages for cold remedies sinus medication and dvds I called the store manager and he looked on the security cameras The kids took off in a dead sprint as soon as they left the bathroom and didnt stop until they were well outside We called the police and the officer stated that he actually knew one of the kids ,A Lot Of Stories Today,20

meguriau,17,22,1r5sy8,150,Hi TFR Im back My thesis has been officially submitted defended had an existential crisis and have recovered from all the irregulat sleeping patterns and physiological symptoms associated with caffeine excess Its been a long time but here is another instalment of Tales from a Hat Boutique httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailsearchqmeguriauamprestrictsronampsortnewamptall This one has been in the works for a little while for a number of reasons  Im afraid of long walls of text and procrastinate and  I wasnt sure if it was clear enough  I should probably mention that I simplified the title of this series for simplicity but the brand also releases a line of bags for its springsummer SS and autumnwinter AW collections As such I will refer to the store as HB for hat and bag storeBackgroundTwo years ago I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals The majority of the customers Ive had have been pleasant however there have been interesting characters and even a few nasty pieces of work discontent customers that have come by This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this timeStoryTodays story describes the customer who left her mark on our generous reservation guideline and jaded my view of customers in retail Most large designer stores have a limit to the number of days you can keep an item on hold As a small store catering towards a large overseas market we were much more flexible and allowed customers to reserve an item for several months before their arrival in Australia sometimes up to a year without regular contact from the store The length of time was purely due to the fact that not all of the collection is available overseas and the slightly lower prices after taking the tax refund system into account which made shopping at our store more appealingThe extended reservation period was also available to locals Yes they could keep an item on hold for months as long as they let us know in advance eg I am on holiday and wont be back for a month or I live interstate but will be visiting in two months time For others we typically allowed them a reserve period of up to a month without any calls however the time period was dependent on the popularity of an item This guide worked simply because  the exact details of the reservation system are unknown to customers which gives us a lot of leeway on how to implement it and   locals for the past  years in addition to having common sense never left an item for longer than one week at most and answeredreturned their calls when we tried to confirm the reserve status As I alluded to but didnt really explain explicitly in previous stories summer at a hat boutique is the busiest season of the year To give you the scale of how frantic it can be sometimes the three months of summer alone can generate up to a third of the revenue for the year Now the head office of this brand is not known for making clever decisions with regard to production Even though we as staff members of the flagship store put more consideration in what wider range of items would be popular next season and request stock accordingly the preferences of the larger department stores skew what management puts into production Due to managements lack of foresight many of our popular products run out of stock before the season ends which tends to lead to much customer dramaThis story comes to you from the calm after the storm of one summer afternoon The end of the season was nigh and we had hit a record number of sales The boss had gone home and the only sound to disrupt the peace was the persistent ring of the phone behind the desk Slouching in the chair bracing myself for another demanding customer I was surprised to be greeted by a friendly voice We will dub the lady behind this voice DF for deceptively friendlyM Good afternoon HB store Meguriau speakingDF Oh hello Im looking to keep something reserved for a friend Would you have it in stock Its called B in the Natural colour from your SS collection M We do have one of those in stock When were you next able to come byDF Ill be in on the weekendM That sounds perfect If I could just take down your name and contact details well see you thenThis particular backpack was a  masterpiece Its craftsmanship gave off a casual yet stylish vibe and it caught the attention of every woman who came by the store The product only remained on shelves for three days at most before it found its way to a new home It was fantastic that it sold well however my manager had not been able to gauge the level of interest people would have in the item and nor did department stores As a result there were only three more B bags left over in the world at this point in time Despite the high demand for the item the weekend was only two days away so we didnt give it much more thought before reserving two other bags remaining at the warehouse The following weekend had come and gone with no sign of DF My manger figured we could hold it out for another week before deciding what to do Perhaps she was sick busy with work lost her phone In any case I left her a message offering to hold it for an extra weekAnother weekend another message and again no DF This time we let her know in no uncertain terms that this item was going back on display and to give us a call if she was still interested in this item We figured that if she called we could put the item back on hold and if not we could still have a new one brought in on the next delivery date A few days later the bag found its way into the possession of a lovely Japanese lady and DF was still not to be found It couldnt have been minutes after the transaction when the sensor sounded marking the arrival of a smartly dressed middle age woman Bright smile spreading from ear to ear it soon became apparent this customer was DFM Hi there Is there anything I can help you withDF I called in to reserve B bag for a friend Could I take a lookM Im sorry unfortunately we have taken this item off hold The warehouse shows up as having two more left in stock so we will be sure to have this item available for you by next week at the latest DF Thats preposterous It was on hold I wanted to see the dimensionsI proceeded to exhaust all possible ways of explaining to her that we did not have any others in store at the moment apart from telling her that I was not Hogwarts trained and could not simply conjure a replica bag for her to examineM Im afraid thats the most I can do for you at this point in time Well again give you a call when the bag arrives and if you could phone us before coming in that would be fantasticAll in all she appeared to back down and with an expression visibly forced DF mumbled something under her breath and sauntered out of the storeFrom that point on it felt as though DF was engaging in some form of petty revenge The same nonresponsive pattern ensued even after the bag had arrived and on hold This time the manager was determined to keep the bag until DF arrived Days extended into weeks and almost months until the manager had had enough She was by no means an impatient person however in this time the other B bag had already made its way into the hands of another customer so this bag was the last one available in the world and was spending its days hiding away in a cupboard The manager had reached breaking pointManager I CANT BELIEVE THE NERVE OF THIS WOMAN I RUN A BUSINESS NOT A STORAGE CENTRE IF YOU CANT GET A  DEPOSIT FROM HER PUT IT BACK ON DISPLAY SHE DOESNT DESERVE THE BAGAfter she calmed down she asked me to phone DF and let her know that we would keep the bag up until the weekend at the latest and if she would like an extension to please contact usOf course we had no such luck It was now Monday and had been no sign of DF Almost an hour after opening a customer phoned in from Japan for the B bag and it had now been packaged and ready to be posted Shortly after the sensor sounded It  was DF and mildly frustrated does not even begin to describe the response when I told her we were completely out of stock She was absolutely belligerentDF THE BAG IS SOLD OUT SOLD OUT HOW DARE YOU M Im terribly sorry but we had informed you that we would only extend the reservation period if youd left us a messaDF MY HUSBAND WAS HOSPITALISED YESTERDAY SO I COULDNT CALL M Im sorry to hear of your husbands illDF YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO SELL IT I ALREADY BLOODY OWN IT Unable to refer her elsewhere the rest of the morning was spent attempting to placate DF as she drove away potential customers and attracted a small gawking crowd Lets just say that animal taming was not a skill set I invested many points into On my own with no manager to back me up I soon realised that nothing I could do would calm her down and ultimately gave up letting her rage and rant Once she left she left for good and I have never crossed paths with her sinceFollowing this incident a new policy was set in place immediately Overseas customers are still be able to place extended holds on items regardless of their popularity however now it is not automatically true for locals Customers that dont need to cross a state line to get to the store can only keep an item on hold for a week however they were required to check in with us if they are unable to come by Of course there are a few exceptions to the rule but I guess thats retail Extra information for

dogfacegremlin,6,9,1r5qvo,87,BackgroundAnother post on here about shoplifting brought a flood of memories from when I used to work at a big box retail store I worked my way through college and have some very fond memories but some very crazy ones as well This is one of my favoritesI never worked Loss Prevention but was always called up during times of potential thefts The reason being is that contact had to be made with the perp from the time of the incident to the time they left the store  of the time Story timeIt was a few months after being hired I was called on a code blue potential theft I loved these so I rush up front and assume the position around the LP area with the camera I see a gentleman standing by the CD rack looking over the merchandise He looks shifty looks around puts his back to the camera and in a very swift moment turns right to the camera lifts up his shirt and deposits a CD into his pants In full view of the camera He does the same action another  times and proceeds to the exitAs expected we stop him and ask him to come into the LP office He doesnt argue or put up a fight just goes directly to the room with his head held low We ask him to remove the CDs and he does no problems From the beginning of the process I noticed that I knew him We went to HS together not a bright guy and we didnt hang in the same circles but we each saw each other in the halls He finally looks at me closely and it hits him that he knows me He verifies that I am that I am Dogfacegremlin and I say yes Then he asks very candidly if we got him good I smile say yes and show him the video Hes dumbfounded that hes basically showing the camera his theft and remarks that he shouldve done it the other way I laugh it offA few years later same numb nuts went to jail for robbing a bank Asked a buddy for ride to the bank came back to the car crazy asking him to drive Driver noped that idea and just sat there till the cops cameSmarty pants got busted for several other bank robberies because he left the bank bags from previous robberies in his roomTLDR  Caught a guy from my HS stealing asked me if we got him good showed him his theft video Year later same dude busted robbing a bank,Dumbest Thief Ever,96

AdriValkyrie,39,20,1r5ewi,64,I work in a restaurant in a fairly rich town in the suburbs of a large city and for some reason people feel entitled to make that comment to me all the time Im a rather short  and slim girl so I definitely do not give off a strong vibe I am much more so than most people think though that type of job definitely can keep you in shape Most of the time its older customers who seem almost worried for me as in a are you sure thats not too heavy for you when Im clearing off a table Yes I can otherwise I would not be carrying all of this that would be silly I appreciate the concern but no need to make commentsBut every once in a while its very condescending An example of this is when there were a couple of guys sitting at the bar when I went up to make a drink There was no more ice in the sink so I lifted up one of the ice buckets that are rather big that we keep nearby and poured them into the sink to then make said drinkOne of the two guys sitting at the bar looks at me while Im lifting it and says You shouldnt do that Youre a girl Youre not nearly strong enough to do that I just stared at him then proceeded to dump the ice in the sink and walked away while he looked stunned His friend on the other hand started shaking his head embarrassed by his friendI just want to know how people think this is ok Seriously making comments about whether or not I can do my job is not cool and please dont throw in sexist remarks eitherJust as commenting about my weight is not acceptable either Would you comment about the fact that someone was overweight No you would not So please dont comment on me eitherI just needed to rant a little because this happens way more often than it should and Im getting sick of it Does this happen to any of you as well,Youre not strong enough for that,84

delivery finance and computer geekdom Where will we go today  Today is groceries Shall we begin props to uFrenchington for sharing his lot story earlier todayThe parking lot My coworkers hated getting cart duty I enjoyed it Id much rather be outside and moving around than inside and lashed to a checkstandBut the parking lot is perilous I learned this from three different perspectives As a bag boy I could clearly see the damage caused by errant carts Later in life at the financial company I would hear clients tell stories of epic accidents in lots and see the resulting figures for the damage average damage in the lot used to be  with the most frequent cause being backing Lastly as a driver my first accident happened when a driver backed right into my car as I was driving along minding my own business But it happens Thats why we have insuranceHere are a few stories from the lotHIT AND RUN Nice warm San Diego night A smattering of carts on the lot Not many customers insideEnter a large Cadillac its a land yacht Its being driven by a senior citizen and she falls squarely into the QTip category Small white and sporting a moderate seniorfrizz of puffy white hairShe should not be driving anything The Caddy might protect her but its a lethal weapon to anyone elseThe driver rolls past me and anglesin to a good spot near the entrance to the store But she fails to hit the breaks and manages to smash into another car She backsup slightly and rips the number off of a relatively new HondaShe pauses looks around and stars backing again Damn shes going to run I have noting to write with so I try and memorize the plate Sadly I dont get a very good look She bolts out of the lot and disappears forever It was not captured by the security cameras And I never see her or the Caddy again BummerTELEPATHIC CART DESTRUCTIONA universal truth to retail is that the less you are paid the more likely it is that you will be blamed for things that had absolutely nothing to do with youIn this case I was in the back of the lot gathering carts Unseen to me a customer leaves a cart between spaces and nowhere near a corral A few minutes later this cart succumbs to gravity and starts rollingIt rolls right into the door of a customer who just happened to arrive at her car at that specific moment A nice dent is delivered and a couple scratches tops it off FantasticHey you She yells I had not seen the accident and was nowhere near her So I dont register that shes talking to meHey cart guy She yells This time I see her So I walk over to her carDo you ned help unloading I askNo I want to know why you dented my carIm sorryYou dented my car You left a cart out and it hit my car What are you going to do about itI was working on the other side of the lot I havent been in this area for a whileShe grabs the cart and pushes it toward me You left this out and it rolled into my car Who is going to pay for the damageUgh Ill take you to our manager He can probably help you outI escort the injured part into the store and introduce her to the manager Then I go back out and finish the job The woman emerged after a while and drove offBack inside the store I get called to the officeYou have to be more careful when doing carts You just cost the store moneyI wasnt anywhere near the car and I was not the person who left the cart thereShe says you didHow Im not telepathic I could not have caused the damage and I could not have prevented it The only thing I did wrong was doing my job I happened to be out there but It was not meLook Be careful I dont want this happening againI left without saying anything else I was both angry and a bit sad Angry at the false accusation and fallout and sad that people behave like this and it could affect my livelihoodYUPPIE PORSCHE COUPLE AND RELATED BIMBO ASSULTThis was the most upsetting of the lot chaosI was pushing a line of about seven carts back to the storefront Carts do not have brakes and Isaac Newton is not kind to rolling objects with a lot of massAs I was moving down the lane a white Porshe  Turbo overtook me began a right turn then stopped cold Inertia made me its bitch There was absolutely nothing I could do to prevent a collisionThe lead cart smacked into the read quarterpanel of the car It was a pretty good hit nice and loud and merciless to the PorscheYuppieBleachedBimbo shot out of the passenger door and pointed her finger at meYou just totaled a  carNow I did not handle this wellYOU just pulled in front of a moving like of carts and got hit Not my faultSecond rule of retail Its your fault It should not be but it isI want to talk to a manager right nowYuppieHusband parks his totaled car in front of the store right on the concrete ramp leading to the sidewalk  I marched YuppieBleachedBimbo into the store and dumped her off on the supervisor She muttered about how this was going to cost me my jobTo the supervisor This kid just totaled my husbands Porshe What are you going to do about itSide note Totaled is short for total loss This term means that it would cost more to repair the car than what the car is actually worthLets discuss it in my office Meanwhile I was instructed to wait in the break room until it was my turnIt was a long night I had to diagram the accident white up a summary and fill out some paperwork I was fairly sure I was going to get fired Part of me WANTED to get fired just so I dont have to put up with this kind of crap anymore The other part of me knew I needed the job and money and was terrified I was going to lose itEventually YuppieBleachedBimbo left with her KenDoll husband Once again I was berated for causing and accident I was not fired but I was told I would be the next time it happenedThe only comfort was that I did manage to tell

Greenwallets,10,4,1r52ex,13,Hey guys So I left my big box retailer and jumped ship to a really optimistic retail marketing company Said marketing company operates a department on behalf of my previous retailer which means both companies are working along side each other in a VERY small space The issues were experiencing largely stem from employees at the store being incredibly hostile towards my new employer being there Theyre most upset by me leaving my part time job at the store to work full time benefits base pay  commission as the assistant manager for this new employer  This went through the store like wildfire the past two weeks and Ive had associatesmanagers come up to me asking me why I chose to leave the retailer In a tone that makes it feel as though I have betrayed them in some way I know its jealousy from the associates but its affecting our relationship with the retailer Theres a very distinct Us vs Them mentality that has sprung up amongst the associates which likely stems for the limitations that the retailer has placed on us We are unable to unlock electronic display cases or cash anyone out who isnt buying a cellular device or related accessory Specifically there is one associate who has made rude comments about my managers and I in our vicinity in addition to physically trying to walk through me I should mention she did this when I worked there as well she hates everyone and gets a away with a lot because her entire family works there Did I mention shes Im wondering if anyone has dealt with a toxic work environment and how you went about rectifying the situation I should say that my manager isnt likely to do anything because she lacks the confidence in this type of leadership role Shes also struggling to maintain the peace between our company and the retailer Shes too much of a sweetheart Im a cynical realist when it comes to this store,Meta how do you deal with a toxic work environment,17

dimintia,7,12,1r4axm,61,A lady entered our department desiring a replacement power cable for her cell phone  Upon presenting her with what she required mind you that it was a cheaper alternative and not the cable from the original manufacturer she asks if the cable is made in China  Even though I know the answer to this question I look anyway on the cables packaging and when I inform her that her assumption is correct she erupts in a preaching rant to myself and a coworker that according to the news people have been dying from exploding cables that come from China  We stare at her blankly and offer no response giving her the opportunity she so desperately needed to vent it was quite apparent that she lacks rational people in her life  When she finishes I ask her if she would instead prefer to take the cable although more expensive made by her phones manufacturer  She happily agrees and as I hand her the cable I inform her that the cable and her phone are both made in China ,Beware of power cables made in China,73

Lightfairy,4,8,1r445p,29,Been posting a few stories You can find them herehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailsearchqauthorALightfairyampsortnewamprestrictsronMany many moons ago when I was but a young thing I worked very briefly for a very large chain supermarket as a cashier This supermarket was in a large shopping centre Having just checked google for the timing of this event I can tell you it was  years ago Wow Time has flown This supermarket chain was having some problems with an extortion attempt Bomb threats had been made to various stores We the staff thought it was all a bit of fun to start with and a great way to avoid work The alarm would go off we would evacuate the store and if it was anywhere near clock off time we would get to go home early as it would take quite a while for the store to be declared safe again We were having a bomb scare every couple of days All good fun we thought as nothing ever happened Then in the space of nine days three stores were bombed The culmination being a major store in a major city on Christmas Eve The police offered the largest reward in the history of this country for information leading to an arrest Cue this story Two bombs had gone off and we were now getting very nervous and were on high alert A lady comes up to my check out Two carts of frozen goods Chickens  litre tubs of icecream and every other conceivable frozen thing one can imagine I start putting the order through Keep in mind this was back in the dim dark days of hand entering every price and then hitting the code for the department the goods came from No scanners back then I was slaving away making small talk when suddenly the alarm goes off By this time we all knew the drill precisely Pull the cash draw throw it in the trolley that came screaming past with a two man escort and exit immediately We did not muck around any more So with the alarm going and the voice over the shop speakers telling EVERYONE to leave by the nearest exit I pull the draw and prepare to exit WHAT ARE YOU DOING I hear screamed at me My customer with all the frozen goods I turn to her and say Would you please exit the store immediately It is probably nothing but it is best to be on the safe side what with recent eventsShe is having none of it What about all my food Only part of it is rung up and I need it You have to finish my order It will only take  or  minutesWith thoughts of explosions in my head I turn to her and say Lady you can do as you wish but based on what has been happening lately in our stores I am outta hereThankfully it was late in the day and I got to go home early again as they would not clear the store prior to my clock off time I jump on the train and head   hours west Get off in my small town and head down the street only to find I could not take my shortcut home it was a laneway running alongside yet another of the supermarkets in the chain for which I worked as they were having a bomb scare as well Total of two bomb scares in one day for meI heard my register was a mess of thawed icecream and other goo by the time they got back into the store As for that ladies  or  minutes They received only a  minute warning prior to the bombing of the major city supermarket on Christmas Eve They managed to evacuate over  people before it went off No one got hurt They have never charged anyone over the event I left the job shortly after This kind of ruined my taste for working check out TLDR Ice cream and bombs dont go together Just ask my customer ,I am outta here,37

ArQuesta,26,20,1r3xmk,43,Hello again fellow retail slaves Ive posted a few times before but mostly about my time before college when I worked at a Stop for Gamers Not today I meant to go get some reading done this evening but the sky is absolutely pissing rain right now and Im carless at the moment so I decided to tell you about a recent storyI just got done with my Bachelors this summer I know I should have escaped the abyss that is retail but Im stuck at home saving up money to move to the DC area at the moment while also filling out grad school applications as well as working on big job applications Im in a stupid spot and I need money so I started working at a big name coffee shop which is a threeminute walk from home ScoreFor the most part the job is fine no real horrible people to be found The ones that are entitled dicks who deign not to make eye contact usually end up tipping so its fine with me if they like being pricks They just spent  on a fcking drink Anywho Last week I encountered something absolutely amazing in its oddness I was working the drivethru window which at night meant I was taking orders and money and passing drinks and whatnot During a rush theres two of us as peoples drinks go from normal to downright stupidcomplicated But alas theres always a button for itA nice shiney k car pulls up my last customer in a long line rush She seems nice and as her drink is still being made we chitchat Now for some background I have the worst baby face I mean its great that I look young but depending on the person my  years looks like  I dont wear makeup drink or smoke so I am lacking any prewrinkles and Im chubby so I have the dumbest looking baby cheeks Its fine though as I get to surprise people with my age and that amuses me greatly For this conversation Ill use BAC for the lady and Me as meBAC Oh are you still in school right nowMe Actually I just finished Im working here to help pay for grad school applications and get on my feetBAC Oh what did you major inMe EastAsian studies chuckles Its kind of useless around hereBAC Would you say that you could talk about your major confidentlyMe at this point wondering if she works for the nearby college or needs a strangely specific tutor Oh yeah I can talk for days about culture history politics language etc for daysBAC Have you ever read the bibleMe shitshitshitshit here it comes Well a bit when I was youngerBAC with smug confidence and a gleam in her eyes When I was in college my psychology professor told us about the world in two boxes one where God existed and one where he doesnt Sure if youre in the box where he isnt there fine but what if youre in the other one Is it really that harmful to believeNow at this point my supervisor was standing behind me counting drawers and had tuned out the conversation as she told me afterwards I kept hoping my body language and the amount of time we were at the window would get her to help me but alas I was trappedMe remembering hearing that analogy used to argue the other point of view but deciding not to argue at work Well as a kid my dad let me try out every religion and Ive built myself up with the best morals and ideas from all of them If I had to subscribe to anythingBAC Some people are really fake you know They pretend to be deep but they lack in the most important area suddenly angry I know a lot of fake people and they arent people you should call friendsMe the fukThis was the most annoying partBAC suddenly remembering that she in the middle of preaching What are you going to do after youre done with schoolMe I dunno work for the governmentBAC And thenMe Take care of my parents and familyBAC And thenMe Travel or work abroadBAC And thenMe Ive thought about adoptingBAC And thenMe Live my life happilyBAC What about after lifeMe Theres nothingBAC legitimately surprised And youre okay with thatMe Well yeah were not immortal You live to the best of your ability until you dieBAC changing tactics When I used to work in retail I was a great salesperson really friendly but it was fake People are fake Then I read the bible Theres something there if you read it youll understandMe Maybe one day Ill read it but its notBAC Well you know everyone has problems rightMe Of courseBAC surprised for some reason that Ive agreed with her Well how do you deal with problemsMe Sometimes slowly sometimes not at all I try to sit down and think about things and to talk to people You can either sit down and let them destroy you or try to get up again Some people cant cope and need medications but I know a lot of people who deal with things on their ownBAC My husband used to be addicted to money sex and drugsThis is about where my patience absolutely ended my face started to crack a grin Im not an arrogant person but I write I read I study constantly Im an intelligent person and I wasnt going to allow her to outwit or speak me but I was also trying to be unfailingly politeMe corners of my mouth twitching Oh yeahBAC conspiratorially He used to be the biggest drug dealer in my home townMe holding in my amusement badly ReallyBAC Now hes the best husband utterly faithful and he read the bible Hes spiritual now thats proof You have toAnd then like God himself saying Jesus lady shut up the drivethru dinged and my supervisor started our spiel I said goodbye to the dear Born Again Christian and turned away from the window As I walked away my face flushed bright red and my eyes teared up from all my held back emotions My coworkers started laughing and asking what had happened I was a little mortified I mean here was this lady with a car worth more than my fouryear education lecturing a girl lol who she thought was in the middle of college  working minimum wage at a coffee place after dropping thousands on a what she thought excellent education If she only worked retail than dear drugdealing hubby must have paid for that right At what point did she have the right to say that I wasnt spiritual Im very spiritual and I have my own views of spirituality At what point did she have the right to say that to not read the bible was to be a fake human being who was obsessed with drugs money and sex Not only that did she really initiate a conversation geared towards the nonreligious simply because I told her I was educated Plus she didnt tip that poor drivethru girl who had to listen to her for fifteen minutes What a tool SeriouslyTLDR Educated women are obviously atheists Srsly,The DriveThru Window Assault,63
Takeabyte,8,9,1r3uuj,30,The former VP of a computer companys retail division had a lot of policies that were intended to improve the customer experience He was a strong believer that we sales people could deter thieves simply by talking to them and that having security measures like empty boxes of software door alarms and fake products were nothing but an annoyance to customers and would ruin the vibeShout out to rJealousyGrey and his posthttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsrytheydoknowtheyrefakeright that reminded me of this gemThe worst was having real boxes of software on the shelves I worked in a much smaller store than most the shelves were only about  feet away from the door At any given time there would be  to  worth of software and accessories on what little shelf space we had Everything ranging from the full version of design software productivity software portable hard drives headphones etc Every time we got the new planogram we would cringe Think of those shelves in a computer store as a billboard Every single item on display or on the shelf is ad space paid for by whoever made that product with the stuff at eye level or plugged in being the most expensive real estate like a grocery store so we were required to put products where they told us to put them For example when one design software company comes out with the new version they would buy double the ad space wed have one box for the full version and one box for the upgrade for all the versions of their products and the individual apps on display It was madness Over the years though they transitioned to empty boxes and moved almost entirely away from boxed software since download distribution took overThe worst for us was a video editing program It cost  and had a handle on top since it since it had so many instruction booklets but it also made it way easier to grab and run with Anyway a box of that would go missing every week It happened so often we almost ran out of the software to sell Wed look over notice it was missing ask everyone working usually only  or  of us including one technician and one manager it was a big deal when our store had to have two techs work at once anyway wed ask everyone if they sold it and if not our manager would have to report it as theft and explain why we were unable to stop it We would ask time and time again to let us put an empty box out or at least put the upgrade version on the shelf insteadSo life goes on and time passes The thefts seem to slow down and the video software never went MIA again Meanwhile a friend of mine had to go to a halfway home for drug abuse and I would visit him every so often to keep his spirits up One time I was playing billiards in their garage and theres this one guy who was there because he was a kleptomaniachttpenwikipediaorgwikiKleptomania started telling stories about stealing from the mall with his girlfriend and started to talk about the computer store I couldnt believe it I was playing pool with the guy that stole about  worth of software He was also responsible for taking computers that belonged to customers while it was waiting to be sent out for repair People almost got fired for that shit It was crazy I wanted to punch the guy in the faceOh well he did go to jail for a couple years and I whooped his butt at poolhttpiimgurcomQqHzZgif He got what he deserved and hopefully stopped stealing things Looking back at it now it obviously didnt effect the companies business and the customers who had their computers stolen were given the choice of whatever computers they wanted as well as a bunch of other free gearTLDR Someone stole a lot of software from the store I met him years later and beat him at playing poolI have soooo many other stories from working that store for so long Ill tell you guys some more later For now Ill just wish you a safe holiday season stay strong and eat a breakfastAll the bestTakeabytePS My first post about this story was going to get deleted or downvoted to oblivion for saying specifics It would have been better if I could use more pronouns,Computer Store Thief,39

xVarekai,78,31,1r3e2x,156,This story is a little different as its not about a particular customer but instead about one of the most uncomfortable working experiences Ive had with a manager  Ive worked on and off for a certain body carehome fragrance store shilling overpriced lotion to the masses and as such Ive been in several stores depending on where I lived at the time and the financial state I was in  My first and only other post can be found hereThats called stealing httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsjfthatscalledstealingand while I probably have other stories its been a while since I had to deal with that environment but Ill post any juicy ones I recallSo about this store manager  I lived in a small town in the bible belt for some time and while I hope this doesnt offend anyone I will say that I am an atheist but wasnt exactly out about it as Id experienced some nasty behavior in the past for simply saying I dont go to church  My store manager on the other hand was very active in her church and wasnt shy about talking about her faith  She seemed to assume that we were all christians of one form or another but I dont think that this is something that should be talked about in a place of business  Ive worked with people of all faiths and if youre a decent person I really dont care one way or the other  In fact Id prefer it not come up at all as this can lead to problemslike it did in this situationSo it was really more a culmination of comments and assertions than an actual confrontation for a while with me quietly holding my tongue and going about my job as best I could  I was in a difficult spot at the time stressed in private life and pretty depressed about my lack of direction even though I was actually able to save money for the first time  I had taken on a minor management role that turned out to be quite a bit more than I had expected  Some of you can probably relateAnyway Im struggling to master the many tasks and expectations of my position I was promoted into lower management and actually moved an hour and a half to take it so the disappointment was a bit stronger than if it had been within my previous home store and I can tell that my manager who we shall call Cindy from here on out is wanting badly to get me to church  Little things like Well have you made any friends at church and You should find a nice church to go to youll meet more people and feel better when I confided that my personal life was a bit difficult  I know Cindy meant well but there was no way I could really open up to her  Plus she wasnt exactly the model person she seemed to think she was pitting employees against each other and having her church friends spy on the store when she took a rare day off  Im not sure why she delighted so much in the little gossipy things she did but the store was small and her influence made some pretty big waves at timesOne day I was about to close up the store stooped to pick up some trash off the floor and came up wrong under the sink overhang giving myself a pretty solid concussion  My SO took me to the hospital after I called HR to report the incident where we stayed for  hours to be seen  I got a note that said I needed to be off for a few days until my symptoms cleared up and Cindy didnt like that  She sent an email to a comanager that I was pretty good friends with about how she didnt want me taking advantage of the situation  Lady I had a concussion and I didnt do it on purpose  That was pretty much the beginning of the endCindy started laying it on thick such as at management meetings where we talked about personal experiences looking pointedly at me when she said that faith is the most important thing in her life and she doesnt know where shed be without it  She even did this little stunt where she gradually filled a glass with objects of varying size saying If you dont leave room for faith then your bottle is never full  Fullon evangelical which again I dont care what you do in your own time but this is not appropriate for workFinally I was able to quit and started making plans with my SO to move back to my home state for a fresh start  She and I sat down in the food court for a coaching session and she started talking about how this job wasnt really for me and I agreed with her saying that I was going to be turning in my two weeks  She seemed annoyed that I was already making plans  I thought that was it and then before we went back to the store she looks at me intensely and asks xVarekai do you have a bibleAlright  Ive had enoughI said No I dont  And I dont think thats an appropriate question for a place of businessShe looked as if Id slapped her and maybe she felt that way too  I dont like to be confrontational or make people feel bad but enough was enough  I never once said anything to her when she was preaching at work I took it quietly and let her looks of disdain and irritation wash over me  And its not just religionanything that could be controversial like politics or views about abortion should not be discussed at work in my opinion  Its distracting causes problems and can make good people make poor choices in their desire to defend themselvesAnyway she was stonecold frosty to me for the duration of the two weeks and I was glad to be gone  Some of you may say well you should have gone to HR with that  And yes I probably should have  I suppose it was the general environment and knowing that it probably would have only gotten worse if I had said anything that kept me quiet and she has a lot of influence in that community  So I took it until I had a way out and didnt look backI dont know if everyone will understand the impact of that one question to someone who is firmly without faith but it was jarring and inappropriate  I only hope she learned something from the experience and hasnt done that to anyone else,The bible story,187

dichotomies,9,30,1r2lgs,15,Heres a story that I have never forgotten from my time working as a Personal Banker for a large nationwide bank not BoA It happened several years ago The story starts about a week prior in a dream I rarely remember my dreams but this one stuck out to me I remembered many details from how things were said and the feelings expressed I woke up and I continued thinking about the dream it was a dream filled with a heavy emotion that was difficult to shake off after waking up Fast forward to today I sit down and help a  something customer John who is sorting out his dads accounts Johns dad died a couple weeks prior in a horrible bike accident in Texas A semi plowed into him As a cyclist myself we spoke a little bit about it But moving on We have paperwork to do I take the death certificate and have it reviewed by our legal department I faxed it to them As I am talking to John I see that his dad made his son John and daughter Sarah beneficiaries POD  payable on death This makes it easier for beneficiaries to bypass an estate process by making a private arrangement with the bank After having the death certificate approved by the legal department and verifying Johns ID I start to talk to John about his dads accounts I mention that Sarah is also on the account and that we will be cutting two checks one made out to each of you Now this is before smartphones and he doesnt have the number for his sister on his phone I think it was because she had just moved or something John had an address book with him and said Im pretty sure its in here Let me take a lookIt was at this point that it all clicked into place for me It was an immediate sensation of a vault coming unlocked and creaking open I knew for at least the next minute exactly what was going to happen I have never had this sensation before or after Normally I get this feeling after something happens déjà vu This time I felt like I was observing my own dream unfold before my eyesHe looks through his address book and cant find his sisters number A guy in his mental state could certainly be unsure of things or where he wrote things down so he continues looking in his pile of paperwork for her number I have to bite my lip to not say anything I KNOW that his sisters number is right in his address book I am so confident that I want to say No its in there Look again I only kept my mouth shut because the last thing I want to do is freak out a distraught son bereaving the unexpected death of his father John ends up looking through his paperwork for a short bit then looks again in his address book He finds it this time I honestly cant remember why we needed to call her this was about  years ago but I do remember the feeling I had when he started looking in his address book as if it were yesterdayAs I told this story you might have been thinking But this sounds trivial and minor what gives Well I feel that the events that I remembered from my dream happened a week later in real life enough and I knew it while I was experiencing it That is kinda freaky I am an agnostic and this has certainly been enough for me to keep my mind open Just thought that Id share with you guys Thanks for reading ,An old story that I havent forgotten from working at a Bank a long time ago,45

it on to a return belt near my feet if it was small enough If it was too large or if the belt near my feel got backed up the box had to go to one of six guys in my area This pissed them off when it happened because they had to touch something that did not belong to them technical note this company is absolutely insane with logistics they preach the art of touching something a few times as possibleI did my best to distribute the load as fairly as possible So as the crap came in I rotated the victim Everyone except BadassPonytail was understandingBadassPonytail started yelling insults after each misrouted box reached him Over the course of the first two hours I got called asshole faggot fucker mother fucker pussy pansy goddamn piece of shit mongoloid surprised at this one since it required knowing what it meant blind inbred etc LoudlyThe environment was pretty permissive of this type of banter It was a dirty shitty environment and there was absolutely no decorum This may have changed over the years but in this era there was zero censorshipPermissive or not personal or not I had enough It wasnt my fault and there was zero I could do about it So I gave everyone else a break and started sending  of the misrouted load to BadassPonytail I mean if Im going to get abused I might as well give him a reasonBox after box went to him He very quickly got backed up since he couldnt handle is regular workload on top of the crap His anger started boil He was getting truly and sincerely angry The verbal assault gained volume and he started calling out for a supervisor A supervisor did arrive and wrongly assumed I was still evenly distributing the crap So he told BadassPonytail to stop being a babyAt the hour three mark he exploded He began throwing boxes at me from about  feet away I shut my belt down turned around and played wide receiver He threw I caught then stuck the box back on his belt After a couple minutes of this I was grinning like an idiot and started flipping his off after each catchYoure gonna die motherfuckerBadassPonytail jumped up to his own conveyor belt and began to rush me He is both larger and stronger than I am and I knew that if there was any actual violence I would likely get thrashed So I grabbed the heaviest box I could find and held it up like a shieldHe charged into me and I thrust the box into his chest causing him to lose balance Instead if hitting me he had to right himself or hed fall about three feet onto a steel grateAfter stumbling his mind cleared One more fucking misroute and Im going to kill you after workFuck you you retarded piece of shit Youre gonna get everything for the rest of the day unless you close your fucking mouth As for after work just try Ill fucking flatten you and strangle you with your ponytailNow I said a lot of stuff working here It was very typical of me to speak of my physical abilities in terms that far exceeded reality I mean if I saw him waiting for me Id run to my car like a frightened gazelle and never look back I hate fighting and had managed to avoid it since middle schoolBut it worked and he backed down Look hand the stuff out fairly and well be cool But you keep fucking with me and well have a problemI punctuated the encounter with another middle finger salute but went back to being fair again No asses were kicked that dayI sincerely hope the culture has improved at San Diego Sunrise Looking back I laugh and cringe at how awful the environment was Everywhere else Ive working in life both of us would have been fired on the spot And we would deserve itThanks for

jorcoga,42,38,1r1ut3,160,So we do breakfast products until am Unlike our closest competitor we also sell our daytime products in the morning though I am judging you quietly but immensely for ordering a grilled chicken burger at  in the morning Our competitor also stops selling breakfast half an hour earlier than we do and because this company is slightly more prominent people get us confused I get yelled at probably once a week for not being able to sell apple piesAnyway its  There are two very hungover teenagers in line who look like theyve been awake for maybe ten minutes Theres also an old lady her arrival heralding the imminent beginning of what I like to call the old people rush where our youngest customer for the next half an hour will still be entitled to a free cup of coffee on account of being old They all like to go on and on about how much nicer our store is when its quiet all the while getting to listen to my managers freak out because Im not hurrying them along whilst they dutifully count out seven bucks worth of five cent piecesAnyway the hungover teens get to my till and immediately want to know if were still selling breakfastWe sure are what can I get for youBefore they can respond I hear an old lady pipe up with No you cant be selling breakfast I think it best to ignore her this is far from the weirdest customer Ive ever had and this seems to be effective enough I finish the hungover teenagers order they head to the back of our front counter area to wait I hand out their food and they go and sit down in one of the seats that is clearly visible from where Im standing The old lady walks over and starts yelling at the top of her voice at themWhat are you doing eating breakfast this late Why would you do that breakfast is FINISHED You made these poor people make breakfast for you when its clearly lunch time You should be ashamedNow obviously I cant just let some little old lady harass these two even if theyre doing a terrible job of stifling laughter I walk overExcuse me is everything okNo These people are exploiting youOh how did they do thatThey made you make them breakfast when its clearly lunch timeWell our breakfast menu is still available and they can order from it if they want toNo youre wrong Its not breakfast any moreI assure you it was no trouble for us to make muffins and cook hash brownsWhy are you defending them They clearly made your job harderWell no thatd be what youre doingI walked off she did too She never did order anything despite the fact that shed been camped out in the store for half an hour reading the newspaper Im still not sure why a probably  year old woman thought she knew my store policy better than I did but there you goEdit Maybe I shouldnt judge people for ordering chicken Can I at least judge people who order coke with breakfast food,These customers are exploiting you,198
jenbenfoo,5,10,1r1rl7,4,So I work in the deli at a chain superstore prominent in the Midwest Ive shared a few stories before but I thought you guys would enjoy this one Its a nice short story about a guy who cant mathsSo this guy comes up to the counter and asks for there fourths of a pound of turkey or ham or whatever Okay no problem I grab it out of the cooler get it set up on the slicer and as I start slicing I verify with him how much he wanted Sir did you want half a pound or three quarters He looked back to me and said no I want three fourths He wasnt rude about it and I got a chuckle out of it I gave him his  of a pound and sent him on his merry way and went on with my day waiting eagerly to come home and post this,No I said three fourths,14
shadowmanwkp,12,18,1r1q8g,60,Preface I work at a Dutch chain store where we sell a variety of things food furniture curtains cutlery and a lot more Were most wellknown for selling stuff from abroad and selling it at a reasonable price Payout may be a bit above minimum wage but my colleagues are awesome and my manager is a really great guyBeing in the Netherlands theres one thing that is even bigger than Christmas Sinterklaas If youre not in the know Sinterklaas is about the same as Christmas but with the bishop of Myra st Nicholas coming all the way from Spain to the Netherlands supported by his personal army of black petes Last saturday it was the great inception because old saint Nick would come into my town with his steam boat This being one of the biggest events in town of the year and us being in front of the square where saint Nick will be coming you can imagine that it is very busy at our store when it happensOnto the story at hand Our manager warned us before we got started that the amount of thefts is increasing these days There were about a dozen of armbands stolen from our store the other day leaving only the cartons Because we have no detection gates stealing is easy but we barely if ever have any thefts unless it is holiday season This warning stuck with me the whole day and it was a good thing it didOut of our three registers we had two open near the end of the morning we were still anticipating saint Nicks arrival in town but that would turn out to be the end of the day Just to be sure that we had enough registers open I was near the registers so I could keep an eye on the amount of customers in queue and man the third register if needed In comes the group of five tenyearolds racing past our registers and jumping onto the candy which is just before me already making me suspicious because usually people will ask us whether or not it is ok to come in through the wrong side I keep an eye on them as they enthusiastically discuss what they will buy Nearly instantly a customer waiting in line says that they probably are stealing now Im on high alert As one of them goes past the registers I see him with his hand in his pocket Immediately as he brushes past me I ask him Me Do you have anything in your pocketHe immediately removes his hand from his pocket and begins sticking them up in the airPocket kid No I dont Search me all you want I dont have anythingWell thats a response that shows a lot of guilt and makes you suspicious all the more However we dont search customers so I let him off the hook Just when I finished with pocket kid from the corner of my eye one of the kiddos has a pack of chewing gum in his hand Just as I turn fully around it is vanishedI get angry really angry even if youre young that doesnt mean that shoplifting isnt a crime so I raise my voice a little and say You there I know youve got chewing gum in your pocket so dont forget to pay for itThe kid is flabbergasted and I am on my way for my lunch break we are very strict with them on busy days I see my boss on the way and I quickly inform him about the situation He tells me he will keep an eye on the situationDuring lunch break I review my own actions towards those kids maybe theyre going to step up to their parents Maybe my boss didnt like the way I handled the situation Anyways I wanted to talk to my boss because I was doubting myself I got my grub and the lunch break end At this point there are more people in the store so we open up all the registers to be able to service all customers Along the way I inform my boss that I want to talk to him It wasnt very busy but its better to be safe than sorry so I keep working at the register I help some customers and generally have a blast workingSuddenly two girls come up to my register just barely tall enough for me to see them over the counter They are being very sweet and ask me if they could ask how much a key chain costs With a genuine smile I tell them that it will set them back around  Its a bit steep for them so they tell me they want to ask their father to pay for them I offer them to let me hang on to it so they can simply walk up to the register and pay for it when they get back they happily obligeI get on with my work and it gets a bit busier so I didnt see the girls nor their dad It takes an hour or two before one of the girls comes back with their motherMe Hello how may I help youMom Hello my daughter had interest in a key chainMe Ah yes she was here earlier and asked about the price I believe its this oneI show the key chain and the girl confirms its the oneJust when the mother wants to pull out the money she suddenly stopsMother Whats that in your pocketGirl NothingMother Come on show me whats itThe girl pulls out an I lt beer key chainMother Where did you get this fromGirl From somebodyI am a bit doubtful so I ask the mother if I could check it I dont recognize it because we sell dozens of the bloody things so I flip it over to see if I recognize the markings Lo and behold they were identical to the key chain I held onto for the girlMe Madam the markings are the same as the key chain from our storeMy boss passes by and he says in a very polite way I would never be able to pull offBoss Madam it is from our storeUsually parents do not keep their cool if they catch their kid stealing after all you taught them not to do it and they still do This woman however kept her cool and pulled it off in styleMom Now be honest with me where did you get this from  Girl From somebody in the store  Mom No thats not true we know that you got it from the store Did you take it without permissionThe girl keeps totally silent obviously embarrassed by the whole ordeal The mom waits a little bit to see if her daughter will form a response but nothing She respectfully asks her daughterMom Would you like to apologize to the mister in front of you  Girl   Mom Come on apologize  Girl Im sorry  Me Apology acceptedI feel like a moron asking this but still its an honest questionMe Madam do you still want to buy they key chain despite all this  Mother No it was a present for her because she was behaving well However because she did this I wont buy it for her  Me Thats ok I wish you a nice day anyways  Mother A good day to you as wellThe day turned out to be mediocre saint Nick came and went and we didnt have as many customers as we hoped But I didnt forget to make a talk with my boss so when we only needed two registers open I asked a colleague to man the register in my place and I asked my boss if I could talk with him in the back I make him some coffee and we begin to talkMe Well I hope you know why I wanted to talk  Boss Yeah I do  Me Well I wasnt really certain if I responded the right way towards those kids this morning Im a bit afraid that their parents might come back because I didnt really follow protocol  Boss No not at all You did the right thing Although what youve said might have been a bit direct you did overhear from the customers that those kids might have stolen something And that thing with the girl was also handled well you did great todayWell that was a load off my chestTLDR Even little kids can turn out to be shoplifters and my boss is a kickass,Shoplifting it starts as early as ten years,78
abbeyinreallife,13,17,1r1eap,67,I work in your friendly neighborhood fabric and craft store and Ive had the job for around  months For a majority of the time Ive been the designated punching bag aka guest services in the store I run the phones announcements returns special orders cashiering complaints etc in my little box Today was a surprisingly slow day but it was nearing our closing time so everyone was trying to rush out We had a line of maybe  or  parties and I was checking people out along with  other cashiers Our line is designed so people have to snake around several twists and turns Around the last turn of the register I noticed one of my cashiers away from her station and speaking with some guests No one in the group seemed very happy The cashier checked the guests out while I was paying close attention because the guests were yelling and grumbling I figured Id be seeing them very soonI was rightNot two minutes later did this middle aged woman with more black eyeliner on than a panda come sprinting over to my station cutting off the customers coming to check out with me in the processHER You need to tell your cashier to stop licking my stuffME Uh excuse me maamHER You need to tell that lady over there to stop licking everything She keeps sticking her fingers in her mouth before she touches my stuff Thats so nasty and grossME Was she just wetting her finger tips trying to page through paper or something I dont like it when people do that and we even have finger wetting stuff to use instead of spit but I thought Id try to clarifyHER NO She was licking her fingers before touching MY STUFF I think I will need to exchange all of my items to ones she didnt lick You need to tell her shes nastyShe pantomimes licking her fingersShe went and grabbed one of our reusable bagsHER Here I want to buy this so I dont have to carry all of those nasty bags she lickedME kay Your total is total she pays me in cashI had the biggest urge to lick my fingers as I was counting out her change but I restrained myselfHER That cashier is so nasty leavesAfter closing I talked to the cashier about what the lady said and apparently she also barged to the front of the line and said to the people oh you dont mind do you as she pushed past yelled at the cashier for blinding her with the red scanner light and tried to get her to give her a discount without a couponNeedless to say we were not sad to see her goTLDR STOP LICKING MY STUFF ,Tell your cashier to stop licking my stuff,84
WhatsAnEnigma,16,7,1r1dog,19,First time using Alien Blue on my phone So this is more of a question than a tale Its my first time working in a store that sells the prepaid green dot cards I work in a corner store in the south A guy comes in and wants to put  on a Green Dot card He gives me a handful of s that reeks of weed No biggie I dont care where you get your money I ring him up Have a nice day He comes back an hour later telling me the card doesnt work I try to explain the directions he gets frustrated and leaves He comes back and tries to tell me I did it wrong I again try to explain the directions he gets frustrated and leaves And let me just say now that he was very very southern so he was hard to understand when he talked so I was a little frustrated too I go to lunch and when I get back hes walking to my car and asks me for a cigarette because I obviously dont have any money since this card screwed me over I have to admit I was a little scared when he walked towards me because of how upset he was at me in the store  But then he apologizes about accusing me of messing up and says he called the card company and they said the card was screwed up and they would send him a refund check I feel very uncomfortable but I tell him that Im glad theyll fix it for him He walks back to his car and I think gee thats a pretty expensive car for a for a guy whos barely   But whatever Lucky guy I guess But it weirded me out that he was still in the parking lot even though he fixed the problem with green dot Clock back in and watch the guy in the parking lot He comes back in and gets another  Green Dot since the other one was bad I dont understand where he got the cash since he told me he doesnt have money for cigs But I dont ask questions cuz Im new to this job and I just do what Im told He buys it and leaves And then sits in the parking lot for another hour I mention how weird this whole thing is to my manager but he just rolls his eyes I think that maybe hes just offended at the fact that I mentioned the weed smell and he seems like a really conservative guy so I stop talking about it because I want to keep my job and I dont want him to think bad about me and the fact that I mentioned weed I seriously need this job so I get really paranoid  Well The guy comes back in and buys two more cards at  a piece But this time he comes in with another guy who hangs around the door like they arent together Im just really weirded out because theyre acting like they dont know each other Then they leave and sit in the parking lot for an hour I dont mention it again to my manager because he acted like I shouldnt worry about it The guys leave I leave and then find out the next day from another employee that actually listened to me that the guy came back for more cards twice before the manager told him to leave because theres a green dot limit Sowhat was this guy doingEdit  spelling ,Redneck Green Dot Gansta,26

metamaxwell,385,369,1r14xk,1094,So I may cry I was  minutes into typing this post up when a power surge hit and every thing at work went down including the computer and now I have to type this again That in itself may become another postDisclaimer Standard stuff First time post Massive wall of text etcBackground I work at a small privately owned retro game store You name it I have something for itNow this tale takes place a few days after GTA  came out You see on this slow day at work I was killing time doing what I usually do playing SNES games on one of our displays On the rare occasion when a customer would come in Id pause my game greet them and offer whatever help I could provide then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store Now it had been an hour or so since I had last had anyone in the store so I was itching to sell something when Mom and Kid came in I jumped up and gave them my spiel and they assured me they were fine and were just looking Well a few minutes go by when Kid and Mom come up to me with you guessed it GTA  in hand Kid has that look of pure bliss on his face The one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his  and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun Except there is one thing between him and that future A fell and powerful guardian That would be meI should take this time to mention that for the most part I dont like telling people they cant buy something It is sad not only because Im missing out on a sale but Im also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you Your card was declined You have to be  or older to buy this etc are phrases I dislike Except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world For you the entitled the bratty the liars the assholes the pricks the scammers the schemers etc To you I find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fatteningBack to the story So whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a M rated game I am required by law to ask for an ID or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen Now most parents fall into one of two general categories The I dont care I just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money type and the Im actually have an idea about what is going on here and Im totally cool with it now take my money type Those are the ones that just say yes and having done my duty and covering my ass legally I move on and make the sale Not Mom No when I tell her about the M rating she actually stops and ASKS ME WHY ITS M RATED My heart stopped I heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when Mario picks up a coin This honestly never happens Ive worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed Kids heart drops at this But you can still see hope in his eyes hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming Dudebe cool NOPEI like my job and I like to think I do it well Im paid to play and talk about games from the Atari on up to the PS and Xbox One afterall So when someone asks me about a game Im going to tell you EVERY THING about it And thats just what Mom gets First blow Language Moms approval doesnt take any visible damage Kid is optimisitc and reassures Mom he is mature enough to handle itQuick second punch Drugs and alcohol I think I saw a grimacebut Mom recovers quickly Kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like Wormtongue in LoTRIm getting serious now Violence Finally a crack in the armor Mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure Kid REALLLY wants this game and can handle it Kid puts on his most mature look I swear if he had a tux monocle and top hat he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion He does he can he could pay the damn mortgage right now hes that matureYoure doing well in keeping the situation favorable Kid but I have a secret weapon Nudity Yep as some of you know GTA  didnt get the partial nudity rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob Nope Now this is what Kid feared was coming and hoped I either didnt know or wasnt going to share it but I did Critical hit TKO Mom was out She refused to get it and told Kid he wasnt going anywhere near that game until he was old enough I thought that was the end of it but damn Kid was quick on his feet He played the Friends already have it card followed quickly by dad will be okay with it call himSo she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him meanwhile Im left in the store getting the most venomhatespiterage filled look Ive seen Seriously I think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me Not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff Oh no I mean slow and painful years of torture kind Well Mom comes back in and is on the fence again Apparently Dad wasnt against it but she still was Im given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what I told her and I do and Mom gets the phone back This time she stays in the store and I must have convinced Dad because this time she hangs up and tells Kid he is not getting the game Reddit let me tell you I have seen some tantrums explosions complete personality turn arounds etc in my time but DAMN Kid takes the cake All illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book He screams he threatens he cries he begs every thing I would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly  minutes so Ill just give you my three favorite parts because I can remember those nearly verbatim Favorite  Kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage Why is this hilarious Because while doing all this he is telling Mom that he is mature enough to handle the game and that the nudity isnt even a main part of it and he wont look at it and he doesnt have to do it etc Except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission So yeah Also the tantrum technique Not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for somethingFavorite  The xxx has it so screw you Ill just play it there Now kudos to Mom she handled this like a pro Her response You wont when I call every one of your friends parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game Im also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playingFavorite  This one was just stupid which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious Kid yells at Mom telling her he doesnt need her and hell just come back and buy the game in a few days himself Mom not fazed or even looking at me asks me if he could buy it without her To help her get her point across I ask if he is  she assures me he isnt and I tell them that without an ID proving he is  or older no one can legally sell him that gameThe night ends with her dragging his bawling snot dripping raging ass out of my store apologizing profusely for his antics and before they get out of earshot I can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments hes going to recieve after his behavior Reddit I love moments like that It had it all Drama laughter lies betrayal threats crying bargaining and a parent actually acting like a parent Oh and Kid was about  by the

GrimGuy,29,14,1r0zg2,92,The longest tract of my retail years is time spent at a large video game retailer This particular story occurs on the very day that I had been taken out of training at a small store and installed as the assistant manager at a very high volume location I dont really know what Im doing yet much less this new store It was a weekday morning in the summer and rather dead The store manager and other employee had abandoned me to the cash wrap and sequestered themselves away in the break room I was doing this and that when a dude comes in asking for a cable to get stuff from his laptop onto his PSPfirst gen No problem I get him the cable and send him on his wayHours pass and my shift is coming to an end The guy from earlier returns this time with his PSP and laptop in hand Now Im a video game store rookie at this point  but I know that no good can come of this Its midafternoon now and the store isnt packed but theres the standard crowd of feral children meandering parents and other miscellaneous types None of them are at the counter though so I get to deal with Mr PSPHis problem so he informs me is that he doesnt know how to access the things once theyve been shifted to the PSP Before I can say a word he has it all set up on my counter and powered up With a standard Retail Sigh I ignore his computer and look at the handheld a while He definitely moved some files over so I walk him through it and show him where the files are stored and thats that RightNot so He still doesnt understand He asks me to open one up so he can see I walk through it more slowly then pick a random file  as they all had random strings of numbers as filenames I say Okay see you just go to this and open itThe screen goes dark for a moment then a whole bunch of grainy text appears briefly I dont see much but I see enough to notice some copyright notice stuffand perhapsdefinitely more importantly an all models were  at the time of filming notice Now keep in mind this flashed by very quickly and at this point the thing is back in his hands Next up a blue screen stating that something like Boy Joy Proudly Presents and then a heartbeat later Instant hardcore man on man Did I mention he had the volume all the way up Because he did Did I mention were standing side by side at this point shoulder to shoulder closely peering at this thing Because we were Did I mention that the gentlemen involved in the video were VERY vocal about their appreciation of one anothers efforts Because oh they wereA frantic scramble ensues much too late to prevent the entire store from knowing exactly whats going on and the dude looks at me wideeyed I dont know how that got there He says I dont like that That wasnt on my PSP I dont have that on my computerI could only manage out a flat Well it wasnt on the cable before I went in the back room and sat down quietly for a long time,I dont know how that got there Or A Stimulating First Day,106
verynotberry,14,5,1r0rm7,43,Ive been out of retail for several years but I still look back on those days with horror and nostalgia  I worked in a store in a smaller town where you arent always slammed and get to know your customers  There was one family Ill always remember with fondness  They would happily wait in a line several people deep just to go through my lane and I loved them for it I looked forward to their visits These were truly kind wonderful peopleHowever there were also the jerks  The guy Im going to tell you about is one of those  Now normally when someone would be a jerk to me I would tend to write it off  Its not personal Im not verynotberry Im the cashier  If it happened every time they came in to the store that was another story  This particular guy was always short and rude with me and my fellow cashiers  Talked down to us treated us like idiots the lot  But one day one glorious day I got my petty revengeHe came through my line and threw some bills and coins on the counter to pay for his purchases  While counting the change I noticed a Canadian penny  This store was in the US  So    not legal tender  I tell coin man CM for short that I cant accept his pennyCM  What  Why notMe  Well its not legal tender  CM  Why not Me  Well this is a Canadian penny and we are not in Canada so I cannot accept thisltbear in mind Im smiling and as friendly as I could possibly begtCM  What  Thats bull  Just take the dn penny   Truly he was a gifted debaterMe  Well sir I would but outside the boundaries of Canada this is not legal tender so I cannot accept thisCM  I PROBABLY GOT THIS PENNY FROM THIS STORE  ltBecause I know I always remember where I get each and every one of my coins dont yougtMe  Sir if that is true I am terribly sorry to hear that we are giving out the wrong coins and I will surely tell a manager about it so that we can keep a better eye out for them but as it stands I will need an American pennyIts important to note that throughout this entire process he had his hands in his pockets jangling what must have been several dollars worth of coinsCM  Oh Jesus  FineHe throws a penny on the counter  I hand him the Canadian penny back with the biggest kindest most customerfriendly smileMe  Thank you so much sir  Please have a nice dayNow if this had been any of our other customers I would have taken the penny no questions asked because hey the American and Canadian pennies are practically identical when you look at them quickly so its easy to miss  I truly believe the gods of karma were smiling down on me that day by not only getting me to notice the penny but also to allow me to have this moment to make a small stand for my fellow cashiers and get back at a man who always tried to make us feel smallIt felt amazingTLDR  Blame CanadaEDIT  formatting,Penny for your thoughts,48

Gimick,8,9,1r0n8k,27,I work at an officewarehouse where I deal mostly in shipping and receiving We are technically a distributor so usually we only deal with wholesale purchases but because we offer a warranty on a brand that is actually a product we manufacture we also answer calls about defective merchandise In the industry I work in almost no one on the retail level does returns on the type of merchandise we makedistribute We get a couple of calls a day about problem merchandise where they always explain to us the retailer will not honor a refund Fine Its no big deal we usually just replace it I get a call from a woman who is having trouble with our product I go through the motions to make sure its not just some kind of user error and try to figure out the best and fastest way to solve the problem She told me what was wrong with her item and I determined she needed to be sent a new oneI ask her for her information and notice I just took a call from the exact same address Well naturally I have to ask about it It turns out her daughter had just called about a different problem with a different item and had to be sent a replacement as well It is odd but not unheard of so I let it goAfter I get the information I need to process the replacement order I double check to make sure I am going to send the right product At this point the woman chimes in that I need to send two HmmI assume she meant her daughters order and try to explain to her that I had already packaged that order and that both would arrive on the same day She corrected me telling me that is not what she meantShe then goes on to explain to me that I need to send her two of the same item to replace the item that she had trouble with I try to figure out why which results in her giving me an immensely long story that in no way related to why she should receive two of an item to replace the one that she boughtI repeatedly try to get her back on track as I would rather not dally on the phone all day Eventually I get to the reason why she feels she deserves twoApparently instead of calling when her item broke she opted to purchase a second item to temporarily replace her broken item It is also possible that it was meant to be a permanent replacement but after seeing how easy a time her daughter had with our replacement policy she might of opted to go through the process for her own item That is speculation of courseEither way she felt since she bought a second item which works perfectly according to her I should send her two of the more expensive original item since she had to spend more money obtaining the new less expensive one I am not sure how those two situations add up for some people but to me the math is off Besides the fact that we did not receive any kind of direct payment from her as she purchased the item through a retailer we also are not in any way responsible for how you chose to handle a situationAm I alone in thinking that her expectations were way off base Is this sort of compensation common in other industries Honestly it made the entire replacement order suspicious Your thoughts,I Should Get Two,36
Stachahof,5,10,1r0j3k,48,This is my first time posting here but Ive been lurking for quite a while  I work in a used media store thats privately owned by a nice guy and for the most part I love it  I get great discounts I have plenty of regular customers who I like and the entire atmosphere is pretty casual and laid back since there is no bigbad corporate to answer toThen there are the drawbacks  Threats and cursing from customers who dont like their cashtrade offers and just overall rude people  We also cater to lowincome people because our prices are so low the majority of our stock costs no more than  and while I dont want to generalize a lot of them arent the most desirable type of personThis particular story happened about a month ago  The couple in question is fairly regular though I havent seen much of them since this happened but Ive never liked them much  Theyre usually pretty loud and dismissive  This particular day they brought back a movie that apparently hadnt worked  They just wanted to exchange it for a different movie  No problem my coworker scanned their receipt and credited them  and they went to shopping  When they were finished they brought a stack of movies up to the counter for me to ring out  As I took them the man kept one and told me he didnt have to pay for that one because hed brought another back  Well call him Dumb FuckMe No problem sir I just need to scan it to take it out of the computer systemDF But I dont have to pay for itMe You wont sir  I just need to scan itReluctantly he hands me the DVD and I scan it with the rest of their movies  I apply their discount and their total ends up being  for five movies  The man pays and I think its finished when he turns to his wife and says to her not to me She charged me for that movieImmediately Im irritated that hes talking about me as though Im not there but I bite my tongue and explain to him that hed only paid for four movies  He ignores me and continues to tell his wife that Ive overcharged him  I pick up his movies which I havent bagged yet and stack them on top of each other adding the cost of them as I go      Then I took off the top movie the one hed gotten for free and set it aside    You only paid for four movies sir I smileDF I cant believe she fucking charged me for that movie when I had a refundI really have to fight back my anger at this pointMe Would you like me to go through the math again for you sirA miracle he finally addresses meDF I dont need anyone to do math for me Im real good at mathHe complains for a couple more minutes but eventually he takes his movies and leaves still convinced that he overpaid for them  I just sat down right there on the floor behind the counter and asked my coworker to please watch the floor for a minute  He couldnt stop laughing,She charged me,58

yohtin,39,70,1r052q,307,I used to work at a hotel as a night auditor overnight front desk guy It was mostly pretty safe but every now and again a homeless person would sneak into the building and try to sleep or steal food from the breakfast room I quit and got a new job for a lot of reasons mostly related to the fact that my manager was a terrible human being This was the straw on the camels back though One night I was delivering muffins to the breakfast room and was going to make coffee At about am I found and confronted a homeless guy and asked him if he was a guest He said Im tired of people asking me that question and unsheathed a big knife I dropped the muffins ran downstairs and called the police They showed up right away and he was already gone but had stolen a bunch of the muffins We had security cameras so I gave them a description of the guy and my managers number so she could send them the footageA few days later my manager called me into her office and before asking me if I was ok she passiveaggresively showed me the security footage of the homeless guy stealing the muffins She said that she understood why I ran away but I should have taken the muffins with me because now they were going to be short on muffins for the week I acknowledge I could have picked the muffins back up and ran with them back downstairs but not getting stabbed kind of took precedent at that momentSo yeah the moment I realized my manager gave more of a shit about breakfast muffins than whether or not I got stabbed was a big reason I quit I have a new job day job and am way happier now good riddance to that place,Breakfast muffins vs me getting stabbed Hmmmm yeah not really a choice at all,377
Cleverness,8,13,1r00wc,14,So I started working retail in July at a big box store as a cashier in NYC  I actually am enjoying myself here the customers at this store are mostly great and there has been no major problems  The management is great with scheduling me around class sick days etc and there are few things that I take notice of  Still alot of people pointed out to me that retail is evil and that I will eventually became insane myself from doing so  So I figure Ill post some things here that I encounterI have other things besides this as someone who is in his s and new to retail to see if anyone enjoys or relates to it  Long intro but yea lets carry onSo in my store its not uncommon for people to bring things up to the register say they changed their minds and hand it to me  I do not mind this at all  Infact I encourage it seeing merchandise placed in random places of the store where they dont belong annoys me more than anything  We can neatly sort it and send the items to their proper departments if they hand it to us cashiers  What I do not like are those who bring up a cart full of stuff and after ringing everything up the card is declined  Alot of times it will be because they are from out of state and the companies do it for their protection a quick call and its resolved I recall the transaction if I needed to suspend it and we finish upalot of the out of towners btw are great they are very friendly  Had a long chat with a guy from LA that I cant be too descriptive about to reveal where I work  Sometimes though someone will come up with a cart full of items their cards will get declined and they either A remove alot of the merchandise but once a card is declined I cant back out to the scanning menu for this transaction and have to start all over again  A minor pet peeve  Or of course B they say Ill get my other card from home and never return  So we have a cart full of items that now need to go backIt just boggles me how people dont keep track of what they can spend  Do they just grab whatever without looking at the price I can understand being a few dollars offI have some leeway I can do with discounts if I see someone is short and they arent a douche but off by  dollars Really  Especially this time of year where its busy,Sure we have nothing better to do than return merchandise you cant afford but put in your cart anyway,27
kingtigerii,20,13,1r00fh,92,Or How we just got skimmed by an EF tornado and you want your picturesSunday we had some bad weather roll through the area and the cell moving our way was a tornado spawner When the inevitable tornado sirens sounded I called a manager and let them know The following is a round about as to what happened nextpm Sirens sound for the county manager calledpm Store Director makes announcement that warning is in place Tells customers to wait for second announcement in  minutespm Announcement is made again that the Store Director suggests we take coverpm Manager suggests we unplug the photo kiosks to prevent electrical damagepm In the middle of the phone call with the manager she yells OH GOD THE DOORS and hangs up At this time I hear a loud explosion type noise and rumbling Instinct kicks in and I start screaming at people to get in the back cram as many people in the bathrooms as possiblepm People are trying to calm the screaming cashiers and employees The customers were super calm  go figure and I get paged over the intercom Its the manager and she sounds like shes shaken up badly Wants me to watch my cell phone and radarpm Try calling employee who is in at pm Hes like a brother so Im worried he was driving in Texting mom and other coworker Not sure of damage to storepm Getting sick of waiting in a hot and crowded bathroom with screaming cashiers panic filled environment isnt helping my coworker so i take her out too Radar says storm is passed No contact with coworker who is due in at pm Time line stopsSo I wander up to the front of the store to find that the roof is leaking in various spots but no major damage is done like many were saying Cashiers made it sound like the front of the store had collapsed when in reality it had simply taken roof damage and the glass awnings on the front of the store were gone later we found they had rolled atop the roof causing the damageNo sooner do I reach the front entrance when my buddy shows up laughing and soaking wet We joked around about it I explained what happened and we got to work roping off the middle of the store which was leaking badly Burst pipe and holes in the roof over the clothing departmentAs we are roping everything off and making sure nobody plays in the water my phone rings Now mind you we have emergency only power there are no registers open and the employees are thinking the management closed the store down until we can make sure nothing collapses or hurts anyone Around the store there are red phones that call an employee in the the department in which the phone is locatedIts a customer C for short Turns out were still opengo figureC  Hi there is nobody back here and we want our picturesMe  Maam there is nobody to help you back there because all available employees are assisting in cleanup and funneling customers out of the store Im sorry about the inconvenience I woul The customer then hung up on me and the phone rings againC  Hi can somebody come back here and give me my picturesMe attempting to do  things at once and make sure the dumb kid at my feet isnt playing in the possibly electrified water Maam the roof is leaking Nobody can help you photo is closed Please come back another day Sorry have a great night I hung up Few minutes later a couple teens walked by and were griping about shitty serviceSo my buddy and I get the department and most of the leaks roped off Manager calls and wants us to caution tape the front of the store outside where the glass awnings are missing in case anything falls I get cracking on that and avoid the reporter outside asking question on what happenedNext crisis we are still apparently open and need to close so we need to get customers checked out and out of the store I hop on lane and start with a transaction when the register looses power midway through There goes part of the emergency power CrapMy buddy is still open on the lane he jumped on so I help him with a couponer seriously she had a book Could have smacked her but we both kept smiling and got the store cleared out Signs get posted and we shut the doors Clean up timeEmployees start grabbing shopvacs off the shelves squeegees and anything else that can help like mops and buckets Others are pulling damaged product from the shelves and putting fallen things back up where they goIts about pm when we get another announcement from another Store Director The store is reopening at Midnight It comes as a demoralizing blow because instead of working towards cleanup we realize we are all simply here to reopen quick as possible and make the company more money Most of the people on overtime started to leave because they just stopped caring I decided to stay until my buddy left couldnt leave him alone with the messNormal cleanup until around pm when the Store Director from the previous announcement announces that we are now open for business My buddy and I look at each other and the still massive pool of water on the ground and decide weve had enough We pick up our mess and tell the nearest manager were leaving Ive got two hours of overtime and my buddy has an am class She tells us to put some stuff back really quick and get out By the time this was completed it was pm We were tired wet and hungryApparently the EF skipped over the store causing only minor damage compared to the industrial complex it wrecked prior to the store and the houses and drivein movie theater that were leveled after the store Thankfully it also missed the two hospitals that are next to the storeTLDR Met a man made of tin scarecrow and a talking lion and we skipped down a brick road to meet a wizard,Maam the roof is leaking And other Tornado stories,105

zobe,8,11,1qynfk,0,Okay so a former coworker and friend of mine posted this on her bloghttpcurlycrankycollegegirltumblrcom and I just wanted to share it with you all since some of us fast food workers can definitely relate And the rest of you can learn from thisEdited from OP for content chainproduct names I personally edited and added to the list below as wellI think it is important for everyone in America to hold a job in food service That way the human race will start to evolve from total jerks thinking they are entitled to order a six piece chicken strip basket at the window after spending three and a half minutes just to order a large oreo treat to normal human beings Fast food is still FOOD Granted the job is not as glamorous as being the editor in chief for a magazine or head chef at a high class restaurant in Socal  but end the end it is still a job I think it is high time that society gets rid of the stereotype that only losers work in the food industry I honestly enjoyed my time working at ice creamfast food restaurant minus the rough moments Ask anyone I would go back in a heartbeat My coworkers became my friends minus the stupid ones And I will always look back at the memories I created I got the job when the neighborhoods popular playcenter closed for the first time in over  years Playcenter had been apart of my life since I was  years old and my mom started working there I was well versed in how the business was run At age  I was running the front of the center greeting customers and stamping play cards as well as working the snack counter in the back At age  I started helping my mom work birthday parties By age  I was in the store by myself from open to close Playcenter wasnt a job it was a life style Playcenter had changed hands many times Luckily for my mom and I the previous owners always put in a good word for us and we kept our jobs That was until  Due to some underhanded nonsense I was not apart of my mother and I did not make the transfer over to the new owners For the first time in my lifeI had to FIND a job Luckily my bff came through for me yet again and put in a good word for me at  Then my future in ice cream began When I was first starting out it was rough My coworkers and I didnt know each other I couldnt memorize how many scoops of candy went into cookie dough treat and customers were mean I hope if there is one thing you take from this particular post you take away a new awareness for the workers at fast food establishments Anyone who is employed deserves respect no matter what the job is Minus people at the DMV They hate their lives I have learned many life lessons at  Most of them from my coworkers Most of them from my manager he has common sense Most of them involving the negative aspects of prostitution But thats besides the pointThe most important thing I learned from working at  was how to order in drive through And now I am going to share this great knowledge with youI give you the  commandments for ordering fast food Welcome to  How can I take your orderSpeak loudly and clearly DO NOT HAVE THE PASSENGER ORDER we usually cant hear them Feel free to say hi to who ever is taking your order DO NOT ask how their day was DO NOT repeat their name to them Its weird Just order  Make sure your kids arent screaming and your dog isnt barking It kills our ears over the headset we cant hear you the driver and its just rude DO NOT ask what our favorite item is  We usually dont have a preference  If you dont know what you want GO INSIDE OR JUST GO HOME  If you need more time to decide politely tell the order person that you are still deciding or need a moment The number one thing to remember is to notify the worker when you are done deciding Communication is key  When ordering ITEMCOMBO SIZE FLAVOR If you are getting a combo know what you want to drink  Notify us early if you have coupons Its easier to apply the discount when we are initially ringing you up versus making changes at the window Dont bitch about the prices We dont make them If you know the biggest US fast food chain right across the street sells the same ice cream cone for like a dollar go there then Well happily cancel your order for you Our ice cream tastes much better anyways Please try to make sure you have your cashcard readily available when you get to the window ESPECIALLY if you are waiting in a line of cars in front of you You have no excuse to not be ready when you pull up to the window Plus you are wasting everyones time by digging through your purse for a full minute AND NEVER PAY IN ALL COINS By the time were done counting that shit out your ice cream has already melted  Get off your phone If we try to ask you a question and you dont hear us thats your problem Now you are definitely not getting any ketchup with your fries Dont add on food at the window It adds to our drive time and time is money Plus everyone else now has to wait another  minutes or more for your piece chicken strip basket to cook  Mistakes happen Feel free to preferably come inside or roll back through the drive through and very quickly explain the situation We will be happy to fix something for you as long as you dont bitch about it In that case we will spitefully fix something for you  And pretty please dont come through the drive through high off your ass I learned what weed smells like at my job This is not what I had in mind when I was told Id gain life experience by workingcurlygirl and zobeTLDR Know what you want when you come through the drive through have your money ready and dont be rude Fast

DoomedPetunias,5,10,1qyioh,34,Nine months out of the year I work as a manager on duty to a gift shop which contributes to a large theater company and is almost entirely volunteer operated As you can imagine we carry everything from books to bardic bobbleheadsIn my time spent there Ive seen my share of sticky fingers  usually belonging to the younger crowd and going no further than a gourmet caramel or two which is why this lady was particularly memorable She was easily in her late sixties short and rotund and entirely inconspicuous until I saw the wigglePart of my job is to make the rounds on the floor to make sure everything is running smoothly I spot the lady in question with a miniature Monet calendar in hand Its slightly larger than a piece of toast I make a mental note and move further down my route when I see her dart furtively into a corner of the store At this point Ive gone partly up our short staircase and have an aerial view of her moving strangely in front of the wall When she turns around again the calendar is goneWe hold a strict policy of not apprehending shoplifters in our store which has always been so frustrating but I usually find little ways around it I approached the woman who now had a visible rectangle protruding from the front of her trousers With the most negligent glance in that area I smiled brightly and asked Would you like a basket for thatShe blanched and stammering out a negative brushed by me like the calendar had caught fire I had done what I could I maintained my distance but kept a keen eye on her while she pretended to browse for a few minutes before hurrying out the door I wasnt too concerned because before she left I had seen another wiggle and there Sitting on top of our tower of fruit preserves was the MonetTLDR On where NOT to hang a Monet and thank god for shrink wrap,Would you like a basket for that,44
TheGreatFalloni,4,3,1qygwp,22,I work in a big box retail store  This woman is buying a  vizio I think it was  I get the tv from the back she pays for it and I take it on a cart out to her car She starts walking out to the very back of the lot where her Escalade is parked  She has a trailer behind the Escalade the big kind you use to tow a car with  She asks me to put the tv face down on the open trailer  Keep in mind if she slams on the brakes hits a bump or goes around a turn the tv will fly off and shatter  She didnt want to put the dusty tv box in her Escalade  I explain what will happen and she starts getting all pissy with me  Im just trying to cover my ass so she she cant get me fired when her  tv breaks on the drive home  So eventually she agrees and she sits there like a queen as I load this giant tv by myself into her Escalade  She speeds away without giving me a tip  Thanks a lot,Be considerate and have some common sense,25
nihlius,1,7,1qygoh,20,So I work at a popular office supplies store and most days Im on are pretty dead so I tend to remember most people who come in more than once However this tale is about a pair of guys who waltzed in at about  on a Sunday evening Both of them look to be between  sweatpants hoodies general casual clothes Im a decent distance from them but I greet them regardless I only get some mumbles back but thats okay maybe theyre third shift workers who just got up or something I want judging yet They come to the only open register mine about  minutes later with a popular office chair which with tax comes out to being just over USD When they start pulling out ones I knew it just turned all sideways Once I was starting to count their money I smelled the distinct scent of weed but hey whatever stoners need chairs too right Two twenties sixty seven ones and  cents in change later they start to leavewithout the chair The box is still on the counter I called out to them and they both turned around After a second I get We needa cart They were both plenty big enough to carry the box it wasnt heavy either So they came back with a cart deposited the chair into the cart and proceeded to leaveExcept they parked the cart in the main entrance keeping the automatic doors open and disappearing into the aisles again By this point everyone on at the time is smirking and the supervisor is trying not to laugh No one moved the cart and no one came in during the period it was sitting in the doorway and after about  minutes the dynamic duo exited the store with their chair Havent seen them again since just gotta hope they didnt come back being all like man we dont even WANT this chair  Taking back furniture without a receipt is nigh impossible when they paid cashso much cashTLDR slow night Dr Doom and Frankenstein walk in order a drink share it make out on the counter leave with more electric Boogaloos than they entered with ,Stoners  Electric Boogaloo,27
SleepKittySleep,4,8,1qyf6u,19,Long time lurker first time poster Im a hostess that works only mornings and double shifts on weekends I am a  year old girl who is nice to everyoneBackground I work at a TexMex restaurant thats known for its patio People mostly come to eat outside on the patio not for the food in particular It can seat up to  people and takes up a city block Its been open over  years and is family run There are at least over  people employed About  waiterswaitresses work inside and about  outside during the weekends There are  busboys per section  hostesses in total  work insiderest outside there are  kitchens and  managers all related It can get VERY busy on the weekends Theres a hostess to each section and I usually work the line Most of the times there is an hour to  hour wait to be seated It takes a person with a lot of patience to be able to work the line We have to be able to walk through every time while having people complain and yell about the wait There are a lot selfentitled people who throw around a managers name Doesnt look hard but it is People do get mean when theyre hungryFirst manager L is head manager Hes real laid back and awesome Second is J cool but tough and scary He basically runs everything Third Z is sort ofbipolar I guess She is awesome one second but mean the next Tends to mess things up She works mostly inside Third is B a lazy ass who only works  hours at the end of everyday She only knows how to complain She HATES me Everyone hates her too though I see her  days out of the weekStory This took place on the patio Sunday night around pm There were only  hours till closing Besides me there were  other hostesses outside Our line had just ended and I was ready to finally start walking around When we work line were not suppose to move from the front unless necessary since we have a clipboard on who is next to be seatedAs soon as B arrives we all groan She always has some thing to complain about ALWAYS At least Z guides us but L literally does nothing Most of us have no clue to what she contributes to this restaurantAnyways people are coming and going Were giving our usual Hey how are you Enjoy Have a good night Were all in a good mood Every one of us are taking turns seating tables Were all doing are part This was going on for about  minutes until it finally died down Our head hostess was was taking care of the busboys and their stations  hostesses were helping put tablecloths while me and Awere watching the frontI had just came from a section in the back after seating table I was literally at the front for two minutes before B comes up to A and IB then asks Do you know a Mexican man with red shirt is sitting He was with his girlfriend or somethingWe both reply no This was not acceptableReally You dont know He was just here Her smile falteringA is really sweet nice and doesnt like to get in trouble so I reply for her The other hostesses might have sat themWho else is hereI answer with the same fake smile she has and name the other  hostessesShes getting a bit mad now And none of you know where you sat him She looks at both of us in disbelief then looks at A and asks What section are you atAfter A answers she asks who is doing lineup I reply that I am At this point I know this conversation isnt going to be pleasant They never are For some reason the moment we met we did not get along I guess its cause I hate that shes selfcentered and spoiled for her age Also because with her I tend to be a smart assYou really dont remember him He was wearing a red shirt She snortsIt took me all I had to not reply back with a smart ass comment There was literally a man with a red shirt in front of me So I say After a while everyone looks the same to meShe laughs Are you serious Cant you remember anybody You dont remember himI didnt seat him I just took a table to OU It wasnt meShe then calls me out Youre lying Ten minutes ago you were standing up here when he was here I was talking to the copI knew she was lying I was being honest I saw hundreds of people this morning I do line I can guarantee that if youre sitting in the patio I saw your face at least once Eventually youre only a number to me Not a face I worked a double that day with a non stop rush I was tiredWell then I dont remember They all look the same to me I smileStill smiling she looks at me I can tell shes expecting an apology Hell no I smile just as bigAfter  seconds of awkward smiling she turns to A and says Unbelievable Do you remember everyone you seatA is stuttering unable to answer I can tell she wants to stick up for me but she doesnt want to get in troubleLuckily a waitress D also her cousin also works as assistant manager some times comes and begins to talk to her She leaves as I laugh at herTurns out this Mexican man with a red shirt had only moved her furnitureTLDR Manager searches for man who moved her furnitureIt may not seem like a big deal but she has this way about her that I just despise Sorry it was long I wanted to give an idea of how big this place isEdit I cant name correctly ,Man with the red shirt,27

acelam,8,13,1qyego,46,Im fairly new to retail and used to think that some retail employees exaggerated how ignorant andor rude their customers could be However these last two months have proven me wrong on every single level The public is full of rude and downright strange people Cue my storyAbout a week ago I was working on the sales floor A lady walks in with her son who appears to be in his twenties Immediately the son asks where our restroom is located which I didnt think was strange because its very rare for men to be happy about being in the store I workOnce I sent him on his way his mother and I began talking about some dining room furniture She tells me about how she found the same couch Oprah has on the side of the road and had it reupholstered so she was looking for complimentary chairs I internally rolled my eyes about the same couch as Oprah comment but whatever She seemed very eager to buy furniture and I dont give a damn what you tell me as long as youre ready to buy from meSo after showing her some selections of dining chairs I left her to peruse her options and went to help another customer whod walked in while Id been talking to her On my way to the other customer however her son finds me and stops me pointing to a rip in his shirt and saying Hey theres a nail sticking out in the mens restroom and I ripped my shirt on it You need to have it removedI apologized for the fact that hed ripped his shirt and told him that Id remove the nail as soon as possible He left and I finished helping the second customer before returning back to him and his motherInstantly before I could ask her how she liked our selection she says My son ripped his shirt on a nail in the mens restroom Did he tell you about thisAgain I apologized and told her that I planned on removing the nail as soon as I was able The store wasnt swamped but there were only two associates on the sales floor and our manager was having to handle paperwork in the back So neither of us could really disappear in case things did get busy or we had a customer ready to check outThe lady replied Well is that all youre planning to do I wasnt sure what more she wanted me to do so I told her that I would make my manager aware of the problem and that I would immediately take the nail out of the wall instead of waitingI went to my managers office and sort of hovered around briefly explaining the issue at hand My manager rolled her eyes and asked Is she expecting us to pay for the shirt or what All you can do is just get rid of the nail if there even is oneSo I grabbed the hammer and went to the mens restroom  sure enough there was no nail at least not one in a place where a persons shirt would get snagged Our restrooms display clearance paintingswall art that are hung up high and behind toilets so unless the son was doing some climbing there was no way he couldve gotten his shirt hung upI sighed and returned back to the motherson duo and asked the son where the nail was specifically as I could not find a nail anywhere that hed hang his shirt onHe then backtracks and says Well uh it wasnt exactly a nail It was those silver hook things on the doorThe silver hook things are the very blunt very wide hooks used to hang pursesbags while a person uses the restroom Given what the rip on his shirt looked like there was absolutely no way the purse hanger wouldve caused that ripHis mother again looks at me and says So what are you going to do about his shirt Its ripped because of your storeI apologized and told her that I couldnt take down the purse hangers She looks like Ive slapped her and says Well I dont care if you take them down or not Thats a Ralph Lauren shirt Its a hundred and fifty dollars I want to know what your store plans to do to pay for the shirt that you damaged If I broke a candle Id have to pay for thatI wanted to tell her that maybe her son probably shouldnt wear expensive clothes while he was out shopping I also wanted to tell her that our store actually doesnt have a you break it you buy it policy because if we did all of us employees would never make a dime lol But I just calmly said again that there was nothing I could do and I was very sorry Her face twisted up and she immediately turned around and stomped out her son right behind herAfterward my manager told me she figures it was probably a scam As I didnt get a look at the shirt when the son came in I had no idea if it was ripped before hand or not though I highly suspect it was Either way my manager supposed that in another store if this woman had continued to raise a stink an overtired associatemanager may throw her a  discount to just shut her upSo guys beware of potential scammers as the holidays get here Maybe this guy really did rip his shirt in our bathroom but how in the world is that anyones fault but his Ridiculous no matter how you cut it,Its my fault that you ripped your own shirt,59

worksinapetstore,62,64,1qybg3,326,ANTICLIMATIC UPDATEWell I got an email back this morning from our customer service rep telling me that the woman had called  However she is no longer in charge of customer service calls and redirected the call to a brand new office  I have not heard anything further about the situation  We hadnt heard about it yet because it literally was being announced that afternoon during a conference call  I asked my store manager to let me know if we got an email back from this new office but there was nothing in the email today  If I hear anything Ill be back here with an updateBACKGROUNDAs my username suggests I work in a pet store  A corporately owned pet store to give you a little more insight  Im a shift supervisor and so I tend to close by myself and it then becomes my job to handle the majority of customer service issues  Ill also preface this story by explaining that our store has a new no complaints policy  Corporate has been receiving too many customer calls that are complaints that corporate feels should have been handled at the store level  The manager staff has been told that we are to do whatever it takes to keep a customer from calling corporate    I could probably write a whole post about how I die a little bit inside each time I have to give a discount to somebody who in any other store would be told to hit the road Ill also mention right now if we werent under this new no complaints policy I would have asked her to shop elsewhere about  seconds into this whole ordeal  Then again I guess I wouldnt have this story if I hadTHE STORYSo I was doing my nightly rounds of the store making sure everything looked nice and neat when I ran into Eighteen Dollar Lady EDL for the rest of the story Me Hi there are you finding everything you need tonEDL As a matter of fact Ive found what I needed but Ive got something to say to YOU Me Sure what can I help you with EDL You can explain to me why this dog food is so damn

FoodhttpswwwgooglecomsearchqwellnesscoreorignialamprlzCCHFXenUSUSampoqwellnesscoreorignialampaqschromeijljjampsourceidchromeampespvampessmampieUTFessmampespvampqwellnesscoreoriginalamptbmshop  This is a fairly high end food  In our store it runs for about  dollars for that size bag  The reason the price is so high is because they use high quality proteins in their food and they use several other ingredients with higher nutritional value instead of a filler like corn   I attempted to explain all of this to her but I didnt get a word outMe Well its a  EDL begins yelling out of nowhere YOU KNOW I NEVER COME HERE ANYWAY  I ALWAYS SHOP AT privately owned store  minutes from our location  THEY HAVE THIS FOOD FOR EIGHTEEN DOLLARS THEREthis is the where the broken record part of the story comes inalso my thoughts will be in italicsEIGHTEEN DOLLARS  EIGHTEEN DOLLARSEIGHTEEN DOLLARSHOW CAN THEY HAVE THE SAME SIZE BAG FOR EIGHTEEN DOLLARS  HOW COME YOU ARE CHARGING SO MUCHtheres no way the other store charges that for this bag of foodour cost for it is around  or so bucks to begin with and no store would sell it for below costEIGHTEEN DOLLARSEIGHTEEN DOLLARS  EIGHTEENDOLLARSis this

to stop yellingMe  Mam Im sorry to hear that but do you perhaps have a reciept or an ad showing their price  I dont set the prices here but I can offer you a price match if you have  EDL  WHO THE HELL CARRIES AROUND THEIR DOG FOOD RECIEPTSMe Well if you give me a moment I can look up privately owned store  minutes from our locations number and verify their price EDL NO  I shouldnt have to go through all that just to get the right price  ITS EIGHTEEN DOLLARS  WHY ARE YOU SO GREEDYwhat theMe  Again Id be happy to give you the food for that price but in order to ring an actual price match on the register I need some sort of verification that the same product is that price at the other storeand thats pushing it were not really supposed to go below cost to make a bitch like you happyEDL NO I WANT AN EXPLANATION  I WANT AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY YOUR FOOD IS  DOLLARS AND THEIR FOOD IS  DOLLARSWow  Fuck you lady  Im trying to help you hereMe  Well as I mentioned before this is fairly high end food  They use a lot of high quality ingredients so its more expensive to make  But you are getting a very good quality food for the moneyEDL  NO THIS FOOD ISNT THAT GOOD  ITS NOT HIGH END IF ITS EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AT THE OTHER STORE  DONT YOU LIE TO MESERIOUSLY  Dont call me a liar  If you want your damn food for  dollars go to the other damn store Please just swear at me so I can kick you outEDL  WHO DO I HAVE TO CALL TO GET THIS ANSWERED  WHOMe  Well Im a shift supervisor so if youd like the next point of contact is my manager who will be in tomorrowEDL NO  I WANT SOMEBODY HIGHER UPCrap  Were not supposed to let them call corporate until weve done everything at the store level to keep them happyMe Well Ill tell you what  I think I can scrape together a few store coupons to take about  dollars off your bag I died a little bit inside saying this by the wayMe  Would that be ok with youEDL  NO  I DONT CARE ABOUT A DISCOUNT  I JUST WANT A NUMBER TO CALL  YOU CORPORATE BIG BOX PET STORES ARE SO GREEDYside note I dont work for either of the two stores that probably come to mind when I say big box store  Its a corporate store yeah but weve only got about  stores total Were actually cheaper compared to the other two big pet stores that probably come to mindMe  Mam I dont set the prices  I can give you a number for our customer service representative and I can give you some coupons to bring the price down a lot more than I quite honestly should  EDL  NO  I WANT WHOEVER SETS THE PRICESFucking seriously  Nope  Shes not getting anything other than our CS repEDL Mam I dont have that information I can give you the number for our customer service rep and if shes not able to help you out then she will give you the number of somebody higher up  EDL Fine  We get up to the register  I find a few store coupon PLUs that we have to use in situations like this  Its meant to be a last resort that maybe just maybe if a customer sees the price come down that much they wont call corporate   Even though I know shes going to call corporate anyway  I still give her the coupons off  I think because all that will happen if I dont do it is corporate will fucking send her a  gift card for her troubles  Because to them shes one more customer that will spend money in our store so lets give her  bucks now to keep her coming backall about that bottom line for themShe finished her transaction and left the store Knowing that shes going to call corporate I now had to write an email to the customer service rep detailing the whole incident  And then I had an ideaI pulled out the yellow pagesI looked up that privately owned pet shop that was about  minutes away from usI called them from my cell phone pretending to be a customer Asked them if they had Wellness Core Original in the  lb bag and what the price was if they did The guy came back on the phone after checking They do not carry a  lb bag at all of that brand  They carry the largest size  lb  Its Our price on our  lb bag is   Were cheaper than them  WERE CHEAPER THAN THEM  I pretty much was dancing at that point I wont know how everything went down on the corporate end of things until tomorrow  Im praying and praying that they tell her to shove it  because I REAAAAAALLLY wanted to  And Im hoping that maybe this particular nutcase makes them rethink their no complaints policyTLDR  EIGHTEEN DOLLARS MOTHERFUCKERS,EIGHTEEN DOLLARS EIGHTEEN DOLLARS EIGHTEEN DOLLARS,390
denrae,7,6,1qyazy,32,The other day while working at my local grocery store an older woman came through my check out line She was using a walker and had a VERY severe hunch back Her head was actually lower than my register it was so bad I was just finishing up with bagging the items for the customer in front of her The lady directly behind the woman says to her Here sweetie let me help you put your things on the counter She had her items in bags tied to the sides of her walker the woman turns and yells at this friendly lady and tells her NOT to touch her items because that is HER meaning me job I could tell that she was going to be very difficult after that so I proceeded with extreme cautionfriendliness I started ringing her items and asked her how she was doing She then starts mumbling to herself and yells Well I guess Ill dig out my store card since you didnt ask for it and obviously WERENT GOING TO because you dont care I apologized to her for not asking before I started her order and as I was waiting for her to find it I bagged her items up with paper inside of plastic exactly like she yelled at me to do My manager who is almost sickeningly sweet on an every day basis could see the woman was being difficult so she came over to ask the woman if she needed help paying or getting out to the car The woman started mumbling to herself about how I shoved all her items into one bag  there were three bags with maybe four items in each because I figured she couldnt lift much  and how she doesnt even know what I did with all her stuff it was sitting on the counter My manager helped her slide her card through the card reader helped her read the screen pushed the buttons for her etc all while being talked down to by this woman She then demanded my manager get her a cart by yelling I NEED a CART about four or five times My manager just kept saying Okay sweetie Ill help you and goes to get her a cart She puts the womans items into the cart and goes to help her to her car when the woman just starts yelling STOP just STOP HERE and leaves And then today a customer came through my line with a gift bag I dont think she spoke English very well She handed me the bag and just said For you It was a hand knitted or crocheted not sure which red and green hat I didnt know her She just gave me a homemade gift just because Its the sweetest thing a stranger has ever done especially while at work I really almost cried cause it was just so unexpected I will never forget that moment I deal with a lot of jerks because I work in customer service I bite my tongue on a daily basis People ignore me treat me like Im an idiot and belittle me because they think Im lower class than they are I get judged constantly and sometimes I just want to scream in a customers face YOU ARE NOT BETTER THAN ME I WORK MY ASS OFF EVERY DAY I WORK SO SO HARD TO IMPROVE MY LIFE I STARTED FROM NOTHING AND I DID ALL OF THIS ON MY OWN IVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE HERE IN A YEAR THAN MOST HAVE IN  But I never doFor that woman to go out of her way like that just to say thank you thank you for being here to wait on me means so much When I hear comments like You work so hard Or You do everything here Do you ever go home it gets me through those difficult customers Sorry if I seem overly emotional about it but having something so infuriating happen then be followed by something so heartwarming gets my emotions all pumped up ,Some people are just so nasty,38

Sigillite,15,21,1qxrkh,66,For the past couple of months I have been working at a restaurant in my hometown I had been let down by being told by my college that I wouldnt be able to get a position which would have gotten me out of the service industry for goodThat same day though I walked in after seeing their ad posted got an interview and an offer all within a half hour Awesome Turned my day right around For about a month all was wellThe owner Mike was great came from the service side so he was flexible with staff great with guests and ran a really tight ship One of my favorite managers of any job His wife Stephanie though was just awful She was great at the business and catering side of the restaurant but get her anywhere near a guest or come to her with an issue and she would find some way to make it worseMy training was next to nothing aside from learning the menu and showing me around It was a new computer system and thanks to that I would make mistakes that would piss her off yet how am I supposed to know the proper procedure if noone ever told me in the first place The way that they did addons or changes to a menu item was not what I was used to yet noone told me what I was doing was wrong until more than two months into the jobShe also would constantly talk down to the wait staff I dunno how to explain it but every time she had a criticism or asked us to do something it was like she had asked us to do it twenty times before and we were all the stupidest people in the world When I didnt know the ordering procudure for example she said Youve been here for a while shouldnt you know this already Well no you ass because I only had four days of training and the people who trained me were fired not a week after I startedRed flags all over the placeIm also in grad school which is so far above this stupid job on my priorities list I have to decompress on my way home or Ill get the bends Whats unusual about my program though is that we have  week terms I started in August and so my availability originally had me working about  shifts a week It was just too much on top of the grad school workload which was much more than I had anticipated I asked to reduce my shifts to only  on thursday friday and saturday mornings Lunch is busy so I made plenty of money for what I needed and they seemed ok with itWhen my class schedule changed though I couldnt work thursday mornings anymore I told them that a week before it changed and I was still scheduled thursday No big deal I left class early and was there on time Next week same thing I left class early and reminded Stephanie that my availability had changed and I couldnt work thursday mornings moving forward She made a big huff and acted like changed the schedule was the worst thing in the world Apparently it is really hard to move people around because everyone has the shifts that they like and Not a lot of people can work thursdaysKeep in mind that they havent replaced  servers that have left in the two months I have been there It is me and three other waiters the rest are bartenders Sorry not my fault I open up my availability so that I could work any night of the week friday and saturday mornings as long as I kept my three shift a week schedule So last week I wasnt scheduled for anything weird computer systems being what they are though I assume its a mistake I can still log in online and see the schedule but Im not on it I call the restaurant and the hostess tells me that I am not on the schedule Ok what the fuck Are you really doing this I wait until its been two weeks with no schedule to call back and ask to talk to her And she wont talk to me What the hell man be unprofessional and let me know Im fired by not scheduling me fine but at least tell me WHYShe really pissed me off through this whole thing so I was thinking of a way to get back at them and my girlfriend suggested filing for unemployment benefits which will cause their federal unemployment tax to go up whether I get the benefits or not because of their high turnover rate ,So long and thanks for well nothing,87
InspectorVII,11,12,1qxqo3,53,Nothing flips the bitch switch faster than when a customer hears no and then breaks into the sob storyToday I had an attempted return  No receipt discontinued product in all probability something I havent sold in quite a long time  Let alone yesterday as the customer had claimed I should mention at this point yesterday was Sunday we are not open on Sunday  As graciously as my little heart could bear I declined to do the refund on the long discontinued well used product  However I did note that if she does happen to located the receipt our return policy does extend  days and I may be able to work something out with a valid receipt  With that I am usually done off to the next customer  However I would not be ranting hear if the customer accepted defeat and moved on with lifeHis first argument was I just bought this it is defective  To which I reiterate without valid recipient I unfortunately cannot refund youSecond argument was  You should guarantee things  You are ripping off your customers  To which I reply  I absolutely do guarantee things with valid receiptThis argument I am in here all the time you should remember me  You should know I bought this  How do you even do business if you dont know who your customers are  To which I reply that I see hundreds possibly thousands of different faces every week   The final straw was that This is for my friend who is dying  Do you know how hard it is to care for somebody who is dying You are making this situation much worse  Dont you have any empathy  Dont you even care  All you fucking care about is money  Youre nothing but a con artistCue bitch modeI respond at this point now shaking mad Sir we are done here  Leave nowHowever this is an unacceptable solution  He continues into a story about how much suffering his friend is enduring and how he doesnt have the money to replace defective items   How I am a horrible person for not doling out freebies because somebody tells me a sad storyEventually after about  minutes of ignoring him he left taking a business card on the way out  My business card the manager   I look forward to that complaintI should elaborate the reason why this bothers me so much is because we all deal with our fair share of personal tragedy it is difficult and unfortunate part of life  It is also inevitable   Some of us are entrenched in it  Some of us are working past it  Some of us are just starting the journey   It is not that I dont want you to share  It is not that I wont lend a sympathetic ear  It is just when you use it as a trump card and assume that I have no understanding of what this is like I become very offended,Personal Tragedy is not currency,65

vegasyndrome,14,13,1qwpva,22,Lets say they are in your store They have a product in their hands and the next thing that comes out of their mouth is Your competitor XYZ is selling this product  less Can you do a price matchOf course I always check to see if its true I go on their website and call from a private line I also ask the following questions Do you have it in stockIf they dont thats usually the main reason why they are asking for the price match They cant get their hands on it over at XYZ If they do have it in stock What colours or styles do you carry if applicableDoesnt make sense for me to do a price match if they dont stock the same colours or styles as my storeDespite verifying the price of a product at XYZ if they dont have exactly what the customer wants then I wont entertain the thought of a price match We also refuse to price match with big box stores because they are able to buy pallets and can afford to sell at a lower price which we cant Some companies we sign an agreement every year to agree to sell at the MSRP to balance out the playing field among stores I know some managers who call up distributors and reps to rat out other stores that advertise a lower price The most recent on I heard was a popular UK juvenile brand cut out a certain large online store for selling below the MSRPHow do you guys feel about price matching or other store policies,Why I dont price match,35

RenM,60,18,1qwc0g,121,So I used to work as a pharmacy technician which means I both handled prescriptions and rang up everyday shopping items for customers It was a combo hell Here are some of the stories We had a regular that was HIV positive super nice but also a bit mentally disabled His mother often brought him to the store or just picked up his meds for him However one day he came in without her and we exchanged our normal pleasantries He said he needed a refill I said I needed a new prescription he pulls it out of his wallet and I see that his finger is bleeding it looked like a paper cut He take out his prescription with said bleeding finger and attempts to hand it to me Normally policy is to hold a customer until you are done running the script incase insurance feels like making the job extra awful Instead I say while typing Oh no name It looks like you cut yourself Just put the script on the counter and here take a bandage which I dont hand to him but instead place on the counter normally rude but Well call you when the script is ready He just smiles says thanks puts on the bandaid and walks away I smile until he disappears behind an aisle and then tell the pharmacist what just happened In the end we cleaned it up and my manager actually called his mom His mom apologized She was sick and he wanted to run errands on his own I guess she explained to him that he cant bleed on public things bc he apologized profusely the next time he came in with her  Our duties board is posted in a place that customers can see it This means if they feel like being creepy they can tell when you start work get off work or take a lunch break I had one older gentleman look at my name tag then at the board and then he said Ill be waiting for you at pm Then he winked and walked away The assistant manager walked me to my car that night Another older gentleman came to pick up his viagra That stuff is expensive so most men only get a few pills at a time and refill as necessary This man said My wife and I dont do it that often anymore Maybe one of these pills has your name on it Me No Im pretty sure they just say Pfizer on one side and VGR  on the other Sorry Then I walked away  I lady comes up to buy a behindthecounter cold medicine Me Can I see your drivers license please Lady No Me Kind of caught off guard UmI need it to sell you the medicine Lady Why Me State law Lady Why She was well into her s so Im not sure why she was mimicking a toddlerMe Because some of the ingredients can be used to make illegal drugsLady Like whatMe MethLady I dont make meth Can I have it now pleaseMe No I still need a drivers licenseThen she asked for the manager I got the pharmacist and she had nearly the exact same conversation with her The lady ended up just leaving To this day I still think she was screwing with us My favorite story There was a doctor in the area that had a couple of his prescription pads nicked All the pharmacies were on alert and he had already agreed to call in any prescriptions until he could get new pads made Well a couple comes in and not to judge but they were the rattiest dirtiest couple I had ever seen I mean they actually had dirt on them and smelled like they hadnt bathed in weeks and gives me a prescription for a Class  Controlled Substance I had never seen filled in my  years of working there We always had a bottle stocked but I never saw us actually fill a prescription for it This was my first red flag Then I get to the doctors name and its just a scribble not really uncommon so I go to the typewritten section and realize its for the doctor that had his prescription pads stolen I tell them Im sorry but I cant fill the prescription I dont give them a reason why I hadnt thought this through yet So they say okay and instead of leaving pull out a second prescription but for a simple Class  Controlled Drug This time I just take the prescription smile and say Ill call you when its ready Instead I called the cops  Finally my last story which shows that sometimes its not the customer that is the jerk Its a pharmacy We sell Plan B If you are over  you do not need a prescription So Im working prescription drop off the pharmacist is mixing up a compound and my least favorite coworker is working prescription pick up Its late so it is just the three of us and I had no customers so Im just filling the next days orders when a lady walks up to the pick up area She is a good  feet away and very quiet so I cant really hear what she says Apparently my coworker couldnt hear her either bc she goes What The customer speaks up and all I hear is Plan B I know my coworker hates all birth control but what she does next is mortifying Lady mumble mumble Plan B mumble mumbleCoworker Oh She looks at me and opens her mouth Me thinking Dont you dare do it Dont you dareCoworker yelling This lady wants some Plan B Will you take care of it I wont fill a baby killing drugThere is a loud clanging as the pharmacist drops her pestle the customer begins to cry and I am just standing there jaw open The pharmacist could not control herself She yells my coworkers name and brings her into the back room I take care of the crying customer and get her a gift card that more than pays for the Plan B I apologize profusely and she leaves no longer crying but obviously upset My coworker comes out upset and angry but she returns to her job About  minutes later Im off for the night so I clock out I walk from behind the counter to pick up look at my coworker and go I need to pick up a prescription pause Its my birth control Its not Plan B but she hates it too She turns red looks at the pharmacist who goes nope and then gets me my prescription That was her last week ,Pharmacy Stories,139

PWNDUINMK,47,21,1qw874,93,Wall of text incomingGOSo I work at a retail pharmacyconvenience store I dont work within the pharmacy but I work at the front end of the store where I am one of the managers Although its not entirely significant to this story Ill let you know that the front end is open ampm  days a week while the pharmacy is open ampm weekdays and ampm weekends On with the showSo the night before last I had two very drugged out  somethings come into my store They were both wearing jogging pants and jogging jackets with zippers His was grey dirty and far too baggy for him causing the pants to droop Hers was black and probably the right size but her jacket was zipped open to reveal a tshirt that was many sized too small leaving  inches of flabby midriff exposed Both of them were as pale as ghosts and have the telltale facial marks of meth addictionThey come straight up to the counter and ask if the pharmacy is open I assure them that as it is  pm on a sunday it is not open at this time The male asks if there is another pharmacy nearby that would be open I tell him that I dont know off hand but that I can check our system to see I go into the office and see that there is a  hour store just a few miles away form usI return to the male who is at the front counter and ask him if he is walking or driving He looks at me puzzled for a second as if to say Where am I  going His drugged out train of though reminds him that he asked about the pharmacy and he replies driving I tell him that there is a  hour store less than  miles from here I offer him the address and he loses concentration for a moment He then asks me if I know any of our nearby competitors pharmacy hours  I do notHis initial reason for needing a  hour pharmacy was that we are the only ones that take his insurance Now he is rambling that he will check the competitors to see if they take his insurance At this point he runs off into an aisle to meet his woman I tell my cashier to find them and watch them like hawks while I man the register He nods in agreement and makes his way over to themThe man and woman have a very loud expletive filled conversation with one another about what they should get The man comes to the front to get cigarettes Im worried that the drug use has artificially aged him so I ask for his ID He doesnt have it He yells down the aisle for the woman to bring her ID to the front She yells that she doesnt have hers with her He asks me if a passport will be okay and I oblige himHe tells me and this is important that his passport is in the truck So I set the cigarettes to the side and help other customer while he runs out to get it He comes back the passport shows him born in  which makes him old enough I ring up the cigarettes again and tell him the total He tells me that the woman has the money and runs off to bring her to the front She loudly exclaims that she obviously wants to buy everything once and that the cigarette purchase will have to waitI call my cashier back to the front as I have to leave the front to help a real customerFast forward a bit and they are at the front with Milk ice cream and cookies much less than the woman seemed to be carrying around They ask if we can check the balance of their food stamps card my cashier tells them we cannot and so they stand at the front counter and call the phone number on the back of the card to check their balanceI manage to ring out most of the line of customers forming behind them The whole time the guy is loudly complaining about how they cut stamps benefits for everyone using lots of colorful language He keeps telling my cashier that they were only supposed to cut it  but him and a buddy of his went down  Oddly enough none of our other multitude of foodstamp customers have mentioned thisFinally they find out that there is around  dollars on the card they swipe it to pay but obviously its not enough to cover the food in the transaction so it is declined I tell them any my cashier that if they dont have enough to cover the full amount on the card that he must enter the exact amount they wish to use and then the rest can be paid separately At this point they decide not to buy the food and to instead just buy the cigarettes with cashAll is well except that the womans fairly large canvas bag purse seems much fuller than when she walked in The walk through the doors and the shoplifting alarm goes off myself and my stocker immediately head over to stop themThe man immediately exclaims that the alarm went off because of him It didnt it obviously went off when the womans purse went through I tell the woman I need to see in her purse as it is what set off the alarm She holds it up and sticks her face in it She exclaims nothing is in it except for her stuffI grab the purse to look inside of it and she grabs it back and screams at me She exclaims that it is her personal purse and you go lookin in peoples personal bagsHer and the boy friend bolt out the door Myself and my stocker follow them out I tell them that I am calling the police and begin placing the call on my phone At this point I could grab her bag from her but I dont I have health insurance and Im not getting into a fight with two druggiesThis is the fun part the girl is screaming to the guy to get into the truck Its a black ford explorer that my stocker is writing down the license plate ofThe man starts saying We didnt bring the truck This isnt my truck We dont have a truckThe woman after a minute or so decides she has had enough and begins walking away in tears The man shrugs and gets in the truck finally and pulls out of the parking lotThe woman runs around the other side of the car and jumps in and they speed off into the nightThe police arrived a few minutes

millondefloss,16,38,1qvyd5,210,Not too sure if this post is entirely appropriate to this subreddit but the memory of it still makes me chuckle and is the occasion when I grew a pair and stopped giving customers everything they wantedSo I was working in a customer service call centre for a multinational grocery chain when I received a pretty typical complaint call from a pretty typical entitled asshat of a customer It was something to do with product quality I asked if he had the packaging He didnt  I asked for specifics regarding the poor quality and the best he could come up with was that the sauce tasted funny Oooookay Now I should have let him go with nothing but I had only been in the role for a month and so I offered him  points on his reward card for the inconvenience points Thats what  Not even worth itHaving had this more than reasonable offer thrown back in my face I realised that I was done being niceOk then sir Ill still forward your complaint to the company Thanks for bringing the issue to our attentionWhen will I see the points on my accountIn a saccharine tone of voice  Oh no you said that the points werent worth it so Ive voided the credit If you want to take the matter further you can write to the address on the back of the receipt Have a lovely afternoon And with that I hung up Moral of the story  if youre complaining for the sake of complaining take whats offered,No,248
chesterfeildsofa,29,19,1qvy3h,102,I worked rd shift at a grocery store for around  months and I would start at pm get my lunch at am and get off at am For my am lunch the assistant managerAM would have to come up and run the register the  minutes i was gone as well as close out the register for that day It was probably worded different but at am the computers would freeze and not let you scan anything until you did the end of day stuff I can only remember one extreme coupon incident I think maybe twice a year the store would have triple coupon days where any coupon under  would automatically be tripled This lady came in around am and got to my register around am She had a TON of coupons and a lot of duplicate items I finished scanning all of her items and had started scanning the coupons around am So of course the computer would freeze right then The AM tried to fix it but it said nothing could continue without doing the end of day which would also void the entire transaction A line had started to form behind the lady so the AM said he would rescan all of her items on a different register while I took the other people behind heronly my computer wouldnt work until he did the end of day stuff So I am standing there looking like an idiot while he tries to get this lady out of the store Then HIS computer freezes I dont know what happened after that because he told me to go to lunch and he would take all the other customers on his register This whole situation was confusing as fuck because he was so frustrated and wouldnt explain anything he was doing to meI came back min later and he tells me he got her taken care of and she got  dollars worth of stuff free and he even had to give her money from the register when he was done I thought that was probably a huge mistake but whatever its on him not meThe next night I come in and the General Manager asked me what had happened so I told him the story of the previous night Turns out the triple coupon deal was only to be applied to the first  coupons for a certain item then just the regular coupon after that No one had told us this before they left the previous day so we didnt get in trouble for itOne good thing though that made all of it worth it is what the lady told me while I was ringing her up She said she worked for a church and everything she was buying was going to that churchs food pantry,Coupon Nightmare,121

HeloRising,41,75,1qvprn,394,This was another incident that happened at a pottery store where you color things that will soon belong to you The last one took off so I figured Id throw another one upI was working one very slow afternoon and three teenage guys come walking towards the door This wasnt strictly unusual sometimes guys would come to make something for their girlfriends These guys were decked out in full hip hop gear though and all whiter than bleached snow A little odd but this was in an incredibly white area of the city I used to live in and in a major upscale mall it wasnt unusual to spot five or ten Vanilla Ice clones on a given daySo Ice come walking through the door and start looking at the shelves full of unfired pottery pieces a lot of what we sold was figurines as well as plates and dishes I greeted them but they didnt take much notice so I went back to what I was doing until one of them comes up to me a few minutes laterYoYo manyou got like any frogs Frogs Yeah weve got a couple of different ones they should be up on that shelf Naw dawg I saw those ones But Im lookin for somethin special Somethin gangstaI stared at him for a full thirty seconds trying to process what the actual fuck a gangsta frog looked like I turned and looked at my unreasonably hot coworker thinking this was some kind of joke to play on the newish guy She had this look of complete bewilderment on her face and I knew she was a crappy actor so this had to be for reals yoI told him to hold on and Id check in the back I went back where another employee was finishing up glazingHeyI dont know our whole stock yet Do we have anything back here that we dont have out there A couple of things why whatd they ask forlong pause A gangsta frogthe fuck is a gangsta frogI have no idea Do we have anything that meets that criteriaWeve got one with a big chain give him thatWe did in fact have a frog with a big gold medal around its neck and I brought it out to himYeeeaaahhhh booooiiiiiii Thats what Im talkin bout Dats the shit right thereSo he sat down with a pallet full of suitably thuglicious paints and started pimping his pottery His cohorts also selected figurines Thug One went with a springing lion and Thug Two defied all expectations and selected a small rose From listening to their backandforth these were suitably gangsta choices for various reasonsAs they were painting my unreasonably hot coworker came up to me and in a quiet voice asked me if she was in fact tripping balls or were there three teenagers treating the experience of painting figurines as an experience worthy of song they had in fact begun busting mad rhymes about the various colors of paint they were working withThey took about an hour to finish their pieces I wouldnt have given them any awards for quality but they took their work seriously We could tell they were proud of their work because they went on at length though Im not positive how a springing lion can look straight outta ComptonOnce they finished they paid with credit cards not as gangsta as a wad of cash but way easier for me to deal with and left Last I heard they were turning the date I gave them to come back and pick up their pieces into a rap To their credit they werent half bad at itAntics aside they were actually very nice and never gave us any static Never even heard the n word out of them which was sadly very common with the hiphop kids especially the white kids,They want gangsta frogs,469
Metroidzoid,9,24,1qvkqw,76,I have to get this off my chest  It is the ultimate example of our assistant managers complete lack of reasonable authorityDonna has been working at this store for  years  Huge inflated ego talks to everyone like theyre  and stupid she was a school teacher basically has pisspoor customer service skills and a nonexistent work ethic  She finally gave her two weeks a few days ago because apparently me and other people there made it too difficult for her to work thereToday shes sitting at a table next to the register not on break and she answers her cell  Theres line forming   now its  deep  Shes still on the phone  And the piece de resistance was hearing her say loudly Oh they dont care that Im on the phone  What are they going to do fire meIt took all my energy not to ask my customer excuse me walk over grab that phone and chuck it into the street She works in nursery and so did I before transferring  She orders things based on whether or not she likes them I order things based on customer demands and whats priced right among other things  She spends  hours ordering what takes me  minutes and shell spend that same time completely changing what Ive ordered when I was asked too  I finally said I was done ordering if she was going to waste the time redoing it because it was ridiculous having two people play tug of war with the same simple task,I am counting the days until she leaves,100
Personsen,445,652,1qvk5o,1615,lyranotsureIm not a huge fan of coupons in general There is usually some problem with them like they are either expired they dont scan or some issue in the fine print that will either make the customer go into a yelling fit or make the line pile up which is a pet peeve of mine If you want to use one or two coupons I am fine with that I completely understand wanting to save some moneyBut there is a trend that pisses me off to no end  Couponers  A lady came in a while back with a large amount of deodorant in her basket After I finished ringing her up she said  Oh and I have a few coupons  She then pulled a massive wad of coupons out of her purse  None of them having scannable bar codes meaning that they would all have to be keyed in manually I called up a second cashier and began to read the fine print as I am supposed to  She notices I am reading them and says Yeah Those should pay for the entire transaction  Im sorry it says limit one coupon per customer and that they arent to be used with any other coupons I reply  No I did the math I have enough here to cover the entire transaction In fact you guys should technically be giving me cash back she says with a chuckle  At this point the line was piling up again on my register so I called up a third cashier and the manager  The manager comes up and asks how he can help  She says Yeah this guy wont let me use my coupons  I point out to him that it clearly states that the coupons cant be used like this  The manager ignores me and lets her have the fifteen or so deodorants for freeBefore she left you could just feel the smugness radiating off of her She says You should be expecting more of us  We couponers are starting to get pretty big around here Next time just scan the damn coupons She then struts out the door with a smile  The manager was fired soon after  ,Fuck Couponers,2267
creepytacoman,4,15,1qvix3,55,EDIT Forgot to mention working at one of the many burger chain restaurantsSo tonight I had a really annoying family who came in First they ordered Fairly ordinary right The last person The mom ordered and I assumed it was for her Apparently it was for someone in the car or something So I said Is that going to be all the dad said Sure and paid up As they were getting to the seat I heard them grumbling about how the mom wasnt eating I figured not my business shouldnt care About  minutes after they got their food the dad came up and glared at me He was a big guy could have been a lumberjack It was clear that he was trying his best to contain himself and not go full out yelling at me He told me I never gave his wife a chance to order and it was all my fault I just said sorry what can I get for her etc He just ordered a cheeseburger paid and sat back down Because it was slow we had it  seconds after he sat down all the way across the room I called his name and he was genuinely pissed about having to get back up to retrieve it I would have brought it over but he practically ran to get itAgain after  minutes he came up and slammed on the counter yelling BOSS My manager who was  feet away turned around I had other customers so I couldnt hear all the conversation but basically the burger was supposed to have no onion and he wanted a refund for the burger along with saying that I should have given it for free anyway since I had made a mistake With people like this pretty much all the managers turn a blind eye since its clearly not me I gotta say I have some pretty good managersTLDR family orders dad doesnt let mom order Dad comes later saying its my fault mom didnt order Then he says I messed up the single item order and gets my manager,I dont usually get bad customers in my small town working the front desk,70

OneWayOfLife,6,19,1quuqs,46,AlrightAfter my first year of retail I think Im finally starting to see how customers can really be And not in the good wayToday was particularly and unusually rife with people that decided to be as disruptive and blameless as possible It may be because of Christmas or because some distant stars have aligned or something but either way GAAAHHFirstly an elderly gentleman comes up to the till next to me and puts all his stuff on the counter of this closed register Between this till and my own or more accurately between me and where he was standing is a small tower that houses lottery scratch cards This meant that out of the corner of your eye you cant tell if its a person or this tower next to you So this bloke dumps his stuff down the paper he wanted to buy and his bag and proceeds to stand there for several minutes while Im stood doing nothing not serving I mean I was working Vikki I swear Occasionally people will use unmanned tills as desks to write out lottery ticketsbirthday cards etc so I feel it was perfectly reasonable to assume this is what he was doing At this time a queue starts to build I have to serve relatively quickly to get through all the customers so I forget this guy is even there After about the th person from the queue he says in a rather loud angry toneCust Im sorry am I completely invisible to youNote that he is stood at an empty register with an obvious queue for my till I replyMe Im sorry Sir but there is a queueI decide that to not make a scene I will serve him next He comes over and requests the free CD that comes in his newspaper Now on the front cover it says in blue letters at least ½ an inch high that the CDs are available in Major Supermarket and Other Newsagents but not our store I call my supervisor Vikki over I hope you dont mind me using your name if youre reading this P and the conversation between her now V and the customer  C  goes like soV Im sorry but we arent doing the discs this timeC Yes you areV We arent Im afraid We havent down them for a while actuallyC Yes you have It says here Thats false advertisingVWe dont do it sorryCErrr yes you doV only Supermarket and Newsagents do it sorryC Well how am I supposed to get there Supermarket is about a  minute walk awayHe then pays and walks away grumpily with no more words utteredThe second customer that decided that she deserved me to instantly and faultlessly understand what it was she wanted came up to me while in mid conversation on the phone It should be noted that she had quite a thick possibly Jamaican accent She shall be known as Phone LAdy PL She gruntsPL Lyca Mobilewhile thrusting a  note at me Note for non English reditors Lyca mobile is a telephone provider We have both the SIM cards and topups for this brand so to make sure Im doing what she wanted I clarify with herMe Is that a topup for Lyca MobileShe half nods so I process a  topup for Lyca Mobile for her She leaves and returns about  minutes later yes it took her that long to noticePL Where is my changeMe Im sorry what changePL I gave you Me That is a  topupPL I asked quite clearly for a  topup I want a refundWe cant refund thisMe Im sorry but I cant refund now Youll have to ring customer services and see what they can doPL So I have to use my credit to call ip for your mistake when its all your fault I want to use your phoneI went on to accept responsibility and apologised for mishearing her I didnt she didnt even specify a topup FFS bust as a friend of mine pointed out she shouldnt be worried about using her credit to phone CustServices as she already has  more than she expected anywaySo Until next time Laterz P,Its happening,65

GrimGuy,58,63,1qsw32,270,The scene is a moviegame rental store in the final days before their downhill slide This particular store is a fairly busy one but its a weekday afternoon and the place is nearly empty Ive been borrowed from another store for the day and having just finished my shift am lingering while I shoot the shit with coworkersEnter a child and his mother of nonassuming appearance and demeanor their appearance and demeanor nonassuming enough that I forgot about them nearly immediately Minutes pass I putz around in indecision over which crappy movie to use my daily free rental on and the motherchild come around to our games Now we primarily rented movies and games but we did sell some as well Invariably the games we sold were ancient shovelware and sports games half a decade past their day all of them were without instructions or original cases all of them were scratched to hell They were also all ludicrously overpriced running damn near what a new game mightFor whatever reason the child decides he has to have some baseball game Hes been quiet so far but hes found his muse in the form of a brightly colored plastic box with one of our generic store inserts serving as cover art and Baseball  written halfassedly on it in Sharpie Baseball  could be one of a couple games but the kid wasnt concerned with quibbling details His mother either due to wisdom or disinterest wasnt having any of it The first couple polite refusals werent taken well and soon the kid is pulling out the arsenal He tried to bargain he tried to plead and the crying didnt come long after Hoping to soothe him she let him carry it while they continued their rounds This only led to him using it to smack her on the leg and continue to ramp up his growing tantrum Her refusals became more firm as time went on and things escalated steadily By the time he threw himself to the floor in full tantrum the scene had garnered the attention of my coworkers and I It was nothing alarming and there was an almost refreshing quality to the mother not breaking down in the face of a crying kid When his tantrum began she earned a bit more of our respect by taking the game from him and stating very clearlyIm not buying you this game today We can talk to your father tonight  but if you keep this up Im going to write down the games name and tell him about it so neither of us EVER buys it for you for your WHOLE LIFEMy coworkers and I all had a look I can best describe as that Obama Not Bad face as we nodded to each other assuming the matter was closedNot soThe child face red and tearstreaked stopped making much noise This wasnt because he was soothed or stopped but because hed turned into a whitehot ball of seething rage his senses failing as his world collapsed around him  He started making noise eventually in an unconscious sort of way It was this halfasthmatic catinheat moaning sort of sound that belonged in a Lovecraft novel It never got very loud but his actions spoke volumesPromptly he dropped his pants and took a splashing chunky yellow shit all over the floor My curiosity about how this would end collided with my minimumwage survival instinct and I got the hell out of Dodge in short order Im told she cleaned it up in tears while the child went back to asking if he could have the gameTada,A child not to be trifled with,333
Locclo,70,39,1qssv1,140,Background I work in the bakery department of a big retailer My duties mainly include packaging bread and stocking the floor and occasionally taking a cake order or handing one over to a customerSo today I found out about something new that my store is doing and Im pretty bummed out about it Where I work the scheduling system gives a lot of freedom and control to the employees Scheduling is automated and its based on what you put in for your availability meaning that if you ask not to come in until  PM the computer wont  and in most circumstances cant  schedule you until  PM Whats more managers cant change the schedule on a whim they need your login and password in order to do it and thats one piece of info they dont haveWhats all this got to do with anything Well for the first time since Ive started and probably as a result of Target infamously opening on Thanksgiving last year the computer is allowed to schedule people completely outside of their availability for one week Take a wild guess as to which one Thankfully the manager I spoke to said that hed be able to tweak my schedule ever so slightly so that I can actually go to class on the Monday before Thanksgiving since my school only closes on that Thursday but sadly for the first time in  years Im going to miss out on my familys big Thanksgiving dinner because I have to work from  AM to  PM on that day and dinners right around  I even have to skip class on Black Friday because my manager told me flatout that I could not change my hours for that day Edit to clarify he did flatout tell me that I wasnt going to be able to change my hours on Friday but after reading some of these comments and considering my options Im definitely going to at least leave early on Friday to go to classI dont think Ive ever contemplated calling in sick on a day that I know will be busy but this news has me pretty tempted to do it on the th out of spiteTLDR For one week out of the year the world stops to stare at my store and any employee who says otherwise might just be out of a jobEdit For the record the store is open for  hours and the only day they close is Christmas Day the only change in policy here is that the computer is being allowed to schedule people outside of their availability and said people are not allowed to change their hours on ThanksgivingBlack Friday,A New Store Policy or Why This is My Last Year,179

JizzBeef,9,10,1qrqn5,50,I work at a very popular gas stationconvenience store in the midwest that everybody loves including the people that work there Out of paranoia I ask for everyone to please respect the Anonymizing Rules So the location I work at can only be described as the worst location in the most entitled part of the state thats in the smackdabmiddle of the United States And when I say that its the worst I dont mean that its the most entitled location I mean the complete opposite of that ie I see prostitutes and drug deals as well as having to deal with drug addicts and homeless people on a regular basis Due to this I have absolutely no tolerance for rude people or for shoplifters or the sort and oftentimes I come off to many customers as being mean just because I can never let my guard downSo anyway I was working an evening shift earlier this week As I was walking to the back of the store towards our supply room an older man wearing a yellow sweater was kind of walking towards me as well as my new coworker Due to his yellow sweater well now call him YS He was kind of approaching us slowly and my coworker Ill call her S was a few steps ahead of me YS tries to stop her but I buttin automatically knowing that this man would be some sort of trouble She stops as I stop to deal with him but I shoot her a look of Illdealwithit so she keeps on doing what she was doing and walks off When YS gets close enough to me my encounter with him goes something like thisYS Hi um can I uhhhh ask you a questionMe obviously aggravated but trying to hide it Yes what can I do for youYS Well come over here with me Id like to show you somethingI dont normally follow male customers when they try to lead me somewhere just because the only thing that us gas station employees fear more than a robbery is a kidnapping Luckily though this was not the case Instead YS leads me over to our rollergrills and shows me the tongs attached to them I say attached like that because they are not actually attached as you can take them off of this little metal loop to use them and people drop them all the time Another thing about our tongs is that we clean them very vigorously every time they happen to fall and we also have another clean set in a cabinet at all times to replace the old ones with every three hours This is all relevant dont worryYS Why arent these chained to the grill Me I dont know would you like to discuss this question with a manager though YS Yes if you would please But uhm whats her name He says this as he looks up at our register noticing that my other coworker is on the main register so he assumes that its herMe HIS name is Justin and I can get him for you really quickYS Justin huh How long has she been working hereMe Uh wha uh well uh HE JUSTIN has been here for over  years YS Okay well yeah get him for me would you Oh and also he holds up some silverware in his hands two forks and a spoon where could I find a spoonI ignore that hes already holding a spoon and point out where he can find them but then he suddenly realizes that hes holding one and says Oh nevermind I already have oneGreat So now I have to go into the freezer where my boss is trying to get inventory done as fast as possible before our next shipment comes in in less than three hours and tell him that theres a senile old man that would like to speak to him About something completely idiotic Which is exactly what I tell him to which he replies Oh great this is exactly how Id like to spend my nightAfter Justin comes out with me we find YS guy and he talks to him and basically it just goes like thisYS Why arent the tongs chained to the grills What happens when they fall Ive seen other gas stations where the tongs are chained why arent yoursJustin Here in state its not a health regulation or requirement that the tongs be chained to the grills and this actually works out to our advantage as well as its much more sanitary than having attached tongs as this makes us able to clean them every three hours as well as any time they appear to be unsanitary or if theyve fallen onto the floorYS Yes but why isnt it a health regulation I mean germs exist in bordering state why dont they exist hereWhat The Actual FuckJustin just repeats himself then attempts to persuade YS to fill out a customer comment card to which YS agrees to do but then just keeps asking the same questions over and over again To which Justin just responds with the same exact responses This goes on for twenty Fucking Minutes YS has now become a fire hazard as well since hes standing directly in front of the front doors and refuses to move despite Justin taking a few steps back in an attempt to get him to move There are probably about  customers in the store at this point and were getting backed up on the register and Im afraid that something might go wrong with one of the newer employees that they may need Justins help with So I briskly grab a customer comment card and hand it to Justin just to try to make it clear that this guy is just a hopeless broken record and he needs to leave Eventually YS leaves and Justin looks so pissfully exhausted He then tells me I thought that was never going to endtldr what,The Perpetual Question,60
CaptainTomTom,48,29,1qrots,92,Have you seen those shirts with the above mentioned title name I love my church I see them all the time where I work Ah the joys of working in retail No Im joking Anyone with a few amount of brain cells would know there is little to no joy in retailNow about this shirt I work in an art store We cater to the creative crowds Usually our customers range from teachers to soccer moms to christian educators of the like They flock to our stores each Friday Saturday and especially Sunday when the new sale starts upThese customers are  more likely to wear this shirt I love my church Youd think theyd be our most understanding and nicest customers The model christian that everyone aspires to be Or believe they are Yeah I thought that too for a whileYou see these people are something different Outwardly they wear a smile that seems as if they are a friendly and kindhearted individual However if you were to look deep into their eyes I swear to you they are not human They are something else Something evilThis one customer changed my entire view on this shirt But its just a shirt Captain TomTom it cant be that bad Oh but it is Oh but it isI had the pleasure of cashiering a sunday afternoon right after the churches let their sheep out of their sermons I call them wolves in sheeps clothing Thats what they are Most of them wear this shirt I keep bring up So did this customer who Im finally starting to tell you aboutI knew she was trouble when she walked in Our store likes to play this song over and over on the PA system Even during chistmas time In tow she had  kids who immediately left her side and went running through the store I greeted her from the registers and she smiled and was mumbling about something to herself and continued on her way Not before I glimpsed at her shirt I love my church I was naive to the plight of retailers at the time I did not know what was in store for meRoughly about  minutes later she comes to the front of the store with a shopping cart full of random items Yarn popsicle sticks glue construction paper all kinds of stuff She still had that smile on her face The kids were following her and had candy and other crap that crafty kids like within their grubby little hands I cleared my throat and began Thank you for shopping at s I can check you out hereShe motions her  kids to come along The  kids immediately started to pile up things on the register making it hard to keep things organized The mother of the three dug into her purse and pulled out several coupons That was the second omen Our store has a strict coupon policy One coupon per customers per day We cant bend the rules at all for anyone no matter who they are what they do who they are affiliated with In bold print it clearly states our coupon policy on each and every coupon It also states it on the registers On the walls when you first enter the building In the bathrooms But these signs seem to get ignoredShe hands the coupons over to me They were all the same ones  off one regular priced item Im sorry maam You can only use one coupBefore I finished she smiled and said Ok I smiled back thinking she understood She kept mumbling and talking Then I realized she had a bluetooth earpiece in her ear Apparently holding a conversation with someone on the other end That was the third omen I was clearly a deer in headlights I proceeded with the transaction scanning and bagging each item When I was picking though some of the things piled up on the registers I touched something wet and slimy One of those nasty little kids opened a sucker and licked it and put it in the pile of items on the counter Immediately I recoiled and investigated what it was I touchedI gagged a bit as the drool trailed from my fingers to the sucker I quickly regained my composure and wiped my hands on my apron someone stole the napkins from my register along with the hand sanitizer that day I looked at her seeing if she was going to apologize as she was staring at me No she was carrying on her conversation in that earpiece The kids looked at me and just laughed Those little laughs haunt me till this day It was just innocent child laughter It was off it was like they plotted to do that I could be paranoid but those laughs tell me other wiseAfter bagging several items  I saw the light at the end of the tunnel She was going to pay and leave with her little monsters She dug in her purse again and pulled out the coupons I stared at her baffled for a moment seeing that she understood that she couldnt use those coupons You forgot my coupons She smiled againIm sorry Maam but our coupon policy only limits one coupon per cust She cut me off againYeah I know Can we just split the transactions or something and I can pay it several times She started to wag the coupons impatiently No maam I cant do that all It wouldnt be fair to the oth To my absolute horror her eyes narrowed as if I shot her in the heart Her face went from a fake smile to a completely menacing bitch from the th level of hell I dont see why you even have coupons all the time if you cant use them at all What kidn of place is this I thought this place was for creative people All you people want to do is take money How about giving for a change She continued on and on I almost blacked out for a moment Literally spit was flying out of her mouth and hit my glasses I Well our coupon pol Again she cuts me off on queue I dont care about the coupon policy You know what I dont want any of this Come on lets go She motioned for her brats to follow suit I thought it was over as she started to make her way to the exit No No it wasnt over Right when I started to move the cart of bagged items out of the walkway for the next customer She comes back again This place is the devil You are just a follower Coming to work and trying to swindle hard working Christian people like me out of their money I answer to a higher power It scares me how I remember some of the things she had said word for word But I do remember clearly that shirt she was wearing and the final thing she said to me I pray for you Because you need itNeedless to say All the shouting drew attention to the check out lines Customers and other employees stood and watched   No one said a word However Taylor Swift once again blared over the PA system Trouble trouble trouble Oh OHHH Trouble Trouble Finally the event was over and she dragged herself out of the store The other customers looked at meI can I can help the next customer in line I spoke with a shaking voice I still didnt know what happened Like I was in a  car accident and wasnt able to cope with the situation that had occurred The next customer walked up and smiled Im so sorry that woman was so irate with you You poor thing She wasnt really a christian woman now was she The old lady was friendly and understanding Until I noticed she was wearing the same shirt My heart felt like it stopped I have a couple of coupons to use she saidI guess you could probably guess what unfolded ,I love my church,121

ChestyPetite,21,23,1qq95t,87,I am a young girl and  I work at a self serve frozen yogurt joint Its a new locally owned business that sells some pretty delicious yogurt I have worked here for two months and sometimes there would be this kid that would come in who would never buy anything beg for samples and hang out from open to close and often sleep on our couch Our boss is totally okay with this for some reason and he leaves us girls alone for the most part so nobody complains  He is obviously homeless but not starving because he is overweight Early twenties So back track to Halloween The kid comes in and likes to do this thing where he will walk up behind a big group of people who I am handing sample cups to to seem less awkward when he begs I feel sorry for him today and decide to give him my shift meal under the condition that he never asks me for samples again Big mistake So he gets his yogurt and sits down right next to me at the cash register to eat I wanted to be friendly because I felt bad for the guy so I asked him some questions about his life and recommended that the could go to the library and study interesting things or read or something because he had a lot of time on his hands I mean this kid literally just sits and watches our shop tv from  am to  pm For some reason he starts to ask me questions and gets aggressive about it He asks me if I want to see his resume and angrily repeats WHY NOT when I say I am busy and I have no reason to Then he asks me if I want babies some day I tell him that that is not an appropriate question and I dont want to answer it This is all met with JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION I eventually said no and at this point Im just playing with my phone trying to stop this conversation What are you doing on your phone Are you texting Who are you texting JUST TELL ME I just say Im browsing and Im using all of my body language to show him that I dont want to talk anymore For now he leaves me alone but just stares at me until my shift is over and walks away when the next employee shows up My next shift is a few days later and of course he is there again Of course he asks for sample cups and of course he plays dumb when I remind him of our agreement I brush him off and ring up some customers so he recedes to sit at the front on the couch like he always does Heres where the fun starts I go to the back after a few hours of being behind the register to refill some raspberries When I get to the toppings bar I see that our homeless friend has sample cups in hand and is stealing yogurt I tell him that he cant do that and that he is stealing  Im not doing anything wrong everybody gets sample cups And looks at customers who are uncomfortable at this point for support You are here every day and you buy nothing begging for sample cups every time a shift ends and a new employee comes in You cant do that and you need to throw those away He just smiles at me and acts dumb No Im not doing anything wrong I get frustrated and text my boss who says its my fault because I left sample cups on the counter This makes me petty angry because thats where he keeps them when he works and not a single employee keeps them anywhere else My boss tells me to leave the dude alone Whatever The next day rolls around and Im back at work At this point Ive talked to some of the girls who work there about homeless dude and every single one has a story of him doing something strange like that in the last couple of days While Im chatting with my coworker M about the problems Ive had the dude walks into the store He tries to wave and I just shake my head at him He smiles and gets closer and waves again I just shake my head He then sits down at the closest seat to the register and continues to stare at me M excuses herself to use the restroom leaving me all alone with this guy He tries to talk to me and I look at him mid sentence and just shake my head At this point HE STARTS TO CRY  I ignore him and play with my phone so he purposely tries to cry LOUDER  I ignore him and tolerate his ridiculously creepy staring until my second coworker arrives and I beg her  to let me work back      At this point I text my boyfriend who gets angry and comes in to sit with me for the rest of my shift All is well at this point Boyfriend stared him down until he left his spot and went back to the couch to watch tv He leaves us alone for the most part but occasionally gets up to watch us though the reflection of the store front windows Closing time has rolled around and all customers have left I come out of the back after a day of mopping and dish washing to watch the register while my coworker uses the restroom Boyfriend is still sitting and doing his homework This is when I see homeless dude stand up from laying on the couch He begins to walk incredibly slowly over towards where I am standing After getting about  feet away he stops and stares at me At this point I am shaking I have no idea what he wants and I am incredibly uncomfortable with him I do not feel supported by my boss because I have been told that he is allowed to stay for as long as he wants I muster up all of my strength and in a monotone voice ask can I help you with anything He shakes his head no at me Unfortunately we have to close the shop He turns around and very slowly walks towards the door only leaving after staring at us for a minute I lock the door and call my boss in tears who tries to convince me nothing is wrong and that I can only ask him to leave if he is bothering customers It takes  minutes for him to give me

SeventyTimes,2,9,1qq7et,57,Yesterday was the Playstation  launch and I headed into work expecting things to be insane by the time I arrived for my pmam shift I work in electronics and was going to be one of the  guys working past midnight To my surprise things were pretty calm I started to work with my friendcoworker to get everything PSy ready for the night It was all going swimmingly for a couple hours Then she showed upOne of our regulars is in electronics trying to pull a locked up  TV off the shelf Shes a loud slightly balding skinny redheaded woman in her mid to late s who has been suspected of trying to steal stuff multiple times Usually she has her  year old daughter who is adorable with her and is constantly screaming at the poor girl for touching things My coworkers roll their eyes and one motions for me to go deal with herBecause shes about to pull a bunch of  HDTVs down on herself I run up to her Hi mam let me help you with thatI dont need youre help She replies flatlyI sigh a little If youd like me to take care of that TV for you I have unlock it firstAt this point I expect her to argue that she has more shopping to do so she has to take it with her which I cant let her do But instead she turns around and looks at me sizing me up for a brief momentOh Well is this a good TV We need a new one for our living roomI go on to tell her that she has actually chosen my favorite TV in that size range She looks at me with an eyeroll and states Yeah I bet youd say that if I had chosen anything else highpriced it is the highest priced  we carryI happily state Oh no mam Im not a salesman of any kind I mean I dont make commission or anything and I know a good bit about our TVs You actually chose what I would buy if I had to choose a  TV from here I had given her the whole truth and nothing but the truth I brace for another sarcastic reply but instead she looks at me again and silently walks to our displaysI expect this to be the end of our chat But then she turns and asks for my help I turn to see my coworkers looking at me with wide eyes and raised eyebrows This is a firstI never expected things to go well but we ended up having a great  minute conversation about the various brands we carry the differences between TV types plasma LED LCD refresh rates and what Smart TV really means I expected all the info to go straight over her head but she understood it all pretty well It turned out that despite seeming ignorant and rude she knows a fair bit and is a pretty quick learnerAfter we finished discussing everything and looking at the upcoming Black Friday deals she did something weve never seen her do before As she left she turned and said Thank you You were a great help and then she SMILED My coworkers were speechless and I was more than happy to help,A happy ending to an encounter with one of THOSE regulars ,66
supersporky,8,6,1qq65t,19,Ugh I just wanted to kick this older guy in the face just now It seems that he always has some sort of problem with me and how the owner runs the store He wanted to special order a set of scrubs and has the tags of what he wants which is awesome and easier for me too I get the order set up and he is rushing to get the check written before I ring up the items I tell him the total and ask to see a valid form of ID because not only is it store policy to check and make sure the DL number is on there but also to get a phone number if we need to call them because of insert whatever reason there is The policy has been like this and is clearly posted on the desk along with a sign that says if you write us a bad check not only do you have to pay that amount but you also owe an additional  to cover the cost of the bounced check other stores may vary I let him know that I know it can be inconvenient and annoying but that it is store policy so could you please go and get it He does but when he comes back inside he wont take it out of his wallet and COVERS the address Which is on the check he just wrote He proceeds to ask me sarcastically if there are anymore hoops that he needs to jump through to make a purchase I stare at him right in the eyes asserting my dominance and tell him no He did not get a smile or a have a good night He doesnt deserve oneAfter he left I wrote down in the customer accounts notes that this gentleman refuses to show any form of identification and to call the owner and see what they want to do with his money Hopefully his check does not bounce and I wont have to deal with him againWhat would you have done,Another short rant about IDs,25
Locclo,9,17,1qq0j6,67,This happened a few months ago but wow I never thought Id meet a guy who could be so frightening without saying a word Let me preface this by saying that I live in a Minnesotan suburb so about  of everyone I meet is extremely niceI know its a wall of text you guys can deal with it Why are you here if not to read anywayBackground I work in the bakery department of a big retailer My duties mainly include packaging bread and stocking the floor and occasionally taking a cake order or handing one over to a customerOur story begins during one of my long shifts right around noon Im happily bagging bread when a customer walks up and asks to pick up a cake Sure I can grab that no problem I stop what Im doing head into the cooler to grab itAnd its not there No cakes Not a one My heart starts to sink but Im thinking to myself Okay not a big deal maybe the decorator just stuck it in the freezer Its not as uncommon as you might think we only had the one decorator at the time so sometimes she would make orders a few days in advance when she had a day off immediately before the pickup dateNope no cakes there either Or rather not the one this guys looking for The one he wants is covered in red and pink hearts this is nowhere near Valentines Day but whatever Im not going to question his choice I consult with one of my coworkers and we dig around for the original order but for some reason we only find one of our two copies and its the wrong oneAs a quick side note there are always three copies of a cake order One goes into a sort of organizer so that the decorator knows what needs to be made for what days one gets attached to the kit or design so we dont accidentally run out before making it and the third goes to the customerAnyways so we find the design order form but the one that goes in the organizer is nowhere to be found I glance at it for a moment then turn to ask my coworker for advice Apparently she turned into the Sidler from Seinfeld because shes nowhere to be found If my life was a sitcom Id be looking around confused while a laugh track started playingSo I take a deep breath put on my brave face and go out to the customer who by the way is a big burly guy with a neutral patient expression on his face and I explain the situation to him Or at least I start to because I get more and more nervous as Im looking at him Why Because throughout my whole explanation he is saying nothing while giving me thishttpwwwvisualphotoscomphotoxmanglaringatcameraportraitFAAjpg look He has cranked the death glare up to  and Im getting the full blast He wasnt even blinkingIm floundering here Im wringing my hands together scratching my neck and wondering if the scary Russian man is going to put a price on my head After what seems like an hour he finally says You have got to be kidding meAnd dont get me wrong here I didnt tell him that we didnt have it and he was screwed I told him that we couldnt find the cake we had to ask our decorator about it and she would be back within  minutes she was on break at the time Thankfully my department manager came around and I was able to pass this guy over to him There isnt much else to the story  the manager talked to the guy the decorator came back and he agreed to come back in a few hours to pick up the cake which he was getting at no charge because of our mistake What was interesting though was the person who came to pick it up later because it wasnt him it was his wife Why was that interesting Because his wife was the complete polar opposite to him I mean maybe I just caught the guy on a bad day or something entirely likely really but he was big burly and scary and his wife was cheery friendly and completely okay with us screwing up the order I mean she actually said the words its no big deal as long as we got a cake out of it Complete reverse of how her husband actedSo yeah That was the first and so far only customer Ive had that actually made me fear for my life and he didnt even say a wordTLDR If the mafia isnt hiring maybe they should beAddendum Thinking back on it thishttpimagesamcnetworkscomamctvcomwpcontentuploadsBBSBHankjpg is almost exactly what this guy looked like minus the police badge ,The first customer that actually scared me,84
sxcamaro,82,105,1qpvmc,503,MY current position involves setting and placing the advertisements for the week in the store I also am responsible for store wide pricing and usually the associates of the store direct calls to me that should go to the store directorWell a customer calls and asks about at least  items and ensuring that they are in stock He then states our flier is offering items at    and  off I correct him and point out that it says  off not  He argues back and forth that Im wrong and he sees it right in front of himAfter several minutes of this nonsense I ask him to bring the original ad in so that I can prove that the  does not equal  He thinks about it and then claims false advertising and he will never shop with us again blah blah blah He even called back and appealed to my manager who bluntly called him an idiot and asked how we could offer  off somethingTLDR Customer thinks that the  sign is the same things as the  sign,Your Flier Says  Off,608

Kellynn,8,16,1qpkpt,56,Oops this got real long I work at an awesome makeup store I just started so my job so far has consisted of watching a lot of training videos soaking up a ton of knowledge and Im just now getting onto the floor I was on the floor for probably an hour last shift ringing up transactions but last night was my first shift where I was on the floor for all of it I was told when I came in that my job was going to be to ring up most of the transactions that night to get me comfortable on register and shadow my coworkers when there werent customers to ring up as well as learning all the proper closing procedures So Im happily trailing after my coworkers learning my way around products and greeting customers while making sure to not accidentally blow up a register Enter The Cougar She will be known at TC from this point on She is being followed by a much younger man and I could not figure out if it was her son or sugar daddy but after the fifth time she asked for the credit card I think I got it She has her hair tightly pulled back her makeup caked on she is one botox treatment away from her face locking up for good and a brightly colored knitted jacket designed to make her look rich but only made her look kinda crazy My coworker goes to greet her with me trailing after Immediately TC is in a tizzy TC I bought some skin products here and I just really need to get them again but I dont remember what they were and UGH why cant I rememberMy coworker explains to her that we have the ability to pull up her purchase history so we can tell her exactly what she bought from us Its a nifty feature we have for customers who are rewards members with us because a lot of times a customer will come through looking for a product in a certain shade but they cant remember it Its a lot easier to look it up real fast instead of having to keep guessing at it and hope you get it right But TC is still losing her shit I just bought so many products and I just cant remember them and I got this one from this other brand and do you carry that brand I want that brandMy coworker explains that we do not have that brand but asks TC what it was she liked about it so we can suggest a product we do carry I DONT KNOW I JUST LIKED IT OKAY Alrighty then Were doing good We show her some of the products in the antiaging area because they seem to have similar properties to what shes looking for to which she starts bitching Im not fifty why the hell would I need anything from antiaging As if fifty is some magical turning point to being able to use antiaging productsSo we manage to establish one product she liked before we can get her over to the cash wrap and get her product history up She keeps telling us loudly about a product she swears she bought from a brand we do carry that had honey in it I can tell in my coworkers face that she thinks this womans nuts and says she doesnt believe that brand carries any product like that but lets get up the product history and see what it was I scan her card pull up her product info and give her her card back We look at her product history going through every single item back until the beginning of the fucking universe There is not a single product here with honey in it The one product she bought that she claimed was the honey one Its a greek yogurt based product We show her this product and she keeps asking if were sure this is what she bought really totally positive Because she swears it was a honey based product She continues to ask at least ten more times if were TOTALLY SURE Lady I am looking at everything you have ever purchased ever Im sure So we pull up our stores website on the computer look at the brand and she continues looking for this legendary honey product This brand has literally never sold this mythical product shes claiming exists My coworker finds her a few other products that will work and we think weve finally pleased this crazy cougar Oh no That would be too simpleHer younger gentleman partner left a while ago because he was  done with being in a makeup store as if being anywhere near product was a threat to his masculinity We get to checkout finally and she calls him and starts screeching into the phone about how he needs to come back NOW because hes got the credit card and needs to pay She hangs up leans in and whispers to me lets just not tell him how much all this cost okay Itll be our little secret Um And how do you propose I hide the total when hes the one paying So we ring her up and Im still keying in items when hes already furiously swiping his card over and over again bitching about how it isnt working I nearly gave myself a headache trying to contain my eye roll We get her her samples and her rewards perks which she spends another five minutes agonizing over and asking if were SURE its not a honey product and are these REALLY the only rewards we have available Finally get her total Boyfriend decides the total is too high TC declares to me well SOMEONE thinks this costs too much money so I guess were gonna need to take a cleanser off to make SOMEONE happy I finish her transaction Her items are bagged My coworker says I can take my break I think Im freeWHAT ABOUT MY BIRTHDAY GIFT So when we hit total it pops up all the rewards info We tell this to the customer and it has a little checklist of things were supposed to offer to the customer If birthday gift is applicable we give it to them Birthday gift did not pop up for The Cougar I tell my coworker that it didnt prompt for it so I didnt offer She asks TC when her birthday is Its early October Now you can get your birthday gift during you BIRTHDAY MONTH My birthdays in June you dont see me walking into work demanding my birthday gift right now After demanding her gift TC wanders off to look at something else and my coworker just mutters Oh whatever Im just gonna give it to her anyway it is not worth the hassle to say no We get her birthday gift all done Her items are bagged Shes leaving I can still hear her screeching to her boyfriend about the honey product all the way out I run for the exit for my break before she comes back to look for it again ,No I swear were not lying to you about your product history,72

GeneralELucky,41,27,1qpcnb,58,I work in retail management and Im a PC Gamer Over the past ten years PC gaming has transitioned from physical media to digital distribution As such retailers carry a very limited selection of PC games if any at all My store is no exception The other day I noticed a customer browsing our video games This woman in her upper s or s asked where the PC games were so she could buy one for her husband Judging by her age I assumed she was looking for the basic casual games like slots mystery adventure games etc I walked her over and pointed out the prices and the savings by buying two packaged together She looked them over for a moment and frowned My husband likes action gamesUnfortunately PC gaming has gone digital and is moving away from CDs and DVDs The good news is that makes PC gaming even more cheaper than video game consoles The bad news is that it can make it harder to include in regular everyday shopping like youre experiencing now But let me see if I can help you outI led her over to the laptops and opened up in Internet ExplorerMaam Id like to introduce you to Steam Its the premier digital distribution network for PC gaming It includes literally thousands of games and has more users than Microsofts Xbox network What I would recommend doing as a gift to your husband is introducing him to Steam and giving him a Steam Gift Card which we sell at our sister store Alternatively you can create your own account and gift him games tooI pointed out several games What they were selling for on Steam and how much they retail for on consoles Another option is the Humble Bundle For a mere five dollars you will receive six AAA games That money goes directly to charities Its easy to focus on the savings but the truth is that the money is going to various goodwill organizationsWhat if my husbands computer doesnt have even RAMOne of the benefits of PC Gaming is that the systems can be tweaked to work on just about any computer thats five or six years old I hook up my laptop to my girlfriends  TV which she bought here during our last sale event and it is hardly powerful at allYou are very passionate about PC gaming Thank you for your timeYoure welcome My parents instilled in me that consoles are only for gaming while a PC can do everything under the sun PC gaming really is the best kept secret in gamingMoral of the Story I was glad it was a slow day ,The PC The Best Kept Secret in Gaming,85

narelie,156,110,1qp37f,525,Due to my apparent obligation to tell this story Im doing my darndest to now deliver Its not delivery though its NarGiorno I had been scheduled to secret shop a nearby fast food chain location for the breakfast rush This is a popular time to check things because its a prime time for customers So I get started on my order this time Im doing a drivethru one I place the order and the girl is actuallyquite rude Doesnt offer a combo size upgrade this is HUGE for these guys doesnt ask what drink I want doesnt even tell me what my order total is She just immediately tells me to pull up to the next window Oh this is a lovely start Theres like three cars ahead of me so I sit back to wait and it takes a surprisingly long timeabout ten minutes For a breakfast rush this is bad  As a baseline youre supposed to have something like  seconds per car I get to the window and they just yanked my card out of my hand another ding theyre supposed to greet you and tell you your total again and tell me to pull up to the curb ahead and theyll bring my food out when its readyThis is a huge nono because it screws with the times recorded for their drivethru Theyre failing miserably and they know it so they start to do this to try and fake good timesMy order arrives another five minutes later bringing this all up toabout  minutes For a breakfast sandwich and Im not terribly surprised to find out its made completely wrongI park write down on the form what transpired record my times and head inside with them and my sandwich You see for this particular one I have to get manager signatures to confirm that I did in fact go there As I went inside I immediately just hear thispiercing laugh The dining rooms almost empty not surprised most hit the drivethrus so they can get to work asap and theres employees chasing each other around They spot me and one of them does a leaping slide across the counter and then grins at meI held up the forms and the grin justfellHe called the manager on over who was holed up in the back and she scowled and muttered as she read over the form Oh really OH REALLY REALLY Oh look at this Someone woke up this morning with a stick up her SAY WHATI inform her to sign the form now as I need to get back and she does then literally chucks my copy back in my face Forget the sandwich Im leavingI stalked out the door seriously angry at what happened and honestly annoyed at the fact that Im going to have to rake them over the coals for this Which I did I was straightforward on my report didnt embellish and I still got a call back from my rep asking if I was telling the truth I assured her it was all true She was shocked but admitted that this location tended to not have the greatest reports This one though took the cakeFast forward a month Im asked to shop the location again but this time dinner rushI get things started as normal did another drivethru this time was in a rush hehe and they did a bit better this time Still forgot to offer the combo upgrade but the drivethru girl was quite polite told me the total etc I drove up to pay and hooooly cow IT WAS THE BREAKFAST MANAGER Theyd apparently switched her shifts on me GAH She immediately recognized me and started squalling ITS HER Turning around she grabbed a poor teenage boy working the drink machine and yelled You handle her I cant do this right now Aaaaand then she up and left I could hear her freaking out as she walked all the way into the backThe poor boy was obviously super confused as to what was going on so I tried to be as nice as possible The shop went pretty well all in all so I went on ahead and filled out the report and headed inside to get the managers signature I was praying very very fervently that maybe Breakfast Manager was just working that night maybe she wasnt the manager on dutyNoooopeIt took them five minutes to convince her to come up front and then she started cursing at me and saying Id gotten them all in deep trouble Do you know that you got two people FIRED How do you sleep at night Lady Im sorry thats not really my fauOh sure SURE it isnt Stupid shoppers they always pick a itch to do them Well here you go hope youre freaking happy with yourself You got us all in trouble and now theyre crawling up our  because of youAt this point every single one of the employees turns and looks at me with huge eyes One guy pipes up Thatsthe shopper Thats why the DM came downYeaaaaah time to scramMade my second report and again rep called to see if I was making things up Nope it went well except for that psychopath of a manager My rep was floored and informed me apologetically that since Id been recognized so easily I could never secret shop that location again Honestly I was relieved at that Well its been a long time sinceand unfortunately psycho manager still works there I had a friend go in to check a few months ago and yep shes there Does she still hold a grudge Ha Said friends order was made wrong and he made a joke about Well at least Im not a secret shopper Apparently the manager JUMPED at that and proceeded to regale him with her version of events about the itch who tried to get the place shut downYep I can never go back now ,Mystery Shopping Tales  Great now I cant come back here anymore,635

storyteller,5,12,1qou5x,33,Background The summer after I graduated from high school I took my first real job at a Christmas themed amusement park I was the fill in girl so I worked two days in Santas House he had to have a helper with him at all times to avoid any possible lawsuits two days as the face painter and then one day in the shops On days not in face painting I also dressed up as Snow White and did the character actor thing while I worked because it was so much fun Moving onI was working this particular summer day in the Girls shop there were several shops for various themes and my manager was a tremendous hag All of the managers were older women who never had real jobs and just derped around this park their whole lives feeling entitled because they had control over teenagers This woman well call her Etta complained constantly and while I was experienced in working the other shops each is different and she never really trained me for working this shopEventually Etta decided it was time to push off for lunch and leave me alone in the shop Of course this is the perfect time for awful tourists to come in This woman walks in with her little girl and starts looking around She soon finds some of the watches we have at the counter little plastic and rubber junk things meant for kids with all kinds of colors and crap on them and they are expensive like  a pop for this little junk watch BUT on the other side of the counter there is a tub which used to hold some kind of candy and now holds the overflow of the watches which dont fit on the display The tub they are in is labeled with a price sticker the says  So the lady turns to me and asks what the difference is between the expensive watches on the display and the seemingly identical but cheap watches in the tub I have no freaking clue and they do look the same because they are so she starts taking watches out choosing one for herself and apparently all the members of her family to give as souvenirs Shes got a handful of watches and the shit soon hit the fanEnter Etta She immediately sends me onto the floor of the tiny shop to stock and clean while she rings up our high rollin watch pimp Unfortunately the watches were  each and came to over  so the woman had a fit and starts screaming about mislabeling and how the watches shouldnt be that expensive but Etta tells her the watches in the tub were mislabeled and the real price is  Lady starts demanding that they be given to her for the cheaper price because thats false advertising and that I had told her the watches were  not true She wants the discount and blah blah blahLady eventually voids the whole transaction puts all of the merch back and storms out Nothing was ever said again and I swiftly moved the watches in the tub TLDR Lady wants lifetime supply of watches pissed off when they arent priced for a dollar store and demands discount for false advertising,Watches Ill take ten,45

NotOnFile,20,12,1qoetf,38,Okay so Im not sure if this belongs to TFR or TFTC I have never been on the customer side of retail where something goes wrong It is always a smooth saleor thats what I though until I visited the chihuahuas hut I have been going there at least once a weekmore like two or three timeswell blame it on the holidays I work a night shift and we get out late then go for a drink or two and always finish the night off with a visit to that cute little Mexican dog place I didnt notice until today when my friend pointed it out that every single time I go to the hut they get my order wrong Every Time It didnt annoy me until tonight I started to think about it and found out that since I had to deal with those asshole customers all the time I never made a fuss when someone got my order wrong bc I would most likely always eat it until today It seems each time I go they miss two or three burritos on my orderIm a fat ass but I pay Its the same people each time so I can easily blame it on the same person and it be legit Tonight was the first time I checked my order before I got homewhich is about a gallon of gas away My order was a gordita crunch a quesadilla and two beefy burritos I was only missing a burrito nbd I tell the dude Im missing a burrito and he just gives me this look like forreal its a f burrito but he tells them anyways No excuse me or one moment please Eventually after much time wasted he makes a new burrito It really irked me especially when I realized that that specific crew screws my order up each time I go Not only that but when more people drove up he said are you effing kidding me Its your job bro Man up,On the other side,50
Hobothug,21,39,1qodto,201,So I work at a big popular electronics store in the US selling computers Ive done this for about  years off and on and its been a pretty good job for me throughout high school and college Aside from typical work BS not very many exciting things happen at work  but today was pretty specialSo I came into work in the early evening my typical Thursday shift and everything went completely as usual It was slow the customers we did have inquired about our Black Friday deals and I spent a good deal of time just making new price tags and doing other mundane tasks throughout the department Nothing special Sold maybe about  computers whatever So anyway Im in the midst of my third sale  customers had just picked out their computer and I was just making a quick joke about Black Friday when I glance towards the front doors open wide and exclaim Oh my god it came early as   or  people all in a group march in in quick successionMy customers turn to look and both they and I watch mouth agape as this huge group of people pile off of a bus and file directly into the computer department The leader of the group a loud woman with too many botox treatments comes up to me and quickly says These are all business teachers and Im going to spend some time teaching them about technology ok bye before dashing to the middle of the department and asking her massive group to circle around her They circled and filled up the entire middle of my department  making it impossible for legitimate customers to get near the merchandiseMy customers and I just watched as she began loudly beginning to welcome and begin her lesson  in the middle of my electronic department I was stunned for a moment  and then began looking for a manager any manager  because god knows that this situation was beyond my authority It didnt take long for the management to arrive My direct boss picked out the group leader made his way to the front and was like What do you think youre doing These are business teachers and were with the State Business Teacher Club and Im teaching them about the newest technology We already spoke to a managerI AM the manager and you didnt speak with meOh no I called and talked to a Diane We have nobody named Diane who works here total BS He was a bit dumbfounded and retreated just as the store manager arrived on the scene At this point I made an effort to rescue my sale and led my customers a bit away from the mob to talk about MS Office  as they had some questions Apparently as I was doing this our GM was on the phone calling all of the other managers to see if any of them had given permission for our store to be turned into a classroom with no luck This lady just forced herself and her class onto our sales floorAnd meanwhile shes going to town talking about products Shes not wrong or grossly misinforming them thankfully but she is doing quite a bit of product bashing along the way I would never buy an insert brand here computer always pick another brand Loudly And then she decides that it would be the opportune time to talk about Microsoft Office  as Im talking about Microsoft Office She and her group descend on me and my customers basically forcing us to get out of the way  and we took cover down the desktop aisle My customers and I just watched awe struck as this happened They made some quips about her Botox and her rudeness  and then we moved to a register far far away and I got them out of thereAnd then returned to my department where I stood at the corner looking distressed I mean it was the only space available and tried to explain to unsuspecting shoppers what in the hell was going on Management hovered nearby  shooting her looks designed to make her feel unwelcome debating about whether to kick her and her group out or notShe got the message thankfully and cut her lesson short  staying only an hour as opposed to the full two written out on their itinerary I looked it up online after I got home  they were supposed to spend TWO HOURS hogging up my department and then they got back on their bus and went back to their hotelUgh According to a friend who works at the hotel when they got back they were all complaining about the manager who asked them what they thought they were doing They SHOULD have been complaining about their instructor  who just led a humongous group into a store unannounced with the intention of using it as a classroom Ugh Agh Ugh,Botox lady and the teachers club The night my sales floor was turned into a classroom,240

auApex,22,28,1qnot0,128,This will be fairly long as it involves several incidents that happened over a few months  Quite a few years ago now I was working the night shift pmam at a  hour bakery to save money for an overseas trip  I had some of the most bizarre experience of my life while working in this place  Some of this might sound made up but I swear it is  trueThe first story involves a night shift manager  I worked with a crew of about five guys who were all really cool  The manager was a bit different from us but seemed OK  He was very Christian and constantly received praise from the owners for being responsible and a setting a good example  All was well until about five weeks into my stint  The manager started disappearing for short  minute breaks several times a shift  This didnt really phase us because it was generally quiet during the night shift and his absence allowed us to play up a bit by putting on good music and sampling a few of the delicacies on offer  However unbeknownst to us the owners were checking in from time to time on the video surveillance and noticed the managers absences  It turned out this guys sole destination during these breaks was the bathroom  The owners kept watching him and discovered that he was taking a certain kind of adult magazine with him every visit  So this guy was jacking off in the bathroom three to four times every shift  I didnt really have a problem with that but the owners did and he was firedThat was nothing compared to what happened next  A few weeks later the owners husband and wife team called us in during the day for a meeting  During this meeting they informed us that large amounts of money were going missing during the night shift and they suspected that one of us was stealing  Obviously this was a big concern and created a lot of distrust among our otherwise close team as no one knew who was taking the money  The real story behind the disappearing cash only came out because we all got together and called our union rep because we were threatened with dismissal and a police investigation   Did I mention the wife was a raging alcoholic and also a gambling addict  It turned out what was happening was the wife would get black out drunk at the bar across from the bakery come into the shop and collect the nights takings  She would then go to the local casino and gamble away everything  The husband claimed she was so drunk she didnt remember which is why she was so adamant one of us was stealing  This came out when the union rep told the owners he would initiate some sort of protective proceedings if they didnt give him footage from the security cameras so he could prove none of the staff was stealingThe final part is more tragic than funny  Obviously the situation with the drinking and gambling didnt do wonders for the owners marriage  Over the next couple of weeks we were witness to several latenight fights between the two at the bakery and got wind that the husband had left his wife and moved out of their house  Because we knew about the gambling incident and were witness to these fights the husband called us in for a meeting where he explained that his wife was mentally ill and going through a breakdownOne evening at the beginning of my shift the wife brought in her two young kids for a hot chocolate  It looked like they had been on an allday shopping spree as the kids had bags and bags full of new toys and clothes   Two evenings later the husband came in for yet another meeting  He was visibly shaken and very upset  He told us that his house had burnt down the night before and his wife was inside when it happened  She didnt survive  We didnt ever find out for sure but it was pretty clear she had taken her kids out for one last special day before taking her life and burning down her house  A very sad situation all around  At this point Id had enough and quit my job there  While looking for work a couple of weeks later I got a call from one of my former colleagues who told me to meet them for a drink as there was something they wanted to discuss  When I sat down the union rep we had talked to about the theft situation was also there  Apparently while looking into the place he discovered the enterprise agreement the owners made us sign so they could pay us normal wages during the night shift instead of overtime was invalid  As a result the business owed us standard wages as outlined in our relevant industry award  This ended up being thousands of dollars each because there was a clause that said we were entitled to  extra every hour worked past midnight and even more during Saturday and Sunday  We eventually settled with the owner for a payout of around half what was owed but it was still a large sum and gave me enough to immediately buy my plane ticket and go overseas  All up it was a crazy six months or so and not really worth the stress for a low paying retail job  It sounds stranger than fiction but everything Ive described above happened  This was the last retail job I ever worked as I took an office job when I got back from travelling  Thanks for reading  edit Shit just realised I missed one very important detail During this ordeal the husband was banging the day shift manager who was a long time family friend and the wife found out This was the main subject of several of the fights and us knowing about the affair was the reason he called us in for a special meeting after the fire Knew I left something out of my post It was seriously like living in the middle of a daytime telemovie

melism,23,47,1qn6l7,148,Ive been lurking for a while and this happened today so I thought Id share I apologize if this is a little difficult to read I am a sales manager at a car dealership Basically the way I function is if youre nice to me Ill be nice to you If youre an ass to me I am smarter and I will screw you and you wont notice it I think thats fair A customer well call her CB crazy bitch came in to buy a car today The car she wanted had an MSRP of  before any tag fees or taxes My invoice on this car was only  so I didnt have a lot of discount room available She comes in and gives my sales person a sob story of how her husband had just died and she was having a horrible year already I felt bad so I gave her a price of  on the car much less than the invoice price so yes we were losing money on it already minus a rebate for a competitive car this comes from the factory All I need is a registration of a similar car and she gets another  off There is nothing I can do about this You either have a registration or you dontShe then starts yelling at the sales person that she isnt trading in her other car I get up from my desk and go talk to her This is how the conversation wentMe Maam I hear you have a question about the pricingCB Im not trading in my carMe I understand You dont need to trade it in I just need proof that you own one so your registration is enough CB If I give you my registration you are going to steal my carMe No maam I just need it to send to corporate so that they can approve this rebate You can keep your registration I just need a copyCB Im not giving you my car and I wont buy it until you take that off right nowshe then went on a rant about how we were thieves my parents should have aborted me because I am someone who is willing to take advantage of an old lady the sales person was threatening her she didnt want to work with the sales person because he is black blah blah blah I stayed quiet and pretty much just sat there straight faced for about  minutes while she went onMe Ok Ill take it off You do understand that if I do that the price is going to go up right CB Of course it is because youre not buying my car Do you think Im stupid  minute rant on how educated she isI go back to my office with the sales person Usually when someone disrespects one of them that way I kick them out I ask him if he wants me to do that and he replied not if you can get me a good deal I go back to my desk and print out another price Remember how the MSRP was  but I was willing to sell it for   below invoice and a  rebate I gave her a price of  plus tag fees and taxesCB The price is different Why are you trying to take advantage of me Stop changing the priceMe I took off the rebate because you didnt want it I can put it back in but the price will go down when you let me copy your registration You dont want that do youShe agreed signed up and went on her way She paid over  more because she was a mean old lady ,Stop changing the price,195
IronyJudge,24,22,1qn3uj,82,Being in retail you grow a pretty long fuse When you have to deal with the worst of humanity on a daytoday basis there isnt really much that shocks you and most of the time you know that it isnt personal and that the customer is just a total assholeFor a few years I had some skin issues mostly localized to my hands I had a hangnail which got cut on a bag of dog food which then failed to heal and progressively turned into a bigger and bigger patch of scar tissue accentuated by the ridiculously dry air of winter That lasted about a year and a half before healing up Just as that was healing up I got a pretty good sized wart on my other hand right at the base of my index finger I got it frozen off and then a few months later it came back even bigger Due to the size and visibility of these I got a bit self conscious about themA guy came in one evening wearing a bluetooth  I got called in to help him figure out to put a harness on his dog I love these ones because most of the time i show them and they give a look like oh duh Most harnesses are ridiculously easy to put on Bluetooth guy was asking about one of theseBG How do you get this harness on a dog I have a littke skit I to through pretending my hand and arm is a dog As Im doing this skit he notices the wart on my fingerBG DAAAAAAAAAAMN HOLY SHIT YOU SHOULD GET THAT CHECKED OUT  Me I have Its just a wart Im treating it  BG Are you sure Holy shit man thats huge  Me Its just a wart Harmless sometimes itches Its nothing  BG Shit dude Are you sure thats not cancer or something  Me Yes  Side note Im relatively safe from a few forms of skin cancer due to my placement on the skin tone paint chart  BG You should get that cut off  Me Did that Grew back Trying a different strategy  BG Okay Man thats huge   Me Its not as though I dont know it exists  I then continue to demonstrate how to put a harness on a dog and how to adjust the harness to size Im pretty pissed at him by this point but able to maintain my composureWe part ways and I go back to doing dosing calculations for a fish tank with some ick problems and he comes over to me again BG So how do you adjust it again Hes got a daughter of about  running around his feet now  Me You take these little buckles  YOG DADDY WHATS THAT ON HIS HAND  BG Fucking ugly thats what that is  YOG then screams at the top of her lungs and hides behind his legsWorking in retail you grow a progressively longer and longer fuse Then there are customers who grab the fuse kink off the trailing two feet and light it an inch away from your limitI took the harness threw it at him said Figure it out yourself dick and stormed into the office where I told AGM of She wants you to apologize fame exactly what had happened including my reaction She basically said she may have handed the harness gently to him and not called him a dick but wouldnt have stood for it eitherTo top it off when BG bought the harness he told the cashier about the wart and that I really needed to get it checkedA few months later after the wart had been slain freezing  duct tape he came back and had some questions about dog food During the exchange he apologized for what hed said Some redemption but he still marks the only time Ive blown up at a customer,Daddy whats that on his hand,104

FredFltStn,122,465,1qmc2g,1154,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  In Florida we get our fair share of rain especially in the summer During light showers its business as usual but when the wind and the rain really pick up we batten down the hatches We lower the sides of the tent and use plastic to cover any shelving or product that may be getting dripped onOne afternoon we got the typical fast moving heavy thunderstorm with wind rain and lightning It really came up on us fast and we had a load of people in the tent shopping at the time I grabbed all of my help and we went crazy trying to get all of the sides down and boxes off of the floor before stuff was ruinedWe managed to get everything down and covered before we had gotten much damage We did however get totally soaked while all of this was going on my cashier was still ringing out customers and new customers were running through the rain and lightning to get INTO the tent No offense but in a lighting storm I dont even want to be in a tent in a parking lotOf course thats about the time we lost power It was early afternoon so we didnt really need lights inside of the tent and I actually have my registers on small uninterruptible power supplies UPS so they dont cut out every time the power fails My cashier is still churning and burning trying to get people out of the door About  minutes later the power still hasnt come back on its still pouring outside and the UPSs give up the ghost and run out of juiceNot a problem I was a boy scout and I have a backup plan for my backup plan My parents RV has a generator so I can switch over my critical power to that if I need to It does require us to reroute some power cords and stuff like that so I cant just flip a switch and make it happen but its doableMy dad and I brave the rain and wind to start getting stuff ready for the switch While Im out in the storm one of my employees comes out to tell me that they need me in the tentAt my counter screaming at my cashier is uber bitch UB Shes pissed off that my cashier has refused to ring up her purchase just because the registers are dead My cashier was nicely trying to explain to her that the power should be on shortly and they would ring her up as soon as possible but UB didnt want to hear about itThis particular cashier had worked for me for five years or so at this point and her father is one of my best friends Shed actually graduated high school and was home from college on summer break working for me I always joke with her that shes the boss and Im just there to do her biddingMy cashier is keeping her cool but I felt bad for her so I stepped in to try and defuse the situation UB demands to check out NOW because she has somewhere that she needs to be and I need to take care of itIm soaked to the bone and I just want to get this bitch out of my tent so I pull out my phone and ring up her purchase on that She actually had a pretty big purchase and when I told her the total she didnt believe it She wanted to see my phone to verify She then went down the list of stuff at least  items and questioned each price When she was doing this she actually found a mistake I had made I had entered in an item as  when it should have been  The only reason I knew this is that she was making me verify the price item by item as she called them out from my phoneYou should have seen the look on her face when it dawned on her that the only mistake she found was where I had UNDERCHARGED her I grabbed my phone back and happily told her I would fix the price for her and then gave her the new HIGHER total I should mention that the entire time theres a crowd of people around watching the scene and a couple of them started to openly laugh when this happenedWhen I told her the new total she lost her GD mind She started screaming at me that it was my fault and that she shouldnt have to pay for my mistake In fact she should get a discount for having to wait so long I let her yell for a good two or three minutes just standing there expressionlessIm tired Im soaked to the bone and my dad is outside in the rain trying to get the power switched over by himself because of this bitch I called to one of my employees and told him to put her stuff back on the shelf then I turned to uber bitch and told her Youre going to need to go somewhere else because youre not allowed to shop here anymoreI turned to my cashier in front of the customer and told her Dont sell that bitch anythingShe left screaming obscenities and threats the entire way out and into the rainONE YEAR LATERThe same cashier grabs me from the floor and points out a customer shopping in the tent Its the same uber Bitch lady that I had thrown out the year before and shes shopping with three or four other people To be honest even after seeing the lady I didnt place her face If my cashier wouldnt have recognized her Id have never noticed she was thereCASHIER What would you like me to doME Its up to you Youre the bossThe lady and her party finished shopping and got in line at the counter to checkout When UB got to the register my petite  year old female cashier stood her gound looked her dead in the eye and told her Im sorry you may have forgotten but youre not allowed to shop hereStone Cold BabyThe lady actually walked out of the tent without saying a word I think she was embarrassed because she was with a group In the end one of the people in the group paid for the stuff and they walked out confused as hell If youve seen any of my staff photos

sexisquidward,9,10,1qmamc,51,I worked in  Cafe for a few years during my first couple years of college and I can tell youpeople suck  I have tons of stories I can share from the shitty management to some of the better customersBut today I will share with you SmoothiePizza Lady  I had the blessing of working by myself one night with limited pizzas though it wasnt a particularly busy night  I just needed to clean and ring up the orders  It had been dead for sometimeA woman comes up to me and notices we were out of the supreme pizzas  She VERY much wanted ONE slice of a supreme pizza  She literally begged me to make more for her and I told her I could not  For one the pizza supplies were already cleaned up and put away and if memory serves me right we had no supreme pizzas that day  I think we were out of the veggies so the morning shift just made everything elseThis woman literally BEGGED me to make more  I explained to her that we were out of the product and that I couldnt make more  I offered her the Take and Bake pizza which from the name you know you can take it home and bake it  I explained that if she wanted to buy the whole pizza it would only be  as opposed to a  slice  She could take it home and have left oversWell apparently this woman lived with her mother who has to be elderly as sin since this woman had to be in her ss and her mother doesnt have an oven to heat up any slicesOkShes still begging me to make this pizza that i have NO INGREDIENTS for  Finally she walks away  Im like whatever and continue cleaning up the back She returns with the Take and Bake pizza  Im thinking ok she took my advice and is going to buy the pizzaNOPEShe wants me to cook the pizza and sell her a slice of pizza  I explain to her that I CANNOT DO THAT  She whines a bit longer and finally leaves  And she left for good finallySeriously this is over ONE SLICE OF SHITTY PIZZA A few nights later I was telling my coworker about the woman and my coworker was telling me about this woman who came late trying to get a smoothie after we had no more  While we were talking in the backSHE SHOWS UP  I just DIVE to the ground and my coworker is like OMG THATS SMOOTHIE LADY and Im like OMG THATS PIZZA LADYNow when we worked at  we would shut down the smoothie machine early by like we closed at  because it took FOREVER to clean out  It was the worst machine ever  Of course that is what this woman wants  She literally just stands there WHINING about how she wants a smoothie and how she wants us to stop the cleaning process while the machine is filled with cleaning water and make her a smoothie  NO  SERIOUSLY  My coworker explained to her that we had run out of ice cream and that it was in the process of being cleaned out  The woman just stands there and complains about how this happens everytime she comes in all of  times since we were the typical closers  Mentally thinking  is at the Mallthere are WAY better smoothies there than the shitty  smoothies  Except for when they had Pina Colada because that was the best everIn the end she never got her smoothie though she may have gotten her pizza that day that she so desperately wanted the other day  Its been a few years but I remember her,The SmoothiePizza Lady,61

MagneTismen,28,88,1qlrym,396,A recent posthttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsqktuchilichilieverywhere reminded me of a story from my time when I was in the fast food business Some of my earlier stories can be found herehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsznnifyoucantpayican Its been a while since I last posted feels refreshingSo I was working my rd  year in the fast food restaurant and was doing both cashier work and burger flipping This particular Sunday was fairly easygoing and not too many customers coming in and out Sundays usually meant slow business and thus lots of cleaningpreparation for the coming weekI was on the burger flipping side of the counter when I realised that we were about to run out of french fries so I did a quick checkup on what needed to be refilled and headed down to our storage room This was the only time during the day that I was not in the vicinity of the countercashiers and was gone for roughly  minutes When I come back up the three cashiers new girls who had worked lt months was standing scared shitless by the managers office and one looked like she was about to cry The following is a recap by one of the cashiers so I cant be  sure it went down like this but heres what happenedA father whom I had seen come in had ordered a meal for him and his two boys roughly  and  years old and went on to have their meal The father then comes back to the register and screams on top of his lungs that one of my kids cut their finger on a screw that was loose on the chair he was sitting on He then proceeds to grab said chair and throws it over the counter towards one of our cashiersYes you read that correctlyHe threw the frickin chair towards one of our cashiersApparently it didnt hit her but Im not sure that I wouldve been able to keep my cool if it happened to me unless I would be too flabbergasted to be able to comprehend what just happenedOur then roughly  cm tall thin blondehaired shift manager who at the time was  and was the nicest person you could ever deal with then went out to have a little talk with said dad On your shittiest of shitty days when you felt like putting your head in the fryer instead of the french fries she could come in and say HI MagneTism and all your problems would go away Thats how happy and nice she was Not today Game face onShe walks up to the dad and says with the most straightfaced and serious look Ive ever seenAwesome Happy Shift Manager Do you think that you as a father is setting a good example for your boys here by doing that Do you think that behaviour is acceptable Do you think that youre being a good role modelHis face was so red with shame that we probably got slightly skin tanned by his insecurity He apologised for his behaviour so much I thought he was never going outside of his house againStill the fuck dude Anger management plsTLDR Anger management pls,Lets assault the cashier for no reason,484

motownmissile,4,17,1qlbrx,13,Yesterday I had the experience of shopping for a new mattress while a morbidly obese woman was trying out mattresses apparently with no other intention than to lay on each mattress and render it unsellable to anyone else because of her breathtaking BO which will probably necessitate the mattress store fumigating each bed she graced with her presence Her BO was so bad one of the salespeople actually gagged while talking to herflies that entered the Circle of Smell dropped out of the air deadThe smell was so bad I went to a competing mattress store and bought from them just so I wouldnt have to endure the nauseating stench that emanated from her,Customer with raunchy radioactive BO at mattress store,30
Kellynn,7,13,1ql896,65,I just started my new job at a makeup store So far its been a lot of video watching but the other day I got to be on the floor shadowing the other girls and learning my way around the register I love my job already When one of my senior coworkers explained Listen If a client is being a dumbass give them to me If theres any question on a return pass them to me You can refuse a return and if theyre trying to make a stupid return you tell them no Youre in the right I actually did not know how to respond After working at my previous job see all my previous stories I dont know what to do at a job where they dont treat me like shit I think I could hear a choir of angels singing in the distance because a miracle has clearly occurred Anyway onto the story One girl is at lunch so theres two long time employees and me aimlessly following them around and being supervised on the register to make sure I dont blow the place up So one of my coworkers goes to greet a customer Now our store is very small Its a store within a store so its not like this is a huge place I would guess maybe twenty five feet max in every direction maybe The perfume rollerballs are towards one side of the store while the opposite wall is all of the bottles of perfume All of these have testers as well So the customer is at the rollerballs My coworkers greets her were watching them interact the woman is suddenly furious and then the woman walks off to keep shopping My coworker comes back over with a now opened rollerball The customer had decided that since there was no tester of the rollerball she would rip open a new one and use that as a tester My coworker explained to the woman that there was a tester of the full sized bottle on the perfume wall and the woman proceeded to start yelling at her about how it was too far of a walk and how dare she ask her to go over there to test a sample and why isnt there a rollerball sample over here Coworker is pissed and now has to damage out the perfume the woman opened She leaves to go take the damaged item to the back The woman continues to shop then comes up to check out Im doing the ringing my coworker is supervising to make sure I dont accidentally destroy the register The woman quietly says ListenI know shes not in here right now but will you please tell that other woman when she comes back that Im really sorry I didnt mean to get angry like that it was just I didnt want to go over all the way to the other side to test it Im just really sorry We tell her well pass her apologies on finish her transaction wish her a good day and send her on her way And despite her bullshit lazy excuse I am dumbfounded A customer admitted her mistake She apologized I am convinced that a hole is about to open up in the middle of the floor and swallow us whole because theres no way this is real life I still dont believe it ,Its the end of the world A customer actually apologized for their behavior,78
tactictactic,3,8,1qky67,29,This is a little story I find funny so I think Ill share itThis stuff is all important I swear So I have this uncle who is very stand offish when it comes to his family socializing with the rest of our family Our family is fairly close knit you could say We have family dinners  times a week and we all live very close to each other even this uncle However this uncle and his family are so standoffish that I only see them a couple times a year usually when they want to suck up to my other uncle who is loadedNow how this ties into retail I work at a fast food restaurant Since I have started working at this place this uncle and his family have come in to my restaurant twice and not once have they recognized me or acknowledged me The first time I took their order and the second time I brought their food out to them The second time my uncle even asked me to get some food that we forgotPersonally I think this is funny I mean Ive had people who I havent seen since I graduated nearly  years ago recognize me at work This either shows how little he is around myself and the rest of our family or just how little he thinks of fast food workers like myself that he wont even acknowledge me Either way Im looking forward to the holidays where Im pretty sure Ill be seeing him and can bring it up and make him look like a dumb ass,A little story that I find funny,37

momoyome,5,14,1qkp0e,49,I was out of work for a year and a half I have a college degree and a few units shy of my masters so I was fairly unemployable Finally a highend fashion retailer took pity on me and hired me last month I get between  hours a week usually closer to  hours but at least its proof that Im being productive somewhere and a paycheck The store I work in is in an outlet mall very close to the Happiest Place on Earth so we get a lot of tourists ready to drop big money on mediocrequality clothing I find it fun to talk to customers that are from all over because Ive done a lot of traveling myself I love sharing stories of me visiting their home country and telling them what I loved and missed I was working the cash register two weeks ago and a Mainland Chinese lady dumped a pile of clothing on me and started yelling in Chinese at me Now let me describe myself Im young slightly blonde and white I have zero Asian blood in me I dont look Asian at all and I certainly dont look Chinese I dont have a sign on me that says I understand Chinese The more she talks to me the wider my eyes get I finally moved her giant stack of clothing aside and said loud enough for her to hear me and probably half the store I dont understand Chinese in Mandarin I took a year and a half of Mandarin and I spent a month in China and it was the only thing I could think of to get her to stop causing such a scene Wrong move buddy Hearing Chinese made her speak even faster and louder I succumbed to defeat and started talking over her and in my broken Chinese found out she wanted me to hold her clothes for her while she went to the bathroom Not two seconds after she left the store my manager told me we were pushing payroll and it was time to clock out Told her there was a woman who only spoke Chinese and was quite loud going to be back soon and to have fun with that I chuckled all the way home thinking about what other poor souls that woman encountered that didnt understand her and she kept on talking to them thinking they could,I dont really speak Chinese,63

KroipyBill,25,58,1qkgre,211,A few years ago we had some spots during the winter that were rough This particular day working at a large electronics retail store was alright It was raining which meant we werent going to get snow finally At least not until the evening During the times it was raining an older couple came in not way old possibly s or so looking for a brand new massive TV I was assigned the task to assist them and they were overall extremely generous and nice It was over all a very pleasant experience showing them televisions how to mount and hook up components etc They eventually went the whole nine yards by purchasing a Bose sound system with a massive entertainment system attached to a flat screen mount and of course a BluRay player The entire endeavor was nearing  Graciously they paid for it and were excited for taking all of these new things home The TV was a  inch and the entertainment center box was extremely heavy I offered to carry it out to their car if he could bring it around front As the husband began to walk out the door he slipped and biffed it hard on the sidewalk I noticed there was a little bit of snow falling as it was later in the night but didnt think much of it As I rushed out to help him I too slipped and fell I got up helped the husband up and looked out onto the massive parking lot The light glare showed me how the parking lot was now one massive sheet of ice from the rain Husband Man I didnt think it froze that quicklyMe Yeah thats really insaneI began to contemplate how we are going to get this stuff out to his car The lot was sparse as were nearing closing time And his poor wife Shed probably eat it hard I helped the husband up as best as possible and we both walked inside My manager came over and we began to discuss the situation Manager Looks like if you carry that stuff youll get workers comp and maybe die Me Thanks for your concern youre like a father to meManager So how are we going to get all of this crap out of here I looked over at one of the floor carts Me DudeI need a long hard object Manager Ha my wife says that to me sometimes tooMe No stupid I need like a pole or something Manager Why Me I think Im going to row a floor cart with some of his stuff out there Manager looks at me wide eyed shakes his head smiles and gets me a  foot or so long PVC pipe I first started with the heaviest object which was the couples entertainment center I felt the weight would probably help me with traction I knelt on the cart placed the entertainment center on it and began using the PVC Pipe to row it out to the customers car He unlocked it using his remote after he saw me get there while losing all control with his laughter I crawled into his car and from the back of his car I pulled the entertainment center in I rowed back and put the TV and BluRay standing on the boxs side This was tricky as I had to row my slippery cart to his car while holding onto the TV Thankfully I managed and the customer graciously gave me the keys so I could drive his SUV to the front of the store for his wife and entertainment center They both drove off laughing and extremely happy of the outcome Needless to say my manager was excited to see what lengths Id go at to land a sale even if it meant an icy death ,An Icy Parking lot with Large Electronics,269
whereismypassport,12,18,1qke7l,102,I worked at a dry cleaning chain about half a year ago I have since gotten a better job elsewhere but every now and then I get to thinking of all the ridiculous customers I had during the timeOne night I was working the entire shop alone when a lady walked in The first thing she asked me was if I was alone because some other workers were familiar with her I told her it was just me there that night She proceeds to ask if I had heard of her and her situationThe lady tells me that she had used our services a while back for a lot of her clothes after her house was found to have a mold problem Apparently her insurance was covering the dry cleaning bill because all the belongings in said house were contaminated and a serious threat to her well being So not that complicated of a situation but when I ran up her name on the computer it turns out that she had brought her stuff in over a year ago Apparently at some part of our dry cleaning process the contaminated clothes had gotten even more contaminated possibly with some sort of radioactive chemicals Okay well then Because thats totally possible and everythingShe then tells me that her stuff should be somewhere in the shop possibly in a cardboard box with her name on it She insists on walking behind the counter and looking around for herself obviously not allowed At this point I ask her to give me a moment to call my boss He tells me there should be a box just as she described in the back of the shop He also advised me to remain very patient with this individualI find the box hand it over to her and she approaches it with extreme caution What happened next was like straight out of a candid camera show She pulled out gloves from her purse and demanded to go through each article of clothing  me as a witness by her side  and write down observations of them in a notebook she brought Some clothes appeared to trigger no symptoms in her others made her make strange sounds and movements and facial expressions I was watching this nonsense happen in front of me for at least an hour She would describe in such detail just how she would start feeling nauseous and light headed and tingly in her toes I couldnt help but raise my eyebrows every once in a while especially when she had me sniffing a hat and asking me if I could smell any type of abnormal chemical or if it made me feel strange in any way Every time I simply replied No it seems perfectly fine to me I loved he way she looked at me as if I was the one with an issueI asked if she would like to take any of the clothing home with her she looked at me with utter seriousness and said Well I would have to burn the car down after that so I would rather not a lot of my other belongings have already suffered that same fateTLDR mentally unstable woman had me sniffing her radioactive clothing for over an hour whilst flipping out completely,Mentally unstable regular at the dry cleaners,120

applecrumble,52,15,1qk89v,60,For those of you who dont know mystery shopping or secret shopping is when a company hires an outsider to go to a particular branch of their store on a specific date to pretend to be a customer and scope out whether the correct stockpromotions are in place employees are upselling as required and that customer service is at the standard expectedUsually the shopper will get paid a set fee or if they need to make a purchase to evaluate customer service they will get reimbursed for the costs and get to keep the item or a combination of both Its pretty fun to do you get paid and sometimes you get to score awesome free stuff I have about  worth of free stuff from this gained over the past year from a doughnut to a pair of expensive sneakersSo one time I had accepted an assignment at a store that sold nothing but expensive but really cute Tshirts For this job there was no set fee but Id be reimbursed up to  So I did the job it was easy I got a cool Tshirt out of it I submitted my assignment with a scan of my receipt to prove that I spent  on that specific day at that specific storeI got an email back from the mystery shopping website saying that I had completed the assignment on the wrong day and thus wouldnt be getting paid After some back and forth emailing it turned out that they had the wrong date on the site which they corrected But they still maintained that I could not be paid for doing the assignment on a different day to the one they wanted Now I have enough money to pay upfront for this stuff and not starve while Im waiting for reimbursement  but Im not rich enough that it doesnt hurt to see  gone on a Tshirt I never would have bought unless it were free I rarely spend that much on a single TshirtMy only alternative would be to go back to the store on the correct day return my item and buy another item and evaluate customer service again But I somehow had to do this without the return showing up on the purchase receipt and I had to pay for it in cashcard not store creditSo the day rolled around and I made the mistake of coming to the counter and saying to the guy behind it I want to return this Tshirt it wasnt in the correct sizeGuy pleasantly Oh well Im sure we can find the correct size for you and then well exchange the itemsMe Uhoh No could you process the return for this one please And then Ill pick out another oneGuy still pleasant Itll actually be a lot easier to process it as an exchange and get you  store credit to spend on another TshirtMe think think But Im not sure if Ill buy anythingGuy endlessly patient Well how about you have a look around and if you dont see anything you like well process the return and if you do we can exchange the twoMe panicking now pretty sure I had a crazy look in my eyes by now No Id really prefer for you to process the return nowGuy smile gone OK lets see your receiptthen followed a LOOOOOONG process in which he entered the receipt number verified my purchase asked for ID got me to recite my address from the ID put that and my name and phone number into the system etc This lengthy process must have been to prevent employees from processing nonexistent returns and keeping the cash By the end I could see why he hadnt wanted to do it when there was a simpler alternativeAnd after I put the poor guy through this I then had to ask him inane questions about the Tshirt designs materials etc to assess his product knowledge So here I was having forced him to do a lengthy and unnecessary return because I wasnt sure if I wanted to buy anything only to turn around and ask him specific questions as if I was very interested in the brand and the productsThen of course I selected another  Tshirt and brought it up to the counter for him to ring upNow he was very professional but I could tell he was inwardly frustratedraging He smiled tightly and said See I told you it would have been easier to just exchange theseI apologised grabbed my receipt and ran out of there Im sure I will form one of his crazy unreasonable customer stories and I have been too embarrassed to set foot in that store againAny of you recognised that you had a mystery shopper in store Any funny storiesinteresting experiences And what if any were the repercussions ie if they gave you a bad report was there extra training getting written up or God forbid getting fired etc,Any of you come across mystery shoppers before OR The Time That I Was the Nightmare Customer,75
yessircapntightpants,69,104,1qk546,588,I used to work for a video store which is this thing that used to exist that was kinda like Netflix except a Netflix you could walk inside  I was a Shift Leader one step below assistant manager and was working with my coworker whom well call Dave on a very busy Friday night  Dave was the sweetest most mildmannered person I ever met  Chipper and mellow and genuinely happy to be doing his menial thankless job  Friday nights at the video store were always a chaotic mess from about pm to pm  Huge lines of people wanting movies for their weekend viewing pleasure and a very limited number of cash registers and employees to ring them up The store I worked at had a fantastic Store Manager and as a result incredibly low turnover Everyone there knew what they were doing and we moved the crowds out fast provided no customer insisted on being difficult and taking up a register for ten minutes while they tried to figure out what phone number or name they put their account under or something like that So one particularly crazy Friday Dave and I are working the registers up front doing our usual hustle to get through the hordes of movierenters when in walks The Horrible Bitch THB from here on out  She had the sort of tan that one can only achieve by laying around and barking orders at the pool boy all day every day  Her bleach blonde hair was teased to nearJersey Shore levels and her acidwash skinny capris screamed I regret becoming an adult and am actively attempting to revert to my teenage years despite clearly pushing   The dead yet somehow angry look in her eyes was both haunting and repulsive  She had three boys with her ranging in age from roughly four to nineyearsold and she gave the impression that motherhood was the worst decision she ever madeShe didnt bother us while picking out movies and while she was curt and generally shitty to Dave while he rang her up she wasnt an exceptionally bad customer Dave was his usual sweet self and managed to get her rentals in order while she alternated between rolling her eyes at him making heavy sighing noises before answering questions and screaming at her kids to PUTTHATCANDYBACKRIGHTNOW  If you work retail you know that these sorts of customers barely phase you  Sure theyre unpleasant but if theyre not actively yelling at you and causing a scene you just kinda assume they had a bad day and try not to make it any worse  Dave handed her the movies she rented and wished her a pleasant evening as she left and then went back to ring up the next customer in the incredibly huge line Less than thirty seconds later THB angrily storms back in clearly looking for something  Dave sees her and asks if she forgot something and she snaps that she left her keys on the counter  Dave checks the counter and also the space behind his register and around the cashwrap but doesnt see any keys While still ringing up other customers he asks me and the other people working that night if any of us have seen a set of keys  No one has  A couple of helpful generally nice people waiting in line even hear this and do us a solid by looking around the front area since we cant really come around when theres a huge line of customers  No one sees any keys Dave is trying to helpful but he has other less horrible customers who need his attention so THB winds up storming around the cashwrap area searching for her keys amongst the display cases that line the registers This wouldnt be a problem except that shes searching by pulling all the product down from its neatly organized POP space and just leaving it in piles on the floor or the counter Were busy and shes clearly ready to explode so we dont even try to stop her  We both know itll be easier to just clean up her mess than it would be to try and reason with her  After tearing our cashwrap displays apart she starts loudly accusing us of hiding her keys out of spite  Maybe shes seen Clerks and maybe shes fully aware that shes an unpleasant bitch to the Plebians that ring up her purchases but shes become absolutely certain that we threw her keys in the trash She demands that we dig through the trash RIGHTTHISSECOND and give her back her keys We explain that we havent seen her keys and we certainly didnt throw them away Dave even takes a moment away from his register to show her the small trash bin we keep up front which is almost empty and clearly doesnt contain any keys THB is not satisfied  She wants us to check the big outdoor trash can by the door  Despite the fact that her truck is parked right in front of the store and that no one could have thrown her keys away in that can without her seeing them she is insistent that we drop everything and go pick through the garbage Honestly if it were a slow time and there werent any other customers waiting one of us probably would have thrown on some gloves and just done it Years of retail make you highly likely to do something you know is stupid because its always easier than trying to convince a customer that their request is in fact stupid  Its Friday night though and theres no way were closing a register to placate her obvious personality disorder She storms out again and Dave looks out the window a minute later and informs me that she has dumped out our outside garbage right in the middle of the sidewalk and is forcing her children to dig through it  Nothing like adding a little childlabor to your harassment of innocent retail clerks to really take things up a notch  He mentions that shes probably going to leave that mess there and hes not wrong  THB gets a cab or a ride home from someone so the next time we look outside shes gone leaving only a pile of video store garbage and her shiny new truck in her wake Later that night after close were doing our standard restocking and straightening of the concessions out front when Dave yells for me  I look up and hes pulling a set of keys out one of the candy bins  The same candy bin that THBs child had been digging through before she started screaming at him like a volatile harpee Now I dont know if said child just happened to drop the keys and forget or if it was purposeful revenge for the screaming or if he realized that hed dropped them but was too terrified of his psychotic mother to speak up but either way her keys had been there the whole time  Without a word Dave took the keys and walked out to the parking lot where THBs shiny new red truck was still stranded  Because Dave was such a nice guy I assumed he was going to toss them in the back and maybe throw a note on the windshield or something  Instead I watched him hold the keys in his hand and slowly gouge a scratch from the back of the tailgate to the front headlight and then throw those keys in the same trashcan that THB has upended during her rage  He walked back in saw me staring and said Bitch made me pick up garbage Fuck her and her keys And with that he quietly resumed his closing dutiestldr You forgot your keys,The woman who pushed my mild mannered coworker to commit vandalism,692
NotOnFile,15,11,1qk1mr,49,Okay so Im about to explode Im just ranting sorry for this word vomit Shes just getting the best of me I have the worst partner everIm a manager at a grocery store and at nights we have two managers I normally do the paperwork and the otherX is supposed to work the floor I always do paperwork bc she never stays on top of it Basically she takes two hours after the store closes and it takes me only fifteen minutes For some reason beyond me I often feel bad about the way I feel towards her Like I cant stand her being a manager bc I didnt like her to begin with Then she does me this huge favor to remind me how much she sucksShe just became a manager in July and it took her two months to train Two Months Anyways my old partnerwho was a great worker got another job so that means I need a new nighttime partner This means I get X Mind you she has had two months to train so I expect her to know as much as I doI had one week to trainduring holidays Day  So Im doing my paperwork in the office and up comes X who just plops down next to me letting out this dull sigh Theres nothing to dooo Now she was a cashier on my shift before she became a manager and knows this is NOT what you tell me Plus I cannot stand when Im working and you want to sit there and watch me work No there is always something to do and if you disagree I will happily find you something to do which is exactly what I did for her She learned quick to stop saying theres nothing to doAfter a couple days So shes learned to not come in the office while Im working She has started avoiding me at this point This one night I was ahead on my paperwork so I decide to fill my time with productivity I go check to make sure the necessities are being stocked by our bagger Nothing has been done I am a huge douche bag to those who think they are above doing grunt work Dont want to do it Get off my shift GO AWAY So I find them Im pissed They notice Im pissed They take the hint and start working the hardest theyve ever workedAbout a week afteryou would think shed learned by now As a manager you do not get formal breaks here Its short shifts anyways hour shifts Everyone else gets a ten minute break every two hours When there are two of us we can take turns going to the back to eat once everyone else is back from their breaks So everyone comes back from their breaks and Im helping a customer so I just tell X to go ahead and go eat bc its the beginning of the month and were about to get slammed As predicted they all come rushing in at once and everyone including me is on a register Wheres X I cant worry about that right now I have a line of customers and there are two people at the courtesy boothmanagers only are allowed to go in the booth I call her up to deal with the booth and go about my customers By the time we finish the rushabout five minutes the customers at the booth still arent serviced so I go fix them up Ten minutes pass and still no X and we get another rush This goes on for about forty more minutes with me constantly calling her bc I have no time to go on a wild goose chase Finally we slow down and I am pissed Not once did she come up when she was called Im behind on paperwork customers are still coming in packs and packs and theres no  X I go all around the store looking for her giving her the benefit of the doubt that she is in the warehouse where she cant hear the intercom My last spot to look is the break room and there she is with her feet propped on the table her music blaring playing on her phone I give her one deadly stare as she takes her feet down and turns her phone off acting like she wasnt on itno phones allowed Me You done with your vacationX Yea girl what you gotShe follows me into the office and once we are alone I go off I have a short fuse and this girl knows how to light it Youre supposed to be setting an example for your fellow employees as a manager and you want to screw everyone over by getting paid to sit there and play on your phone while we are working our asses off Are you kidding me If I see you in the back one more time any day of the week where you are supposed to be elsewhere Im clocking you out and Im tearing your card up Im done with having a shit partner who wants to sit there and cry when she gets a raise but when it comes to physically showing them how thankful you are for everything they do for you its the end of the world Hell no If you dont want to work then g t f O This catches her off guard She runs off and doesnt stop working until I turn the lights off I found out the next day I had made her cryThe next day went okay Shes slow but she worked I told her I dont like being a bitch but I cant stand people who dont work There are plenty other people out there who will work their ass off if they were in her position She says its okay and we have a good dayBeginning of last week She takes another long breakminutes I warn her if she doesnt start doing something Im gonna pull her card She finally comes out and starts looking busy That doesnt fly with me but I just told her to hustle She needs to step up her game This doesnt do much help but I do not want to explode againAll of our bosses know whats going on so theres no one else to report it to Im so tired of babysitting this chick Holidays start next week and if she doesnt step it up Im going to Abomb her ass real quick Were about to start handing out turkeys to all the plants workerswe hand out probably around  per holiday Excluding hams and doubles I do not see the rest of this year being a good oneI

Gneissisnice,159,242,1qjhdd,807,I work in a college bookstore as you could probably guess from the title You might remember some other stories Ive posted herehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentslmxvthecustomermetamorphosistheory herehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsivmcanigetadiscount and herehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsbcziwantitnow Today I thought Id share the story of why I stopped answering the phone at work warning very longNow its November at the bookstore and things are pretty much dead Weve sent all of our books back to the publishers and cleared out the store so theres not much to do except tell the lazy procrastinators no we dont have that book yes Im sure why did you wait until November to buy your book So when the phone rang I was eager to have something to do Boy was I wrong about that University bookstore this is Gneiss speaking how may I help youHi I was wondering if you could pull up receipts for my daughters purchases since  WHAT No I cant do that I explain that for us to find it she would need the exact date and time for each purchase Not that we would even be able to pull up a transaction from three years ago anyway But then a thought occurs to meDid you maybe order them online I ask She says that yes she ordered everything online Ah thats a different story and doable But just because I can do it doesnt mean I should Why does she need receipts from  semestersI ask her why and she explains that her crazy exhusband refuses to pay for her daughters textbooks unless she can prove that she only spent money on books and not sweatshirts or other merchandiseOh Uh okay I guess that kinda makes sense in a way Ignoring the obvious questions like Why is your husband paying NOW  years later and He really wouldnt pay if your daughter did buy any logo merchandise I decide to send her the emailsI pull up her daughters book orders and tell her that they only go back to Fall  She asks why and I dont know but I guess that we either changed systems at that point or it just doesnt store the orders for more than a few years I mean how often would you need to pull up orders from that long ago Shes unhappy with that but we proceed She asks if I can cc her on the emails Nope I can only send them to her daughters email that the order was placed under and I tell her the email address to confirm that its correct Now that the orders have been fulfilled I cant change any of the information I do tell her that she can have her daughter forward her the emails though and she agrees to that As I start sending email after email I inform her that one of her purchases has the status of CancelledWhy she inquiresProbably because you cancelled the order I respond  emails and  minutes later were finally done She thanks me and thats thatOr is it Apparently not as it turns out A few hours pass and I hop on the front register as it gets somewhat busy Just as I get off the manager calls me over Gneiss phone for youPhone for ME Thats weird I pick it up Its Her Hey Gneiss you helped me out earlier I just had a couple of questions One my daughter didnt get all of the emails Whats going on I pull up her orders again and I immediately see the problem Your daughter changed her email the first few orders went to her old email I did say that the emails were going to that email Oh Cant you change the emailSigh No maam as I explained earlier we cannot change the email address You should have your daughter check her old email and see if its thereOk Well can you send them again SIGH Sure why not Its not like I have anything better to doOh and my other question Are you SURE that you cant pull up anything earlier than  I explain to her that yes Im sure Here come the dreaded words Can you check with your manager to make sure Ugh I put her on hold and go over to the assistant manager who usually deals with web orders I explain the situation and he thinks the entire thing is absurd but he agrees to check the womans order He asks for name and I tell herHis eyes widen HER and suddenly memories come flooding back to me The woman that kept me on the phone for an hour last semester asking me to go over the price of every book her daughter had rented The woman who calls once every couple of weeks with some kind of crisis

lel,31,17,1qimeq,45,Edit Whoops this turned into quite the rant Sorry for the length guysBackground I work as a cashier at a supermarket chain in AustraliaRecently the service staff have been told to start collecting trolleys from the two carparks we have in the complex one upstairs and one underground Im still not entirely sure where the trolley guys are as theyre the ones who were employed specifically for this purpose but oh wellI actually quite enjoy it It makes a nice change from just standing around at the registersSo the other day I was pushing trolleys Now Im a  year old female naturally quite small but I consider myself to be strong I have recently started lifting weights at the gym and love it So after a few comments like these I started getting really pissed offAsshole guy Ive encountered him one time before this Hes downright arrogant and very loud Kept telling me how much money he has like I was supposed to be impressedHe walks towards me from the shop and sees me pushing trolleys towards the doors He grins and says more like yells Sending a woman to do a mans job huhI ignored him and kept my eyes forward He muttered something under his breath as I walked into the storeNice old lady was standing at the top of the ramp that leads to our downstairs carpark She stood aside for me as I pushed the line of trolleys up sweating profusely and probably quite pinkNice old lady Oh thats no job for a young ladyI chose not to say anything and just smiledA couple of other men would walk past look concerned and also a little amused and ask Are you okay or Do you need some help I decided to firmly respond with No thanks It was getting hard at this point to keep myself from snapping at them but I knew they had good intentions One man came straight up to me I had just started trying to pull out a trolley that was stuck between the curb and the concrete blocks that are at the top of parking spaces not sure what theyre called He walks straight up says need some help and without waiting for an answer lifts the trolley up for me I told him thanks and stacked it with the othersMy boyfriends friend and his girlfriend came up to me as I was trying to turn the line of trolleys around to get up the ramp Him Hey are you alrightMe Yeah Im fineHim Why are you guys doing the trolleys now What happened to the trolley guysMe I dont know Its weird its like they disappeared or somethingWe both laughHim So whyd they get the smallest girl to do it thenMe teasing Hey Im stronger than I look okayI felt that I could be more honest with him in what I said as I knew him as a person outside of work not just as a customerHe like most of the others was obviously trying to be nice and help me out but it really made me angryDo I look weak I kept thinking to myselfI guess I get a bit red in the face when I do any physical activity but it doesnt mean that Im necessarily strugglingAlthough I was struggling I dont want to admit it as this reinforces the weak little woman stereotype that Im trying to avoid But I was only struggling because it was the second time I had done this and I still wasnt used to the work What Im used to is standing around and scanning stuff Its quite a big change in the amount of physical activity you have to do I really feel like I have to prove myself now somehow As I said at the start Ive been lifting weights at the gym and I love seeing the progress Ive made in the size of my biceps I am by no means weak But I am not used to the sheer exertion needed to get a line of trolleys up that ramp Anyway I just absolutely was not expecting the number of comments I would get based on the fact thata I am female andb Im doing something extremely physicalTLDR Every time I think being female has little to no bearing on how I am treated in the workplace I am proven wrong,A Tale of Trolleys Sexism and stereotypes in a supermarket,62

SeaBones,9,14,1qh76g,30,Ive done my time slaving in the mall most of us have Its times like this during that calm before the explosion of the postThanksgiving holidays that we sit back and reflect on the mall as an entity that serves human kind with tons of bullshit to waste money on Its there to wander around as we examine the contrived realities that corporate stores have created A chance to walk in and out of separate sustained little environments offering up soaps and teas and shoes and sausage logs Keurigs and linen sets Handbags and jewelry We employees walk bleary eyed to our daily grind practically hovering in slow motion through rivers of human flesh slurping pumpkin fraps and dragging built bears by the leg like prisoners taken in warAll of this is set up and carefully placed in window displays and store designs to offer you the chance to finally start living your life to the fullest it possibly can be Teas to awaken your spirit clothing to flatter candles to enliven your senses gifts to open up on Christmas morning and gawk at in awe as your family shares a moment to revel in your apparent moneyspending brilliance So I ask myself what more can this contrived corporate fantasyland possibly do to bring people in Ive witnessed the evolution of the mall from indoor wasteland of records and grungy teenagers to outdoor meccashttplbpostcomimagesbusinessthepikeoutletjpg that successfully lead a family through a day of parades and outdoor shopping glee to nighttime restaurants and movies A full experience where the most money can possibly be spent These outdoor malls have concerts childrens games and events at day and bustling restaurants become clubs and popular bars at night Its a complete package Its not just something to show up at and leave its something to stay at To live inCould a person live in the mall Could a person become a fixture in this dystopia Could a person open their window to advertisements of new body washes for the holidays and listen to drunken nights out at night Can a person do this in the comfort of suburbia The answer is apparently yes and its already happeninghttpwwwbelmarcoloradocom As I searched for apartments I came across a new trend thats now being incorporated with outdoor shopping and theater centers Cut and paste luxury middle class condos and moderately priced apartments right there in the comfort of a mall environment and conveniently located right in your suburban area They pop up seemingly overnight It isnt the result of apartments and Chinese restaurants coming and going over time its a premade specifically designed shopping and living dystopiaSo theyve done it the bastards A completely pluggedin hip new standard of living that provides a mass goods store entrance mere feet from your front door and a corporate candle store visible from your morning breakfast table Not only will residents never escape this mall lifestyle theyre permanently incorporated in it so that customers are literally forced to walk by stores on a daily basis Is this happening in your area Are you yourself now a mallelement How far will we go to give in to corporate stores forcing their way into our lifestyles  ,Let the Malls Take Over an Observation,44

FredFltStn,120,227,1qgzk5,775,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  Im very picky about the fireworks I carry and I make sure I choose only the best and most reliable products for my tent To back it up I also offer a NoDud Guarantee Basically if it doesnt work bring it back and Ill refund your money or give you something better What I really need is a Its not a dud youre just an idiot guarantee Mortars are one of my favorite types of fireworks Basically you place the provided tube on a flat level surface you load the ball or canister shell into the tube you light the fuse you run like hell The fuse lights an ignition charge which sends the shell up into the air The fuse then lights the shell charge which explodes with different effects or colors Mortar shells have to be loaded into the tube with the lift charge on the bottom Most of the mortar shells I sell have TOP and BOTTOM stickers on the shell The mortar shells themselves are manufactured so that if they are put into the tube upside down the fuse wont be long enough to stick out of the tube The instructions on how to load and light the mortars are included with every box of mortars I sell Its often printed on the box AND on paper instructions inside the box   Sounds pretty simple rightHere are a few of my favorite Its a Dud returns for mortars so far Its defective   The guy lit the mortars first and then dropped them into the tube  He missed the tube and the mortar exploded on the ground That made it defectiveThey didnt fly up into the air before they exploded    It turns out he was lighting the shells in the middle of the street with no tubeIm too drunk to light these    Now heres a guy you can be proud of He actually realizes that hes too loaded to light these safely so he wants to exchange them for something else I happily exchanged the mortars for some finale cakes which are much easier to use My pride was short lived after I watched him climb into his car to drive away after we made the exchangeIm afraid that Im going to hit a plane   We asked Hes nowhere near an airport He just thought that they flew so high they might accidentally hit a plane if one flew byTheyre blowing up in the tube    Ok this rarely happens but it can His pack had come with two tubes and both were destroyed when he tried to fire off a mortar I assumed the shells had gotten wet While I was swapping out his package of mortars for a new one he also complained that the fuses werent long enough and that hed had to stick his lighter into the tube to light the damn fuse When I showed him how that could only happen if he put the shell in upside down he got mad at me and told me off Sadly the upside down shell thing happens so often that we now keep a collection of exploded tubes on the counterThey blew my tube apart   The guy decided he wanted a better show so he had actually loaded three shells into the tube at once and lit themThese things are dangerous It scares me every time I light one   Once again a guy was lighting the mortars first and then dropping the lit mortar into the tube He fired off a few and then returned the rest because he thought it was too dangerous When I showed him the instructions printed on the box he yelled at me because How the hell am I supposed to read that in the darkMaybe they should watch fireworks on TV next yearIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,Please feel free to ignore the safety instructions Tales From a Fireworks Tent,1002

Gotten,4,16,1qg8c6,89,I dont really have a Big story to tell so Ill just post a few of the smaller ones here and try to make it look half way readableTo start out I work in a convenience store gas station Its small and basically built to be easy to get in and out with what you want For those of you who havent had the pleasure Ill give a small synopsis of my job My official title is Customer Service Representative CSR for short which basically means I do everything There is no one person for different jobs We are the cashiers cleaners stock personnel and as the title suggests we assist customers as best we can Another thing of note is that managers arent in day round My assistant leaves around pm every day where as the manager is in from am  pm When the manager isnt present I am in charge of the store and its my responsibility to handle all situations short of emergencies by myself All of this information plays a key role in my stories The Drunken LadyIts not too uncommon for someone who is inebriated to stumble through my door Most of the time its to hit the head or grab some sort of food item to help them absorb that last bit of alcohol lingering in their stomach before they black out But this lady was a bit different She came in followed closely by the stench of alcohol Obviously extremely intoxicated waited in line until she got to the front and asked for a pack of cigarettes I ring them up and place them on top of our printer seated neatly beside the register behind the counter and ask her how she was going to pay She said debit which I knew was going to be a problem as it usually was with people who are intoxicated and I pressed the corresponding button and asked her to wait for the strip to light up before swiping her cardIntoxicated LadyIL Swipes card way too early Why is it asking me to swipe my card I already didMe You have to wait for the blue lights before you swipeILshoots me a dirty look and swipes her card again continues to enter her pin and then stares blankly at meMe I notice that my side is still asking for her PIN a common occurrence when you put in the wrong PIN Maam you need to reenter your PIN numberIL enters her PIN still not taking it continues to enter it  more timesOur machines are built that if you enter your PIN incorrectly  times it cuts you off and puts a stop on your card as a theft deterrent So it gives me that messageMe Maam youve entered your PIN incorrectly too many times my machine wont take itIL Ok where are my cigarettesMe Your card was denied it didnt go throughIL Stares daggers at me Ill send my friend in you need to learn not to be so rude to customers The Impatient AssholeThis one literally happened  days ago as most people who work in my line of work Ive pretty much developed a tough skin towards any berating or asshole inclined customers Instead of getting upset I have learned the boundaries Im allowed to work within when dealing with them As I said before CSRs are the jack of all trades when it comes to the job As I was cleaning up working a solo shift I emptied the trashcans next to the soda fountain unbeknownst to me someone had taken the liberty of tossing a half full drink into the trash and it lead to the area behind the register being covered in sticky goop I mopped as best I could between customers If youve ever mopped then you know that once a mop has been used to clean up such a big mess the mop head is completely useless In stead of cleaning it will just spread the mess and dirt all over So I tossed it cleared out my customers and went into the back store room Literally  feet from the register area to make a new mop bucket I had just poured the detergent in and started the water when I hear a customer calling out Not abnormal even though its  feet away when the water is running its impossible to hear anything else So I turn the water off and walk back out It should be noted the time I walked in to the back room and the time I walked out wasnt even a  second time span So the customer had only been waiting maybe  seconds at mostImpatient AssholeIA Finally I could have walked out of here with these beers by the time you came back out hereMe OkIA So it would have been Ok if I had walked out with them thenMe Well thats called shopliftingIA Well I should have just left instead of waiting for your fucking ass to come out hereMe places beer behind the register Out the doorIA WhoMe You You can walk out the door right nowIA Well fine then Ill just take my business to the next store thenMe Ok DipshitI would come up with a better title for this one but in all honesty its the only way to really describe someone of this caliber In the  years Ive been working retail Ive yet to have this story topped by anyone Ive encountered Selling age restricted items comes with the routine of checking IDs We even have a stupid bright yellow button that says We ID Under  that we have to wear on our uniforms Working early morning my manager had come in and was waiting for the safe to open so he could count the deposit for the bank Dipshit walks in I had seen him before maybe once or twice but not enough to remember if I had carded him for cigarettes as he was easily under  Dipshit Dipshit I need a pack of Me grabs them and rings them up placing the pack on top of the receipt machine as always And I just need to see your IDDipshit Seriously Youve seen me beforeMe I need an ID to make a saleDipshit Seriously If you dont sell me the cigarettes Im going to call the copsMe Uhh go aheadDipshit AlrightSo he leaves the store and my manager had overheard everything He calls the cops and just to make sure you know the cops love me I give them free coffee and fountain drinks and on top of that they all know Im cleaner than HoneyBooBoos moms plate and when Officer McAwesome shows up he just looks at me My manager tells him what happened and even pulls up the video for him He used the anonymous tip line and told the cops I was selling pills and snorting them on the counter He currently has an arrest warrant out for misuse of civil help lines and diverting police forces because he was stupid enough to come back and give my boss his IDThats all I got for now have a few more stored up if there is an interest for it Hope you guys enjoyed the read,Collection Of Small Stories,105
jokicksass,13,28,1qg4us,117,This is my first post of this sub after being a long time lurker Im pretty excited to finally have something to finally contribute here Im also writing this on my phone so please excuse any formatting and grammatical errorsBackstory I work at a pretty well known chain that sells novelty tshirts and adult items in most major malls in America and Canada So Im standing behind the register ringing up a customer When I finish my manager rushes over to me and says Theres a naked guy in the store  I look around and cant see what shes talking about I then look to my immediate right which is towards the front of the store and there is this frumpy looking older Hispanic guy with only a button down shirt on Im immediately taken aback by this sight My first thought was that he was probably drunk or high  As my manager is fumbling for the store phone to call mall security I see the guy start to squat and strain like hes trying to take a dump in the store I immediately run out of the store to try to get security here faster As soon as I leave the store I see a security officer standing by our window talking on his talkie to someone else describing the situation to them    I tell him that this makes guy in my store is trying to take a dump on the floor He just looks at me then goes back to staring I walk back into my store frustrated trying to figure out what to do A few seconds later  security officers walk in with gloves on and the woman that was supposed to be watching him   Apparently the guy was with a group of special people and got separated from his group The officers told my manager that he had just finished taking a dump in front of the store right next to ours His pants were in a corner not too far away from my store I can only hope my week gets better,Happy Monday,145

AKADidymus,18,46,1qft7b,178,I heartily dislike working in retail Im kind of ashamed to be back at it after escaping multiple times but I had an experience the other day that made me proud of my work Note I did not say proud of where I work but proud of my workI usually work the cash register my whole shift but when the lines are short and there arent enough cart pushers cashiers can get sent out into the parking lot So when I got the call I went to the break room and got my jacket then walked out into the parking lot and started retrieving carts After about half an hour of working with one of the fulltime cart pushers talking and making progress clearing out a couple of the fuller corrals by hand he said to me Im glad they sent you out thoughI was startled for a moment Whys that I saidBecause you workI smiled and said and Im proud of it And its true I found something to hang my pride on I see many people who take jobs they feel are below them and they do a halfhearted job at them Either theyre making sandwiches and they put no effort into distributing the ingredients or theyre pushing carts and they spend the whole time on the phone I do feel that Im above the job I have because I worked hard for a degree and a skillset that should be paid better But if I cant do well at a job I feel Im above what would that say about me I dont want to be working where I am but I do what I do well At least I have that to hang my hat on  I am proud Pride is the source of shame I have never been able to swallow my pride well,Because you work,224

breezy,11,26,1qfs9m,121,Remembered another story from my patriotic teen clothing store days This was during the summer when everyone was out shopping and enjoying the nice weather My store was part of an outdoor mall which in the midwest is the dumbest idea ever but clearly nobody asks me my opinion on real estate Now we had  fitting rooms and one room that was handicap accessible at the end of a long narrow hallway which was a stupid design for anyone with a stroller or wheelchair trying to navigate that way On a normal day we wouldnt use the big room unless someone was handicapped or had small children with them because it was further away and people tended to make a bigger mess there for some reason On busy days though we would put people in the big room as soon as it emptied never saving it specifically I was working fitting rooms during one of these busy days and all of our fitting rooms were full when a woman came up to me pushing her childaged daughter with a clear disability Im thinking cerebral palsy but Im not an expert in a wheelchair Woman shall henceforth be known as Ridiculously Entitled or RE RE Im so sorry to bother but my daughter has had an accident and I need to change her really quick Could we use a dressing roomNow normally you can only use a dressing room to try clothes on but in this particular outdoor mall the bathrooms are quite a ways away and the woman looked desperate So I told her she could use the next open fitting room and she settled in to wait About two minutes later someone came out of a regular room and after I cleared the clothes out I gestured to the woman that she could change her daughter in there It would be a tight fit but these rooms were still large enough to bring in a stroller and fit a bench and try clothes on Me Here maam you can use this one RE Thats too small I need the handicapped room Me If youd like to wait for the handicapped room thats fine but a mom and daughter went in there right before you came up so theyll probably be a while It might be faster just to walk down to the restrooms RE Thats ridiculous I need that room you need to ask them to move to the smaller room Me Im not going to try and move them and all their items to a different room if you would like to use the larger room youll have to wait for it RE I cant believe youre discriminating against my family like this this is illegal and I can sue this company for you refusing to serve us Me Maam Im doing you a favor The fitting rooms are for shoppers only so if youre not willing to use the open room or wait for the big one Im going to have to ask you to leave She threatened to call and have my job and sue and etc etc I told my manager what happened at end of shift but never had any followup so I can only assume the lady realized that refusing to kick actual customers out of the fitting rooms wasnt infringing upon her civil rights ,Maam Im doing you a favor,147
thebenzenemolecule,4,13,1qfry1,34,Im new to Reddit and havent made my account yet so my friend uthebenzenemolecule is letting me use hers for this storyBackground I work in a large garden store in Australia and Ive enjoyed the work there so far Its pretty quiet most days but I hadnt been working there long when this woman came inShe wasnt too large a lady but she was certainly not small by any means and she would have been in her mid to late thirties She came into the store and passed the registers at the front I wasnt serving anyone at the time but she didnt seem too out of the ordinary so I carried out my job Just outside our indoor section she attracted the attention of a trolley boy and asked him where the toilet was He pointed and gave her directions towards the garden centres cafe She took a step towards the cafe hesitated then turned back aroundShe walked over to a spot where we had piles of mulch stacked unashamedly dropped her pants and began defecating on the damp concrete floor When she was done she pulled up her pants and walked inside past the registers ignoring the shocked looks of myself and the other employees and exited the store The trolley boy came over and uttered something along the lines of Did she just to which I replied I think so Hesitantly we kind of just stared in the direction of the mulch until I decided to investigateI walked over to the mulch I could already smell it Interestingly she had found a random plastic bag and used it to hide the poop and when I say hide I mean that the plastic bag was transparent and the poop was in no way hidden So then I did what any good employee would I cleaned up that strange womans poop And then I went on my lunchbreak Im just wondering what exactly goes through a persons mind when they know where the toilet is but still choose to poop on the floor outside on a rainy day in a garden centre,The toilets are right over there maam,47

kaggzz,23,46,1qf10t,235,This is a really old story  I was working for this company that is currently considered a fossil  It was like a Redbox that you could walk in to but with a ton more movies  Oh and most of the movies were on this format called VHS DVDs were just really becoming a thing  We had a lot more movies especially old ones compared to Redbox and we were more a fan of blue than redThis particular store was in a fairly welltodo neighborhood  The plaza has one of the worst parking lots of all time  Not a day went by without some sort of almost accident and sometimes there was no almost about it  I got backed in to about once a year  Many people would park in the fire lane about the only safe place to park to throw a movie in our drop box to pick up or drop off a passenger or to grab a togo order from one of the many restaurants  If you were there for thirty seconds nobody cares  If you wanted to be there longer Well it didnt help the flow of traffic for one and its a general evil thing to do  Enter Richie McLatefee  RML is a regular sort of customer the one who is too important for the rules to matter to them  RML is handreturning a movie he was suppose to have back a week ago but because he is so important he is not going to pay the late fee  All too common a thing  Dr McLatefee MD DDS PhD PsyD ESQ DDT EX CT has their brand new limited edition Mercedes parked in the fire lane outside of store  To make this understandable he has a car that costs six figures parked illegally to yell at a couple of register jockeys over a  late fee he knows he owes  Now if they had been cool about it wed probably have cut the fees in half instead he is on the ten minute mark of a tirade that has more curse words than I thought was possible about how Richie McLatefee is a better breed of human being compared to us scum who are forced to wear a polo with a corporate logo and a collar thats a completely different color from the rest of the shirt and that it is somehow our fault that he did not return his movie in a timely fashion  Our hero the Mall Cop we shall call Awesome enters  He would breeze by every so often basically just making sure that everything was OK and maybe to hang with us as he was wont to do  After listening for a minute Awesome comes up to the register interrupting DML mid stream of vulgarity Awesome Excuse me sir is that your car outsideRML  Yes It is  Now buzzoff Ive edited this by removing the cussing also were talking about an incident over a decade agoAwesome OK just want to tell you its in a fire zone and you might want to move it soonRML  Whatever you wage slave  I cant believe I have to crawl in this putrescence and lower myself to deal with scum like this  That man in the polyester shirt and tin badge almost touched me  I could buy every one in here RML pretty much stopped for breath never  Awesome left  At this point the entire staff was so desensitized to the whole entitled customer thing that we pretty much let him wash over us like so many nagging doubts about life  I happened to turn to watch Awesome leave in part because I was hoping he was going to stay and save us all  He went right out to stand in front of RMLs car his little cart was behind  Giving DML only half an ear it was usually a good idea to ignore these sort of customers as well be sending him to collections sooner rather than later I watch Awesome count down one minute the go back to his golf cart  He grabs this giant orange square from his cart plastering one on the drivers and passengers side of RMLs over priced car  Calm as you please Awesome comes back in to the store grinning  As am IAwesome  Just thought you should know the tow truck is about  minutes away  I got the info so byeRML  And the polyester blend is back  My god do you have any idea who I amAwesome stayed in the store and the three of us block Richie McLatefees view of his car  Hell we even got to the point where we gave him some sort of hope that we would waive the late fees to keep him there  We even manage to keep his attention till the tow truck operator puts a hand on his car  In this state that means he is officially towed  RMLs car is hooked up we send his account to collections and Awesome is out there laughing and yelling at RML for parking illegally  TLDR Richie McLatefee is better than your or I but not better than Security Guard Awesome whose powers include the removal of overpriced luxury cars,StripMall Cops Are Heroes,281

millondefloss,7,64,1qem78,323,Just a short one but I had to post this because Im just so very very proudMy colleague is only a teenager  and this is her first voyage into this wonderful world of customer service Ive seen her cry Ive seen her take insults personally Ive seen her frantically apologise for things completely beyond her control but I knew that once upon a time I was just like her and that developing a thick skin takes a while Today she finally stood up to a customerHe had been screaming at her for five minutes and more doing the typical angry customer spiel of demanding the moon on a fucking stick and initially she dealt with him as usual  apologise sympathetic noise and repeat This was to no avail he just wouldnt stop screaming Finally she manages to tell him that this really isnt something she can deal withCustomer I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND WHY NOONE WANTS TO HELP MEAnd now comes the point when I wanted to burst into spontaneous applause She set back her shoulders looked him square in the eye and saidWell sir when you come into a shop and decide to scream at an advisor refusing to listen to anything they say and generally abusing them its not exactly surprising that the advisor may be LESS INCLINED TO HELP YOU sirI was speechless but luckily the awesome customer I was serving turned to the man and said chirpilyShes right you knowSweet sweet justice I think my colleague will be just fine with shitty customers from now on,Like watching your kid take its first steps,387

Betelgeuse,69,117,1qekfj,552,So I used to work at a Retail store that for the purposes of this story we shall call Paper Clips  This story will take some minor setup just to describe how the store is set up  We have one main desk that is at the front of the store and works like a customer servicecheckoutTech Support combo pack  To the right of the Front Desk is a oneway enter door that only opens to people entering the store  To the left side of the desk is the actual door that allows you to exit the store  Right in front of the service desk is our selection of tablets which as you can imagine is quite popular with they young kids and sort of allows the adults to shop in peace as their kids play gamesOn this particular day a Mom comes in with her  kidswell say the oldest was about  and the youngest  and starts shopping  The oldest of course immediately goes to the tablets and starts playing games oblivious to the rest of the world  The mother starts to finish her shopping and warns the kids to stop playing games and get ready to leave  The  year old boy of course ignores her completely absorbed in a game of Angry Birds or whatever he was playing  As I am checking this lady out her two youngest get ready to leave with their mom and abandon their games like good kids  She gives the oldest two more warnings by the time I finish up her order but he keeps playing and shrugs her offThis is where her Epic Parenting kicks in  She looks at me says thank you for ringing me up takes one last direct look at her oldest kid still playing the game frowns and and then leaves the store  I look at the oldest kid for a minute and watch her load up her bags and kids into the car  At this point I get worried cause I really dont want her to leave the kid behind too much paperwork  So I turn to the kid and say Hey kid  Your mom is leaving you behindNow then at the same time he turns around looks for his Mom she is actually slowly driving away in her car essentially looking like she is leaving him behind but not really  Kid goes into FULL PANIC mode and runs the wrong way to our door that only opens for incoming customers and realizing it isnt opening starts trying to pry it open with his bare hands like he is about to be killed by zombies or something  Kid also starts yelling for his mom and is almost in tears I am too but its because I am laughing so hard  Now our doors arent really heavy but for a  year old it would probably be like trying to pry open a steel trap  The mom meanwhile is slowly driving away along the front of our store  Im in tears laughing so hard and was about to help the kid but my Manager got there first and managed to flip the reset switch at the top of the door which made it open for the kid  The mother sees this happen and stops the car to let her kid catch up and jump in  I catch her gigantic smile as she drives off probably knowing he will never do something like that again  My manager looks at me confused as hell wondering what was going on and I tell him she was going old school parenting on him which gets a nod and smile from him as he goes back to the officeTldr Kid plays games and doesnt listen to mother and gets fake left behind to teach him a lesson  laughs were hadedit this is my first post ever,Epic Parenting,669

melkaynun,5,11,1qeg7r,34,During high school I worked at a department store in the mall For a while we had quite a few attempts at people returning things that they hadnt bought We had just went through a change in store policy and our return policy now stated that you could return any item any time You didnt even need a receipt What customers would do is steal things from a different store a few towns over come to our store and try to return them without a receipt since they didnt need them for either cash which we technically could do or a store voucher that they would then go sell to someone else for cheaper than the amount it had on it since they were still making moneyI have two separate instancesThe first instance a lady came in with about TEN different dresses All rang up over  some even hitting  Right off the back I was suspicious that they were stolenI asked her if there was anything wrong with them and she said no that she just didnt like them The problem was that this women was probably a size  She had dresses all different styles ranging from size  all the way up to  Of course she would have known not to buy a size  because that is not even close to her size same goes for the I told her since it was such a big order that I was going to call my manager so that he could look for her receipt in the computer which is something that can be done by the manger but really its just a way to scare them from trying to scam up She then said that it was okay she would be fine if I just gave her a store voucher I said that I  needed a manger to look it up because of its price no matter how she gets the money backAs my manger is walking over she decides that she doesnt want to return them anymore and that shed go home and look for her receipt Unfortunately she left with the dresses but at least she didnt end up with money in her handThe second story is basically the same except the lady said that she was returning some jeans that she bought her young son Again the jeans were ranging from T to a young boys size L These are even close in size they were also Levis one of our more expensive brands my manager had seen her upstairs carrying a plastic bag that was EMPTY and when she came downstairs it was full of jeans She actually got caught by our LP and got in troubleI just dont get it If youre going to try and return something that you didnt like or it didnt fit at least have all the same size or sizes that are similar I get it if you bought a medium and a large and the large was too big so you are returning it but if you are stealing things that obviously dont fit you I Just ugh,If youre going to try and steal at least be cohesive,45

HeloRising,39,46,1qe567,226,At the behest of another redditor a story from my pottery hawking month I didnt really like the job what can I sayA couple of years back I worked at a store that you buy unfired pottery from and you are provided with paint to decorate it We then take the piece in the back fire it in the kiln and give it back a few days laterWe had a customer come in who had far more money than sense She spent almost  on plates and cups that she decorated rather unoriginally herself Whatever Its her dime One week she came back and was so pleased with the plates she wanted to do a cup a very special cup for her morning coffeeThis piece she took some time with and I have to admit it looked pretty good After several hours of fairly painstaking work she gave us her masterpiece Thats when it gotinterestingCustomer Now I understand these take a few daysMe Indeed they do We only fire them when we have a full load for the kiln The back is almost full so Id say swing by tomorrow and we should have it ready in the morningCustomer Oh I was hoping to be here when it was firedMe We usually do that at night The owner comes by and actually turns the kilns on but well load them tonight after closingCustomer Wellcould I come in extra early I really want to be here when my cup gets firedMe Thats not really my call but theres really nothing to see The kilns look like big bricks with some metal bands on them and they just heat upCustomer I remember last time you told me there was a chance the piece would be destroyed in the firing processMe Yes Its rare but it does happen A fault in the bisque unglazed pottery that we cant seeCustomer Alright well Id like to be here when my piece is fired in case something goes wrongMe UhTheres not much you can do if it does Actually theres not anything you can do The inside of the kiln is extremely hot and opening it would most likely beunpleasantCustomer Ohbut I want to be sure my piece is alrightThis goes back and forth for about ten minutes Eventually I agree to call the manager and ask permission to shut her up if for no other reason The managers response verbatim Tell her to stop eating the fucking paint get rid of the lunatic The nice version of that response was not well received so I decided to break down how the kiln worked I didnt want to just scream because of reasons in her face as she was apt to spend large amounts of money there and my boss unhelpful reply aside would have been sore if shed gone away unhappyThe technical response initiated an exchange most parents are familiar with The pieces need a lot of heat to set properly Why Because of the glaze we put on them Why do you use that glaze Eventually we cycle back around to the fact that opening the kiln while it was running would likely kill herShe took that warning with all the dignity and acceptance shed beeno actually she asked why Again I sank into the chair behind the register and in the most defeated tone I could possibly put together I repliedBecausefire Flesh good Fire bad She clearly didnt understand what I was talking about but she did at least see that my patience was running low and she nodded said shed be back in the morning and left ,Because fire,272
IronyJudge,30,24,1qe3i9,85,This is going to be very long Sorry but damn was it an interesting dayI cant really speak for all of retail but theres a very certain way corporate animal based stores work We have very separate realms for animals were taking care of in the store and products we sell Weve got the fixtures and setup for the animals we have in back and then the tanks which we have the animals up for sale in Nowhere in this process is things we have on the floor for sale to customers Separate SKUs separate ordering even separate managers who take care of themIt was a relatively normal Saturday Saturdays are easily our busiest day and were well staffed We had recently brought on three new people who were on the floor mostly in the Ill help you find it capacity All three were working this day and had taken a liking to me since I was roughly their age and in their eyes know what Im talking about Beyond them it was the manager who has a functional but not specialized knowledge of animal care and the cashier who refuses to be anything but a cashierI go on lunch Eat my sandwich Play around on my phone Delightful I go to the coffee shop across the street and talk to the people at the Farmers Market for a while Everything was great No grumpy customers so far during the day No technical glitches All peachyAs Im walking up to punch back in from lunch one of the new girls comes up to me and goes Weve got an issueIm expecting a dead mouse or something which is a very low key affair After I punch in the manager tells me to talk to another one of the new people who saw the events transpire I find her and she wordlessly brings me over to the main desk in the animal part of the store Theres a cart with an opened bag of cat food in it Inside the bag of cat food which had a different food inside it than the bag actually was strangely were two extremely large turtles Somebody had decided the best way to get rid of the turtles was to abandon them in the store without telling anybodyI feel Ive gained a reputation on this page for stories about turtles This reputation has to include the fact that turtles are very cost intensive animals They need massive tanks massive heaters massive filters massive places to sit and bask under their massive basking lamp A pet turtle is not a cheap endeavor and will easily set you back  to  dollars Do not get a pet turtle unless youre into really cool animals you cant snuggle I love feeding the ones we have in the store but beyond that you cant really pet them and play games Keep in mind we cant exactly pull all of the necessary equipment off the shelf We easily possess this equipment but considering Im apparently in charge of this operation Id get my ass reamed for doing so No matter how necessary you cant take  off the shelves then do it twiceTwo full grown turtles sitting in a small bucket situated in a bag of cat food which has been opened and replaced with a different brand of cat food By this point I wasnt even trying to hide the fact Im a foul mouthed cynic With customers perfectly within earshot I was giving my true thoughts on the situation After I was done swearing I sat in the office spinning around in the chair trying to come up with a planWe cant put them in with the turtles we have on the floor because theyre nearly three times the size and come from god knows where with god knows what pathogens We have to set them up independently  Get all of the biggest tanks we have for our overstock animals and repurpose them to house turtles This required taking the largest tanks we had currently in use setting up new smaller tanks for the overstock hamsters hamsters are assholes and are onepertank eating a lot of room and then cleaning out the big tanks to within an inch of their life  Set up these tanks half the size of a real setup for turtles This went by with many problems as one tank full of water  pounds of water per gallon times  gallons wound up on the floor Requiring extensive cleanup to get all the shards of glass off the ground as well as  gallons of water Down one large tank we had to get another one and evict the poor hamster from it  Place turtles in tank This meant we had to get a tank set up for them the best we could We had the lights ready to go in storeuse but had to grab filters off the shelf Taking things off the shelf and putting them to store use is one of the most annoying redtape filled things you can do The MOD at the time had to call up the GM at home to get approval for it It was fun listening to the Yosemite Sam cursing on the other end of the line We got approval for two twenty gallon filters  Have one of the new people sift through the bag and find a third full grown turtle buried in the cat foodWait  Mother FuckerWere out of tanks at this point We cant just take a  item off the shelf to repurpose for store use As much as it pained me to do it I took the two smaller of the turtles and housed them together We then took some of the hideyholes for the guinea pigs and converted them into basking spots inside the tank weighed down by bags of aquarium gravel One of the turtles decided to shred one of the bags and pour gravel all over the place but that is relatively unimportant to the saga Then we encountered the astoundingly foreseeable problem that we didnt have enough outlets in our back room We needed  outlets for this operation and there were  This required me to leave the store drive to the nearest hardware store and purchase a power strip for as cheaply as possible Im still a little afraid that the  power strip I got will at some point burn down the entire strip mall Why we didnt have a power strip available for the task Ive yet to get a good answer onWe finally got the turtles set up in back With  people working on the job it took us  hours when all was said and done Then somebody asked the question on everybodys minds What nowTurtles are the slowest selling animal in the store Theyre not too expensive themselves but the  birds go faster Three full grown turtles each requiring a  setup are absolutely impossible to move no matter how you look at it We called around the specialty stores in the area which all flatly refused to take them most likely for space reasons themselves and I bear no hostility towards them So were left with three very large very resource intensive turtles in our back room which have no hope of going out the doorOne further problem we ran into was the filter cartridges I wound up coming in every other day despite working or not and replacing the carbon in the filters with carbon I extracted from the spare filters for our aquariums and then rinsing out the cartridge itself Id head into the store on the way home from school It was a pretty routine thing for a whileThis went on for a month and a half Meanwhile the MOD the day the turtles came in was also working to get rid of them for the time span This went far up the chain of command to the VP in charge of the  state region After hearing how big our turtles were a commercial breeder  miles away agreed to take them in We didnt care at this point if we got any money out of them We just wanted them gone The three turtles are now living out their days at a nice farm in bayou countryIf you go into a store that sells these turtles theres a small but real chance that they may be descendants of these three,Another Turtle Story,109

flyingcupclub,16,11,1qcs41,33,I worked on this big clothing retail store they have stores all over the world and I recall how obsessed the assistant manager and sales associates were about shoplifting They were always suspicious of customers It was very contradicting their actions they either were brown nosing customers asking if they needed any help etc or they would be watching certain customers very closelySince we did not have security the SAs were in charge of rushing to the door whenever the sensors beeped Even when people just got inside the store if it beeped they would be requested to show their bagsOnce there was a customer wearing one of our tops which was from a recent collection This SA went crazy on the store following the poor woman and announcing on the radio that she stole a top I told her I SAW the woman entering the store wearing that very top yet she kept following herThis same SA would drop all of her go backs on tables when the sensors beeped It was so embarrassing for all the involved  the SA and the customers being harassed by her The other customers just watched amused at her dropping everything on every beepingThey also would sell clothes that were ripped stained with missing buttons or broken zippers during the sale season Actually they would sell clothes like this even when they were full priceI recall a customer calling and complaining that she just noticed when she got home the same day she made the purchase that the top she bought had I hole I no doubt it might be true I have seen so mane garments with small holes that if you dont inspect very well it might pass unnoticeable When I went to ask the assistant mgr if it was ok to let the customer make the exchange she said Oh how convenient Mind you this manager was a complete bitch who would tell you to cater and brown nose the hell out of customers but when was time for the post purchase  a very important step to retain customers shes dismissive and arrogant towards them I also recall many times when the cashiers forgot to take the sensors off the clothes after and then it would beep on the door The customer were forced to go back to the register and have their bags checked and show their receipt so the cashier can make sure that whatever has the sensor on  which was HSHER responsibility to make sure to take off wasnt in fact somehow stolen and thrown in along with the legit purchases I noticed that most customers dont have the guts to actually complain about itThe mentality in this retail store it is that customers are actually trying to deceive and trick them at all times and that you have to always watch them Does anyone have similar experienceAfter this terrible experience with retail along with other issues I would never work in retail againI just want to make clear that retail does have some very difficult customers and that there are some shoplifting happening but I believe he approach by this specific company is plain wrong,Clothing store obsessed with shoplifting Does it happen where you work too,44

MysticSpiral,78,68,1qchcl,311,Excuse any typos Im on my phoneAs Ive stated before I work in a fairly well known and popular womens clothing storeSurprisingly I actually DO love my job and one of the reasons I do is because I get to help women feel pretty and put a smile on their faces This can take work As women we each have our hang ups big arms big calves a belly roll a chunky butt etc I get a chance to show women how to dress to flatter themselves and show them that no matter what we are each beautiful in our own ways I actually take that really seriouslyI grew up with eating disorders and low self esteem due to being chubby I starved myself and made myself throw up more than I like to admit to I also survived an incredibly emotionally and a couple time physically abusive relationship To make a long story short my appearance was something that he got on me a lot about Ive finally come to love myself my body and who I am  Flaws and allBut I actually lost my cool on a customer once Back before I was promoted and transferred to a new store my primary job was selling I have the gift of gab if you will and I can sell anything to anybody So I was left to my own devices with customers quite often Enter Skinny and her mom Skinny needs shorts but as a woman over forty she wants boyfriend shorts think Bermuda shorts We have a few in that style soi pick her out some colors and tops and accessories because yeah Im a salesperson Heres where the trouble starts Skinny went up a size She was a size  and is now a size  Remember she is over forty She looks great and is not unattractive I assure her that she is not fat that lots of women would kill to be that size and her mom jumps in on the positive bandwagon as wellSkinnny keeps complaining Of course I wonder if she may have an eating disorder I do my best to comfort and assure her I style her put together outfits and compliment her Not just to sell either I genuinely want people to have the confidence that I worked so hard for It doesnt work All skinny sees is that  instead of a She says she is too fat about once a minute Now I start to get annoyed Ladies and gentleman I am not a small girl Im attractive proportionate and dress well but Im NOT tiny So on my  trip with her to the sales floor to puck out more shorts she starts complaining again She calls herself fat and how she cant believe she put on so much weightI lost my cool I looked Skinny dead in the eye and said If you think a size ZERO is fat then what must I look like to you at a size sixteenShe went very quiet You are gorgeous and you look great do you want some shorts or notShe didnt speak much the rest of the time but she bought the shorts and more and she stopped complaining about being fat I was probably too harsh I felt bad that I lost my cool but in the end I think she may have realized that her complaining about being fat to someone who IS in the overweight spectrum was Not in good tasteEdit please dont take this and turn it into a skinny v fat debate in the comments That is not at all what this is about I firmly believe that there is something beautiful about each person and that you can be beautiful at any size      If you carry yourself with confidence and self respect nothing can stop you and no one can bring you down ,If a Size Zero is Fat  ,379
HaveHadIt,10,9,1qc6tq,15,Followup to my post from the other dayI got a call back from RGIS for an interview On the other hand I have a bit of an in with a local security guard company which would involve apparently lots of watching TV and being left alone to do school work while occasionally waving cars into an apartment complex Not sure of the pay on RGIS but the security would apparently be  a week Its close to home and I could probably get a recommendation from a former employee And the idea of working but having a lot of free time is appealing But I cant shake the idea that its still customer service but of a different kind Thoughts EDIT Well that settles it Im not even going to go for the RGIS interview Sucks because I just updated my resume and I thought maybe I did a good job if they were willing to give me a shot Oh well I was leaning for the security thing anyway ,RGIS Inventory guy or security work,24

WhenDucksAttack,39,69,1qbcko,309,Nearly  years ago I was working for a very large electronics chain the place where you could get everything from transistors to computers to radios for your shack  It was right around the holiday season and a man came in with his four or five year old son to look at a computerI walked up and started to chat with him about it and it becomes clear that hes seriously interested  Remember  years ago computers werent the everyday thing they are now this would be quite the sale and yet another feather in my cap at this store as computer sales were few and far betweenAfter evaluating the customer I drop into Car Guy Description  and start to explain that the processor in the computer is like the engine and RAM is the cars transmission and so on  The guy is diggin it hes getting what Im saying and hes becoming more and more interested  Then his son starts saying Dad  Dad  Dad  Hey Dad  Bored obviously and wanting attention  Dad quickly shushes the son and turns back to me  We start talking software and monitors and the kid starts up again  Dad shushes him once again and asks me a question about the computer  I start to answer Well the hard drive is where the computer stores informaAIIIIGHHHH and I fell overThe son correctly deducing that Im to blame for his dad not being attentive to him had hauled off and punched me in the side of my knee  The knee that had been damaged playing football and that I needed to wear a brace on for anything more athletic than climbing stairs  Of course the knee collapsed like a house of cards bouncing my head off the display unit for the computer in the process and sending me sprawling into a stack of RC cars  I tried to get to my feet only to discover that I couldnt put any weight on my leg and that I had blood streaming down my faceDad stood there shocked berated the kid for a second or two then dragged him out of the store  he never apologized and he never came back  Turns out he bought the computer from another one of our stores  I learned to keep an eye on kids from then on  I wound up being given a choice I could either have surgery to fix my knee or spend six months using braces wraps and a cane at all times  I went the braceswrapscane route and now I need surgery anyway  THANKS kid,When Children Attack,378

ToniCipriani,24,18,1qao2b,68,Any fellow cashiers know what I mean Sometimes after you finish ringing up a transaction for a customer and then they either fiddle around with their bags or stare at the receipt right at the register without saying anything or even acknowledging you any further It doesnt even bother me at all it just feels super awkward because I never know what to say to them I cant really call another customer forward because I dont want to seem rude and rush them or if they are the only customer in my line I dont want to just walk away in case they want to ask for something else Which alot of people tend to ask for lottery tickets after they purchase beer or wine at the store i work Lotto is sold on a different register than regular salesUsually I just turn around and try to act like im organizing the cigarettes on the shelf behind me lol Anyone else know what I mean though I work in a small liquorcorner store and for a small business we build up a decent sized line fairly quickly and often times out of nowhere ,That awkward moment after you finish a transaction but the customer takes a long time leaving,86
llamas,2,20,1qanq6,75,I havent worked in retail in two years but I keep seeing my former coworker on campus and I need to tell someone about my short simple and satisfying actionsWe worked in a clothing department of a failing retail chain she was a cashier and I kept everything stocked and neat She was also a giant annoying bitch We were allowed to stash stuff at the check out area to purchase on our breaks or days off You were allowed to keep stuff there for  hours then it had to go back This area also contained items that were returned or some how migrated to the front Since there was nothing I could really do for her attitude every time she gathered items to buy on her next shift I would return them to the floor when she left pretending I didnt see the note she left on them with her name In reality the note really helped me make sure I was only doing this to her stuff,So maybe I was a little passive aggressive towards my coworker,95

jre,11,12,1qa554,31,Ive worked for a smiley retailer for a while now at two very different locations The first was in a rural small town where we were the only game in town the second is in a larger city in a middlelower middle class area Since moving to the city Ive noticed a shoplifting trend that baffles me every time I run across it I work in our shoe department and a several times a month I will find a pair of shoes without shoelaces Apparently our shoplifters have decided that rather than spend  on a pair of shoelaces they are better off stealing them In addition to not wanting to pay for their laces they have also decided that rather than simply pocketing the conveniently pocket sized packages of shoelaces usually located within ft of where they are they would rather take the time to unlace the shoes and then leave them on the shelf laceless Now Im not saying that Im ok with people stealing from us And this is nowhere near the worst instance of shoplifting or even the most common kind I see I would rather deal with  pairs of laceless shoes to  pair of nasty smelly old shoes put into a box as our new shoes walk out the front door I just dont understand the reasoning behind this theft For one and probably the one that a customer would care least about were losing more money through this rather than taking a hit on a  pack of laces we have to take it on a   even  pair of shoes Second it takes so much more time and effort to unlace the shoes than it would take to just steal the lacesWhen I worked in the small town I dont remember once finding a pair of shoes that had the laces stolen Plenty of empty shoelace packages but never shoes  What the hell is going on And why the goddamn shoelaces,Shoelaces,43

FredFltStn,224,331,1q9jql,735,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  Most of my employees are teenagers and have real jobs during the rest of the year just like me Even so they jump at the chance to work for me since I pay better feed them give them free fireworks and always try to make my store funLast th of July I had a couple of new guys helping out during setup One of the news guys dropped a beam while setting up some rack shelving and it almost hit his foot He turned to one of the teenagers Colby and joked that he would need workers compColby has worked for me for several years now Without looking up or stopping his work Colby perfectly explained our workers comp policy just as it had been explained to him years beforeCraig doesnt have workers comp If you get seriously hurt we have to kill you and hide the bodyThis location has gone  DAYS since our last accidentTLDR  Workers compensation is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employees right to sue his or her employer for the tort of negligence The tradeoff between assured limited coverage and lack of recourse outside the worker compensation system is known as the compensation bargainWhile plans differ among jurisdictions provision can be made for weekly payments in place of wages functioning in this case as a form of disability insurance compensation for economic loss past and future reimbursement or payment of medical and like expenses functioning in this case as a form of health insurance and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment functioning in this case as a form of life insuranceGeneral damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages for employer negligence are generally not available in workers compensation plans and negligence is generally not an issue in the case These laws were first enacted in Europe and Oceania with the United States following shortly thereafterStatutory compensation law provides advantages to employees and employers A schedule is drawn out to state the amount and forms of compensation to which an employee is entitled if heshe has sustained the stipulated kinds of injuries Employers can buy insurance against such occurrences However the specific form of the statutory compensation scheme may provide detriments Statutes often award a set amount based on the types of injury These payments are based on the ability of the worker to find employment in a partial capacity a worker who has lost an arm can still find work as a proportion of a fully able person This does not account for the difficulty in finding work suiting disability When employers are required to put injured staff on lightduties the employer may simply state that no light duty work exists and sack the worker as unable to fulfill specified duties When new forms of workplace injury are discovered for instance stress repetitive strain injury silicosis the law often lags behind actual injury and offers no suitable compensation forcing the employer and employee back to the courts although in commonlaw jurisdictions these are usually oneoff instances Finally caps on the value of disabilities may not reflect the total cost of providing for a disabled worker The government may legislate the value of total spinal incapacity at far below the amount required to keep a worker in reasonable living conditions for the remainder of his lifeA related issue is that the same physical loss can have a markedly different impact on the earning capacity of individuals in different professions For instance the loss of a finger could modestly reduce a bankers professional facilities but ruin a pianistIn  Georgia and Alabama passed Employer Liability Acts  other states passed similar acts between  and  These acts simply permitted injured employees to sue the employer and then prove a negligent act or omission A similar scheme was set forth in Britains  ActAfter Germanys  Act workers compensation laws began to be reformed to reduce the need for litigation and to mitigate the requirement that injured workers prove their injuries were their employers fault For example The  British Act replaced the  ActIn the United States the first statewide workers compensation law was passed in Maryland in  and the first law covering federal employees was passed in  By  all states had enacted some kind of workers compensation regime Such schemes were originally known as workmans compensation but today most jurisdictions have adopted the term workers compensation as a genderneutral alternativeAt the turn of the th century workers compensation laws were voluntary for a couple of reasons Specifically an elective law made passage easier and many felt that compulsory workers compensation laws would violate the th amendment due process clause of the US Constitution Since workers compensation mandated benefits without regard to fault or negligence many felt that compulsory participation would deprive the employer of property without due process The issue of due process was resolved by the United States Supreme Court in  when in New York Central Railway Co v White it was held that an employers constitutional rights werent affected After the ruling most states enacted new compulsory workers compensation lawsIn the United States most employees who are injured on the job have an absolute right to medical care for any injury and in many cases monetary payments to compensate for resulting temporary or permanent disabilities Most employers are required to subscribe to insurance for workers compensation and an employer who does not may have financial penalties imposed If youve actually been crazy enough to read through all of this text you should seriously consider seeking some type of professional help The entire TLDR was meant as a joke and the short story was actually above the TLDR I do appreciate your persistance and to show it please allow me to bestow gold on the first  of you that obviously have nothing better to do than surf reddit and can follow my instructions Please add a comment to this story that starts with Candygram for Mongo Feel free to say whatever else youd like in the comment since you seen to have some free time Of course the first five have long come and gone if youre reading this now but what the hellTexas employers have the unique ability to opt out of a the Workers Compensation system under the original state law written in  However those employers known as nonsubscribers are exposed to potential liability in the event of an employee injury Though the employee must prove that the employer was negligent in causing his or her injuries the employer loses its common law defenses of contributory negligence assumption of the risk and the fellow employee doctrine If successful the employee can recover his or her full common law damages which are far more generous than workers compensation benefits Yeah this story is about that Thanks WikipediaIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories

CurvedStraightLine,20,30,1q9aex,99,This story isnt about a BAD customer just a strange oneIve mentioned before that during my career working womens clothing years ago wed do personal shopping and do things like serve snacks in the fitting suite  One day I get a call from a woman who wanted to arrange an appointment for thisShe was perfectly pleasant and as Im taking down her information shes telling me that she hasnt been shopping for a while but most of her clothes dont fit anymore  It seems she got sick and it caused fluctuations in her weightBut worst was that she couldnt walk properly anymore  She dropped her voice and said that I wouldnt believe what had happened to her  While she was in the hospital sick they accidentally did surgery on her leg meant for someone else and now she couldnt walkI of course reacted in horror  Thats a worst case situation for anyoneJump forward to the day of the appointment and I assign an associate to her and fill her in a bit on what she told me  The associate was a really sweet woman who had great rapport with customers so I trusted herThe taxi gets there and the woman gets out in a wheelchair  She had crutches and could pull herself up but mostly stayed in the chairI was honestly curious read nosey about the surgery so I popped by a few times to see how she was doing maybe to hear more of the story  And boy was she forthcomingThe first strange thing was that she was upset her kids werent letting her persue a lawsuit  Which accidental surgery sounds like a sound reason for a lawsuit so I was confusedNow she was a totally pleasant customer to work with really a dream customer but every time these little details about her leg would sneak through  She couldnt wear pants because of her leg and she needed skirts that would be ankle length to cover up the horror that was her legThen she tells the whole story  She was sick she went to the hospital and she woke up in a nursing home to find that she had been grafted with someone elses leg  Furthermore she knew they had her leg but they WOULDNT GIVE IT BACKThis is a well spoken polite woman so the crazy just came out of nowhere  I was glad I had a good associate assigned to her and we just all sort of rolled with the punchesWe get her to start trying on her clothes and she comes out of the fitting room on her crutches  She eyes up her associate and I and asks do you want to see it and like a magician pulling a curtain back she pulls her skirt up to her kneesIt was obvious she wasnt bearing weight on one leg but otherwise there was no issue  I mean to say her leg looked perfectly fine and just like the other one  But she is looking at it in the mirror commenting about how horrible this strange leg is and how she cant believe they gave her this legWe just sort of changed the subject back to the clothes and she left seeming really happyI did some research that apparently this is something that can happen as a result of a strokeyou just dont recognize a part of your body as your own and people come up with fantastic stories to justify why it isnt theirs  This is actually how I started reading Oliver Sacks booksThe problem is later on this customer came in during off hours and went back to the fitting room with a random associate who wasnt warned about any of this and wasnt quite as good with people  Next thing you know shes running back into the breakroom in a fit that apparently a customer had a corpses leg and WHAT SHOULD SHE DOMeaning one of my stranger manager training times was to convince someone not to freak out that it was a normal leg and that we have to cater a bit to eccentricities  ,Not My Leg,129

TimesNewEnglish,50,44,1q8hwg,212,Long time lurker first time poster bear with me on this wall of textBackground I work at the service deskmoney wiring transfer of a big box retail store where customers Save Money and Live Better My job includes cashing paychecks transferring money around the world processing returns and making sure cashiers are in their proper places In terms of scheduling for breakslunches not hazingEvery Friday all of the pipeliners and construction workers come into the store in order to cash their rather large paychecks Anywhere from  because we charge a flat rate to cash checks as opposed to several other places that charge based on percent A lot of these workers become regulars in the store and are often on a first name basis with myself and the other co workers This story involves one of these regularsStory On a brisk October evening a few weeks ago we were dealing with a huge rush of workers due to the fact that the main worksites were all on our side of town as opposed to the other store about ten miles away This changes from week to week as jobs get completed and other jobs open up Anyway insert Redneck Douchebag Deluxe RDD from here on out Imagine Bret Michaels sans bandana and an even larger beer belly He casually walks up to the desk and hands me his check and his drivers licenseThe reason for the quotes is because I could barely recognize the plastic blob he had just handed me as an ID The card had literally been BURNED to the point that the only visible parts of the ID were the picture and the name of our great state where the winds come sweeping down the plain Now normally I would never take this as a valid form of ID but I recognized RDD as a regular and decided to cut him some slack The following conversation ensuedMe Alright sir I recognize you as a regular so I am going to give you a pass this week and go ahead and accept this but if you want to come here again next week to cash your check I will need you to bring an ID that is not damaged to validate your signatureRDD Well whats wrong with this IDMe Sir the ID is almost completely singed to the point that I cannot make out the information that I need to verify your identity You can get a replacement liceRDD What crap school did you learn THAT fromMe The name redacted policy handbook sirRDD I CASH  JACKPOTS AT THE CASINO WITH THIS IDMe Congratulations sir but this is not the casino and I need to be able to verify your identity to cash your check Ive already said that Ill do it this one time because youre a regular but after this you will need a new form of identification to cash your check hereNote This entire time I have been processing the transaction and was waiting to hand him his money which was already countedRDD Well I think youve got too much schoolin boy You need to get outside moreAs I handed his money to him and began processing the next customer a coworker of RDD RDD whispers to the customer that he should watch out for Harry Potter he wont take your ID I shrugged it off and continued workingFast forward six days to the following Thursday RDD and his friend from earlier make a return trip to my desk with check and brand new drivers license in handNow when I cash a check there are several things I need to verify before I can continue the transaction The issue with the check that RDD had given me this week was that the check was not dated until Friday which was not until tomorrow This means that I could not cash his check without getting fired And so it begins againMe Im sorry sir but this check is dated for tomorrow and we cannot cash it until  AM when we open tomorrowRDD THIS IS BULLSHIT THIS IS TWO TIMES YOUVE TRIED TO SCAM ME OUT OF MY MONEY WHERE IS YOUR MANAGERNow could I have just said that I would go get one and have been done with it YesBut that wouldnt be very fun at all now would itMe Alright sir let me just open up the Chamber of Secrets and try to find you a managerBy this point he was fuming to the point that I thought he was literally using all  of his brain cells to come up with a response but he just stood there getting more and more angry with himself I walked into my managers office explained the situation and when she came out with me he was already gone As of today he apparently has never come back to cash his checks here Cant say I miss him muchTLDR Florida man tries to pay his water bill with cocaineEDIT How do I wordsEDIT Thank you guys for the support on my first post I have plenty more stories from my little slice of hell Ill make sure to post one when I get off of my shift tonight,Youve Got Too Much Schoolin Tales from the Service Desk,256

agusto,9,13,1q817k,25,Ive wanted to post to this sub for a while now and Ive been thinking about all the terrible customers Ive had in the last few years There were bitchy ones drunk ones messy ones and yes of course there were entitled ones But with how many there already are on this sub who wants to hear another depressing story about a shitty customer Instead I thought I would share a story about sweet sweet petty justice  Alright so about  months ago I was working at the ice cream shop that advertises with commercials featuring those god awful giant red lips you may recognize them It was me and my sister on for an evening shift during which I had the displeasure of encountering a rather whale like woman with a bad attitude and a voracious appetite for tartar sauce well call her Tartar Whale TW for shortSo TW walks waddles into the store and asks for an empty bucket of strawberry sauce After checking the back of the store we politely tell her that we dont have any to spare Tartar whale is displeased with this but still decides to order a fish sandwich meal We fill her order within a few minutes as it was very slow and bid her good day As she opens the togo box TWs eyes bulged out of her head in disgust and diabetic rage as she snarled that she did not in fact order a fish sandwich but asked for a shrimp basket We apologized and began to cook the shrimp we live a thousand miles away from the ocean in the deep fryer As we do TW requests  additional cups of tartar sauce Now the cups are about  ounces each so thats roughly  ounces of tartar sauce she planned on clogging her arteries with As we go into the kitchen my sister says something along the lines of well shit were out or tartar sauce we had very little left not nearly enough for  cups what are we going to do now I dont want to get bitched at again I thought about it for a few seconds and my mind hatched a petty childishly evil plan to get back at TW We lace it I say we can mix a little tartar sauce with mostly mayonnaise So we threw together our Trojan tartar sauce and offered it to TW thanking god she asked for it togo As TW speedwaddled out of the store and into her car we made bets over whether or not she would come back to bitch but she never returned and we had a good laughSo I suppose the moral of the story is if you have to be polite to people you cant stand every day you can at least take joy in small petty jabs when you can get them,Tale of the Tartar Whale,38

NotableNobody,70,53,1q6n77,280,I worked for two years at a chain videorental and entertainment store It was my first real retail job and offered a lot of customer service experience that I was lacking For the first year or so my manager was a fun loud woman named Rose While she was unpopular with some customers for her unapologetic forward nature in dealing with service issues she remains one of my favorite bosses to this very dayOn this day I witnessed a play in three parts Here is the story of the Job ApplicantIn our relatively small city our store was very attractive to highschool kids looking for a job Every day Rose received between five and twenty phone calls from students checking up on job applications or asking to see if we were hiring It was kind of annoying but usually wed just tell them theyd get a call back if we wanted an interview These were often kids whod been drilled by their parents to call over and over again to show incentive speak to the manager etc and they were very persistentOne morning coming in to work I stopped by the coffee shop to grab a little pickmeup As the barista was making my coffee the phone rang and she answered That early in the morning we were instructed by Rose to give applicant calls the usual spiel rather than forward the phone call to her The barista is right in the middle of saying Rose will give you a call back if we accept your application in the meantime it is active within our system for the next  days and when suddenly the other line erupts with screaming The girl on the other end actually shrieked so loud that for a moment I thought one of the espresso machines had broken  the line cut out and then picked up again on the caller demanding to be forwarded to the manager The barista made a face held the phone a foot away from her ear and said I WILL FORWARD YOU TO ROSE PLEASE HOLD before holding the call and dropping the receiverOh my god she muttered What a crazy asshole She finished making my coffee before paging the office As I left I heard her say Hey Rose The caller on line one is asking for you About a job Yeah yeah I know just wait Youre in for a treatI made my way back to the employee room to change When I got in to the office to check my schedule I caught the very end of Rosie slamming the phone back onto the hook She was wildeyed when she looked back at me and said Who the FUCK did she think she wasWhat she told me Ill relay here After the barista told her how shed been threatened and screamed at by the girl on the other end of the phone Rose took the call When she began talking to her the girl was very sweetI just wanted you to know I love your store and it would be an honor to be a part of your team she oozed Rose asked what her name was and offered to review her application right away The girl offered her name and sounded excitedOkay said Rose I just deleted your application To the sound of sputtering festering rage she scolded You do not get to treat my employees the way you just did and expect special treatment from me Were a team here and you just demonstrated to me that youre incapable of treating another human being with respect Im marking your application and blacklisting your name and as long as Im manager here you will never be employed with meThe girl screamed Wordlessly Rose told me that the line cut out again and when I walked in she hung up without another wordI took my till out to the register and as I prepared for another busy day of cashiering the phone rang Without even thinking about what had just happened I answered with the customary company greeting A girl with a sulky voice respondedHello Uh Id like to speak to your managerNow realized who I was probably speaking to Okay I said Ill forward you to Rose right away I waited a beat and sure enough she saidUh No Id like to speak to Roses managerRose is the store manager I told her There is no person currently present with more power in the company If you have a customer service issue we have two counter managers present todayNo uh Look how about you just send my call to your corporate managerI almost laughed out loud Our CEO is down in Texas and more often than not hes traveling abroad fishing The District Manager while more accessible isnt just a phonetransfer away I had no idea if he was even working that day I explained this to the girl I also at this point had absolutely no incentive to provide her with that information  shed harassed two employees within the store within five minutes of our openingYeah except see I just had a Uh A really emotional experience with Rose And Id rather not talk to her So you should probably just send me to your corporate managerI just told you thats physically impossible I said The highestup person I can send you to is Rose herselfI think youre lying said the girl In fact Im pretty sure you are So uh whats your name Because Im going to get you fired tooBrilliant My names Kendra SPOILERS My name isnt KendraWell Kendra when I get a hold of your managerWhich one I said This was too good an opportunity to pass up Your CORPORATE managerOh well good luck with that I saidHey the girl yelled I DONT HAVE TO PUT UP WI hung up We never heard back from her or any evidence that she ever called our headquarters More likely than not if she ever did someone with a lot more power and gumption than I had made a few more minutes of fun out of hertldr Dont scream at the people you want to hire you It probably wont pan out in your favor and youll probably wind up a story on Reddit,Scream Louder Get Job,333

ravencrowe,32,28,1q6f44,66,Back in high school I worked in a popular Game Store I was lucky to work in the smallest and therefore most relaxed store in the district and based on my experience with transferring in the entire northeast My boss was lenient on the dress code and as such I was allowed to keep my blue hair and wear whatever jewelry I wanted The funny thing is most retail places are strict about facial piercings so you would have thought my nose ring would be the issue yet the only thing that caused me trouble was my necklaceSo one day Im working behind the counter with my boss its just the two of us working the store and were both on registers I was dressed even more casually than usual that day I came in wearing a tshirt My boss said Youre supposed to be wearing a collared shirt to which I tugged on the neck and said This is a collar and I was wearing the pentagram necklace that I wore every day For anyone who doesnt know pentagrams are a symbol of Wicca which is about nature spirits and not devil worship Near the end of our shift a middleage white suburban mom came in She grabbed an Xbox controller and approached the register My boss was busy doing inventory at the moment so I smiled and said Can I help you She looked at my boss then back at me and said Ill wait My boss looked up from the work he was doing and said Im actually busy right now Is there a reason she cant help youTo which the lady looks at me reproachfully and saysI dont like her necklace Its satanic I was so surprised that I couldnt think of anything to say so I just turned around sat on the floor behind the counter and went back to putting away tradeins My boss stopped doing inventory so he could help her As soon as she left he turned to me and said What the fuck What a fucking bitchI thought the whole thing was hilarious but my boss was legitimately mad at her not at me He went on a tirade for the rest of the night about how stupid people are I mean seriously does she think shes going to get struck by lightning for passing money with a devil worshipper Or maybe she thought that her controller would be cursed if I touched it If only I had the power to do that,Im not going to curse your controller I promise,94

slandeh,21,29,1q5w5v,122,As stated before Ive done a lot of returns and had a lot of arguments with customers and some still take the cake as the dumbest things Ive had to do in my career Ive become seasoned enough to enjoy arguing with customers I had a particularly upset guy try to tell me point blank he didnt care how much fraud he could be committing he just wanted cash for his purchaseA man comes in with a tool kit well call him Tool he purchased from us the name brand is store specific so its not possible to buy from somewhere else and tells me that it didnt work for the job he was trying to accomplish So I ask for a receipt to begin with policy is first that a receipt must be available or can be looked up in order to issue a proper refund if no receipt is available a manager can approve of a return but it would be issued on gift card and only for lowest amount the item sold for within the last  days of purchase depending on item The man states he mustve thrown it away and didnt have it No problem we start to look it up int he systemI first ask him for his phone number since its the easiest to look up type it in and look for the item not found No problem lets try another phone number still no luck Im starting to believe he may have bought it long after the return policy but ask how he paid for it He says by cash which eliminates being able to look it up by his credit card I tell the guy that because I cant find his receipt I cant issue a refund He complains that he knows he bought it from here since the brand isnt anywhere else I explain that its not necessarily where he bought it but when he bought it The return period is pretty specific He wants to talk to someone else so I get him my ASMMy ASM is a little too busy to come deal with a return and agrees to just do the refund without a receipt Alright fair enough I turn to the guy after hanging up with my ASM and tell him that my manager approved for me to go ahead and do a return without receipt As I start processing it I inform him that per policy I can do it but I would have to issue him a gift card and it would be at the lowest selling point the item has been at since within the return period This is the breaking point for ToolTool Are you fucking stupid I said I wanted my cash back for that item I wont take a gift card You know why Because I cant use the gift card anywhere else and I have to go somewhere else to get the fucking set I need to do my job I wont take a gift cardMe Well I cant override the system since we are already doing an override and giving you a return without a receipt anyway At least I can give you  back for the itemTool Youre joking me right I paid  for that and I want  back and in cash I want to talk to someone elseSo I pick up the phone and call back my ASM who says hell be right down When ASM shows up I begin helping a different customer but overhear the whole conversation which started with my ASM going through the same routine I just finished looking up the receipt While he is going through that I notice that Tool is trying to pretend like I didnt look up his wifes number which I did and while he is explaining that I must be stupid for not asking it I interrupt and point out that I looked up two numbers which neither were explained who they belonged to so I had no idea I was looking up his wifes number Tool gives me a dirty look and tries to explain that I wasnt saying what I was doing during the whole transaction so how was he supposed to know what I was getting phone numbers for even though I ASKED for them and stated I needed them to find the receiptAfter my ASM finally clarifies that Ive already attempted to look up the item he tells the guy that he cant do anything more than return the item for a gift card at the value Ive already given him So Tool asks if he can show my ASM something and walks him down the aisle where the item is located I assumed it was because he didnt want me interjecting more comments to make him look bad When he comes back it seems my ASM has convinced him to somehow accept the gift card So he runs the transaction and finally gets his gift card On his way out Tool crumples the receipt and throws it on the floor All my manager had to say was Thats how he lost his first receipt for me to be unable to move for a whole two minutes because I was laughing so hardOnce I got over myself I finished the transaction with my next customer and they told me I cant believe how much of a jackass that guy is Im sorry you had to deal with that,The Return Policy is pretty clear,151

Kellynn,12,11,1q5igw,74,I worked in your friendly neighborhood fabric and crafts store and gave my notice last week Last night I was working my second overnight in a row The first was supposed to be  PM   AM and then my manager proceeded to keep us until  and try and keep us later because guys theres still stuff to do come onnnnn as she disappeared the entire night and left us to do all the work Last night was my second overnight We asked to leave at one which resulted in my manager pouting death glaring us down and refusing to speak to us the rest of the night But that is not the purpose of this storyFuck overstock Fuck it so hard My best friend and I both worked at the store and both planned to leave After last night we both decided it was our last shift there no exceptions Imagine this Somewhat medium sized store but its very crowded Lots of narrow aisles overstock is on top of the shelves as well as on special shelves along the walls But these shelves are all very shallow so theres a questionable amount of room Sounds crowded already right Now fill the aisles with boxes stacked as tall as you physically can Welcome to my hellSo the first night we were stocking seasonal Glitter everywhere I took my shirt off when I got home and an honest to god cloud of glitter exploded out There are stacks of huge boxes for all the overstock and we add to these as we stock and find that things dont fit There are probably five hundred overstocked candles giant boxes on both sides of the aisles filled with crafts boxes and cards and gifts Every aisle has maybe a third of it available to travel through if that When we left at  AM my manager whined that shed get someone else to help her move the overstock When my best friend and I came in at  PM the next night none of the overstock had been movedStep one Clear enough of the stock room to actually be able to move in the overstock because our stock room is shockingly also piled up to the ceiling with no room to move My manager explains what we hah I mean you two will be doing We load a flatbed of foam and fiber take it from the stock roomand we cant get the cart down the aisles We literally cannot move it more than a foot from the stock room because the overstock boxes are filling the aisles It takes us nearly fifteen minutes to get from one end of the store to the other because were shoving giant boxes out of the way as we goFinally get to the foam which has two rooms of overstock of its own We stock the three or four things we actually can then have probably four huge boxes of overstock that needs to go in the foam overstock We throw open the first doorFloor to ceiling full of overstockOpen the second door Take a guess what that one looked likeMy blood pressure is quickly rising By the end of the night of desperately trying to get through shelves while being berated by my manager about how were not doing enough despite the fact that shes been sitting on her ass the entire night while were working like crazy we were both out of patience I started just shoving overstock out of the way with as much force as I could to avoid screaming in frustration Everything I try and stock is overstock There is no room for the overstock My life has become an overstock nightmare The funny part My manager continues to yell about how we need to have clearance down every single aisle because WHAT IF A CUSTOMER WITH A WHEELCHAIR COMES THROUGH My best friend responds by stopping down an aisle that you have to literally turn sideways to get down to get past the boxes stops looks at my manager and just gestures to the lack of space before walking off We had no words for the stupid anymore,There is a special place in hell for overstocked overstock,85
thompsontoonsart,19,11,1q5ao4,70,I work in a bedding outlet store that sells mainly discontinued merchandise from our catalog company Our stock is rarely complete to make full sets because we receive whats left over from our catalogs sales If something sells out in the catalog we never see it We also have very limited overstock space so we try to squeeze everything we can out onto our selling floor My coworker shared with me an interaction she had with a customer yesterday This woman saw a particular penguin printed flannel duvet cover in our clearance section She asks my coworker Do you have any other sizes available I only see king size hereMy coworker responds No Im sorry We only have that duvet cover in king size Weve sold out of the other sizesDo you have any other sizes in your stock roomNo thats a discontinued style We only have king size leftThe woman becomes short Well could you look out back anyway Sure My coworker walks to our stock room and just waits there for a few minutes before going back out to inform the customer that we indeed only had that duvet cover in king sizeIts like people think our stock room is some magical portal from which we can just pull whatever they want What part of that item is sold out do people not understand ,Is everything that you have outDo you have more stock out back,81
IronyJudge,61,133,1q54dq,560,Back before I was the stores knowitall guy I was a lowly cashier I took pretty quickly to dealing with our archaic system and found out many of the systems rather unfortunate quirks The system will block you out if youre at a certain screen If you hit the wrong button at a particular time itll discard data and make angry noises One of the more unfortunate problems is how there is a screen of no return Once you reach it it is impossible to go back no matter how much you tryI was still pretty new so I was in the panicked Theyre going to fire me for doing something wrong state Any time a customer made a complaint Id shit myself in fear until one fateful night Ive previously stated my store occasionally serves people who inhabit the most notorious snob suburb in the metro areaOne rather nice old lady comes up with a few cans of one particular brand of dog food I start scanning the cans then the customer behind her in line starts screamingPR Lady decision for the initials to be revealed later THOSE ARE MINE  Me Sorry they were the same brand as hers I then remove the two cans I scanned from the first customers bill then close out the transaction She pleasantly thanked me and went on her merry way PR Lady was now at bat and she plopped a bag of dog food face down UPC up on the counter I scan her  cans of dog food then the bag of food ask her for her rewards card information announce the price total She swipes her credit card willingly then I hit the button that brings you to the screen of no return Its the screen to sign for the purchasePRL Did it give me my dollar off  Me Im not entirely sure but were past the point of no return Once you sign and the receipt prints out Ill see and if it didnt Id gladly fix it if it didnt  PRL Im not signing for it  Me The transaction can easily be fixed If you sign and there is a problem well simply cancel it out and do it again  PRL Just go back and tell me if the dollar came off  Me I cant do that You cant go back from this screen  PRL YES YOU CAN GO BACK AND TELL ME IF MY DOLLAR CAME OFF  Id been working there for a few months by that point mostly on register and she knew the system better than me apparentlyMe Once the receipt prints out Ill be able to tell you If you could just sign really quick and if its wrong well be able to fix it  PRL NO  Heres where I make the fatal mistake I reach over to the credit pad and hit the cancel button This has the effect of immediately timeouting the machine and popping out both the receipt and a little paper slip for the customer to signPRL YOU JUST SIGNED FOR ME WHAT THE HELL YOU LITTLE BRAT THIS IS FRAUD  Me  manager to register one Backup cashier  PRL I WILL HAVE YOUR HEAD FOR THIS YOU ARE GETTING FIRED TONIGHT YOU PUNK Manager then arrives In the few months Id worked shes proven herself to be among the most levelheaded in the store She also has the poker face of a championAGM What seems to be the problem  Me She was unsure if the sale price ran  PRL There was a coupon on the front of the bag he didnt ring it up I refused to sign for the purchase then he signed my name This is fraud This is legally fraudI had no knowledge of this coupon She put the bag face down on the register There was no way I could have seen itMe I hit the cancel button to make the mach  PRL YOU SIGNED FOR MEAGM Im sorry about that I will cancel out the transaction and I will personally ring it up and make sure the coupon gets inThe customer behind PRL pipes up and says to me You did nothing wrong This lady is just crazy That made me happy and PRL just kept on with any possible insult towards me she could AGM finally finishes the transaction with the coupon applied PRL signs then walks out the doorI go back to ringing the nice lady who called PRL crazy The customer behind her also gave words of consolation The other cashier now a manager told me that was one of the worst shes seenThen AGM comes up behind me gets on the PA and calls another cashier upAGM She wants you to apologizeI turn around and PRL is standing at the front of the store still fuming The other cashier gets there and I walk over to issue my formal apology PRL You high school punk I want you to apologize for committing fraudI will admit I look about  years younger than I am Its reasonable for her to think Im in high school by appearances but at that time I was cracking open LSAT study books I also decided to whip out my bigboy vocabularyMe I do most solemnly apologize for any transgressions If you could kindly enumerate every one of them so I may appropriately respond to my failureshttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvmmIyrloampnoredirect  PRL rants on for two minutes without realizing just how much my apology was dripping with sarcasm I tune her out I dont care Im going to let her yell and when she stops yelling for a few seconds Ill give her a canned responsePRL stops yelling  Me I understand your concerns My intent was not to defraud you but to make the machine print out a receipt to see if your dollar had been properly removed I fully apologize for the misunderstanding and wish to assure you it was in good faith  PRL YOU BETTER APOLOGIZE THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER HAD ANYWHERE IVE GONE IM THE HEAD OF PUBLIC RELATIONS AT A MAJOR BANK I KNOW WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOULD BE LIKEAnd what a good job at PR for your bank youve been doing All of the banks headquartered in town are reviled nationwide Me I assure you these mistakes will not be repeatedPRL then starts shouting for another couple minutes at me which I again tuned out AGM finally steps in and tells her shell take care of it PRL smacks into the door and gets pissed until I open it for her Once I get back inside AGM motions me to go to the office At this point Im shaking freaking out that Im about to be fired We get into the office and she instructs me to sit down She sits casually on one of the tables and starts laughing her head offAGM What a goddamn bitch I didnt stop her because I was stunned at just how wretched of a human being she was Sorry but oh my god Ive never seen anything like that before  Me  so Im not in trouble  AGM Ill pay for some therapy if you need me toThree unfired years later AGM is still my favorite manager ,She wants you to apologize,693

deltora,54,34,1q3vxg,115,EDIT wow sorry this is so long i didnt realize until i saw it posted   okay until a few months ago i worked at one of the two large retail pet supply storesi dont know if i should say which one id worked there about  months at the time of the incidentscene it was late i was one of three people closing that night i was the cashier my coworker was in aquatics small animals and my manager was counting the days money its about an hour till we close i can seriously feel my heart beating in my chest while i type this just thinking about it   also i need to preface this tale with something to truly appreciate this story you need to read it how she said it so not to offend anyone but everything this woman said is in a heavy angry ghetto accent anything you said to her was a personal attack to plainly describe her she was a short round and evil black woman  the writer of this story does in no way mean to imply that all short round or black women are evil or that all evil women are any of those other things this woman just happened to be all of them   now read on true believers   act  the beginning of the end   she enters my register is right by the door and its my job to greet people as they come in so i say hi welcome to  do you have any questions she says a short no and wonders off no big deal thats my usual then a little but later she comes back and says yes well maybe you can try to help me i need a cat dripper mine broke and i need a new one now i dont know if any of you work in a pet supply store but a cat dripper is not a thing so i say hmm a cat dripper do you mean a refilling water bowl or a water fountain type water bowl sign no a CAT DRIPPER you know what it is it drips out water when they lick it oh like a rodent water bottle show me those then so i walk over a little ways to small animalslooking back i really should have just paged the animal guy and then killed myself so id never have to talk to her again and showed her the bottles well these are too small and they have pictures of rats on the package i wanted one for a CAT CAT CAT well they dont make these for cats are you sure you bought yours here i havent bought it anywhere yet you cant seem to find it no i said i mean the one you have at home the one that broke i never said that a friend told me about these and she said you might have them at this point some other customers were making their way to my checkout so i excused myself with well ill leave you the think about your options or something like that and checked them outact  part  the transaction  after i finished with those customers she got in my line with just a small fish net for an aquarium kind of strange and hopefully not a cat dipper but whatever then i made the slight mistake of asking on retail reflex did you find everything you were looking for i could just beat myself over the head sometimes i swear and she said no YOU couldnt find what i was looking for ill come back another day and maybe then youll learn where things are by then are you new now i didnt intend to make her any angrier so i just said yeah im one of the newer ones here which is kind of true theyd only hired  new people after me oh i thought so was her delightful reply  act  the transaction part  things go from bad to awful  the next thing in my list of automated retail questions is are you a  member she says she is and proceeds to get out her purse and start digging into it shes looking and looking and looking and right as im about to ask if she wants me to look it up by her phone number she says she found it its in a card slot that is built for maybe  cards and she has like  or  jammed in there so shes fighting with it and fighting with it and im not saying jack because i dont really want to interact with her anymore as she finally gets it out with an uhg i ruined my new nails she glares at me as if waiting for an apology an apology she was never going to getshe holds out the card and i scan it i bet this wasnt even on sale was it i check it looks like its not today nouh oh well why didnt you tell me that before she continues to glare doesnt the computer say if something is on sale and shes right it usually does but that day was our big takedowntheoldsalesandputupthenewones day and our computers sometimes take a bit to catch up so something thats sticker says its onsale might not really be or vice versa and i told her as such using as few words as possible i do not mean i was short with her through this whole story i was very polite to a point beyond reason or sanity because by this point a line had formed behind her so she huffs and pays of course with all small coins i ask if she would like it in a bag and shes just putting all her things back in her purse completely ignoring me and when shes finally done she says well put it in the bag already so i put it in a small bag because its small and hand it to her and she walks down toward the end of my line  and youd think that would be it right end of transaction she leaves and i must be over reacting wellact  she doesnt leave    so this lady she takes her item and walks away  feet she is now standing at the end of my register why i have no idea but there she is now to be honest this did happen some time ago so at this point ive also been trying to black it out things get fuzzy bare with me i believe  customers came though my line in the time she stayed and it was a slooow night so my best guess is she stayed for  minutes or so i think the first to come through was a boy and his mom they were pleasant and uneventful the kid asked me if he could get a treat for his dog and then they left after them another customer i will never forget came into the line  act  part  he returns  sorry this is going to need backstory so a few weeks before the incident there was the guy the guy is a fairly regular customer to the point that i recognize his face in a crowd but not much else i do know he has cats tho anyways heres his story he came in to just get literally a handful of catfood cans like  and he got to my register and he was friendly and kind and then he was  cents short he was going to run to his car to dig though the seats for the coinage but i told him id cover it now this was the first time i ever did that out of i think  or  time and his face was the greatest thing ive ever seen you would have thought i just pushed his cats out of the way of an oncoming truck i only expected a quick thank you and hed leave but he was like what is your name looks at my nametag Deltora im going to pay you back after he left i really never thought to much about it until he got in my line looked me straight in the eye and said i think i owe you a dollar i told him if anything he only owed me  cents but he put a dollar in my hand and said no i owe you a lot more than  cents thank you now this is where things get fuzzy because all while i was having customers she kept talking at me and the things she said were not compliments i dont remember what she said when but she must have said something as my new best friend stepped into line because he almost glared at her for saying whatever it was she had said at me but i cant remember anyway after he bought his things and left he gave me a look like i hope you have an okay night   i only wish that came true    act  par  hows the weather  after he left she leaned forward she is now sitting on the front window sill i dont know if shes ever leaving she could unpack a picnic basket for all i know she is in this for the long haul but she leaned forward and says what did he get for free i was caught off guard by this and looked around my counter for any clue of what she was talking about so i just said he didnt get anything for free and she said YES HE DID he asked you if those were free and you said yes then is clicked the dog treats oh you mean the boy those were dog treats i thought you meant that man that wa NO i meant the boy now give me some dog treats and i did and as i handed them to her i was trying to think of what i could say that meant GOODBYE by the by this story take place in the midwest and during the time of this story the weather was  shades of odd it would POUR for  minutes then BAM sunny day like nothing happened so what i had been telling people is be careful for the weather it a bit unpredictable nice right i came up with it myself no way on earth anyone human being could possibly be offended by it right yeah so i said to her still being the pinnacle of niceness be careful for the weather EXCUSE ME oh oh no um its a bit unpredictable more glaring what are you late teens early twenties i dont know whats happening anymore  yes now at this point a man gets into my line and he heard was lead up to this too and she doesnt stop either she goes right on talking at me while i try and ring him up I HAVE TWO KIDS THEY ARE BOTH GROWN NOW NOW OF THEM LIVES IN FLORIDA SHES A DOCTOR NOW I HAVE LIVED IN MINNESOTA FOR FORTY YEARS DONT YOU THINK I KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER IS LIKE IN MINNESOTA i want to die let me die WELL wow that wasnt meant to be rhetorical so i barely nod a yes while hoping a bus would come through the front window killing me and her i hope this other guy doesnt get hurt hes not so bad at this point he leans into to me and whispers do you want me to tell you my life story too HOLY SHIT this guy is great i give him the weakest of smiles and say thank you then he leaves and she actually leaves to but BUT  she stops half way to the door and turns GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR JOB HERE and with that she left   FECKINBTCHIWILLKILLYOUSDFIAGIHBASDFGBHLADSFGBHafter she was finally gone i just crouched in one of the isles and did some deep breathingdry heavingtearfree bawling if you believe in soul mates i believe in the opposite of that i think this womans aura or whatever you want to call it and mine must have been totally different sides of the spectrum because i honestly felt like she rubbed my soul raw with sand paper she was abrasive in every sense of the word and while i would take a bullet for a stranger she is now one of a handful of people on the planet i would shoot in the stomachanyway thats my story it took my  hours to get down because i needed breaks a lot of breaks but here it is for all of you if i remember anything else ill add itshe also came back twice one of those times to accuse me of theftTLDR she knows what the weather is like and needs her cat dipper but badedit also for the record i still have that guys dollar and i never intend to spend it,WELL oh wow that wasnt meant to be rhetorical,149

FredFltStn,302,449,1q3l7r,1136,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  I had a customer call a month ago to complain about some fireworks The customer was hearingimpaired and the call was being conducted through a TDD device using an operator If youve never communicated over a TDD through an operator it can be exasperating and I feel terrible for the hearing impaired people who have to use oneBasically you tell the operator whatever youd like to say making sure to speak slowly The operator types your end of the conversation on a keyboard and then sends it to the hearing impaired user The user then reads the message types in their reply and sends it back to the operator The operator then reads the reply back to you Sometimes it can take minute or two for all this to happen so youre basically saying a couple of sentences or asking a question waiting for a minute or two to hear the reply and then speaking again Its like having a conversation in slow motion with someone on the moonApparently the caller had purchased some fireworks from me in June and was mad because some of them didnt work  I give an unconditional money back guarantee on everything I sell and I always feel terrible when someone has issues with my stuffI apologized profusely and since my store is seasonal and had already closed I offered to send him a check to refund his purchase Normally Id want to see a receipt or have them bring back the duds but because of the TDD wed already been on the phone for more than  minutes at that point I felt bad for the guy and just wanted to finish the call and make him happy Two minutes later  TDD delay Unfortunately that wasnt the answer he was looking for Instead he wanted me to replace his fireworks I offered to meet him somewhere and bring him replacementsTwo minutes later I was informed that he lived an hour away and couldnt get over to Orlando Instead he wanted me to mail him the fireworksNow fireworks are considered hazardous materials and cant be shipped through the regular mail Because of the expense and problems associated with this I dont ship fireworks I let him know that and again offered to send him a check to cover the dudsTwo minutes later I was again told that I needed to mail him fireworks since I had a guarantee and the fireworks he had purchased were bad Once again I explained to the operator that I didnt mail fireworks but that Id be happy to send a check Two minutes later Hes now really mad at me and yelling that I can send him a check and hell go to another fireworks company to get his stuff I only know that he was yelling because the TDD operator informed me that he was typing emphaticallyThats rightI was being yelled at by a hearing impaired person over the phone through an operator translating the callI asked him to give me a list of exactly what fireworks were duds so I could figure out the cost and mail him a check I also told him that I would need his home addressTwo minutes later Its a box of firecrackers A Fcking  box of firecrackers I had now spent  minutes on the phone because this ass was unhappy that some of the firecrackers in his pack did not pop more than two months after he had purchased themI immediately sent him a check for  through online banking I filled out the note field on the check It read Please shop somewhere else Unfortunately it can take up to  days for the check to arrive when its a new entry onlineThe bastard called me back every day until he got the check When the TDD operator would identify themselves I would just say The check is in the mail and hang up If youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,Please shop somewhere else Tales From a Fireworks Tent,1585

right now I can pack it up immediately but itll still be the  for diagnostics before we can release to you This caused more of the exact same argument and then she began yelling about me needing to be fired again and that he should be fired as well and that M should be fired Basically this girl wanted our whole department gonegtTF finally giving up FINE Ill just take it to Apple then Theyll do a better job After a bit more cussing at us she finally pays the  and goes to Apple B having worked at the Apple store notes that the girl just wasted well over  extra  the fix from us would have taken just one day longer would have been done day after all this and she would have only needed to pay  more for all her issues to be solvedPeople are soodd sometimesSorry for the wall of textTLDR Some girl doesnt listen to what shes signing to requests for a whole department to be fired and then goes on to end up spending hundreds more than needed EDIT Grammars and stuffs ,Fair warning Im going to

VivaLaVodkaa,17,20,1q2txh,55,I apologize for the wall of text but Im really not sure how to TLDR this oneAlright this is my first time posting here This isnt a retail story so hopefully you guys are flexible about that and I hope you enjoyThis past summer I was an  year old that had just gotten my first job One of my best friends started his own small landscaping company and it was doing surprisingly well As his company was quite small and lacked heavy equipment we did relatively small stuff planting trees bushes mowing lawns trimming trees etc The jobs were a considerable drive away so I went down twice a week to help out As far as first jobs go the pay was much better than expected so I didnt mind the drive as much and this gave me a chance to hang out with my friend afterwards as wellThis was my first day with my friends company probably May  We had just finished two lawnmowing jobs and were moving onto the third and final for the day My friend said I could either sit it out and hit the local mall while he took this one on or I could help him out I was fairly exhausted but he insisted that it would be a small job as described by the owner of the property The owner was an old gentleman maybe  years old His social worker hired us to do the job and she did in fact describe it as smallSo I caved and said fine because a little extra money never hurts this job was paying  so it would be  a person for what was supposed to be an approximately  minute task We arrived at the property and the front lawn took  minutes I was really happy at this point because at this rate we would be done in no timeI opened the door to the backyard and holy fuck the grass was almost as tall as me  in some areas album included at the end Upon seeing this I shit an assortment of bricks We were WAY underequipped for this job as we only had one lawnmower and a whippersnapperWe decided to give it a go since we were here anyway Mostly because the owner was rather old couldnt mow it himself and probably couldnt afford to pay anybody more The lawnmower continuously jammed and I do not blame it What should have been a  minute job took us a grand total of  hours over those  hours the lawnmower probably jammed  times The strategy was that my friend would whippersnapper as much as he could to reduce the load on the lawnmower I would mow it down as best as I could and we would alternate as necessaryBy the time we had finished deforesting the lawn we were exhausted Instead of the original  we had been offered the social worker payed us  so  each  over  hours still decent Absolutely exhausting work thoughHere are pictures of the lawnhttpimgurcomaUjtjAESch,Just a typical landscaping job,75

question about dog food they call me If you have a question about birds they call me If you have a question about which sort of cat litter is the best for getting out of  inches of midNovember Minnesota snow they call me I will also give you the long answer to any question you ask If you make a statement in conflict with proper animal care protocol I will gently explain why you are wrong and how you can be less wrong As you will see I tend to be very long windedAquatic turtles are really popular when people are asking about them and are the slowest selling animal in the store A proper set up on them will easily run into  They need massive aquariums  not on sale and all of the fitting aquarium accessories If anybody asks me about turtles I will go through the costs with themThen come in three women One of them quickly designates themselves as the primary customerTurtle Lady I want one of em turtles  Me Alright Do you have a tank  TL No  Me Well Youll have to get a tank first and set it up Normally I recommend a  Breeder  TL I want this one points at  gallon tank  Me These guys get pretty big Youll need to upgrade to a bigger tank in a matter of months Its cheaper to get the fill grown tank and just start from there   TL Im getting this tank Just get me the fucking turtle holds  gallonCorporate tends to want us to bend over backwards and lick the shoes of customers though I am more than willing to politely tell a customer to shove it Me You can not put that turtle in a  gallon tank  TL Well its only to get to Chicago Then Ill get everything Actually just get me everything I need and Ill buy the tank when I get thereThis is where things start to get weird I head off and grab a shopping cart and start to piece everything one would need for a proper turtle setup Out of spite I threw together the most expensive possible setup Top of the line heater top of the line lamps biggest possible resting spot fanciest filter  bag of pelleted food I finally bring the cart over to her and she flips her shit Unbeknownst to me while I was filling the cart she paid for the turtle and the  gallon tank The turtle was legally hers and I couldnt do anything to stop it You cant really force a customer to return something against their will TL WHAT THE FUCK IS ALL THIS  Me You asked me to get everything youd need for the turtle  TL The fuck is this for holds up lamp fixture  Me Its a basking lamp It helps them absorb calcium  TL Fuck all this shit Im just getting this tank and the fucking turtleI just want the lady out of the store at this point TL Im going to

gallon tank weighs around  pounds  For a turtle you only fill it halfway but I just felt like fucking with her at this pointTL Yeah Ill lift it in  Me Sure Ill put it on a cart and fill it for you  TL You think Im fucking weak Im going to carry it  Me Well itd be easier  TL Im fucking carrying itI just resign myself to facilitating her insanity at this point Nothing I can do just get her the fuck out of the store as fast as possible I fill up the tank let her carry it all the way out including when she forgot her keys inside the store and walked all the way back in holding the  pound sloshing tank When she finally got back outside she opened the door to the  car set it on her back seat and buckled it inThe other two ladies make their way to the car having not witnessed the rest of the interaction and start screaming at Turtle Lady about how insane it was she would have an open aquarium sitting in the back of her car I sort of slink away back into the store and start telling my coworkers about what had transpiredThen she comes in holding the tank turtle in it and comes up to me TL So weve decided we need a smaller tank  Me Well the one you had was probably the cheapest one  TL I dont care about the price  Me Well uh I mean we have a  gallon fish bowl but you would need to get a new tank for him the instant you get to Chicago Its one of our larger markets so youll have no problem finding a store  TL Yeah yeah whatever She returns the  gallon leaving me to deal with a half full aquarium and purchases the fish bowl and some food for the turtle Its about then Im sent to get dinner for everybody working in the store which Im usually more than glad to do As Im getting in my car I see her walk back into the store with the fish bowl Not my fucking problem at this pointWhen I get back in I find that she wanted a bigger thing for the turtle She also spent a fair amount of time bugging the cashier about what ethnicity she is mixed  black  white apparently black girls cant have hair as pretty as hersTurtle Lady finally left and we all held a vigil for the turtle At least somebody made a point of writing NO GUARANTEE on the turtles paperworkSecond worst turtle

ShootsToKill,27,22,1q0fuy,107,Ive been working at my store for over three years now and despite my company not caring too much about its workers Ive always felt that my managers didnt share that same view Im starting to think I was wrong about thatRecently my managers came up with a little contest for us If we sell items from more than one department to a customer we get a  gift card Weeks went by and despite the requirement being met daily nobody got a gift cardSunday night the assistant manager kept me at the store an hour late because he had to write an email At the end of the night he told me that a few weeks ago he watched me sell from several departments to one customer and gave me a gift card Even though its only  it still meant a lot to be rewarded for going above and beyond just helping a customer and sending them awayI got home that night and showed the gift card to my fiance proud of myself and satisfied While looking over the card I noticed that it expired three months ago I was a little bummed but I figured I would bring it in the next day and we would figure out some other rewardI brought it in the next day and showed it to the assistant manager He told me to wait a minute and went to talk to the general manager who came up with the idea to give out the gift cards Thirty seconds later he walked out of the office and said You can just consider this a really big pat on the back Then he smiled and walked awayThis is not a big deal I dont end up  richer than I was before I wasnt expecting any kind of reward but to get my hopes up and to stomp on them is just wrong I would have been happy with just about any replacement they could have given me monetary or not Now I have an expired gift card in my wallet to remind me that three years of them breaking my spirit gives me the right to take a better opportunity the second I see one,Worse Than No Reward At All,129

yodamaster,20,21,1q0fc0,88,I know this isnt explicitly retail but I would love to share this good ol story of mine as I procrastinate writing a really boring paperI worked a couple years ago as a lifeguard at an indoor pool facility The facility consists of a leisure pool  that never gets deeper than  has a waterslide etc a lap pool for exercise a sauna and a hot tub IIRC it was a Sunday which means there was no executive staff Aquatics Director and the Head Guard on shift was on break he was pretty handsome and off flirting with one of the cute girls working at the front desk Anyways there were two guards on duty I was assigned to watch the lap pool sauna and hot tub while the other guard watched the leisure pool While walking around scanning the area I came across a man in the hot tub who had his face submerged in the water for an extended period of time THIS IS A HUGE RED FLAG for obvious and not so obvious reasons So when I get around to the hot tub I tap him with my rescue tube and explain to him the several rules hes violating and he seems cool with it and I return to pacing around the pool rethinking my decisions in life When I get back around to where he is he stops me I dont understand why I cant just put my face in the water I explain to him well sir when I see someone laying face first in the water I assume that something is wrong regardless of how deep the water is A lot of people like to come in here after they work out and they are prone to losing consciousness especially in hot water with steamy humid air Yea but I pay a lot of money to use this place I should be able to do what I want I understand sir but these rules are here for your safety and the safety of others thats when I uttered every underlings favorite words would you like to discuss this with my supervisor of course he agreed Now I think its important at this point to explain that this fucker was MASSIVE like probably ex marine huge and I am the typical gawky awkward swimmer with a tiny ass waist no fat and lean muscle I can barely do a pull up but I have a breast stroke that would knock your socks off but I digress So I wait until I am relieved then I go and try and find the Head Guard lets call him Roman So Roman is a huge ass motherfucker that left about a month after this incident to become a cop I explain to him this asshats inability to comprehend something that most  year olds dont have to be told twice to not do So Im relieved of any responsibility to enjoy my break by eating Ritz and peanut butter fuck yea After a minute or so I hear elevated voices So I step outside and the asshat is beet red and Roman is chill as cucumber fuck yea veggie analogies I pay  fucking dollars a month I should be able to do whatever the fuck I want Roman keeps his cool and explains what I already told him I wont listen to some little shit telling me what to do as he says this he jabs his finger towards me and in his eyes I saw the pure fury and rage that is steroid abuse Eventually he calms down and the rest of the story was retold to me as I wasnt involved in the rest of the deliberations Long story short this guy gets taken off the premises handcuffed and in the back of a squad car He is banned from all locations of this HUGE INTERNATIONAL nonprofit fitness centers and if he ever trespasses he will promptly be arrested Thankfully no fists were thrown cause I dont feel like going to court,I pay  fucking dollars a month I should be able to do whatever the fuck I want,109

OpponentCorn,1,12,1q0any,17,Hi folksI love this sub the stories make me laugh cry sob over the decline of humankind etc They never fail to brighten my daySo here is the first of my own stories Or it would be save for that one that i wrote in greentext Whoopsies my bad Anyway enough talk lets fightI work at a big box home improvement warehouse where lowest prices are just the beginning Specifically in the trade department dealing with commercial customers and the odd retail customer who happens to need help with building materialsThis just happened about ten minutes ago so forgive my venting But tragically this is a fairly regular occurrence wherein a ahem valued customer will come in and well embarrass is the wrong word all they make is a tiny mistake nobody knows everything which isnt embarrassing in the slightest But instead of laughing it off they bristle and get defensiveSo here we are working earning them dollars mostly just catching up on paperwork Its the end if the day so theres very few team working at the time and a pair of people come in without anyone really noticing They are not builders they have quite clearly been sent in to pick up a few things by a builder though Turns out they are looking for nails so they immediately walk over to the small rack of builders essentials that we keep beside the trade counter Pencils folding rules marker pens and suchThere are all of three different kinds of nails that we keep there the kinds that builders always need So predictably it turns out that what they are looking for isnt there but no stress we have an entire aisle full to the brim with nailsWhere are your decking nails Are you out Thats pretty crapI look up and a scowling face greets me They will be down aisle  we only keep a few essentials here the rest are in the nails aisleWhy arent they hereIm not paid enough for thisYou guys dont know a thing about how to set up your store all the nails should be in the same place Now wouldnt that be more sensible Silence Wouldnt itAwww poor baby is that your girlfriend you brought with you Well I guess you wont be impressing her todayActually scratch that just get angry while I stare at you thatll impress her pants right off of herAt this point I should probably point out that I can see the nails they need It looks like someone picked up a box and changed their mind right before they got to the counter putting their box of nails on the builders essentials shelf I guess its just too hard to try to match up the empty box you have in your hands with a full one on the shelfSo fuck it I guess its petty revenge time Bert stareI turn around and just walk awayAnd I instruct everyone else to ignore them if they come back,I look stupid so Im going to tell you that you are stupid,29

hellomini,62,46,1q076f,118,So I work at a retail location in Canada that provides services such as domesticinternational money transferring and money order purchases Today I had one gentleman come in requesting to purchase a money order for x amount in American currency payable to his American health insurance companyAs store policy goes I explained that all money order purchases had a specific fee and that a customer could only pay for it using cash or debit card He then proceeded to tell me that he had an American debit card and asked me if it would be okay I asked to see what kind of card it was Ie From what financial institution and saw that it was a  debit card with the MasterCard insignia  a newish type of card that allows account holders the versatility of a chequing and savings account as well as the ability to make online purchases in the same way that many use their credit cards among other things While this card is relatively new in Canada it has been introduced much earlier in other countries including the USUnfortunately this type of card is not seen as an acceptable form of payment for money orders in my store because a debit card with MasterCard or Visa functionality would register as either of the two in my registers system despite being a chequingsavings card To put it in simpler terms the only debit cards acceptable for this kind of transaction would be Interac debit cards nothing else To use a MCV debit card would confuse the register and have it show up as a credit payment rather than a debit payment  something that I would not be able to carry out to begin with as the credit payment function is completely inaccessible when undergoing this kind of transaction on my registerI explained all of this in the simplest terms I could to the customer snd apologized for the inconvenience Then I pointed to the nearby ATM machine and explained that an alternative would be withdrawing funds from his American chequing account and pay with those funds I then concluded that he could choose which option would be best for him and that there would be no pressure to purchase a money order from my store as there are many other providers with this service but that the same rule regarding MCV cards exists throughout Canadian stores offering this service What then happened was probably the most baffling thing everAs many of you on here Im sure you have at one point felt more therapist than retail worker At this moment I had the unfortunate chance of experiencing this at its full extent as he began to explain why exactly he needed this money order and that they whoever they is told him that he could do it here and that he didnt want to pay the fees to withdraw funds from his American account and that every other country has these cards and use them properly But then get this he wasnt done yet No no According to this fine gentleman he was an American citizen and didnt have to follow my rulesAt this point I was really confused Im not sure how his American citizenship had anything to do with the rules within Canada Secondly I never expected to encounter some kind of Murcia circlejerk in real life but lo and behold I did Moreover I had just explained all of this to the customer in front of him who was a Japanese citizen and had a Japanese MC debit card and required a money order as well Now I had several questionsDoes he think being American grants him immunity to the standard transaction protocolDoes he mean to insinuate that somehow being American is being better than being Canadian as evident in his overaccentuated Im an American citizenAfter hearing me speak to the Japanese citizen does he assume that somehow the rule would not apply to him because he was American and the Japanese person was notWhat does he mean he doesnt have to follow my rules Does he think I pulled a rule book out of my ass and that Im just fucking with peopleLastly does he really think I care about him being an AmericanAll of these questions ran through my head I could have shut him down real quick I could have reminded him that when you enter a country you are obligated to follow the rules of conduct within that country especially when it relates to any thing monetary I could have also mentioned that it was people like him that gave Americans that stereotype of selfabsorbed redneck an unfortunate stereotype to the many Americans who are anything but I could have done so many things But that is not the Canadian wayI simply responded sorry And that was thatEdit formatting,Im an American citizen and I dont have to follow your rules A tale from a little cashier working in Canada first post,164

ComixBoox,16,14,1q04yx,58,Background  or so years ago when I was in high school I decided that I needed a summer job I had never been employed before I had just turned  and most places near where I live wouldnt hire someone under  so I started looking for work A friend mentioned to me that the movie theatre where he worked was hiring so I applied and miraculously got the job For a long time this cinema had been the biggest one in town It was always packed and had the newest movies but within the past year another much nicer cinema had opened only a few blocks away and business had slowed to a crawl Because of this the staffing at this theatre was pretty sparse Business was steady in the evenings but during daytime hours there was pretty much nobody in the lobby This will be important laterThe Story I arrived one weekend for my first day of work a little nervous and not knowing what to expect I came in and the assistant manager a super cool girl  years or so older than me gave me my locker and uniform and started showing me the ropes It was a great first job I was just the ticket taker and so all I had to do was tear tickets and direct people to their theatres and then clean theatres in between showings The AM shows me the ropes and then leaves me in the hands of another Ticket Taker TT for the rest of the day so I can basically shadow him and ask him any questions I might have I ask him questions try to make small talk and the like but this guy a big asian guy says almost nothing to me Everything is met with a timid yeah or no so eventually I sort of give up One or two people trickle into matinee showings but for about  minutes its just me and TT alone in the lobby when all of a sudden he starts making strange noises TT grunts and sad little moansMe Are you okTT  urghMe uh TT rrrrrrrrrrrrrnghhhhThis guy is doubling over now grunting and sweating when all of a sudden he opens his mouthTo call what happened next puking would be doing a disservice to sick children everywhere Its as if his body carried within it a portal to a dimension entirely comprised of halfdigested skittles popcorn hotdogs and soda and now burdened with terrible purpose his stomach had begun to unleash this nightmareworld into our own I stood in horrified awe as vomit spewed out of this man this vessel for excrement for an unmeasurable amount of time until the stream became a dribble and eventually ceased I had backed out of the splashzone when it started so I was relatively unscathed but TT looked like hed just dove into the whale tank after the belugas had eaten a batch of rotten fish He looked up from the small brown lake that separated us looked into my eyes and without a word ran out of the movie theatre as fast as he couldI am   and I am not exaggerating when I say I could have laid down in the puddle that was left and made a full pukeangel It was the middle of the day less than an hour into my first real job ever and I was alone in this huge movie theatre lobby with this puddle of vomit the only witness to this strange occurence The radio we had was sitting on the ticket takers podium splattered with flecks of puke so I gingerly pressed the call button and radioed up to AM who came downstairs laughingMe uh so TT threw up and then leftAM haha oh yeah sorry about that Its actually been about  months since he did this He used to do it every day,The strangest first day of work ever,72

MissInDeceased,16,29,1pzs5r,101,I had completely forgotten about this story until someone asked how it was to work at this place    This was about  years ago when I was freshfaced to the retail scene I had previously worked at a movie rental place but it was nothing like this When people wanted assistance they wanted you to essentially be their personal shopper Which was kind of okay when it wasnt busy because this place sold expensive bras panties and lingerie     I was stuck to the morning shifts because I was the only employee not in school at the time Morning shifts always equaled the shipment shift     So every weekday am to pm I would come in put out new bras and whatnot and help customers when they came in It was typically me and the opening manager then maybe another girl if we had the hours    One morning was especially eventful We had gotten about  boxes of nothing but bras and it was my duty to put them out After about  hours I managed to get them all out or backstocked if there were too many     This is when a customer comes in a bigger girl about a  DD looking for a certain pattern in a certain bra    I knew exactly what pattern she meant as I had the same one so I pulled one out to verify She confirmed and told me her size     At this store when I worked there the drawers had a clear front on them so all you needed to do was look through the little window in the size you wanted to see if that colorpattern was available     Thats exactly what I was doing I was leaning down looking into the windows to see if this pattern was available Also I had been there for the past  days putting out new bras so I already knew what we had out front and in the backstock so if we didnt have it I already knew       But while I was looking into the windows the girl who was looking for the bra asked me Do you even work here    I was surprised at the question so I said Of course I do thats why Im helping you    Well it doesnt look like it looks like youre just standing there    I was shocked I was  I had no idea what to say I told her I would go look in the back and she just said Whatever    By the time I came out she was already at the register bitching to my manager about how I did nothing to help her how lazy I was and so on I walked up behind the counter and busied myself while she kept bitching    Finally she left I was nearly in tears this was the first time someone had complained about me and KEPT complaining about me even while I was there     After she left my manager told me Dont worry about it I saw that you were actually helping her she was just being a bitch     Geez some people   ,Do you even work here,130

alexasloan,7,5,1pznyk,55,The store I work at has these scratchers that we give out periodically at the registers if you forgot your coupon sent in the mail for either   or  off These coupons are only for people that use the stores card The scratchers are so dumb because the people that forgot their  coupon at home always get it honored and dont even really need a scratcherAnyway Im closing POS one night with another newer girl when this customer approaches my her and asks for a handful of scratchers in a whisper voice like she knows shes being shady My coworker looks over at me and I explain that the scratchers are for customers that have the store card only and we can give her one but we usually just scratch them at check out amp I ask the customer if shes ready for checkout She says she has a store card and isnt ready to check out but she says she wants a handful of scratchers My co worker calls for a manager to see what she can do When the manager comes over the customer starts acting crazy  shes yelling at the new girl saying that shes not providing good customer service and she wants to see a manager All of this is for show because she knew we called the manager and that she was on her way Im kind of giving her the crazy eyes at this stunt shes trying to pull So my manager asks if everything is ok and how she can help and this crazy customer starts yelling that she just wanted a scratcher so that shed know how much she can spend tonight And my manager was like ok sure here you go and hands her one kind of confused why this is even an issue So I speak up and say that the customer actually asked for a handful and do we do that This crazy lady starts yelling now and rocking back and forth saying that all the other managers do it and she usually gets like  or  scratchers when she comes in Seeing that this lady is crazy my manager just asks her  Did you have a  at home The perfect opportunity for this lady to just say yes get the best discount there is and just move on with her life But she says I dont know what I got I just want my scratchersMy manager gives her three and says Have a good night and the psycho lady gabs them from her and storms back to Customer Service to write a complaint about my manager TLDR Crazy lady is more interested in gambling for a  coupon than just accepting one that is offered,Give me my scratchers Just tell me you left your  at home,60

deleted,24,28,1pzewe,140,I only worked in retail for about a year episodes like this partly the reason why but this story is one Ill probably carry to the grave I worked at a grocery store in the Specialty department We handled wine cheese beer coffee and chocolate products You know all the best stuff There was even a bar area where we served ice cold drafts pumpkin spice lattes and wine by the glass Everybody in the Specialty department did everything  on a given day you could work the bar stock wine or any number of odd jobs related to retail and food production Our main area it could be said was the cheese counter At first glance this cheese counter was glorious Literally hundreds of specialty cheeses from all over the world One of our responsibilities was to assist customers with choosing the cheese right for them  we posed as cheese experts but the reality is few of us knew more than what we could read on the package words like salty and creamy seemed to sell things pretty well At the end of the day not the worst job in the world  definitely a bit higherclass as far as retail work goes Our customers were pretty bearable  I have more good stories about them than bad I suppose I got luckyBut that all changed one fateful eveningI was working behind the cheese counter with two other employees cutting cheese all the obvious jokes have been made doing our thang Its pretty theraputic work and we get to shoot the shit while checking out the ladies Then a woman walks up She appeared to be about my age  early twenties She was Indian and not bad looking all things considered Naturally I took the opportunity to ask if she needed assistanceAnything I can help you with maamI could immediately tell that something was off Her pupils were the size of dinner plates She looked at me as though I was the most terrifying thing she had ever seen in her lifeYes I need helpSure thing maam what can I help you findThere was a brief pause and she appeared to be unravelling some particularly complex puzzle in her head I got the sense that she hadnt really heard meMy friend has cancerI was completely blindsided by this I need you to help me I dont know what to do my friend has cancer and I need helpShe was gesturing wildly as she spoke and appeared to be gaining momentum you know when people start talking at you and slowly pick up speed as they go I had no idea what to do  fortunately Im pretty good at talking people through things so I decided to just reason with her Well I think that a doctor might be able to help you better than I canShes been to doctors and they cant help her I need helpMaam I work in the cheese departmentI dont know where to go I dont care that you work in the cheese department I dont care that youre busy I need you to help meAt this point I start to glance around for assistance Those two coworkers I had mentioned earlier Nowhere to be seen Fuckers By now I had picked up on the fact that she wasnt all there Fortunately for reasons entirely unrelated to retail Im pretty accustomed to reasoning with people who are drugged updrunkless than soberWell since shes your friend maybe youre the person who knows whats best for herThis seemed to calm her down a bit so I kept goingMaybe the doctors arent helping because they dont know her like you do You should go and be with her since shes your friendShe seemed to ponder this and to my great relief the phone rang I siezed the opportunity to walk away and answer the phone It was one of my coworkersYeah hi I thought you could use a rescueHoly shit dudeI know dudeCan you try to find Service Service  is code name for our securityYou should probably go to customer service and ask them to page themSuddenly Im interrupted by a plastic fork whizzing past my head I look up and see this fucking girl throwing garbage behind the cheese counter I hung up and asked her what she was doing She didnt even respond just started throwing shit at me instead One of the assistant managers finally came out and asked her to stop This seemed to distract her and to my great relief she walked away I found out later that she had the exact same conversation with another hapless employee from another departmentUnfortunately since this particular store is ridiculously procustomer service I doubt that she ever got kicked out Our corporate culture is kind of weird  you could smack talk an employee right in front of them and well still give you free shit But if you even LOOK as though you might steal from us you get escorted out in handcuffs No joke  Ive seen it happenI have a handful of stories from working retail and I might share when I have the time This story is one of the highlights  Ill never forget that woman Although I highly doubt she actually had a sick friend I still wonder what was actually going on in her head I guess Ill never know,The time I was attacked by a druggedup Indian woman while slicing cheese,168

YeahJordy,189,215,1py1fk,782,Background I used to work at a discount store and since there was only a handful of workers we were jack of all trades I packed shelves helped customers worked the register everything including changing lights while they were on because my manager assured me it was perfectly safeStory Anyway the night in particular that this story unfolded my manager decided to buy myself and the other worker a thickshake while she went and changed some money So here I am with my thickshake packing those personalised number plates onto a rack when I see a customer at the register waiting to be served so I dash over and begin serving Now I feel its worth mentioning that this store is pretty close to a junky area and so we get our fair share of painful customers This night was no exceptionI went back to packing plates and after a while I realised my thickshake was missing My manager promptly points out that this tattooed man with a rats tail and filthy clothes sorry for judgemental imagery Im still slightly bitter was slurping on my shake I confronted him not quite sure what to say and he got immensely defensive eventually offering it back to me I just shook it off and kept workingHalf an hour or so later my manager yells out that someone is in our storeroom she was behind the counter and had seen it on the CCTV our storeroom is at the far corner of the store and clearly has an EMPLOYEES ONLY plaque on it I sprinted up towards the back and sure enough as I approached this woman the kind you can confidently assume to be an addict is walking out of the storeroom and I see her drop something into her bag I confront her and she avoids eye contact and tries to busy herself with the nearby shelfMe What were you doing in there What is in your bagWoman Theres nothing in my bag Im just lookingMe I saw you drop something in your bag show me what it wasWoman I aint done nothingWe went back and forth arguing for a while and I was getting frustrated so I left her and ran back to the storeroom saw my backpack had been unzipped and sure enough my iPod was missing I ran back to the woman who had met up with the shake thief from earlier and handed him my iPod subtly I saw it in his hands and practically yelled Thats not yours Why did you take this as I snatched it back and he yelled in return I didnt do nothingThe next part is a bit blurry from the adrenaline I was experiencing but essentially the two junkies refused to explain anything to me Next thing I knew a lady pulled me aside and was asking me all these questions and I noticed another  were talking to the pair of thieves This lady told me that she and her  friends were plainclothed policemenwomen who just happened to be walking by the shop as my manager screamed out about the woman in the storeroom since there had been reports of thieves in the shopping centre recently She asked me a bunch of questions and after half an hour or so I got back to work as they kept interrogating the thievesAs I was working a male policeman MP came up and this is the conversation that unfoldedMP Hey mate how old are youMe  I turn  in a few weeksMP laughs Hah I thought soMe Whats so funnyMP Well this woman finally admitted to stealing your iPod but she claims that she only did it to get back at you for hitting on her in the club the other night In Australia you have to be  to go clubbing I knew she was lyingBut you wouldnt go there would youMe thinking that he meant going clubbing No I wouldnt clubs definitely dont seem like somewhere Id like to be at all even when I am MP No I meant herWe both had a good laugh about that remark and it made me feel a bit better The police took down my details and then they escorted the junkies out and gave them a lifetime ban from the shopId like to say that was the end of it but  minutes later the junky woman returns and just says I know Im banned but when I was out the back I left my phone out there can I just go get it please Oh It looks just like that one she points to my managers phone sitting near the register We politely tell her to get lost and never come back The nerve of some peopleSince then Ive had to give an official police statement but havent heard much else past that although I know she got charged Also my brothers girlfriend works in a different discount store around the corner and she has had some stories with the same woman too but thats for another time,The night the customer stole from my backpack,997

blackaurora,14,19,1pxgsh,85,This happened about a month or two ago but I just thought of it now so here goesA lady comes in wanting an iPhone S She looks familiar so while Im retrieving the iPhone I secretly take a look at our log books Store policy at least our store dunno about others was that a customer could only purchase one iPhone per person every  days Why Fraud We get more than wed like There are some people that repeatedly try to come in The guys at LP know who they are and so do some of us and will often call us on the departments phone to tell us not to do the contract Then we usually pretend our computers went down or somethingAnyway the log book tells me she bought an iPhone S just yesterday I wasnt sure how to tell her that I know she just bought one so I make up some excuse to go find a manager in the back I find one who knows our policy and explain the situation He says that in a recent meeting they decided that as long as the customer has the proper ID were supposed to let it go through Nothing else matters Not our current policy or how suspicious they are several red flags went up with this woman or even if we recognize the person as being fraudHe even says It probably is fraud But we have to do it anyway I ask why they changed the policy  dont get much of an answer So I go and do the contract Or try to anyway Luckily the system rejected it forcing me to call the carrier where they told me they cant let it go through forgot why I mentioned her to some of my coworkers the next day and they confirmed that she was known to be fraudSo basically if ATampT hadnt stopped it  and they rarely do  wed have been screwed Id really like to know what geniuses came up with this new policy,It probably is fraud But we have to do it anyway,104

jinbaittai,9,16,1px3nf,83,I work as a dog groomer and have a pretty regular clientele  One of my customers C has two dogs that she keeps with long hair  Shes pretty fussy about their appearance which Im fine with but shes also kind of petty and passiveaggressive if you make a mistake  For example one time I accidentally trimmed the eyelashes on one eye too short  the dog blinked at the wrong second and they were a quarter of an inch shorter than the customer prefers forcing me to trim the other eyelashes just a bit shorter so they matched  Not a huge deal normally but ever since then shes made a big point of reminding me not to cut the eyelashes too short  But she brings her dogs back at least once a month each if not more often and I usually have no problem squeezing her in last minute  So she likes me for the most part  Anyhow for the past week Ive been pretty sick which has led to me losing my voice pretty much a whisper and a major sinus headache  Today I had three dogs booked for grooming sessions one of whom was Willie a major barker and Mika who was  pounds  The other was C bringing just one of her dogsWell C showed up twenty minutes late without bothering to call me  Mika had been dropped off early and I was in the middle of working on her  Willie was in a kennel and  barking his fool head off as per usual and there were two dryers running at the same time  it was very loud and chaotic  Always great for a headache rightAs I mentioned my voice is almost entirely gone  I went to go chat with C to confirm what she wanted done for the day  I told her in my pathetic whispervoice that I would have to finish what I was doing with Mika before I could start on her dog and that I would need extra time with her dog  My final question was  Can you come back for your dog at Out of nowhere she gets upset    I was confused so whispersaid Yes I know its longer than normal but Im slow thanks to being sick and I have to start him later  So I need him until   At this point she literally stamps her foot and says in a huffy voice Oh just CANCEL it then  And then storms away taking the dog with her  I stood there for a minute and then shrugged and got back to work  I was feeling like garbage and I didnt have the energy to chase her down and see what the hell was going on  A couple minutes later my manager came back to the grooming room  So whyd you ask C to come back at   I said To pick her dog up  Well apparently C thought I wanted her to take her dog home and bring it back at   And instead of making sure she didnt hear my pathetic whisper incorrectly in all the chaos she freaked out and left bitching out my manager on her way  She hadnt waited for my manager to come chat with me either shed stomped out of the door  My manager and I shared a head shake and carried on with our daysLater that day C called to complain again  Apparently once my manager explained that I had intended to keep the dog for longer than normal not that I wanted her to return the dog to me later she changed her tone and begged to bring the dog back that dayIn a fit of pettiness I said no  I was too tired actually wound up in the doctors office an hour later to get antibiotics  She rebooked for later this week and apologized profusely  I am trying really hard to keep my smugness in check  With great power and all that right,Jump to conclusions much,99

Taelzos,19,39,1pwj2p,156,Allo TFR First time posting in this particular subrebbit but I have a post or two in TFTS as that is where I work nowBackstory  I was working for a popular Canadian fast food chain that doesnt have as many restaurants thrown everywhere as the other chains thus we get a lot of customers to each particular store and a lot of regulars I was there for four and a half years pending my graduation from college as the closing shift grillmaster loltitles for  of the time but sometimes I would also close front of houseThis particular time I was working front of house closing shift on a Sunday which is usually the slowest time of the week for us It was fairly late and there was only one customer at the time so we were chatting away as I filled out their order and garnished their hamburger for them The customer happened to order a bottle of orange juice with his order instead of a fountain drink which is what springs this little story The company bigwigs has recently decided to slice the size of our bottled juices Apple and orange to approximately  of their original size and lower the price by a whopping  cents This sort of thing doesnt sit well with me as I am the type of person who has pride in their work and always put in their best effort regardless of what society likes to think  so this little gimmick of theirs was on my mind recently The customer was not a small gentleman and when I gave him the bottled juice with his order he gives it a kind of sad bemused look and drains it in one gulp That man just paid  canadian for a single slug of orange juiceI grabbed another from our convenient little fridge located at the front of house and slapped it on his tray telling him to just take itThe gentleman reaches into his pocket to try and take out his wallet to pay for the additional bottle but I refuse and explain to him the recent change they made to gouge customers and what I thought of it We had a quick discussion about it about  seconds because his meal was ready and I let him sit down and enjoy his foodLater on I browse out to the sitting area to wipe down his table and retrieve his trayAnd there on the table is the second empty bottle of orange juice sitting smugly atop a  bill laid out on the tableGlorioustldr I dont think very highly of the marketing flops of big food chains,Fighting the good fight  Fast Food Tales ,195

FredFltStn,204,383,1pvl00,1031,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  As you can imagine we get a wide range of customers in my fireworks store One of my top priorities is customer service That priority goes away when you start acting like a creeperMost of my staff are teenagers and most of them got the job because Im friends with their parents In general I have a staff of teenage girls who work the registers and guys who work out on the sales floor moving boxes stocking shelves and doing sales I tend to spend most of my time on the floor talking to customers and selling fireworksOccasionally the girls behind the counter get hit on Pretty sure that happens almost everywhere What happens even more often is that the teenage guys who work for me hit on girls that come into the store Ive had to step in a few times mostly when the guys start following around some girl like a puppy dog instead of working but overall we dont have very many issuesOne evening one of my cashiers grabbed me and pulled me aside to talk to me There was an older gentleman who had been hanging around the counter and made a few inappropriate comments to one of the cashiers and she was getting uncomfortable I walked back to the counter to see if I could helpI walked up and pleasantly asked the guy if he needed any help He was casually dressed and looked to be in his mids I would guess He told me that he was just about finished shopping and said he didnt need any help I hung out near him at the counter hoping that he would get the messageApparently he did and he started to put his stuff up on the counter for the cashier to ring him out I stayed until she was finished ringing in his stuff She gave him the total and I started to walk away to help another customer I was probably about  feet away when I heard him ask How much to see those titsI called over to two of the guys on the floor and then stepped in front of the creeperMy staff and I carefully escorted the gentlemen out and helped him into his car I also explained to him that he was no longer welcome at my store Thats my story and Im pretty sure my staff will tell you the same thing UPDATED  For a laugh Ive posted a few photos of the staff here httpimgurcomaAZsZq Also proof that people in Florida are crazy Florida man arrestedhttpwwwmynewscomcontentnewscfnewsnewsarticlehtmlcontentnewsarticlescfnfireworksexplosionhtml after explosion involving homemade fireworksIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,I have no idea how the customer was injured Tales From a Fireworks Tent,1414
Ali,1,6,1pvk5b,12,WARNING long story ahead Long time reader first time poster Figured this story was worth sharing as this is the first time Ive lost my patience with a customerBackground I work as a customer service supervisor in one fo the largest grocery store chains in good ol Canada Im essentially the person in charge of all of customer service and the cashiers and am responsible for closing the store at the end of the night Part of my responsibilities include dealing with customers where my employees are unsure of a resolution or unable to resolve an issue without authorization from a supervisormanagerSo this particular story takes place just a mere  days ago One of my coworkers who was running the selfscan machines that most people love to hate A customer had requested  cashback in case anyone is unaware cashback is adding a specific amount to your total charged on your bank card that you get back in the form of cash at the end of her order at a usual register with a cashier it is the cashiers responsibility to hand over the cash to the customer However with the selfscan machines the money is automatically dispensed and it is solely the customers responsibility to collect the money the opted voluntarily to withdrawThe initial thing I was told over the phone by my coworker before I went to speak with the customer was that the customer asked for  cashback but she forgot to take her money This happens quite often customers are human after all I dont blame people who forget their money behind but at times we cant do much about it The usual procedure is that I take down the customers name and number along with any relevant information about the transaction time date amount which register was used etc then the cash office staff in the morning will check to see if the store still has it or if the next customer in line saw free money lying around and pocketed it themselves at which point we cant really do anythingSo I make my over and start talking to the customer well call her RAB for rude ass bitch Anyways CAB makes the claim that she took her cashback out but the machine never dispensed the cash and she said the machine was slow during her entire transaction No biggie I open up the machine to see if her cash was stuck somewhere in the middle no dice So I run diagnostics on the machine to see if the dispenser if working properly its working fine so now Im getting a bit skeptical the fact that she could have taken the  and is now trying to get another extra   At this point Ive done all I can my hands are tied So I had to explain her the situationMe Alright maam your money isnt in the machine and the dispenser is working fine so I cant confirm if the money is still in the machine or notRAB What No Im telling you the machine never spit out the money and it is your coworkers job to make sure I have my money and sign off on my receipt You people arent doing your jobs correctly Not the first time one of my employees has been blamed for attempting to steal the customers money at this point I knew resolving this wouldnt be easyMe I understand maam Im not saying I dont believe you  but at this point theres nothing I can really do We dont sign off on your receipts at selfscan stations there is no cashier handing you the money the money you take out is  in your control so it is solely the customers responsibility I can take your information down and they can check things over tomorrow morning and if your money is here you will be getting it for sureRAB NO I NEED THIS MONEY NOW FOR MY DAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY she was holding her  year old in her arms the entire time JUST GIVE IT TO ME BOTH YOU OF YOU GUYS ARE LYING AND TRYING TO TAKE MY MONEY YOURE SUPPOSED TO MAKE SURE I GET MY MONEY AND SIGN MY RECEIPT THIS IS JUST UNACCEPTABLEAt this point her child starts crying because her mother is yelling at me shes pretty much making a scene and all eyes are on usMe Maam I understand your frustration and I really wish there was an immediate solution That way youd have your money and we could continue on with our other tasks I guarantee you neither of us are trying to steal from you we wouldnt want to as the risks of getting fired are way too high to even think about attempting something like thatRAB LISTEN I DONT CARE I KNOW YOU HAVE MY MONEY JUST GIVE IT TO ME YOU TERRORISTS AND CHINKS Im South Asian and my coworker is Oriental Asian ARE NOTHING BUT BAD NEWS TRYING TO RUIN CANADAS IMAGE YOURE TOO CHEAP TO MAKE AN HONEST LIVING SO YOURE LYING TO MY FACE TO TAKE MY MONEY IM A REGULAR HERE SO I KNOW IM TELLING THE TRUTH Ive been working in the store for  years this is my first time seeing herAt this point Ive had enough shes louder than ever her husband doesnt seem interested in calming her down so I lose my patience as wellMe Maam youre going to have to calm down youre causing a scene I cant help you if youre going to be yelling the entire time and I definitely do not appreciate the remarks and allegations towards my coworker and myself being a regular does not give you the authority to make racist remarks and accuse us of theft Youll have to be a bit more rational if you want a resolutionRAB EXCUSE ME I AM THE CUSTOMER YOU ARE THE EMPLOYEE DONT TELL ME TO CALM DOWN I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT YOURE WORTHLESS AND I DONT LIKE YOUR ATTITUDEMe With this attitude youre not getting any help either Im contacting my manager she can deal with you from here on out like I said my hands are tied if I could do anything I wouldAt this point I page the manager on duty to my location and walk away in complete frustration and just pure rage that Ive never felt before The manager dealt with the customer took down her info so the morning staff could check to see if we had her money and check the cameras to see if she actually took her money and tried to harass us for another extra  I dont know what ended up happening in the end but I really hope she didnt get her moneyTLDR customer claims selfscan machine did not give her the  she asked for I tell her nothing can be done until tomorrow She doesnt like what she hears so she makes a scene makes racist comments and harasses me and

meguriau,38,38,1pupen,123,Hey TFR Im back My thesis has now been submitted and I have caught up on sleep so that leaves me free to divulge juicy anecdotes where my pain is often your gainMy Tales from a Hat Boutique httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailsearchqmeguriauamprestrictsronampsortnewamptall collection began last week garnering a bit of attention so here I am back with another one I had different story planned for you originally but Im bumping it back in honour of the race that will be stopping the nation better known as the Melbourne Cup Im not sure how big the event is outside of Australia so in short this particular racing event is not only famous for its horses but also the fashion Both men and women vie for the bestdressed awards and what better way to attract the attention of the judges than fancy hats and fascinators BackgroundTwo years ago I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals The majority of the customers Ive had have been pleasant however there have been interesting characters and even a few nasty pieces of work discontent customers that have come by This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this timeStoryThe first week of November is often a trying week here at the hat store We experience an influx of women with a perfectionistic streak looking to find that amazing hat to match the dress they had purchased in advance Today of course was another such dayAmongst the chaotic gaggle of women was an American tourist AT in his mid to late s A few confident strides was all it took for him to make his way from the front of the store to the counter M Hi there was there anything I can help you withAT Do you know which hat will win first place at the racesM Im sorry sir Im not sure I can answer that for you There are many variables that make a hat impressive The look of a hat is dependent on the height and face shape of an individual so I cant pick out which one would win and thats not including the colour scheme and style of clothing that will be wornAT Well make a good guess I want to win the prize If Im going to spend more than  on a hat itd only be worth it if I win When else am I going to wear it anywayM I can attest to the fact that the hats here are of very high quality and that the majority of customers find that the hats can also be worn in casual settingsDiscussion ensued on the properties of different types of hat and what put each hat at a different price point We finally arrived at a stage where he finally settled on a  Panama hat The hat itself was nothing short of perfect for him The ivory white complemented his lightly tanned skin tone and his height and face shape offset the width of the brim The transaction itself was running smoothly and all I needed was his signature when he paused pen in hand When asked if everything was alrightAT I was just thinking If this hat doesnt win me first place can I get a refundMy eyebrow involuntarily morphed my expression from the default handlingpotentiallydifficultcustomersinretail face to one of bewildermentM Im sorry sir We can neither exchange nor refund hats that have been used unless the item is defective The hat is still perfectly capable of providing sun protection even if you do not win tomorrows competitionHe did not seem content with this answer but his objections were cut off by his wife It turned out that she had been waiting outside patiently the entire time and seemed somewhat embarrassed by his behaviour Apologising profusely she managed to get him to sign the sheet and guided him away from the store bringing the transaction to an end We will find out tomorrow if he ends up calling in to ask for that refundEdit He didnt call back Not sure what exactly that means but I think hes happy with the hat ,Dear customer that is not how refunds work Tales from a Hat Boutique,161

Smallwater,15,26,1ptl46,94,I apologize beforehand for the massive wall of text I started typing some smaller stories but they kinda grewI currently work at a small grocery store Its part of a big German chain and I have to wear blue polo shirts as per uniform People may already know what chain I mean I work there on Saturdays only and Im still in college for the rest of the week That means Im basically the bottom bitch but since I actually try to be as productive as possible the rest of the team and management trust me enough to let me do things I shouldnt be allowed to like using the electric palletjack going into the office on my own changing prices  This chain is quite strict about their employees You are absolutely forbidden to post stuff online there have been terminations due to facebook pictures However I think that TFR is less public than FB and Im quitting there in three weeks anyway Firing me is no longer a concern for me  I will start of my long chain of stories believe me in the two years I worked there I lived through plenty with a couple of short stories of one of my former coworkers  Well not directly my coworker See we have what we call a Flying team It basically means that they get sent out to different stores and usually we only see them when we have a shortage of people due to vacations or when we need a quick replacement due to illness  One of those guys names started with T So thats what Im going to call him from here on T was in all aspects a Tremendous Idiot He was daft slow witted and the only reason he was able to keep his job was because of his uncle who worked higher up in the chain of command Some of his best escapades    Every time he had to come to work T would call and apologize He would be late for work a little bit he got stuck in a traffic jam This happened at every store Now would he be late a couple of minutes or only be late once every  weeks no biggie We get payed by the minute its your money youre losing pal But no T would come OVER AN HOUR late every single day Because of traffic jams Without change He would get in a traffic jam for over an hour every single day he had to work We started to put him on the roster an hour early as to compensate for his tardiness    When he eventually did make it to work he was different to work with than other colleagues Not that he was bad at his job on the contrary He was a fairly decent worker he knew what he was doing and he worked reasonably fast IF he was working Note T is about  years old So not only does it signify his competence being a something stuck in a retail job as a simple clerk seriously you can get promotions at the snap of your fingers A simple math test and youre already part of management but it also means a lot in what Im about to tell you now  T would occasionally read all the frikkin time flirt with girls Coworkers customers management whatever Ive seen him abandon his post AT THE REGISTER to run out in chase of a couple of teenage girls to give them his number Yes thats a  year old dude running out on his job to give his number to girls almost half his age Creepy Just a little bit  The kicker of this bit would be the scolding he got from my manager one day I was working with T and a female coworker F  F isnt unpleasant to look at but not what youd call smokin hot The manager on duty is also female and she was a bitch Not the kind of bitch you hate at least not until you got on her bad side Ive seen her stare down huge bulking angry costumers who were easily twice her size But she was awesome to work with as she was fast intelligent funny and generally pleasant if only towards us Ill call her M  Now Im stocking shelves with T and F while M was back in the office The shelves we were stacking were quite low so it involved a lot of ducking and bending over Im minding my own business swearing at some boxes who wouldnt line up right when I hear a load SLAP and a startled scream Turning around I see F standing shocked with her hands on her bottom and T with a bigass grin on his face Guess what happened yet Cause I didnt at that time I continued cursing the evil boxes who remained just half a centimeter to big and thought nothing of it Nothing of my business anyway  Suddenly M comes over to me fuming Smallwater have you seen T I see the foam coming from her mouth and F at the verge of tears behind her I tell her where T is and she storms off T T GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE I really cannot emphasize how loud and angry she was shouting Its like a Drill Sergeant met a train whistle and they had a loudass baby T comes over not really understanding how much trouble he is in with M nearly reaching boiling point Before he can even start his first sentence M completely explodes YOU KEEP YOUR GODDAMN HANDS OFF MY EMPLOYEES YOU UNDERSTAND In my mind it suddenly clicked and I realized why F was so upset about the loud slapping noise Apparently T thought it was funny to slap F as hard as he could on her butt but F really didnt like that Again I should note the creepiness of this F was barely older than  so again that is a man in his thirties slapping a girl almost  years younger that he barely knows on her butt while on duty The best part His defense  Ah I didnt mean anything by it She isnt even pretty enough for me to really mean it It was like watching a tiny rabbit unknowingly jump in front of an angry tiger F breaks down in tears she had some minor selfesteem issues and M completely explodes so loudly that he people at the register were turning heads We were at the back of the store   As far as I know he only got a berating for that incident to the surprise of us all We were sure he was going to get fired for that    T also drove a car He would have to since he has to go to different stores One of the more glorious days I remember was when T came to our store but after  hours got the message Where the fuck are you from another store The moron went to the wrong store No biggie he could have misread his roster I thought Apparently it was not the first time he showed up at the wrong store It was so bad that the manager of the store he should have gone to was already prepared for this and called our manager to ask it T could bring along a couple of boxes of grapes since the Other Store ran out earlier than expected Sure we had plenty of boxes left so we told T to bring his car around to the loading bay so we could load in the boxes There were  boxes about cm by  cm big Not that huge we though that we could easily fit them in the back of Ts old Golf Wrong  He pulls up and we immediately notice the big subwoofers hanging in his trunk Now I must say for a guy as daft as T I was impressed by the neatness of the customization It was clear the Golf had been modified but it didnt look grotesque or ugly  We started to carry the boxes to his car when he stops us and tells us he will load it in himself He just had his interior reupholstered and didnt want it damaged Fair enough so I tell him to pop the trunk and Ill put in a couple in there He opens the trunk I put in a couple of boxes and I notice the trunk wont close anymore There were too many boxes as the subwoofers were in the way of closing the trunk I start pulling out boxes to see how many we could fit in there   We could put in  boxes xcmxcm big in the back of his car because of his subwoofers  Not exactly relevant to his capability as a employee but I still giggle every time I think of the story    The reason T was eventually fired was theft Now dont get your hopes up on a big Oceans Eleven type of heist it didnt even involve money T drank a lot of energy drinks Redbull the store brand piss we sold at  cents a can whatever However paying them wasnt high on his priority list He was sneaky about this as he would pull out a can from the shelves tell the manager on duty he took one and tell he would pay for it later Now this happens fairly regularly with employees taking something from the shelves or from the stock and paying for it later Its not a big deal as we have a system of trust and memory Basically it means you either take action yourself and quickly pay for it or if you havent paid for it yet someone will remember you of it and you quickly went and payed Of course this rule was only valid when T wasnt around T would grab something say hed pay for it and continue working When someone saw him drinking he or she asked him if hed payed for it yet Hed simply say yes For a while we all thought that T was indeed paying for them Remember we work on trust so we trusted him hed pay for them  Ohhh boy Hed pay for one alright But he drank  We continually saw him drinking from a can of Red Bull and wed all think it was the same can he paid for Meanwhile it was his d or th can At the end of the day we would find a single empty can in the trash bin and we didnt suspect a thing T got a can tell the manager he took one paid for it drank it and threw it away at the end of the day No problem right None of us wondered why he went so long with a single can  One day one of the managers looked behind the press we use for cardboard boxes we collect empty boxes and press them into a big bale that would be shipped out to a recycling company There were a shitload of empty cans there The guy who found those didnt think much of it and just reasoned it was someone who was too lazy to take the extra three steps to the trash bin Until he spotted T looking guilty and quickly turning around when he spotted the manager The manager started to berate T for not cleaning up his trash when Ts idiocy landed him his termination When asked if those cans were his note the manager still thought he had paid for them he just threw them there he quickly said hed pay for them he just hadnt come to it yet So what you havent paid for those No not yet but I forgot my wallet today Ill pay for them the next time Im here The manager couldnt really believe his ears T actually confessed to stealing those cans and was trying to get away with it by trying to pay for them afterwards Now bad luck for T a person way higher up in the ranking was present in the store He overheard the story and immediately took over He asked the same questions confirmed that T indeed took those cans without paying for them and fired him on the spot Even Ts uncle couldnt help him theft is an immediate termination of contract    The best part of this His direct boss the manager of the Flying team was glad to hear T was gone He said he received too many complaints about him to keep him working but his uncle kept his head dry Finally they got him good and we didnt have anymore of his problems    Bonus story he once asked me what I studied I study IT and he immediately jumped on the occasion to ask me some questions about his new iPhone  T So how about internet Do I have to pay for that  Me Yeah G costs money Based on your provider how much you pay changes  T Well what about WiFi  Me WiFi is free as long as you have a connection point you can use WiFi  T So I dont have to pay for it  Me Nope as long as you have WiFi  T Where do I get WiFi Like at my phone dealer  Me Possibly Usually you get WiFi with your ISP its standard on the modern modems it is where I live there are  major ISPs and both have free wifi access points built in their modems  T No no I mean on my phone  Wait what  Me WiFi is standard on your phone You dont have to pay for it At all  T Ok thanks  I have a faint feeling he still hasnt used his WiFiTLDR Its a wall of text containing  smaller stories about an idiot coworker,T stands for Tremendous idiot,120
CurvedStraightLine,82,82,1ptjvr,331,This is from my days at a craft supply store  I was a roving Acting Manager  Meaning if the actual store manager was out for a while I got to travel in and run the store for a bitI was called in for a brief stay only four days at a location during inventory while the manager was out  The store manager is showing me around the layout and comments that she has some issues with the backroom staff being on their cell phones during shifts so they are required to turn in their phones prior to clocking in and get them back afterwards  No problemMy first full day starts the backroom staff comes in  They were horribly understaffed for the backroom at this location only two people Mike and Angie  Angie was a sullen middle aged woman  Mike was young probably fresh out of high school and didnt seem like he had two brain cells to rub together  He showed up that shift out of uniform  I mean completely out of uniform  I tell him that there would be a write up  He stares at me then comments that the store manager was out he figured they werent really going to work that dayI explain to him that no were going to be running the same as ever I have the same authority as his manager and I wont take bullshit  Mike sort of slouches out of the office and I call for him to leave his cell phone behind  He drops it down onto the deskThe next day Mike is in uniform theres two cell phones on my desk and I figure were in business  I walk back to check on how the backroom inventory is coming along early in the shift and find that Mike is sitting on a box texting away on a cell phoneI immediately call him into the office and he is sitting there looking positively baffled at why he was in trouble  He left a cell phone on my desk just like I asked the fact that it was an old nonworking one shouldnt matter he was listening to my rulesAfter a moment or two I started to doubt if he was playing dumb or really that stupid  Either way it was another write up which he seemed beyond upset over  I spelled out for him that during the time he was clocked in there were to be no cell phones in his hands period  Day three we had computer issues and we couldnt get any inventory done  Computers came up later but by that point I didnt have the staffing to get everything done  I asked every single employee if they could either come in or stay longer to polish off inventory  Mike was one of the ones who agreed and asked if he could have his cell phone to let his ride know when to pick him up  As soon as he finished I took his phone back and locked it in my officeWere busy but I look around and realize Mikes no where to be found  I sort of let everyone know to look out for him and got a call that he was found in a closetI come back and hes still sitting in the closet  On his cell phone  He just sort of looks up at me confused when I open the door and says that his XBox Live account is messed up and hes working on fixing itI march him into the managers office  Turns out he had broken into the locked managers office to get his cell phone an action he thought was fine because I had given him permission to call his ride earlierIm sort of staring at him  Now I COULD fire someone insomuch as I had all the same abilities as a regular manager  But its sort of bad form to fire someone elses employees  So I tell him that I was having someone else fetch his belongings and I was going to see him out the door  I would relate this whole story to the actual store manager in the morning and it would be up to her what would happenSo I call to Angie to fetch Mikes things  Now I had never seen the two interact this whole time  I dont think I even heard Angie talk the whole time  She had just kept her head down and worked silentlyBut suddenly Angie was flying through the store crying and freaking out carrying Mikes thingsand her own  She starts ripping into me that I was picking on a boy and how I cant fire him  I say that Im not but shes in full hyperventilate mode and not listening  She says that if Im getting rid of him I was losing her too and she flings her namebadge at me and runs out of the store still weeping  Mike looked more confused than anything and followed her outThe next morning I handed over the keys to the store manager and had to explain that she basically didnt have a backroom staff anymore and I really wasnt sure why,Remember The Backroom Staff You Used to Have,413

NotTobeyMaguire,13,9,1psx7v,41,I was inspired to relate this after seeing the other similar post from earlier We always allow dogs into our NYC retail store because theyre typically either pursedogs or big friendly lugs who brighten our afternoon Unfortunately this time one of them had an accident but we only discovered it from the rank smell and the customer complaints coming from the second floor We investigate used loosely because it was instantly obvious upstairs to find that someones dog had left a soft wet stanky one on the hardwood floor and then proceeded to step in it and track it around the store It was a mess mostly concentrated around one side of the floorThankfully all of the other customers save one who was on the opposite side and said he didnt really care had left for greener pastures And let me tell you this this REEKED The only problem was there wasnt a dog in the shop all day only lots of humans Thats when it struck me it was probably a child who had the accident Whatever Its gross but it happens We figured the child left a stinker tracked it around without a care and when the parents realized what had transpired they scooped up their toddler and fled the scene of the crime fearing punishment or retaliation Not an awesome parenting method but the deed was done and there would be no way to stop someone so far after the fact considering that they were long gone from the storeSo a coworker and I closed off the floor cleaned up sanitized everything and left it at that After notifying the owner of the store we decided to request that they look at the security cameras just for a solid conclusion to the story even though nothing else could be done about it Tapes were reviewed and a couple days later we had our answerThere was never a child There was never a dog There was never an accident or a confused adult or a sick person or anything There was only a woman middleaged and rather normal looking for the neighborhood were in with a small bag full of excrement The poo bag leaves the hand bag the poop leaves the bag with a soft plop she walks it around a fair portion of the second floor with the aid of several unknowing and unsuspecting customer accomplices and then she flees the sceneIt was the perfect crimeTLDR Aint no party like a pootrail party cause a pootrail party just gets all over the place,The case of the poo of dubious origin,50

Hotdogorpolish,7,12,1psrzd,40, Hi everyone I have been reading TFR for the last year since I entered the retail world Sorry for the wall of text  I work at a certain big box store that requires a membership its located in the middle of a major US city so we get our fair share of interesting and weird members  I have been a cashier at my store for the last year and Im sure like many of I have developed a certain lines I say to the customer during each transaction such as  did you find everything alright  Or  what I say at the end of every transaction have a great daynight Well one gentlemen was in my line today and I rang him up the same as I do every other member and said have a great day Apparently he wasnt having a great day because he quickly said You didnt say thank you I was a bit shocked because I generally have a good rapport with the customers but honestly its not that surprising because many of the people who visit out store feel entitled to threat the employees like shit because they pay money to shop with us I looked at the old man and replied  I said have a good day and he replied thats not a thank you At this point I became fed up with the old man because we were extremely busy so in the most sarcastic voice I could muster I said ttthhhaaaannnkk yyyoouuu sir for shopping with us He was immediately pissed off and asked where my manager was I gladly directed him my managers know I give excellent customer service and that many of our customers are but bags All that happened was I was given a short taking too and asked what I could do better next time to which I replied nothing I tell everyone to have a nice day I guess this guy was just having a bad one   Thanks for reading I have tons more stories from work if you guys like this one ,You didnt say thank you,52

masajmarod,11,18,1pspag,28,I finally got a new job thanks for the months of entertainment that kept me sane while working my dead end retail job keeping my head up until I was able to land something better I have refrained from posting in the past mainly because I was relating to many other posts about retail jobs and work place hell This is one of my first reddit posts too  Work sucks Deal with it Everyone hates their job Be a man and appreciate the fact that you have a job in this economy and enjoy what you havedo outside of work be happy while being incredibly miserable inside  There is NSFW language mixed in here just a heads upI work at a Hobby Store in the USAHow in the hell did I MasajMarod end up working at a fucking Hobby store in a strip mall selling shit that doesnt matter That is a mystery I cannot wrap my head around I do no not like people strip malls or shit that doesnt matter  For more than three years have I taken the verbal punishment and abuse of my coworkers boss and customers I hate them all I am so glad I am getting out of this life depressing rut and a new chapter is beginning A bit of backstory since this is my first post  I did work as an automotive mechanic for two years during this timeframe so this was just a weekendseasonal job which made it much more tolerable  The shop I worked for moved locations and I left shortly after to focus on school  Sticking around at the hobby shop was purely for entertainment at this point I still help out at the shop when time allows  At first this was a place I enjoyed a unique atmosphere cool customers decent coworkers worked around my school schedule and the job was placed in my lap Having been unemployed for a few months I needed a summer job anyways  Just like any other specialty store think golfbowling proshop and the like we are experts in our field and knowledgeable in many products equipment but usually specialize in something specific  What attracted me to the job was my interest in electronics radio controlled equipment unmanned flight and the customizationfreedom the RC hobby has  Striving to be an engineer one day this job held a higher interest to me than just having owned an RC car since I was  years old  I have built an autonomous vehicle fiddled with first person view and programmed everything using a micro controller before it was cool I have since given up all RC related hobbies because this job has killed every ounce of enjoyment it once brought me Moving on  Here is my rant and warning for anyone in the lone star state wanting to fill my shoesI am the longest employed worker in my store right now I have been there for over  years and have outlasted  other employees and am on the th group of coworkers in my department I have trained most of the people in my department now and a handful of others I know the store better than most and understand how it operates very well  I have built up a reputation over the years from being associated with the previous employees and am known as a scapegoat and a black eye for the store and my department  The first three groups of coworkers sucked no one was motivated to work or show any responsibility for their actions called in frequently and smoked weed all the time Some of the guys were smart and left on their own We had an employee steal from the store and much of the blame was shifted onto me because I was still there when he quit The store owner went crazy and doubled the amount of security cameras he now has and he stripped me of my discount and store key to unlock the glass casesbathroom key I had to check the key inout with my manager until the owners investigation passed over and he realized I was not at fault During this time I had to put up with all the customers who were looking for the previous employee who also stole from them  and since I couldnt provide them with any contact info a lot of them started jumping my ass for some of the stuff that was going down I told most of those customers to piss off in a polite manner yet during this time the store received several corporate complaint phone calls etc I took most of the heat We were understaffed and no one from management would hop on the floor to help out People went as far as to write reviews online about it then come pissing and moaning to the manager about how incompetent his staff was I might of snapped once or twice due to the stress acted of of line or mouthed off to a customer because of the bad situation I was put in Even the cashiers would apologize for my rude behavior and that I must not of been on my crazy medicine WTF All the signs were there  quit and never look back Why did I put up with this for so long Subpar management customers hated me boring repetitive atmosphere I saw the importance of an education and knew this was just a part time job to get me through collegeThe reason I stayed this long was because it was an incredibly easy job and having to work around my school schedule was almost always impossible to other employers I had some new coworkers who shared my elitist mentality and witty mindset  Hell yeah I started to enjoy work again  I decided to stay The owner was planning on opening up a new store and sending me and another guy over to run it I was looking at a good raise and new job title Assistant Manager Finally my hard work was starting to pay off I thought The other guy who I was supposed to run the store with is a big stoner lives at home with his mom he is in his s and perfectly capable of being independent and he was also a jackass Smoke on the job frequently deal drugs while on the job etc Do what you want but dont shit in this shared nest of ours pal I reported it but the owner didnt bother to listen He rehired this asshat when he bailed on us last Christmas leaving me working the day after Christmas by myself That story is for another time We had a falling out and I was denied my position due to a conflict of interest with the stoner coworker Fine I would rather stay closer to home anyways I at least expected a raise or something since I was promised one I am still able to be an assistant manager here if the other douche bag is leaving Nope  Fast forward  months some quit some go to the new store and I am working roughly  hours less because of a heavier school schedule The owner gives one of the new guys a raise and promotes him to manager of my department along with another gentleman in another department WTF Okay  they are scheduled for more hours but they have been here for less than ½ the time Ive been employed so what gives At least one of the promotions was legitimate and justifiable he deserved it  the other guy doesnt lift a finger most of the day and wears slippershouse shoes to work  Time goes by  two new guys are hired Word gets out  they make considerably more than I do hmm So I go in and ask for a raise I have certainly turned around the previous bad rep I had previously and earned the raise I was asking for Not only was I denied but I was belittled about what little I bring to the company LOL right  Got it I was going to ride this out until the year was over but not anymore Thankfully I have been networking with others to seek employment dedicating more time to school and focusing on what is important The job is mindless and numb to me now  Ill be on autopilot and doing the bare minimum until my two weeks is upI have considering going out with a bang no call no showing or just straight up quitting midshift during a busy Saturday  Perhaps even halfbaked style if they push too many buttons I have enough work experience to not even write this one down on a resume while burning the bridge and flipping the bird Realistically speaking  theyll be screwed without me there this holiday season and that is plenty enough satisfaction for me Removing the slave tunic off my back bandaging my wounds and whip marks then waltzing out the front door is something I am looking forward too  TldrI have the most education experience knowledge and highest level of seniority at my retail job but none of that is worth jack shit to the owner  Learned some life lessons got a new higher paying job more related to my field of study ,I have put myself on auto pilot until my two weeks expire Lengthy rant,46

Scratchums,24,59,1pry8t,179,So I work at a clothing store pretty well known brand which has a unisex fitting room  I was on duty there unlocking doors taking unwanted items processing them etc  In one stall we had a mother and her young son maybe  and in the next one an older lady maybe mids  Its a Saturday so its pretty busy  There are maybe  other stalls occupied tooSuddenly I hear Oh god theres pee all overAnd all I could think to say was Wha  Because the restrooms are literally also in the fitting room  And these two stalls happen to be next to the restroom  This cry however was coming from a fitting room stallThe woman and son run out of the first stall and the kid is going bananas  I peek in and yep somehow there is pee on the floor seeping in from the next stall  People are staring at me  Ive only been working here for a few days  Ive plenty of customer service experience but Ive never had someone pee on another person So I knock on the second stallUmm maam  Are you all right in thereI glance under the stall and her feet are moving but shes saying nothing and the woman and especially the kid are going bananas so I use my walkie talkie to call for a manager and step outside for a sec  The first thing the manager asks is Well is she dead or something  What no shes moving  Things are getting awkward thoughAnd when I got back the door to stall two opened  The mother the loud son and several customers are watching her and she proclaims to all around her Yes  I admit it I had an accident  But that is no reason to scream and panic and treat me like less than a human being  Yall dont know me  My name is redacted and Im from other state Im not even from here  Sir I will clean my own mess if you would get me the supplies  I told her that wasnt necessary a manager was on his way and hed already volunteered to clean it  Unfortunately she insisted and stuck around  The mother and son decided it was a great time to yell at the woman kid first  She got pee on me  over and over and over again  After a very awkward Yall dont know me sort of confrontation she made her way to the front of the store near checkout and began flailing around  Eventually police were called and demands were made for the woman to be arrested but I dont believe anything really came of it except maybe some Maam Im gonna have to ask you to calm down because the lady was still with us at the time in the fitting roomI kept my cool  I have a respectable poker face and can remain neutral in retail horror but what escalated it was how the lady was totally unapologetic  Obviously she didnt mean to pee in a fitting room and certainly not on someone elses kid and maybe some people can forgive that because shes right they didnt know her or her problems but she went from embarrassed to indignant very quickly  The peak was definitely emerging from the stall with arms outstretched as if to say Yes my children  I am the piss messiah  Look upon me and know me,She got pee on me,238
ginabeena,53,58,1prohx,255,Okay yesterday was Friday so it was pretty busy but I had a short four hour shift so it wasnt all too bad for me Except all of our main registers were being used to I hopped on one of the back registersWhere I work the farther way the register is from the front door the longer the line is I will never understand that logic but whatever I was on a register pretty close to the door so even though we were super busy I had yet to ring anyone out in the first thirty minutes so I was just cleaningMy supervisor asked me to move to register  to help the line at the Speedy Checkouts down The most hated register because everyone just stops there no matter whatI didnt turn my light on and I called a lady over from another line She only had two things so another lady gets in line behind her Lady  tells Lady  that I wasnt open but Lady  continues to put her stuff on my belt anywayWell the first thing I scanned asked for a serial number It didnt have a serial number so I had to wait for a supervisor to come override it Lady  huffed and puffed while Lady  apologized The second thing rung up and the lady said the sign said it was about  cheaper than what it was ringing so I call my supervisor over and she calls the department it was from and we wait Lady  goes Oh my god Cant you just skip herWell I couldbut I was tired of Lady  so I say No but there are plenty of other registers open with no line She replies But I already put my stuff upWe wait some moreLady  moves one register upThe person from the department brings the thing up that Lady  confused the price with Lady  is done Lady  turns around and gives me the most shockeddisgusted face Like if looks could kill I would be deadLady s transaction probably took  minutes at most,Entitled Customer,313

EndlessNerd,11,25,1pqgsf,131,A few years ago at the hobby shop an older gentleman and his grandson come into the store  The boy had saved up money over the summer and wanted to buy a radio controlled car or boat  After showing them a few items they decided on a higher end brushless racing boat and two expensive lipo batteries  They purchased with a credit card and leftPretty straight forward right  A week or so later a couple come into the store with the boat and the batteries wanting to return them  It was still wet from being sunk  The boy had wrecked and sank the boat and they left it under water for a few days before pulling it up  The parents first argued that it was defective which we werent buying  We told them wed be happy to call the manufacturer for them to help them get replacement parts as the company had a pretty good customer service  They werent interested  They just wanted to return everything  We again explained that we dont take back used items the return policy is printed right on the receipt  They reasoned that the boy shouldnt have bought the boat that the grandfather had talked him into it but it was a bad idea and they wanted their money back  After a final refusal and offer to help fix it from the manager they left  About a week later we get a call from the bank  The couple had initiated a charge back claiming we sold them a defective product or the like  The bank was actually pretty cool about it they talked to the boss a bit and he faxed over the receipts and return policies and explained to them that we obviously cant take back used lipo batteries that had been submerged in water and if there was something wrong with the boat they should have brought it back to us straight away not played with it until it sank  In the end we won the dispute but it was a pain in the ass  TLDR   Boy and Grandad buy expensive boat parents want to return it after its been sunk because they think the Grandad forced the boy to buy the boat,He shouldnt have bought it so we want our money back,156

RedRing,87,288,1pq91s,990,Hello again TFR  Yesterday I posted about the one day I completely lost my cool and went super saiyan  Wall of text in comingBackground again just in case  I worked at a game reselling store that was connected to a movie rental place  It was one of and will probably be the best job I had  Started there on my th birthday had to be  and was basically and for a short time was managing it on and off Alright so at my store I had tons of regulars and got to know them pretty well  Some of them became a family away from my actual and my work family  Even today some  years later I still see them and we talk like we saw each other just yesterday  There was one customer named jason who came in often with his grandma  He never bought anything and was just happy looking  If he did ask to buy something his grandma said it would be too hard for him  He would talk to me from time to time and tell me about his sonic game and how he loved to play it but had beat it numerous time sonic  on genesis  I always thought if he could play that then surely anything he looked at on ps was going to be just fine  One day his grandma pulls me to the side Gma We come in here a lot and jason has decided to call you a friendMe Thats good  Hes a really good kid and I enjoy him coming inGma I notice you never asked why we never buy anything and I respect that  Jason has autism so the games are just to hard for him to learn the controlsMe Oh I see  Well I wont say anything to him about it and you know you guys are always welcome in here and we will help as much as we canFast forward a couple of weeks on a monday afternoon where  we are usually dead as all get out  Day before game releases were very calm  I only needed one other person and they were already on the clock when in comes jason and his grandma  They look around and jason sees a game that he wants more than anything Ive ever seen him look at  Legend of spyro for the PS  His grandma told him it would be way to hard  The look on his face when she said that pulled on every heart string I hadI pulled his grandma to the side while he looked at the game and asked how long they thought they would be in the store  She said until she got tired and then they would go grocery shopping at the store at the end of our strip  So I ask if I can put the game into the demo unit  She was hesitant at first but decided to go ahead and let him  About an half hour into the game he is starting to get upset and she starts to get tired I put my office chair near her to sit down and start talking to jason and kinda walking him through how to play  Another hour goes by and he is getting the hang of it but she decides to go shopping  I convince her to let him stay and pick him up whenever she is done which she agrees to do  He is loving the game and I can see it  He has a look on his face Ive seen all to many times  While he is playing I tell my coworker to leave him alone and Ill be right back  I walk over to the grocery store and find her  I ask her if she has any problems with him getting the game  She says she doesnt really want to buy the game if he cant play it  I ask again and she gives the same answer so I tell her not to worry about that Ill take care of it  She agrees although hesitantlyI go back to the store and look up the barcode for the memory card he is using and the one for his game and ring them up  Use my extra store credit from my old non employee account I never was bothered to put on a gift card and finalize everything  She comes in and he gets really sad that he has to end the game  I go to turn it off and when I do I eject the game take the memory card out and put them together in the case with the receipt  He doesnt understand at first and starts to put the game back on the case so I go out from around the counter and tell him to open the game case  In that second I see the happiest expression I have ever seen  He runs to his grandma who is now visibly choked up about it and shows her  She is speechless but manages to say Thats amazing jason  He walks over to me and says Thank you redring I will beat this game just like you showed me  He then gave me a hug which made his grandma and I break out into tears  She takes him out of the store and they left  Later that night I get a call from her saying he has been playing the game all night  hours if I recall and is loving it  I explain how happy I am and tell her if it gets to be too much to bring the game in and we can switch it out or I can show him how to progress through that part   About  weeks later he came in and bought the second game and apparently had been doing extra chores to be able to buy it  I see them every now and then  Jason has been doing a lot better in school lately and is still gaming  Gaming has allowed him to make connections and friendship with people  He always is happy to see me and always gives me a high five and sometimes still a hug  This kid is honestly the best thing to come out of retail for me so far and I am so happy to have worked that day with him  To watch him go from the  year old who couldnt really play any games to a kid who is now understanding just about any game you put in front of him  To see how that experience made something where he could relate learning with his autism and make it basically non existent now  Every year I get a Christmas card from his grandmother and him and every time I am told what game his is playing and its always got something about spyro on it even if its just the picture of spyro sitting on their fireplace  They go in my bank lock box so that nothing happens to themTLDR I hate to do this for this one because it means so much to me  I help a kid and he changes my life,One of the best days Ive ever had,1278

Teslok,43,23,1pp2qg,78,Once upon a time in a land far away from my current domicile I worked at a small MomnPop style video rental store in the days where clunky stinky VHS cassettes were slowly vanishing to be replaced by shiny plastic DVDs  I was in a period of unending transition in my s still living with the parents if wed had a basement it would have been my domain and with no prospects of ever finding my way out of this miserable situation spoiler I got out  I was in debt up to my eyeballs from a useless certificate program my car was such a rolling wreck that I should probably post its tale of woe to rtalesfromsadcars and I was raised with all of the bad financial habits associated with poor parents who are determined to remain poor and keep their children poor  The one thing I had going for me at this point I had the kind of work ethic that brought me crawling into the store with raging fevers hacking coughs and aching misery  At any time any of my coworkers could call and say Teslok we need you and I was there so long as I had my car or someone to drop me off  I was the magical shiftcovering genie  For the most part I loved that job  Ive mentioned it from time to time in comments here and there  It was familyowned the manager made it clear from the start that she had my back if there were any problems and I was good at building a rapport with our regulars  I knew them their lives their families they came to chat about their days they came to rent movies they came to ask me what I thought of the latest new releases  Our renters were our neighbors Wed run into them at the grocery store wed bump into them at the library it was a small town and we were at times a hopping place  But I was too available  I did not know how to say no and frankly I was all too aware I shouldnt because I was perpetually broke  The most shining example of me being too available came one overcast morning on one of my rare days off  I was babysitting my youngest sibling just me and him in the house  The parents were at workMom took my carand the other siblings were at school  And I get a phone call  gt Manager Teslok I need you to take over at the store  gt Teslok Mom took my car today I cant get in  gt Manager I know Im on my way to pick you up now I should be there in a few minutes   So I got dressed was bumming around in PJs and got my brother dressed he was a regular fixture at the store from the time he could walk packed up toddler snacks and locked up the house  I wish I could say that this incident taught me to learn to say no to stand up for my day off but nope  That lesson came much later long after I was out of retail  I remember thinking at the time You know I should be bothered by this That she assumed that Id be OK with this to the point that by the time she called she was already driving to my house  But I wasnt bothered at the time  Just bothered that I wasnt bothered  TLDR  Agent Teslok your mission should you choose to accept it Wait  Forget choosing  Were on our way right now,The Perils of Being Too Available,101

butwhyisititchy,49,94,1porcp,438,So not retail but a good customer story nonetheless I worked for a large national health insurance company for a few years doing customer service and in that time I spoke to a lot ofuh special people One day I got a call from a gentleman who was getting a bill from his doctor and wanted to know why we didnt pay it Well the doctor was not in our network so when that happens we give the customer the option of having payment sent directly to them instead of their doctor since they often have to pay up front for services I checked his claim and sure enough we had already paid him in full for this bill It was somewhere around  He said he had never received the check so I looked and it had been cashed a few months back I looked at the image of the cashed check and told him his signature was on it and it had been cashed I told him if he didnt cash it I could initiate a checkfraud investigation for him As usual though I was pretty certain he had cashed the check and just didnt remember This is the case  of time Finally he realized he did in fact cash that check He didnt know that it was intended to pay that bill though and had spent the money on other things Now I feel like I should mention that the checks are sent with a copy of the claim showing exactly what dates and services the check is for But surehe had no idea Thats fine Im thinking now that he realizes what happened this call is done and I can go home call came in  minutes before my shift was overlove that But no He then asked if I would be RESENDING a check for that amount to pay this bill What Um no sir we already paid for this You received the money Thats it for us Him well yes but I spent that money already and still have this bill to pay You need to pay this bill Youre my insurance company I was literally speechless for a moment Wtf kind of logic is this I was on the phone with him for an HOUR going back and forth trying to get through his head that this makes less than zero sense People boggle my mind sometimes Tldr dude thinks we should pay his claim twice because the first time we paid it he used the money on other shit,No we wont pay you twice because you spent the first check by accident,532

frankiethestreetlamp,10,14,1pocj4,35,Hi TFR All you lovely sullen and generally over it people have provided me with such entertaining stories its about time I contribute at least a little bit I work at a well known electronics retailer in a rural town Im talking farms rural but weve got a decent university and a famousish race track so the town itself is quite large and has all walks of life Which means all sorts of crazy too This story is from about two years ago but stands out as one of the douchiest customers Ive ever met On a late night shopping shift deep into the absolutely pointless to be still open period I was shuffling around the shop putting stock away while the manager on duty absolutely awesome guy henceforth known as AAG was fixing some window promo fittings near the front entrance At this point there was an internet kiosk out the front of the store maybe  metres awayWed also just gotten in a large and impressively flashy sound system that was playing a few metres into the store facing out to the shopping centre Now were always careful to keep these to a fairly low volume but understandably customers turn it up from time to time This was not one of those times Its also worth pointing out that on top of terrible hearing I get a lot of ear infections and am usually half deaf at any given point So this middle aged guy walks in he seemed calm enough and I asked him how I could help Well call him Douchenozzle or DNDN what he actually said I was at the internet kiosk and that bass is really disturbing What I heard that place is really disturbing So I chuckled thinking it was a joke Woops He immediately goes bright red and rips into me about how he was trying to do important things and kids like me will ruin our ears with music that loud and HOW DARE I LAUGH AT HIM etc etc I was trying to cut in to say I misheard AAG had overheard and came over to save my assThe guy is a bit calmer talking to a huge bald bearded man AAG generally looks like a bikie minus the tattoos and eventually leaves while AAG turns the volume down to minimum and gets back to what hes doing in the window I opened my mouth to explain what happened to AAG when he tells me to wait a moment pulls out his phone and turns the volume up over the network while DN stalks off He hears it Stops Looks around Nobody near the sound system Oh the joys of technology and awesome managersI have a few other stories some involving my lack of great hearing some involving outright crazy and a lot involving petty revenge but mostly just Im a farmer who didnt bother to research anything spend  hours walking me through it again and again and I know more than you because I have a penis And a lot of idiots excoworkers and customers alike,Im sorry you couldnt browse your porn in public in peace sir,49
deleted,2,10,1po8wt,25,During my once in a blue moon shopping spree at my local low price hardware store You know the one that has cheap tools free flashlights ect I got the joy of being behind a customer that couldnt read policy on returnsThe guy was arguing with the clerk about how he should just be able to get cash back since he had his reciept The clerk told him that it is against policy to just give cash back he could refund the money to the card however This customer kept going on while the clerk kept calm After about five min or so the customer caved in and just whipped out the card and bought the other stuff he needed instead Upon leaving I heard the guy say I will call your corporate office and make a complaint about youI looked at the clerk and said I bet he doesnt even know how to dail a phone The clerk laughed and we chatted a bit on the kind of crazy customers we get at our jobsBefore I finished I asked him what were they supposed to try and sell as a check out challenge and if they got credit for warranties Once he told me I bought about four of their check out and got the bestlongest warranty they offered I told him as I was leaving Hopefully that makes up for the jackass you dealt with before me dont let that kind of shit get to you because there are good people left in this world,Dont let that guy get under your skin hes done the same thing at my job,35
Dis,27,15,1po3w4,47,The bookstore that I happen to work at is near an entrance in what is basically THE mall in the town I live in  It is the closest thing to culture that we have  and while it is normally hellish enough on the weekends its sometimes downright dead during the week The mall normally holds a Halloween Trick or Treat event that has the stores pass out a fair amount of candy to a fair amount of children  Usually a decent turnout and the mall hosts what is a nice event for somewhere just under  young kids in cute costumesWell tonight it stormed like a bitch and thus Halloween night is essentially cancelled for the night for all of the kiddies in the area   If only there were an enclosed space in which the brats could all beg in a mumbling manner for candyWell as it turns out EVERY parent  as well as for some reason a handful of ridiculous teenagers  got the same idea and turned out to the mall to badger the shops into giving their children candy   This had become so very huge that when I walked into work I was immediately told that I was in charge of handing out candy to the children   Going to the mall side entrance of the store I stood next to a co worker who had already been there and began handing out candy  I was under the impression that he would be joining me   Uh as it turns out that wasnt fucking happeningHe disappeared sometime after he got a refill on the candy and I was left alone a few times when I was out of candy and had to handle telling children and their parents that I had run out   Most people were pleasant about this rather reasonable set back but then there was the minority of smegma who rolled their eyes and had the nerve to expect something out of the charity that a business is giving to their children  Well you guys should have expected this turn out with it raining outsideThirty minutes in  my co worker who had been sent out for a candy run to the ridiculously over priced boutique in the mall was no where to be seen and in a surreal way that youd think that youd only see in a movie like Brazil the line of children who were waiting for a single piece of friggin candy stretched allllllll the long way down the hallway that separated the book store on one side to the coffee shop and the rotunda  Holy Christ you would have needed to see it to believe the amount of twoyear olds in cheap princess dresses and boys wearing offbrand Scream masks to know what a sheer childrenorientated panic feels like  I believe that this must be a good deal what it is like before and after Christmas Day for a BuildaBear employee  Christ are people who work with kids on a day to day basis much more patient than I will ever be   My coworker returned some time later with  worth of candy that came directly from out of my managers pocket   It was small fruitflavored tootsierolls that I was instructed to give no more than one to every kid   This later got supplemented with Halloweenthemed stickers and temporary tattoos   This unbelievably ran out an hour and fifteen minutes into what was supposed to be a two hour long event with all of the children in attendance doing nothing more than standing in the sort of line that would only be normal for a Harry Potter midnight release  Not for a single Piece Of Candy  or two stickerstemporary tattoos   Thankfully the unchangingly looooonnnggg line of people dissipated with little grumbling  although almost none actually went into the store to at least browse  They took their candy and left leaving the store a complete ghost town by the time I got back to my actual work for the nightWas it worth it  Well for a child hater like me I was overwhelmingly surprised at the good manners of most of the children in attendance  a lot of warm smiles Happy Halloweens and thankyous  and the most trouble that I got was from parents who thought that a good Halloween memory for their children is to have them stand in line for a single piece of candy handed out by a sweating nervous book store employee  I loved seeing the homemade costumes but I kept a mental count of Minecraft costumes that came with big cardboardbox heads at a magnificent four with children dressed in the trademark scraggly beard and camo cap of some cast member from the TV show Duck Dynasty at a strange ten The extra buckets that some adults thrusted at me as I tried to give each kid attention made me want to breath fire on the entire event  some of them at least had the grace to mutter something to me about a phantom sick child who was unable to attend the eventThe moral of the story  do not depend on a mall to give your child all of his Halloween candy  Its unfair to both your children and to the stores who have to waste time and money distributing it to them  If its storming bad on Halloween maybe just buy them a shit ton of candy and stay somewhere warm with themFun fact  later that night a group of adults and a twoyear old that had gone into the childrens section and later on the mother of the twoyear old rushed up to me holding her squalling child asking me where the nearest restroom was  As I was telling her about the stores restrooms I realized that the child was fucking bleeding from out of her lower lip in a steady stream  As she walked away I could hear the woman scolding the child about freaking out when she had hurt herself  Later on the night I saw the group leaving deep in conversation over the prerequisites for their insurance company on getting stitches at a hospitalTLDR Now why wouldnt you just read my Halloween story if youve bothered to click on it at all  Really   Well alright Sometimes parents look at the decision to skip Trick or Treating and the danger of pneumonia and decide that standing in a looping nightmarish line for a single piece of candy is the logical decision to make  BONUS  tonight a woman learned that a wounded child will squall  I dont see that kid getting any stitches any time soon even if she needs them,What Happens on a Rainy Halloween Night in my Workplace Apparently  WalloText Edition,62

RetailQueen,9,6,1pntzc,39,Seriously this past weekend I worked doubles everyday and came in for  girls who called in sick Then yesterday my boss needs to have a talk with me because I answered the phone which has been ringing for a good  minutes while a customer was looking through her purse for a receipt It just makes no sense to me Apparently I can skip work and not get in trouble but answer a phone and the world ends ,Im the only person at my job who does anything and I get yelled at for the most stupid things,45
GraySparrow,27,39,1pni7r,181,For a vast majority of the time I do enjoy my job and since Ive come to the USA almost everyone has been friendly and welcoming  often customers will compliment my accent and make pleasant small talk with me at the cash register that I enjoy very muchAnyway as many of you probably know nowandagain a customers bank card may be denied Maybe their money hasnt gone through yet maybe theres a problem at the bank who knows Occasionally it is just our crappy machines so when a card is denied and the money not taken from it I can try it again Our card readers are not hooked up to the old registers so we have to swipe the cards for the customersThe other day an angry old lady made some purchases I swipe her card it is denied I inform her thus but say I will try again I try again I try again Shes one of those awful people who blame you as if youre deliberately trying to shame herThere is money on it Well make it work It cant be denied etc etcEventually she pays through some other method I wish her well She leaves Think nothing more of it Until a few days later My lovely not sarcastic shes wonderful coworker pulls me aside to inform me that an angry old woman has just been in to bitch to her about how the little foreigner broke her credit cardIve not had much xenophobia here but identifying me like that hurt Mostly because Im beginning to be known in the area and the foreigner who works at suchastore is easily identifiable as me and I like to think Im a decent worker not someone who harasses old ladies by destroying their credit cards whether theyre nasty bitches or notI didnt break your card lady I havent broken anyones card I apologise for not using my foreign magical powers to stop your bank card being declined,The foreigner broke my credit card,220
Sasuke,9,12,1pngrr,10,This is a story that my friend told me that happened to her when she used to work in an adult shop So about  months ago she was just checking the cash register and stock when a female customer walked in Now I dont want this to sound sexist but every female customer my friend encountered in the store was a lesbian And in this case it was a lesbian She walks up to the counter and asks What kind of strap ons do you have My friend tells her the different kinds they have and she picks one and buys it But after the purchase this was asked So are you a lesbian  Um No Im not a lesbian  Oh well thats too bad because I wouldve asked you to come over then we wouldve had some fun together then she leaves the store My friend had encountered some weird people but none of them ever said anything like this,Um No thanks,22

kquatro,9,18,1pneit,73,Hello TFR This is my first time posing here Normally Im reading the stories all you people have to offer I think its about time I share what happened to me last Friday TLDR at the bottom Background  I work at local pharmacy in town Im  and been working here for  years Its your typical momamppop store We offer cards candy toys gifts along with various OTC products and our retail compounding and nursing home pharmacy So lets just say I get all walks of like coming into my store may it be local doctors to the local homeless guy that rides his bike around town It doesnt matter who you are or what drug youre taking Im going to treat you with respect while keeping a smile on my face Story So its around PM and both my other clerks went to lunch at the same time I dont know why normally we try and have  clerks together at all times because we get swamped with customers so its just me my tech and my pharmacist upstairs Everyone else is in the basement Whatever Im used to it I can run this pharmacy with a blindfolded if I had to But today wasnt my day weve all had off days I could feel it One of my clerks and I joke around saying whenever she goes to lunch I always get the bad apples The ones who want to get in my face because their insurance wont cover all the RX so they have to pay a  co pay Shit I even had a regular get mad at me for some stupid ass reason because her insurance actually PAID for her RX so instead of a  co pay it was like  or something ridiculous But this day was different My pharmacist is on the phone with a doctor and my tech is stuck on the phone with an insurance company trying to get a claim to go thru Ive got a line of  customers Im helping and  more coming in the door plus  others that are ready to be helped As most of you know after working a business for a while you start to get to know people by their first names and on a personal basis  of the customers in line know me and know how hard I work and were fine waiting Fast forward I have one of the RXs ready for a waiter I politely tell the people that just came to the counter I have to help this customer st because shes been waiting I ring her up and she asks for an insurance claim form OK I ring up my other waiter just picking up a special order quick and easy then run behind the counter to print out the paper work we dont have access to certain programs on our clerk computerI should point out all of this is being taken care of in less than  minutes All while this lady I havent helped yet in GLARING at me I could feel her eyes burning into my little soul and it was making me uncomfortable My pharmacist was FINALLY off the phone so I had her call someone up from the basement to help take care of customers My tech would help but he is STILL on the phone Whatever Im doing the best I can While shes doing that I get the claim printed and signed and handed it off to the customer who thanked me and told me I was doing a great job considering all the work I was doing As I was finishing  helping her my coworker comes up but its one of our new girls who hasnt learned how to use the cash register yet The lady who was staring me down like the Eye of Sauron just burning into my soul saw her come up and didnt help her she lost her shit ARE YOU SERIOUS ARE YOU SERIOUS THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE I CANT BELIEVE THIS Again its probably been  minutes total shes had to wait now I finished with my previous customer and went to take care of her and she kept spewing the diarrhea out of her mouth saying how terrible Im doing and IS THAT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO PRINT A CLAIM FORM st of all bitch there was an update on the system so things changed a little bit so Im sorry it took  whole minute for me to print it off  I try and defuse the situation by apologizing telling her Im the only clerk and Im doing the best I can considering there is only so much I can do when my other clerks are at lunch As she was yelling and I was bagging her shit up my coworker comes up to help the other customers Cool Shes still yelling and making a scene and Im still apologizing profusely while still telling her Im doing the best I can maam Im sorry I think I even said what more do you want from me but I cant be sure I was so overwhelmed Im a young female and Im working on standing my ground and not letting people disrespect me I suffer from anxietypanic attacks so when people get in my face like that in front of other people I get upset but I try not to show it By the end of the transaction I was shaking because my anxiety just shot thru the roof I couldnt even look my other customers in the eyes I was so embarrassed Thankfully they all understood and thought the lady was a total bitch and was out of line and I was doing a great job The icing on the cake though was when I handed her the bag of stuff she looked at me and said youre doing a good job What The Fuck I didnt even tell her to have a good day like I would any other customer that has a douche attitude  I had to go into the back of the pharmacy and catch my breath because I couldnt breathe then I started having a panic attack then came the water works so I went to the basement to cool off  Of course my coworker who clerks with me all time saw me all upset and asked kquatro whats wrong I explain the situation to her and she told me I should have called her up and she would have taken care of the puta but it was her lunch break shes pregnant and I wanted to her to relax I should have called her up though she doesnt take shit from no one Thankfully  I didnt get in trouble I was told I handled the situation the best I could considering After all was said and done I cleaned up went back to work and moved on I keep going over the situation in my head thinking of better ways I could have dealt with her and her stanky attitude but its a learning experience I guess Fuck people like that I understand some people have bad days or you have to wait in like a few minutes longer than you were hoping but that doesnt give you the right to be so fucking disrespectful In the end people will do what they want and you cant change them you can only kill them with kindness TLDR Older lady had to wait  minutes before being helped was a complete bitch to me and put me down in front of regular customers and coworkers FUCK people like that  edit grammar,Im doing the best I can maam Im sorry,91

lifelessMe Okay Mr Walker Did anybody press the police button on the panelMW Yeah my wife I mean I must have leaned against it or somethinSHUTUP sorry damn dog Yeah so I guess I leaned on it The police arent coming out here rightMe No sir there is no dispatch being made So the system is working just fine then There are no issues todayMW Well the system isnt really working right I guess since it tried to have the police come outNow Im going to pause the story right here This is the point where things started gettingwell weird Please understand I did NOT know what was going on entirely until the next day I was suspicious but everyone in the office thought I was making things up Looking back it seems so obvious The next voice will be titled The Wife or TW I could barely make out what was being said It took at least three replays of the call to get everything entirely TW Help me PLEASE NO PLEASE HELP MEMW I need to make sure the system doesnt send out the police I cant have that happening Can you have somebody look at the system and CAN YOU CUT IT OUT IM ON THE PHONE  sorry about that This dog is driving me crazy Anyways I do need somebody to check the system When can you

have him listen to the call I was really put off by the call and didnt know if I should call the police or just let it go The whole time speaking to him it just felt off My manager passed it off as a normal guy watching a movie in the background dealing with an annoying dog Anybody I told didnt believe me Then the next day happened The technician showed up to the home to find it swarmed with police an ambulance and the fire department The technician was able to get an idea of what happened from a police officer there Essentially Mr Walker and his wife had a serious fight and he snapped He beat her severely then killed her with an ax She tried to have the police sent out by pressing the emergency police button on her panel but because the husband answered the phone when the monitoring station called there was nothing we could do He tried to cut her up and dispose of her but a neighbor noticed him CARRYING AN ARM out back They called the police and found the husband trying to bury her in the back yard This was easily the worst moment in my entire career I know there was no chance to save this woman or prevent any of it from happening Thats not what bothers me Its the fact that I didnt even think that another human being could be capable of brutally beating and then killing his wife while on the phone with a stranger It really makes you think So please if you seehearfeel off about something say something You could be saving somebodys life I hope I was able to provide something to everyone that reads this story Whether its the realization of human capability knowing that saying something can help or youre just twisted and wanted a good story to read I do hope you take something from this story Thank you all for reading Take care and be safe Happy HalloweenTLDR Trust me guys youre going to want to read this oneEDIT It seems some people dont understand procedure for police dispatch in the alarm industry I will break it down for you Alarm sounds  Monitoring station calls the home  Husband answers says its a false alarm gives password  Monitoring station cancels dispatchI had nothing to do with the dispatch I was there to try and set service to for the guy As the conversation progressed more and more things started to raise little red flags It wasnt until the next day that I had realized what all those red flags were pointing too I could barely hear the woman on the phone It took multiple listens to the call and full volume to even begin to understand what was being said by the wife There is NOTHING that could have been done by ANYONE in my company or the monitoring station that could have changed the outcome Feel free to keep debating that though,NSFWishThe story youve been waiting for or I Listened To Her Die,444
NejKidd,27,35,1pn89g,122,I now work in a supermarket but for a season I worked in a chain hotel  Not strictly retail but we had a product to sell and customers and various different stories from it but first I want to introduce the people I worked withBackground I was a receptionist in an understaffed hotel reception which was attached to a large restaurant  Although the hotel made the most money by far the restaurant was the place that the managers focussed all their attention on and as a result the receptionists were often the only member of staff to cater to every whim of any guest in the hotel  which was a feat of endurance considering there were  rooms each of which could hold up to  adults  A tantrum from one could be disastrousThe management were too cheap to employ the correct number of staff  a hotel our size by company regulations needed an absolute minimum of  receptionists and  night porters to run smoothly  We had  receptionists and  night portersThe  receptionists were all female  Our head receptionist was a lady Ill call Dolly  Then we had Beth who was older than the earth and had been there since the first dawn  She liked to chatter to everyone and it wasnt unusual for her to not have time for half of her duties before her shift was over  Kim was new and very slow at everything she did  Where I picked up stuff nd or rd try average she would need prompting on her th or th go at a task  Then the worst colleague ever MeganMegan was a small town girl  I dont mean those sweet naive smalltown girl I mean one of those who saw every man as a meal ticket and every woman as competition  She was married at  divorced with  kids at  and when I left she was  she was pregnant with number  which she didnt know if it was her exhusbands her newest boyfriends or perhaps the guy shed also been sleeping with the week those two overlapped  I was a year younger with an acceptance to a good university the year after and been accepted into a job in another country which began at the end of the season  People told me her attitude toward me was because she was jealous  I have no idea but the facts do make a good case for itBut enough ranting  On to the storyWe had three shifts in the day am to pm pm to pm and pm to am night porter shift  We also had a pretty retarded system where even though we had  tills and paypoints we had only  till draw  We didnt often have people paying by cash so it was rare wed open it  But we still had to count it out and in every shiftAlso to sign out we had to take note of every single penny we took in cash on our paypoint in the day  As you tried to log out at the end of your shift youd have to enter in the exact amount of money youd taken  If you were out by even a penny it would refuse to let you log out  You then had to go across to the restaurant get the manager to look at their system to see how you went wrong then track back to the reception to log out properlyBecause of this system and the managers being idiots it wasnt unusual for me to leave work up to  hours late  This is why I loved being on morning shiftThis one particular day I had been my normal efficient self and done all the morning things and Megan who had bitched to managers about the weird hours and not being able to see her children so theyd altered the timetable just for her so she worked midday to pm  So for the last  hours of my shift I had to deal with her sitting and chatting to all the guests instead of doing the work shed been set telling me loudly and obnoxiously how to do stuff while I was already doing it and texting under the counter  At pm my relief came in Kim  I signed out an hour late because Megan kept being a bitch about me signing out  have I done this have I done that where is this piece of paper why have I done that  READ THE FUCKING HANDOVER SHEET NOTES I JUST PUT IN YOUR FUCKING HAND YOU TOTAL WASTE OF SPACE  Ahem  Where was I  So I signed out an hour late and as I was literally on my way out of the door I saw that both Megan and Kim were occupied with customers and Kim was floundering while the guest trying to check in was getting frustrated and Megan was ignoring them both  I stepped in and took over the check in making sure to show Kim everything I was doing again and in the transaction the guest gave a  note for which I gave both  notes in the till draw as change  No problem crisis averted I swiped out and left the premises  It should be noted here that I live an hour away so to get to the shift at am I had to wake at am and if I left at pm it was now pm and I was exhaustedThe moment I stepped in the door the phone rang and the conversation went like thisgt Me Hellogt Megan You took  from the till  Where have you put itgt Me Sorry I havent taken any money from the till  Whats happenedgt Megan Theres  missing from the drawer and weve looked everywhere do you know where its gonegt Me No I have no idea  I left more than an hour ago so I couldnt have done anything  Are you sure you looked everywheregt Megan practically screaming down the phone NO It had to be you  When I came in there was  in the till it was there the entire time until you left and now its missing  You have to know what happened to itgt The phone crackles and suddenly theres another voice on the line its the General Manager who I shall call Chiefgt Chief Hi NejKidd  Were a little bit rushed down here but Megan says there was  in the till before you left and were not accusing you of anything but perhaps it fell into your bag or something gt Me naively checking my bag and internally panicking  No theres nothing here I havent got a clue where it went the till balanced perfectly before I leftgt Chief Okay well keep looking here but if you do find it please just call usShe puts down the phone and immediately Im panicking  What if Megan took it and hid it to pin it on me and make sure that Id get fired this time  Shed recently tried to pin various other fuck ups of her own on me so this was just another in a long line of issues I had with her  Obviously its the one I remember the mostI went to bed and at pm Id still heard nothing so I rang up work to see if anything had come of it  By that time both Chief and Megan had left but Kim was still there  She was surprised I even rang backgt Kim Oh they found it  It was there all the timegt Me What Howgt Kim They counted the till  You know that  note you took for me  Well Megan had looked in the till before I came in and saw there were two  notes and when I went to count it after the handover she saw that the two  notes were gone and went to get Chief before taking the office apart and then eventually phoning you  Then they counted the till and found it was balanced just that Megan hadnt seen you give the  notes as changeSo basically Megan and Chief had accused me of stealing money from the till without even checking to see if the money was actually still in the till  To make matters worse they hadnt even bothered to phone me to apologisetell me everything was okayAfter that whenever I handed over to Megan I made sure I sat down with her and painstakingly went over everything I had done that morning even when she got bored I would explain everything I did just to make the pointTlDr Raging banshee likes to accuse me of stealing before finding out that nothing is missing,The worst coworker Ive ever met Tales from a Hotel,157
Megsout,38,32,1pn7uc,131,Hey guys Im so upset I just had to post on here My sister has worked at a certain highend retail store that sells kitchen and food items for a number of years Today was her day off until she unexpectedly received a call on our home phone which was provided as an emergency contact number by her manager It turns out her manager had a spurofthemoment doctors appointment at PM and no one else could come in and cover for her My sister explained that because today was her day off she had made other plans Now its important to note that my sister suffers from selfesteem and confidence issues so she has a hard time standing up for herself Following the explanation her manager proceeded to bully her into covering her shift and work till closing I know this doesnt seem like that big of a deal but her manager has done this numerous times once even forcing my sister to work open to close and then open the following day She also told my sister she couldnt request any time off this month because they are shortstaffed but them proceeded to allow another employee to take a day vacation Im upset because we had planned to carve pumpkins together for the first time since we were kids this was also my first Halloween home in a while I know its dumb and only pumpkin carving but I feel like we never get to spend time together and I was really looking forward to tonight Im also upset because Im tired of watching my sister get pushed around by her excuse of a managerIm not sure what advice I can give my sister because Im sure this will continue to happen until somebody speaks up which no one will do because they are all afraid of the repercussions Anyway thanks for reading and allowing me to vent I just couldnt take it anymore TLDR my sister got called in on her day off unexpectedly when we already had plans ,Im so pissed at my Sisters manager,163
MrsJingo,46,32,1pmi75,167,My previous job was at a big UK chain cinema At this cinema we had an icecream stand that sold a specific big brand of American icecream Icecream customers were the worstOne day I am working the icecream stand it was a Monday or Tuesday so the whole place was dead Suddenly theres a small child at the counter when I say small I mean no older than  As far as I can tell hes on his own no parent to be seen and the foyer seems deserted There is no way he could open the doors by himself so I assume mum or dad isnt far away maybe hiding round the corner so the little man can feel independantHe places a  coin on the counter enough for just a single scoop and asks what flavours we have I went through all the flavours with him  I think making sure to tell him what is each one He says he would like the banana one and he would like it in a cup not a cone He was totally adorable and explained he couldnt have a cone because he might spill the icecream on himself I gave him the biggest scoop I could realistically get away with Off he goes with a huge grin one happy little chapAwesome transaction right WrongMere seconds later this great big hulk of a woman comes storming over dragging this now bawling little boy along She procedes to scream right in my face something about trying to kill her child Turns out this kid has a nut allergy the banana icecream I sold him contains banana shaped chocolates and walnutsMore than shocked all I can think to do is point right at the giant signs everywhere that say Due to the nature of this stand all of our products may contain nut traces and tell her he shouldnt have anything from here then She threw the icecream at me and stormed off didnt even ask for a refundSeriously though your  year old has a nut allergy and you let him go pick out food by himself He clearly had no idea he couldnt have nuts or he would not have asked for thet one,Because clearly Im psychic,199

angerandbooks,17,15,1pm4vs,66,Hello Im doing a blog the first of which I posted here about a week ago and this is my second post It can be found herehttpanthropologyandbookswordpresscomitsdifficultiknow the formatting is a bit nicer or you can read it belowI once had a nemesisShe only came in twice but she spoke just to me seemed to hate me and I still think about her every now and then so I have classed her as my nemesis although I think I may have met my new nemesis but well see about thatI used to work in a shop that was inside a shopping centre Its a pretty shitty shopping centre with a big supermarket a gym two cafes a cinema a crap pub some restaurants and a couple of other shops People mostly come in for the supermarket This shopping centre is in a really odd area that doesnt really have anything else going for it other than you can walk to a very posh area in about  minutesThe customers are without a doubt some of the most horrible people I have ever encountered with the exception of an older gentleman who comes in every day says hello to us all and sometimes falls asleep on the couch If he falls asleep he walks past us as he is leaving and says I just fell asleep to which we all chuckle merrilly and he goes on his wayHere is an example I once got told off for showing a customer to the book she was asking forShe said to me Where are the Elmer books and I said They will be in the picture book section under M for McKeeI may have been slightly terse as she didnt greet me in any other way just demanded to know where Elmer wasShe then stated Im in a hurry so I emerged from behind the till took her to the picture book section handed her some Elmer books said There you go and left her to it When she returned she said to me Everybody here is rude You just stomped away after I asked for help to which I replied I did not stomp I am sorry that you feel that way You told me you were in a hurry so I showed you what you asked for She bought the book and left in a huffBut she was not my nemesis My first encounter with the nemesis was as I was tidying a table in the front of the store She entred the shop and called over to meWheres Jack London The customers in this shop never seemed to say Hello or Please or Thank you I honestly believe there is something in the water thereI looked up at her and said Jack London I think we might have him in the childrens section This was not the correct answer Childrens section Why is he in the childrens section He doesnt write books for kids He wouldnt be happy about thatI almost said to her Will you be telling him but I didnt as she was terrifying I tried to explain that the publishers produce his books with covers for adults and also some of his books with covers for children She shook her head at me as if I was making this up and walked away as I was still talking to her pulling her little trolley along behind her Not so bad really She was very abrupt and had absolutely no manners but it didnt bother me that muchThen she came back It was a few weeks later she came in pulling her trolley along wearing a tshirt with the American flag on the front sunglasses on inside And again she approached me Wheres your American literature Im looking for writers like Jack LondonWe dont keep American authors separate theyre all in the fiction sectionIm looking for American authors like Steinbeck or Jack London What Jack London do you haveOh God I thought We went through it again I told her we only really have the childrens versions of White Fang and The Call of the Wild and that yes the publishers do this on purpose She shook her head dismissively She still didnt believe me I asked her which Jack London she was after She said she wanted The Iron Heel I looked it up and we didnt have it so I said We could order it in for you or I can check other shops and you could pick it upI am not going to other shopsOKI am looking for American Literature that is older I dont mind newer stuff but I prefer older like Steinbeck or SalingerSo I walked her over to the fiction section and said again We keep all the fiction together alphabetised by author How about Paul AusterNo Have you tried Don DeLilloI dont want thatJohn UpdikeI did that when I was a childAfter a few more sugeestions and a few more rejections I eventually said Well its really a matter of just looking through the section and seeing what we haveAnd she huffed and said  dismissively Yes yes Its really difficult it must be very difficult for you I knowSo I left her to it slightly exasperated and a bit fed upMy manager had come onto the shop floor in the meantime and I returned to the tills to have a little chat with him The woman approached again and I quietly said to him Oh no I dont want to speak with this ladyShe walked by the tills as if to leave and then stopped in front of usYou know she stated loudly Every time I come in here I am treated with disdain You speak to me as if I am stupid I know you are going to talk about me as soon as I leave DONT try to deny it You will I am sick of being spoken to in this way This is a bad shop and I wont be spoken to as if I am nothing She went on All the while we were both stood there me trying to say No we wont Or Im sorry you feel that way but being interrupted and my manager just looking on in shockFinally to finish me off she said You remember this I have written things I write things And you just work here You just work hereAnd off she went She got me this woman did I was very shaken My manager said he should have done something and he was sorry but he was so shocked that he couldnt react I had to go off the shop floor and take some deep breaths I did see her again a few weeks

mknow,9,15,1pm33a,46,Background I have worked retail in a variety of ways some more traditional than others I worked at a retail pharmacy over the summer but due to the short amount of time I dont have many stories However I also work in a less traditional setting selling memberships to a gym This particular gym also had a pool and I occasionally moonlighted teaching swim lessons to boost my hours a little bit This story is actual one of the more ridiculous because of the triviality This was while I was teaching a swim lesson but I also handled some of the retail portion since I knew how that worked as well THE STORY So this round of swim lessons I was teaching pretty advanced swimmers Our swimmers get colored bracelets denoting their swim ability so the guards know where they are allowed to go in the pool If you are a visitor ie just there for swim lessons you get a disposable one Members get a plastic one Ive got a girl who isnt a member but her mother keeps insisting she is I start to write her a slip to purchase a new bracelet but decide at the last minute to check her membership status If shes purchasing it doesnt lose us money but again I dont want to break rules and get in trouble I hand her the slip yes my mistake explain Im checking her status and then go to ask my boss While Im asking my boss Crazy Mom comes up to the retail counter gives them the slip that I havent signed yet mind you and purchases it behind my back She knew full well I was checking and making sure I could even sell it to her Its decided she is not allowed to purchase it Now Im stuck having to process a return for her I try to calmly explain to her that she shouldnt have purchased it already that it was decided she cant purchase it and that I have her money in cash she had paid with card for her in exchange for the bracelet back The following is what she said  there was not much for me to say because I never got the chance You know I have CULTURE I bring my daughter here because its nicer and because its a better quality All youve done is give me cash back for my card I could have gone to the bank for that You think I need you to give me cash back on my card Like Im some kind of poor person I dont need to do that here  I can use my card like a normal personYou know I have CULTURE Youre treating me like some redneck piece of crap You may be able to do that with some people around here but not me You cant treat me that way I mean what are YOU PEOPLE doing here Im high class You need to treat me like itAt this point Im fifteen minutes late for the start of my lesson Im tired of the BS and shes said she has culture like eight times I just referred her to my boss and started the lesson I eventually got to tell my boss what happened so if I got a weird complaint she would know what happened The fact that she snuck by me was the unbelievable part The whole thing was so trivial And the best which I found out after she was done ranting was that her daughter had a necklace from us the old way we used to do it and that we still used if members had them but mom didnt want her to have to feel different from the other kids ,I have CULTURE,61
FredFltStn,278,743,1pm32e,1668,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  Welcome to the week of scam artists They rarely get away with it but that sure doesnt stop them from tryingEverything we sell is Buy  Get  Free BOGO We also send out mailers and have business cards that are good for Buy  Get  Free on any item up to  We also let you mix and match the items so you dont have to get three of the same things Im basically giving you an extra  in free fireworks just for showing up in the hopes that you purchase more than that and that you come back to see us every yearThe coupons have your typical legalese at the bottom Can only be used on one item cannot be reproduced one offer per day one offer per family our group only valid on items up to  etc I usually keep a stack of these coupons in my pocket and I hand them out pretty freely when the store is open I think its a great promotional tool and although it does impact my bottom line I wouldnt think of getting rid of itAs you can imagine we get our fair share of people trying to scam us with the couponSCAM   Theres a lady and her husband that show up at our tent at least four or five times each season with coupons Each time its the same routine Theyll spend an hour watching videos and carefully examining everything we sell When theyre ready to checkout the husband and wife will both approach the counter separately each carrying their three items and each with and a coupon They each pay for one item and get the other two for free If we ask them if there together which Ive done before for laughs they shake their heads and act like theyve never met even though they just spent the last hour shopping together The very next day theyll show up and do the exact same thing  Another hour of examining products pick out three walk to the counter separately use their coupon Even though they are technically scamming me I always let it go because frankly I think its funny as hellSCAM   Another regular customer Every season this guy comes in and picks out three of every item he intendeds to purchase When he gets to the counter he presents his coupon and we of course explained to him that he can only use it on one item Hell then spend  minutes arguing that I let him use it on everything he purchased the last time he was here In the end Ill let him use it on two items and he celebrates like hes won the lottery The thing is hes a regular and he buys a shitload of fireworks Id probably give him a better discount than the two uses of the card if we didnt have to go back and put up all the extra shit he picked out I seriously think he does it just to feel like hes gotten something over on us SCAM   A lady walks up to the counter with a fountain  and two massive assortments  in her cart I was standing behind the counter so I went to ring her up Before I could start she handed me a coupon and this conversation took placeLADY  Im just paying for the fountain Im going to use the coupon for the free itemsME  wondering WTF she is thinking Im sorry but the coupon is only good on items up to  and the free items have to be of equal or lesser valueLADY  It doesnt say that anywhere on the couponI look at the coupon and sure as hell shes rightbecause shes cut off the bottom third of the coupon that had all the legaleseME  Im sorry but this coupon has been altered It normally has all the details on the bottom handing her another coupon from my pocket so she can seeLADY  Thats not my problem My coupon doesnt say that so legally you have to honor my purchaseME  rudely because WTF really Yeah thats not going to happen I dont know what happened to your coupon sure I dont but its been altered and Im not obligated to take altered couponsThe lady is now full on yelling at me insisting that Im breaking the law and that she can sue me for not taking her coupon On this particular day thank god we actually had hired an off duty uniformed police officer to sit at the entrance to the tent acting as security We do that on our busier days because its a great deterrent for theft and it builds goodwill with the local police since they make great extra money for a really easy gig see herehttpredditnkw Besides they love my moms Cajun cookingThe lady stomps away from the counter and approaches the police officer to obviously raise hell about meBefore she can say anything the officer looks her in the eyes and says One moment maam the calls over to me loudly enough for everyone to hearOFFICER  Did you want me to arrest her or just throw her outME  Its up to you Youve got to fill out the paperworkShe left without another wordIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories

rumplesplitskin,48,15,1plsm8,91,Ever since weve been open our little petrol station has had some kind of music playing device gently pumping out either the radio or a favourite CD that someone have brought in from home In all this time management has never batted an eyelid about us listening to music as long as we kept the volume low when customers are in the shop That is until last week when out of the blue were instructed to switch the radio off permanently Someone higher up found out that for over a decade we have been broadcasting music illegally Going by what ive been told the main stores PPL licence that allows them to play music to the public does not cover us over here in the petrol station And management are not willing to fork out the ish for a separate licence just for us  As you can imagine this bummed us all out as music can be lifesaver during those long cold winter hours where customers are few and far between So myself and the other shift leaders got together and offered to pay for the costs out of our own pocket But when the main store manager put this forward to head office they came to the store lined us up and forced us to bend over naked while they inserted root vegetables into our anal cavitys using a polo mallet Well this is how it felt when they said noWe though about applying directly to the licensing folk but this too is not allowed The public cant buy a licence for a business they do not personally own Now here is where it gets REALLY badWere not allowed to play copyrighted music but we are allowed to play anything that our department heads son had made with his friends in their basement recording studioor i should say phone mic Worse still they are a wannabe boy band For the past few days weve been listening to four tweeny boys singing about falling in love having sex and twerkingIm more than positive every member of this band is still waiting for the second testicle to dropKill me please Do it nowEDIT  No wait dont kill me yet Im getting a new pc this year for xmass So give me a few months of gaming heaven before i go to hell ,The day the music died,106
RedhairedLady,6,5,1pls4n,26,Back in college I used to work at the customer service desk for a big box store I would alternate mostly day shifts and a random night shift while going to a community college in the next town over Im terribly recognizable so customers would always remember me while I tend to forget them One of my first nights there we got a phone call for appliances It was a slow night but appliances wouldnt take the call so I had to assist the customer It was a woman with a thick accent MiddleEastern I believe who was having problems with her dryer She was loudly trying to tell me that it wouldnt work I asked her when she bought it and tried trouble shooting as best as I could I also couldnt understand her so I would ask Mam can you talk a little slower for me please Half the conversation was me pleading for them to stop speaking so loudly and to talk slower  The person would not let me out of the phone call and no matter how many times I tried transferring to appliances no other employee would take the call My coworker laughed at me while this scenario dragged on for twenty minutes Frustrated I finally apologized and asked for them to call back tomorrow and politely hung up I was at school the next day waiting outside a classroom in the middle of campus with about twenty other students Suddenly a rather large and sweaty guy appeared and started yelling to me You You work at big box store  I sigh and say yes He then proceeds to tell me that he called the store last night and spoke to a girl about his dryer not working  She was so dumb she did not know how to turn on a dryer I know it wasnt you because you work in the daytime She was so stupid Ill come in when youre working I smiled apologized for my idiot coworker which was me and told him to have a nice day The look on my face as this man walked away was priceless TLDR I spent twenty minutes on the phone not being able to understand a woman only to bump into them and find out it was a man ,Ive always had trouble understanding thick accents,31
firepixie,9,3,1plo9h,20,Hello I need some advice on how to deal with this situation Im not sure how to go about it and I thought maybe people here would have a clue how to The day started pretty good all was well Im a cashier and the customers werent too bad today the only problem I was having is working with one of the managers whom I dont particularly get along with we just have nothing in common well call him Stickupbum Now it was time for my break which was  minutes late but I was alright I got a  tip and people were very nice I clocked out grabbed some food and headed back to get checked out There were three checkers Stickupbum was one of them and he was just finishing up I noticed a customer heading for him as well so I gladly waved my hand for the customer to go first and he declined insisting I go first so we did the weird dance of no you I thanked the customer and went up to Stickupbums register and this is what happenedSUB stickupbum Looking me dead in the eye Customers go firstMe ButSUB yelling STOPMe He letSUB still yelling STOP ITI was stunned I was insulted I felt like a toddler getting in trouble I grabbed my reciept took a look at the other two cashiers and headed towards the break room SUB said something along the lines of Dont talk to me like that as I was walking away Called my boyfriend so he could help calm my nerves and talk it out with him My very supportive loving boyfriend told me if I wanted to walk out I could and I could just find another job I was so close to doing just that but I didnt want to be seen as the person who walks out on the job I stuck it out for the rest of the night I really didnt want to but I did Now Im sitting at home not sure if I want to go in tomorrow part of the reason I dont want to quit is because it is just that manager I get along with every one else and I only ever get positive feedback from customers and coworkers Another reason is because my boyfriend and the store manager are good friends and hes the main reason I got the job I dont want to insult the store manager because I really enjoy him SUB works tomorrow too and he told me tomorrow is when we would talk about it because he couldnt talk earlier or he would just yell at me I dont know what to say and I dont know how I will react to what he will say to me I was waiting for an apology tonight but I never got one I feel like I am not in the wrong and he is am I wrong about that I would like some outlook onto this Im sorry if this isnt really a good place to put this and sorry for the wall of text I appreciate any responses ,Some advice,23

Locclo,28,17,1plmyz,92,This story sums up exactly why I get a tiny feeling of dread whenever an assistant manager decides to help out in our department Dont get me wrong I generally appreciate the help butwell youll seeFor background I work in the bakery department of a big retailer It doesnt pay much but it pays the bills and its one of the easiest jobs to just zone out while Im working since once youve worked there for three years packaging the bread requires almost zero focus and attention Cake decorating on the other handthat requires training Training which I do not have because I was hired as a parttime bread monkey Worth mentioning is the fact that we currently dont have a decorator  were supposed to have two decorators but one slot has been in constant flux one fired one changed departments one quit and as of a week ago the woman who had been decorating for years has moved on to greener pastures As you might guess were kind of stuck we cant take any cake orders since theres nobody to do them and nine times out of ten we cant even write on cakes because between the Deli and the Bakery out of probably  or so employees one person is trained as a decoratorAnywayIn todays story its almost the end of the day for me about fortyfive minutes before Im outta there ready to enjoy a night of watching Breaking Bad while playing Batman I have a thrilling social life you see Nobody else is in the bakery Im all by my lonesome with the exception of two recently transferred assistant managers who are helping to stock because Im working on closing Thats when a customer walks up to the bakery and asks one of the assmen to write on a cake for him Sure the manager says no problem let me just grab Locclo from the backThe manager grabs me and asks if I can write on a cake I of course not being trained in this skill tell him that I cant  all I can do is give a little plastic thing that says Happy Birthday on it Now I dont know if the manager didnt hear me or if he didnt understand me or if just didnt listen to what I was saying but the next thing I know he walks back over to the customer and says Yeah hell do it for you just tell him what you want written on itMy reactionhttpiimgurcomjNFqwgifWell obviously I cant do it so I quickly explain to the customer that I cant actually write on the cake because Im not trained in doing it I apologize and offer him the plastic thingy he doesnt seem to mind at all and just takes one of those insteadThen of course the manager comes back and hes none too happy Once again I explain to him that not only am I not trained as a decorator Ive never written on a cake before in my life I have no experience no practice and for that matter I only kindasortanotreally remember how to write in cursive Then he pulls out this wonderful lineWell I can do it but I havent done it for a long time Its pretty easy you just have to kinda write with the frosting You can probably do it better than I canI looked at him like he was trying to sell me the SlapChop and Shamwow for  plus shipping and handlingYes the untrained inexperienced guy who screwed up making cupcakes which are harder than youd expect to make them look nice thats my story and Im sticking to it is going to do a better job at trying to write in frosting than a guy who actually knows how to do it Even if its been a long time youve still got a huge leg up over the guy who has never done itEven better his next direction Get with my department manager so that he can teach me how to write on cakes My department manager who also doesnt know how to do itI know this story seems like a pretty silly thing to rant about Im anticipating a bunch of posts about how its not hard to write on cakes just try it and practice it but its a little frustrating when the manager knew how to do something that I didnt still asked me to do it and completely ignored me when I said I couldnt do it This line shamelessly stolen from Kevin Hernes excellent novel Hounded first book in the Iron Druid ChroniclesTLDR The right hand doesnt know what the blind man is doing leading the blind into the valley of the shadow of mixed metaphors,If you know how to do it then you do it,109

quintz,8,13,1pleoj,62,Ive worked many haunted houses since  and one standing rule is No refunds No Exceptions which is usually written in large print behind the ticker seller So heres what happened last weekendIts about an half hour before opening and a lady arrives with a young girl maybe  yrs of age to go through the house At this time most of all of the actors are hanging out in front of the house in various stages of being in their costumes which is a little pet peeve of mine especially when there are customers there that can see them since this can take from the fear factor but all well since it can be a pain waiting in the house itself But this lady with the young girl waits patiently for the house to open obviously hesitant but excited to go through the houseIts the top of the hour the actors take their place and the house opens And I see the lady and the young girl go into the house the young girl again hesitant but willing to go through I joke to one of the other operators that the two girls wont make it through the house and we chuckle It didnt take  rooms and I see them being escorted out from one of the chicken exits by one of our floaters We all start to laugh a littleThis is when things get really interesting The lady immediately walks up to the ticket counter asking for a refund The ticket girl points to the no refund policy behind her and tells the lady that its not available The lady gets upset and continues to demand a refund At this point I step in and tell the lady we have a strict no refund policy which why its written in such large letters so everyone can see when they purchase their tickets The lady then argues that she deserves the refund since her and the young girl didnt even get through the first  rooms I tell her that she paid for us to scare her and apparently we did one hell of a great job at it and again we dont give refunds So then the lady argues that we shouldnt have sold a ticket to a young girl All I could say was Maam you purchased that ticket knowing how young your girl was you accepted any such risks in that purchaseFinally the lady and I came to an arrangement that I would give her two passes that she could use any time for the rest of the season which is this weekend She took the passes and left,One for the season,75

whatkindoffuckery,5,16,1pl8mo,43,So I was working at the Service Desk of a grocery store for awhile The store is right next to a not so nice neighborhood  We had a lot of crazies but one was just absolutely ridiculous  He had already been thrown out of the store on multiple occasions and wasnt actually supposed to be in the store but some managers just didnt give enough shits to throw him out So its absolutely packed in our store Im trying to manage the usual circus act of answering all the cashiers codes while simultaneously running the service desk Im in the office when I see a man come and place some items on the counter I finish up what Im doing and I go to help him but hes gone Yet all these items are still on the counter I ignore it and continue dealing with other customersAbout half an hour later he returns with the exact same items that are on the counter I ask him if hes doing a return and he says no He pulls a reciept out of his pocket and proclaims that our selfcheckout gave him this reciept today and he realized when he got home that his items werent on itI take a look at the reciept and its three days old and lists a cashier that isnt even at work that day Not to mention its tattered and torn and definitely not from an hour ago I explain this to him and he immediately starts going off Now I dont know what the fuck kind of machines youre running but it gave me this fucking reciept and I just want to pay for my shit I explain to him that if a reciept printed that he did indeed pay for it but this isnt the right reciept He continues on his tirade in front of the entire front end So I go to ring his items up just so hell leave and he then starts yelling because hes not paying for it twiceI am literally just standing in utter awe of this man as I soak in the smell of cheap beer and cigarettes  I call my manager over and explain to her whats going onShe attempts to please the man but to no avail because he doesnt want us to do a refund he doesnt want to pay for it he doesnt want the new product he just wants us to fix our effing machine He continued yelling incoherent things until she finally just got him to agree to a refundIm still amazed that she got him to leave the store without threatening to come back with his shotgun again TL DR Self checkout didnt print your three day old reciept lay off the booze,So what would you like me to do then,59
meowlife,8,11,1pl3x5,28,Hey TFR heres my storyI work for a small local privately owned boutique I worked in corporate retail for  years prior to landing this job and so far its been a cake walk with the exception of one thing My boss is a fucking nut case She seemed normal enough when I started Your typical the customer takes priority boss who stands over you while you clumsily ring up sales But now that Ive been here for well over  months it has come to my attention that this lady has some serious issues  She comes in on her days off and plants hides empty hangers in the racks then finds them and complains that we arent straightening the store often enough  In response to me telling her I wanted time off to go visit my grandfather and convince him to see a doctor because he had been showing signs of a stroke well if thats the case dont you think he deserves to have a stroke Im still not allowed to close the store because she still hasnt shown me how even though I have my store keys and my alarm code and shes actually shown me  different times as well as my other coworkers who dont understand why she still wont let me I can close out the register in my sleep  Because its a boutique there is only a small handful of girls working there One week several girls needed to go out of town and my boss was leaving to attend a fashion show and order more products This resulted in me  having to work  days straight which wasnt a big deal to me I need the money and it is a pretty chill job when she isnt around Then I got a cold There was no way I could stay home because of how shorthanded we were and one of my other coworkers was getting sick as well but we all managed to figure it out Then Boss Lady came back from her trip pissed because I came to work sick She accused me of being in denial of my illness and of getting my coworker sick When I told her that she was already sick because her kids had been sick the week before she rolled her eyes and said well thats the downside on deciding to have kids  She wants us to play our own music on days that she isnt in the store but only music that has been deemed appropriate for the demographic of women about mid thirties to ancient that shop in our store All the other stores I worked in before this were around the same demogaphic so I usually put on artists that I remember were on the CDs sent to us from Corporate at my old jobs   Today I came in and my coworker told me we had to make a list of appropriate music to be played in the store because she thinks we are playing rap and s stuff when shes not around because she stopped in once when we had Janelle Monae on  She does these weird impersonations of me Example One day I was late because the PGampE guy parked in our employee parking so I had to find another spot down the street I explained to her how he had not only taken my spot but ignored me and walked away when I told him he was in our employee parking Well whos going to take you seriously if you say it like and then she hunched over and stuck her neck out and used this weird gravely voice to say you took my spot Apparently she sees me as a hunchback with a smoker voice Her impression of me has become a common thing now when she comes in while Im working Ive made it pretty clear to her that I dont like it but she does it anywayPassive aggressively talks about me and my coworkers to customers as well as me and my coworkers Example One of my coworkers put in her  weeks because she was moving to LA For the next two weeks we all had to hear  unless another one of you decides to quit on me or  except now Im losing someone so who knows whats gonna happenThats all I can think of for now Aside from dealing with her weird shit the job itself is pretty laid back My coworkers are all nice and the customers are usually easy to help Weve got our share of quirky customer stories but nothing so far that tops my boss ,Fun amp Games in Boutiqueland aka my boss is crazy,39
LovablePWNER,8,10,1pl2bq,53,As a cashier patience is one of my greatest tools at my disposal If I wasnt so patient I probably would have blown up on someone by now My best example comes from an experience I had with a very old woman and her sonIt was another busy Saturday at the grocery store and this very old woman came next in line I greeted her but got a scowl in in responseUh ohSo I ignore the scowl chalking it up to just grumpy old age I scan half her items without a peep from her until out of nowhere she screamedDOUBLED PAPER BAGS I SAID DOUBLE PAPER BAGSNow this really couldve warranted a response but I could tell that she had something wrong upstairs So I instead said Oh Im sorry I mustve forgotSo I continued now doing double paper bags all the while with her grumbling about my mistake Then her son who looked about  came up to the line to which the woman told him angrily of my mistake to which he told her that it was fine and that she should take a seat By this time I was just about done and the man told me Thank you so much Shes well shes had better days Thank you for being so kind and patient with her I told him it was no problem and that this is my job its just what I doI felt so bad for him and his mother From the outside someone could have just said Wow that lady is such a bitch when in reality she probably has no idea whats going on and her son must take care of herI could have lost my head I could have told her she was wrong but instead I was patient with her and because of that I was that sons hero I showed him that I understood his pain Its not easy seeing someone you love losing themselves,Sometimes you just need patience,63
pikachuthethug,43,45,1pkx6k,181,This literally just happened Im typing this on my phone at workA little background I work at a fairly well known gas station chain We are not allowed to do refunds or exchanges without manager approvalThe story A girl comes in around three pm and buys a cappuccinoFifteen minutes ago  pm she comes back She says that the cappuccino she bought earlier was too sweet and asks if she could have something else I told her that was fine as long as she got a soda or another coffee We can give fountain drinks away in moderation but I couldnt give her anything with a bar code for free She says thanks and goes over to the soda fountainShe comes up to the register a few minutes later and demands the price difference between her glass of water and the cappuccinoI replied that if she wants any sort of money back shell need to speak to a manager So she takes down my name and asks when the manager will be in She then complains that I didnt give her a receipt with her original purchase Of course I didnt Im pretty sure coffee is final sale I told her not to worry Id leave a note for my managerHes going to be pissed I hope he laughs in her face for being so ridiculous Maybe it would have been alright if she brought it back immediately after purchasing it but four hours later I dont think so,So a girl just came in and tried to get a refund for a cappuccino she bought FOUR HOURS AGO,226
LeadFootSpiderMonkey,14,34,1pkv6o,155,So I I just found this sub and I wanted to share with you the number one story from my serving days at a big chain eatin style restaurantSo I was worked doubles for a while because we were short staffed most of you know how that goes Kinda slow unless it is a Friday when people come on their lunch breakWe had been steady all day and were just starting to slow down when  State Troopers came in and sat down they were regulars and Ill get back to them in a minuteFast forward about  minutesIm up front talking with the hostess about something when I notice a man dressed in all black carrying a huge guitar case walking through the parking lot talking to himselfNow I try not to jump to conclusions but this guy was an immediate red flag the way he was walking and talking to himself answering questions no one asked etcWhen he got to the door the hostess went to greet him and I started to walk to my section because I was next in the rotationThats when he walked right past both of us tossed his guitar case on the nearest  top table and seated himself all the while just talking to himselfThen things get weirderWe calmly walk over and ask him if he could move to another table as this section was closed and that I would be happy to serve him if he would walk to one of the booths that were assigned to my sectionHe looks up and his eyes met mine If looks could killHe glares at me lowers his head to where just his eyes are looking up at me and gives a curt NO Then opens his guitar case and pulls out a book about cults and mind control It didnt look mass printed it looked like a selfpublished book that had been bought from someones writing endeavors which made it a little spookier Uh Ok now I want this guy to leaveAt this point he was freaking everyone out including the customers seated around him The hostess walks over and politely says sir you are scaring some of the customers with your behavior could you please dial the rudeness back a little pleaseHe gives her the same scary head nodscary glare look and blurts out I am worth more than GOLD YOU FOOL You are to WORSHIP MEHostess Sir I am going to have to ask you to leave as we have the right to refuse service to people who are disrupting the restaurantScary man DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM YOU STUPID WOMAN I AM JESUS CHRIST DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE TALKING TO YOU ARE TO WORSHIP ME YOU FOOL IAMJESUS I AM THE F GOLDEN F TICKET BITCHSo I decide the freak show needs to end and walk around the corner to grab the State Troopers who were just out of earshot in time to see another waitress already there and they are putting their hats on and getting up to come escort him outWhen they get over there he just keeps yelling I AM JESUS I AM THE F GOLDEN TICKET YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE DOINGAt this point it was pretty clear the guy was on something so the officers asked if they could peek inside the case Scary guy for some reason thrusts it at the officer and sits down Indian style on the outside walkwayFrom where we were standing we saw the other police cars pulling in and the drug dogs getting out etcWhile we were waiting one woman made the comment Yooo I know that aint Jesus I aint never heard Jesus talk like THAT not really relevant to this story per se but it was funny and it made the rest of the customers and staff laughIn the end we watched them pull out  bags filled with various white powders and one filled with maybe  multicolored pills that looked like E So the guy was definitely on a ton of stuff days later the troopers came in and told me that he had almost every drug you could imagine in that case and that he was from out of state and had hitchhiked all the way from Texas I am in TennesseeSo that is my most memorable story from my days as a waitress Thanks for reading  ,I am still new to Reddit wasnt sure where this belonged exactly but this is by far my most memorable customer ever,189

BenSisko,27,31,1pki0s,129,Hello again After the overwhelming response my first post about Tony created if you missed it heres a linkhttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentspwovshewantedithotterimadeithotter  I thought Id share with you another tale about my terrible coworker It was a pretty rough day in our coffee shop Lots of angry customers with wonderfully awkward orders I did my best with help from Linda to keep Tony as far away from the bar as possible forcing him to wash the dirty cups and such in the kitchen area rather than let him be in a position where he would have to talk to customers While I was dealing with a particularly irritating customer who simply ordered coffee and then couldnt fathom why he hadnt recieved a decaffinated half strength soya cappuccino Tony comes storming out from the kitchen area with some glasses balanced precariously on a tray He proceeds to elbow his way through the customers grunting Move will ya whenever he couldnt get through and shoving the tray into peoples backs when they didnt move fast enoughHe slammed it down near the coffee machine swearing under his breath about the fucktard customers getting in his wayHe then walked up to one of our customers near the bar and said Man it is so fucking HOT in here Im sweating like crazy in a voice that was far too loud in front of customers and their children He then proceeded to wipe his sweaty forehead on this random customers shirt sleeveI had no idea what to do The man looked disgusted who wouldnt and Tony just sauntered off I apologised once again for Tonys actions got Linda on the machine to finish up the orders and called the manager Once things had died down and we had fewer customers to deal with the manager called Tony out on his actions in the office area I dont know what was said but I do know that sdaly justice still hasnt been served and he is still working with us nowThere is a bit of a silver lining to this depressing story I managed to get hold of someone above our regional management I told them about all the things Tony had done and believe me there are a LOT and in response theyve set up a monitoring system Every time he does something we write it down At the end of the month upper management will confront him with the evidence and hopefully fire his incompetent ass I live in hopeTLDR Dont wipe your sweat on customers ,Another Tale About Tony,160

crystall,107,87,1pk83x,448,I was reminded of this story of my time working at a certain international coffee shop chain by another post This was actually my comment to their post but I have been lurking here so long now commenting occasionally that I thought I would share this with you all Working the same shift in a downtown area of a city you see the same people at the same time every day You get to know what your regulars order this makes sense yes If we were slow and I saw a regular headed toward our doors I would start on their beverage so that by the time they paid it would be ready and waiting for them Most people appreciated this they had a limited amount of time on their breaks from their own jobs and this way they didnt have to stand around waitingwasting their break time Most people This one guy came in at pm EVERY DAY and ordered the same nonfat vanilla latte EVERY DAY I see him coming down the block there are no customers I have been cleaning up after the lunch rush I stop what I am doing and start making his drink so that just as my coworker handed him his change I came over and set the drink down on the counter in front of him saying heres your nonfat vanilla latte sir He looked at it like I had just scooted a turd across the counter at him gave me a death look and said what is this I repeated what I said maintaining eye contact When did you make this he asked incredulously Just now I stated I saw you coming down the block and started on it for you I smiled he was still giving me the death look He picks up the cup sniffs it glares at me and walks out Later on that day my manager comes downstairs and tells me that Mr nonfat vanilla latte had complained that I had his drink ready for him as soon as he finished paying he also contacted our corporate office to complain about my efficiency as well Nothing ever came of it But every afternoon after that at pm I would wait patiently until he ordered until he paid then I would painstakingly make his drink taking as much time as possible and hand it off to him with a smile Some people just dont appreciate it when people try to do nice things for them,Your Efficiency Offends my Delicate Sensibilities,535
GotNoms,36,69,1pk6oe,232,Last summer I had a part time job working in my uncles restaurant as a bus boy it was a small little restaurant that every local pretty much knew as we live in a small town Every once in a while people from out of town come in and eat visitors arent a huge occurrence here and of course we treat them like family just as we do everyone else One afternoon three hood rats from out of town come in and start causing trouble swearing at staff throwing shit at waiters to get their attention just general  douchebaggary for a LONG TIME because they simply did not want to leave I tried to get them to hurry along by clearing the table they were sitting at I normally let them leave whenever they so please but these guys were in the dining area from noon to about  the entire time being obnoxious and one of them yelled at me about taking a plate that he wasnt done eating Do you wanna lick the salt from the plate because there isnt anything else on the damn thing and I politely told him that I was gonna go ahead and finish clearing the table and put the plate in the tubs that we use He then grabbed my arm and said BITCH I SAID I WUNT DUN YET I then politely told him to go fuck himself and get out of the restaurant uncle said if they caused more problems to go ahead and kick em out so this wasnt my call of course he gets up and starts talking shit about how rude I was and how he was going to get yo bitch ass fired real talk and walked up to the counter My uncle had been working the register as we were short staffed that day and he didnt want to put anyone else under additional stress but wasnt wearing anything that signified he was the owner to whoever didnt know who he was Guy starts bitching about how he should get a free meal and everything else everyone always asks for and that he wants to speak to the manager about the punk ass bitch out here Uncle said no and to get out of the store Guy starts yelling about how he will get my uncle fired thinking he was just a cashier and how he knew the owner personally My uncle looked the guy straight in the eye told him he was the owner and told him not to EVER return to his restaurant ever again Someone eating yelled OHHHHHH and everyone flipped shit while all three walked out with their tails between their legs,Hood rats get shut down in restaurant,301

ramsaysbitch,56,64,1pjtyh,290,I work part time  days a week opening at the largest burger chain in the world Yes that one Its not so bad im alone in grill section most of my shifts and dont have to deal with most of the customersemployees But i do get to hear a lot of the good stories from later shifts This one actually happened on my shift this morning We have been having a lot of Pay It Forward chains in drive thru during breakfast rush the last  weeks Most of the people carry it on pleasantly until the last car who promises to do it next time Some of them stop it in the middle with a grateful awesome thanksAnd then there was this womanShe is a regular in drive thru so seeing her on the front counter while my manager was backed up in drive thru i went up to take her order myself The first thing she says Why the fuck would somebody else pay for my food I asked what she was talking about and she explained that when she came through yesterday morning the front drive thru manager told her there was a Pay It Forward line going and her meal was paid for She didnt appreciate somebody paying for her food because she has a very expensive SUV she drives and early s chevy and she can clearly afford a meal at mcdonalds Its unacceptable that we would let someone treat her like she cant take care of herself I try to explain to her that its a kind gesture and youre supposed to continue for the car behind you if you are willing and able its supposed to be something positive She continues ranting about how she isnt paying for anybody but herself and never to let anybody pay for her againI dont understand how someone can take a generous fad and turn it so negative When i talked to the girl who had been in dt yesterday she said the lady was just as bad when it happened and refused to not pay for her own order so we have an extra  in our safe right now because none of us know what to do with it and our store manager is on vacation Never underestimate the ability for people to ruin a good thing ,Pay It Forward BITCH,354

jumpityjump,15,36,1pjjk7,117,Background I work on the cellar door at a very busy winery in a popular wine region Basically my job involves talking people through our wines pouring wines selling as much wine as possible and ensuring customers have the best possible experience We get all sorts of interesting customers and no shift is without its storyWe do get some strange requests from time to time and usually try to accommodate them but this particular story was just so full of ridiculousness I thought it must be a joke Wednesdays tend to be our crazy personrequest day and this was no exception It was around am when the two customers at the bar suddenly looked terrified We turned to see a wave of  Indonesian tourists walking down the long driveway to our cellar door Usually groups of  or more have to book in ahead of time and pay a fee per head for tasting all other walkins taste for free This group had no booking but all wanted to taste wine After a quick panicked phone call to our manager we decided not to charge them because they only wanted to try two wines each and promised to buy lots of cases After  minutes of stuffing around and backing and forthing they finally decided they were ready to purchase First request they wanted cases of ten bottles  our cases are made up of  bottles and we do a discount for cases But they only wanted  bottles in each case Another  minutes of working out exactly how many bottles they wanted and we managed to make up  normal mixed cases for them Then they made a list of which wines they wanted in those cases written in Indonesian They passed us this list and couldnt understand why we couldnt read it and make up their cases from it  We finally got someone to rewrite their requests in English and were ready for payment They offered us US  we are not in the USA and they got very upset when we insisted they would have to pay in the correct currency or with a card because we cannot accept US Payment finally received I put the cases on the bar The main man we had been dealing with just looked at me and said you will carry them to bus for us Im sorry but Im a small girl and you are a group of  at least half of which were strong enough men Im sure you can manage between you to carry three cases of wine to your bus parked across the road at another winery at least a m walk away I explained that I could not leave the bar so he said ok then we will take your trolley to carry them I insisted that that was also not an option as we couldnt let it leave the premises Finally we came to the agreement that I would wheel their cases to the end of our m driveway where their bus would meet me and they would load them on When I was half way down the driveway dragging a trolley of cases and tailed by the wave of happy tasters the winery owner rocked up Rather than stopping he wound down the window took a picture on his phone and sent it to the rest of our staff saying this is what I call customer service Im still not sure if those three cases were worth all of the hassle but it puts other difficult customers in perspective now ,No we dont accept foreign currency cant read your language and wont abandon our bar to drag your cases to another winery,153
brandnewshoes,36,36,1pjizh,216,I posted this story in another thread but Im bored so I figured Id add it here too I work at an entertainment company in the DC area and on the weekends I run the photobooth This happened last Saturday nightThe parents rented out a really popular club in DC on Saturday night for their sons Bar Mitzvah reception The entire VIP floor was just for the kids  unsupervised and unlimited soda The parents had the  lower levels to themselves to get wastedThe kids TRASHED THE CLUB Every single soda they got they spilled The floor was a muddy sticky mess They grabbed the cushions from the VIP couches and threw them all over the floor basically ruining the furniture really nice leather couches They broke a glass panel jumped up on the window sills and started banging on the glass this was on the third story so if they broke the window and fell out they wouldve died They climbed behind the couches and destroyed the paint jobs on the walls Ruined like  speakers which I later learned were each valued at around  There was sushi smushed into the floor everywhere and you couldnt walk without getting a kid or two shoved at youI was working the photobooth and even though Ive had some bad parties before I have never had to shut down the booth due to hell being raised The booth has about  worth of equipment in it and these kids were punching kicking shaking it as if it were a toy If it had fallen on one of them it wouldve been my fault so when the mom started yelling at me for shutting off the booth I yelled right back for letting these little demons get away with it all From what I heard the owner of the club is suing the parents for the damagesI think the club cost about    to rent out for the night They paid my job around  for the entertainment DJ MC photobooth dancers then more for the catering had a well known froyo place cater dessert and a sushi bar came in with food They also rented some extra furniture which was ruined and they have to pay to replaceI just came back from lunch and I was informed that the parents felt so bad for the trouble that they tipped each of workers  The club is still suing and the parents are settling for whatever they ask,The night from hell,252

AWardLove,10,19,1pj9de,79,So the company I work for has both retail and outlet locations Which is fine many companies do However we are not allowed to take returns from an outlet store in the retail location and vice verse I work at a different brand and helping out at another one At my brand the tags are different at outlet and retail which causes problems if somebody tries to purchase an outlet product in the retail storeEnter older lady She was VERY nice waited until I finished up on the phone before asking her question and I was perfectly able to help her find exactly what she was looking for The whole reason she was at the store was to return two coats and pick up two new ones in the correct sizes She pulls out her receipt I scan the barcode and a new prompt pops up on screen Cannot accept returns from out of state or other brand Living in Maryland I was confused as to why a store in Delaware  would be considered out of country joking with this woman about it making light of the situationUnfortunately she really wanted to do this here so I had to call the customer service hotline for the stores to see if there is a magical way to process things I finally get my representative on the line saying I have a very patient customer who is wanting to return an item and this is what is happening The woman is getting a bit annoyed with the delay while I am trying to figure it out And then I realized I am the idiot The receipt was from the same brand in the same country but it was from an outlet store I asked the CSR if outlet stores for this brand carry the same product as the retail because that is what confused me for the brand I usually work at it is product from last year not current product The CSR said it could happen but she wouldnt be able to let me know for sure I hang up and turn to the woman to start to explain what is going on I mentioned she went to an outlet location to purchase and unfortunately this was a retail location She went from kind and patient into The Hulk She kept saying we were an outlet location which I had to keep reminding her we were not I demand your customer service number this is unacceptable I wrote it out for her and sent her on her way while apologizing that there really was nothing more I could do in our location while providing her with the closest outlet stores possible TLDR Outlet vs retail can be a PITA,Return frustration,98

vaime,63,40,1picxh,126,I work as a promotional model in a duty free store at an international airport Its our job to give out samples educate customers on our product and generally help the retail staff with sales Being an international airport in a main city we occasionally get some celebrities coming through The staff at our store are allowed to ask for photos andor autographs as long as they are polite and professional whilst doing so As all the staff I work with are amazing theres never been an issue with this so its common practiceWere a small country and most of the celebrities that come through are local TV celebs or sports heros  people who are more than happy to stop for a photo and an autograph Occasionally big shot international celebrities come through most dont bother stopping at duty free and are ushered on past by their security but the occasional few who stop to browse are usually happy to indulge a few staff in a photoMyself and another employee were watching one afternoon as a couple of staff got photos with a local sports star I mentioned how fun it was seeing these kind of people come through and it sparked a conversation on some of the international celebrities who have been through Most had stories of how nice soandso was etc Our floor manager had a very different story She was working with staff from a different shift one evening when a very VERY famous young male popstar entered the store The store was quiet as he was very early for his flight and there werent many other flights at that time Due to his fame a few of the younger staff were understandably quite excited He was looking around at the products and one of the younger staff asked if she could help When he informed her that he was just browsing she shyly asked if she would be able to have a photo with himHe immediately picked a bottle of vodka up off the shelf and held it up Do I get this for free if I take a picture with youThe poor girl was speechless and he kept asking things like I should at least be given a discount you know  seeing as Im helping you out here Its only fair that you give me  off in exchange for a photo Im doing you a service  you should do me one tooThe poor girl tried to explain that she wasnt able to give out discounts and even if she could due to alcohol laws she wasnt able to give out discounts on the alcohol even vouchers and coupons cant be used on liquor in our store The girl was near tears stuttering and trying to explain but the celeb just kept getting more and more heated raising his voice to a borderline yell telling her that she was stupid and asking her why someone like him should even consider doing anything for a shopgirl when she refused to even give him a small discount The floor manager overheard this and immediately took over the situation sending the employee to the back room to recover and explaining politely but firmly that the employee had no authority to give discounts on any product She apologised that he clearly didnt want to take a photo and politely let him know that he was well within his rights to decline  she bit her tounge and avoided telling him that he could have just said No despite badly wanting to He basically turned around to the manager puffed out his chest and told her she was damn right she was sorry informed her he was too important to be bothered by staff and should get a discount anyway because didnt she know who he wasThe manager a badass middleaged eastern european woman who had probably never listened to pop in her life looked him in the eye and let him know that no she had no idea who he was and she was sorry but they didnt give discounts on alcohol no matter WHO was asking for it but if there was something in particular that he was looking for she was more than happy to help him personallyThis clearly tipped the celeb over the edge who snorted swore at the manager and stormed off Throughout all of this his handlers were standing a few feet away  looking sheepish but not doing anything The manager said she felt most sorry for these guys who from the look on their faces saw this kind of behaviour all the time but didnt dare say a word Apparently the popstar sent one of them back to the store around half an hour later to pick up a list of stuff he wanted  the poor guy couldnt even look the manager in the face while she was ringing up the items particularly because the young employee had only just come out of the back room and was being consoled by some of the other staffThe whole experience really pissed off our manager shed never heard of this guy before and to hear her hate on him was kind of hilarious mainly because she couldnt believe a multimillionare would be so cheap and tacky enough to demand discounts  and worse still to bully a young employee to the point of tears This guy had been that employees hero and meeting him was practically a dream come true so she was incredibly torn up about the whole situation Our manager whilst being a terrifying woman is also staunchly loyal to the family who work there and hated seeing one of her girls so cut up by that doucheI really hope next time he comes here for a concert our badass floor manager is working  he certainly wont be getting any special treatment from her,Turns out bigshot celebrities are just as bad if not worse than averagejoe customers,166

Ayverie,78,26,1pi69x,66,Mini background Ive been working at a major grocerystore chain in Canada for the past  years Ive done various departments from the clothing dept to cash and to stocking fresh produce Onto Jesus LadyFirstly I apologize for the upcoming wall of text Jesus Lady requires some description and detail in order to get the image of this woman across So every month either at the beginning or end depending on when her welfaredisabilitypensionunemployment cheques come in this woman would come grocery shopping sometimes alone sometimes with her husband the poor man Now we get a lot of people at around these times due to the aforementioned cheques Normally she wouldnt really stand out but she didnt get the name Jesus Lady for nothing Jesus Lady was this slightly frail unkempt older woman who occasionally walked with a cane She would often berate cashiers and stay at the cash well after her order was purchased bagged and put into the car by her husbandchildren The reason she stayed behind was to try to convert the cashiers to Christianity Normally if it were a brief chat we would be able to push it aside but she would remain behind for at least an HOUR blocking up aisles for cashes and distracting cashiers from their work If they didnt respond well she would often become angry and aggressive in her tactics so more often than not the cash manager would kick her out after so much time So long story short we called her Jesus Lady because we didnt know her name and she spent an insane amount of time trying to convert us Onto my experience with Jesus LadyAt this time I was working in the bakery section It was Halloween so a lot of staff were dressed up One coworker Ill call him Duro was dressed up as a manager and I was wearing a Little Red Riding Hood costume these are a bit important In the middle of our night all of a sudden I and a few others notice that Duro had suddenly been captured by Jesus Lady She was in the middle of her usual spiel trying to convert him telling him to praise the lord and all that jazz sorry if that offended anyone So the others and I devised a plan to get Duro free from her clutches We called a manager to the back of the store and I hurried over pretending that we needed him for an emergency Worked like a charmUntil Jesus Lady commented on my costume Said it was cute I thanked her I go to move away but she kept talking about random little things Now I was raised not to leave midconversation and Ive always been a bit too nice At this point it didnt work out well for meEventually she began angrily talking about a Muslim cab driver she had had the horror of meeting She said that while he drove he attempted to convert her to Islam and he kept referring to the Qran Honestly at this point I dont care Until she asked me what my name meant Me Well its a Hebrew name but Im not JewishJL So youre ChristianMe Uhno Im actually far from Christian Its just really not for me I wont get angry if someone else is Christian its their choice and if I can respect their choices I expect them to respect mine Jesus Lady however decided that this wasnt right She began to perform her spiel attempting to convert me She ended her sentence with You ARE ChristianMe No Im notJL Yes you are You are Christian at heartMe Maam Im really not Christian at all At this point I was getting frustrated She kept trying to push me to convert to her beliefs and it was particularly annoying since she had been complaining about her Muslim cab driver Hypocritical muchEventually I manage to pry myself away from her and hide for a period of time in the back of the store Duro was back there laughing his ass off at me and I hit him jokingly We hid there for about an hour doing work and when we looked through the plastic windows on the doors separating the backstore from the front of store we noticed that Jesus Lady was patiently standing there by the door with her cart Apparently shed been standing there the entire time waiting for us to come out It was like some strange horror scene when the bad guy is an overly excited Christian missionary We hid there for even longer and eventually she seemed to get tired and just left This was the first time she had actually waited for someone to reappear for her From that point onward Duro and I were very cautious at the beginningend of the month and always had coworkers looking for Jesus Lady for us I would have gone into more detail of what Jesus Lady said but it was a few years ago and I didnt really listen to most of what she said after the first minute The You are Christian bit really stuck with me though because she was just making these assumptions without any fact Fortunately we havent seen Jesus Lady anytime soon Im not sure why maybe she switched supermarkets maybe they moved or maybe Im just never there when shes there But not seeing her has created this collective sigh of relief amongst all of the longtime employees Now I just want to point out that Im not against Christianity and I did not come up with the name for her Im very respectful of others beliefs and I expect others to respect my own Im very tolerant until someone tries to convert me or my friends without regard towards our personal beliefs And Jesus Lady really liked to push our buttons Anyway thats just one fantastic tale about Jesus Lady Let me know if you ever want me to collect some more and share them ,A Fantastic Tale about Jesus Lady,92

Moonlesschris,4,12,1phjyu,0,A while back I needed to buy a few items from a supermarket  I was low on funds so I dipped into my change reserve  I rolled my coins and proceeded to the supermarket  Upon arrival I decide to take the rolled coins to customer service to exchange them for bills to make it easier on the check out cashiers  I wait in line to be seen and when I get to the counter I present the coins and request cash  The SUPERVISOR informs me that We dont do that here  I was a bit taken back and felt that she might have misunderstood my intent  I replied that I was simply trying to make it easier for the cashiers  She then directs me to the coinstar  I looked at the ROLLED coins and mentioned that the coins were already counted  She grew more concerned and her eyes widened and she spoke to me as if I had a gun pointed at her head  I did in fact ask if she was on drugs After which I decided to just go to the coinstar  As I had to unroll the coins into the coinstar I ended up with two receipts due to a time out  I was charged around  to have my counted change counted again  As I walk around the isles to kill time I see a large man who was not round fat but shapes fat Dane Cook  He resembled a sickly looking cancer patient with red eyes  He was giving orders to a young guy who was moving pallets  My eyes were then drawn to the large mans name tag  The name escapes me because the memory of his title eclipsed every other thought  He was a SUPERVISOR  I quite literally stood in aww as I watched him spout orders in mumbly voice  Finally I break away and continue on my adventure  As I reach the check out lane I figured that I would have to pay more then I what I had in change  After I received my total I handed the cashier my two coinstar receipts and readied my wallet to pay off the remaining balance  After scanning the receipts the cashier hands me tender in the amount of the balance Approx   At this point I was fed up with dealing with the employees of this establishment that I did not care to correct the mistake  I gathered my things and walked out the door  Never to return to this place again,The  no longer refers to the bottom of the barrel,2

rugbygirl,22,28,1ph8yi,120,Background I work the front desk at a high end hair salon in the USA Whenever the company hires a new person they put them through a roughly  month long paid internship program to get them up to the standard of excellence expected from each technician During this time they are referred to as junior stylistscolorist The juniors are able to take appointments during this time but the prices are about half of what the least expensive full price haircutcolor would cost with a full priced technician The salon operates on a level system meaning the longer a tech has worked there generally the more expensive their prices to reflect their skill level The salon is also departmentalized so stylists only cut hair and colorist only colorSo seeing a junior for a service is a great deal You get high quality work done for half or more than half the price of full priced services most juniors have worked in other salons so they have experience and they are also supervised by a mentor who checks their work before the juniors guest leaves Also anytime a new guest comes in they receive a thank you packet of coupons for being new to the salon and to give them and incentive to come back These coupons do not apply to junior services as they are already heavily discounted although it does not expressly state that in the fine print on the coupons people frequently give us a hard time about this Story When I had just finished training and was working my first closing shift alone I get a phone call literally  mins before we close pm I pick up with my normal pleasant greeting get no greeting in return just a yeah I want to see a junior colorist I asked what kind of color service she needed to get done and told her the days the junior worked That was the first problem the days the junior worked werent good for her schedule or someone had already booked an appointment at the time she wanted Im doing everything I can to make this work somehow but she is getting more and more frustrated with me She then tells me she wants to book a time  mins before close not a time I offered as available I calmly try to explain that we do not book color appointments that close to closing time because it will take  mins to apply the color and another mins to an hour for it to process By the time she would be shampooed and blow dried that would be about an hour and half past close and we simply do not book color appointments that wayThis is when she lost her damn mind She starts yelling at me saying So you just kick people out the door as soon as you close This is ridiculous Im trying to come in and give you my money Ive been on the phone with you for  mins it had been  or mins max and you cant seem to work the computer I once again calmly tried to explain that no we do not kick people out as soon as we close but we do book color appointments in a way that allows for them to end before or right as we are closing She then proceeds to go on a huge rant about how shell have to miss her grandsons baseball game and hell be so upset and blah blah blah All Im thinking is I dont care please just give me your name so I can book this appointment and go homeShe finally gave me her name I put her down for an appointment that would allow her to leave halfway through her grandsons game and before getting off the phone she says oh wait I have one of those new guest coupons My heart sinks because I know exactly which coupon shes talking about and I was also fairly certain it would not apply to a junior service The coupon is for  off color which would make the  service she wanted  a service that at its cheapest full price is  I tell her that I am pretty sure the coupon would not apply as the junior services are already heavily discounted and she starts to read me the fine print on the coupon in a snarky voice saying it says nothing about junior technicians My voice starts to shake as I once again try to explain that I am almost positive the coupon will not apply and she loses it again this time attacking my personally saying I am the worst customer service person she has ever had to deal with she cant afford it she cant use the coupon she is gonna have to miss her grandsons baseball blah blah you suck blah blah When she finally stops I tell her I will have my manager contact her in the morning She tells me one more time how incompetent I am and hangs upI called my manager immediately on the verge of tears and still semi shocked at what just happened I had worked customer service before but never had someone treat me that poorly My manager is able to calm me down tells me I didnt do anything wrong and that I was absolutely right this crazy woman cannot use the coupon for a junior service I will never understand why people think it is ok to be so rude to customer service employees Edit Sorry Im such a noob at this Hopefully this formatting is better and I tried to cut some of the fat from the storyTLDR Woman wanted to use coupon on an already heavily discounted service and called me the worst customer service person she has ever had to deal with,What do you mean I cant double

southdubify,35,39,1ph6uj,164,First time poster and all that so bear with me guys Albeit this isnt a story from the employee but rather from a customerLast Tuesday I invited some of my friends over to my house In preparation for this gathering I went to my nationwide superchain grocery store here in AmericaAll was well and I had finally gathered up all my things I made my way over to the selfcheckout lane and waited for my turn There was already someone in line so I waited without giving it much thought After about  minutes or so I looked up and noticed that there were already about three tills open so I spoke up to the customer in front of my lets call him Illiterate Idiot The conversation went as followsMe Hey man that till over there is open if you want to head overII Im just waiting for one of these employees to tell me which ones take cashFair enough even though this information is clearly posted on the tills themselvesMe Thats cool there are three tills open  but I think that one over there says that it takes cashII EXCUSE me Do you work here Do youMe No but I can read a signII Hey if you feel the need to go just hop on over otherwise shut your bitch ass upMe FineI then proceeded to take the only till open that takes cash As Im checking out I hear him ask an employee which ones take cash The employee proceeds to tell him that the one I took was the only one that takes cash He looked over and I waved my card at himI just dont get some people They wont accept any sort of help But I guess it doesnt matter karma is sweet in the end,Self Checkout is Hard,203
jumpityjump,6,7,1ph4e2,52,Ive been addicted to reading TFR for a week now and can relate to so many of the stories here so I thought it was time to add my ownBackground I work on the cellar door at a very busy winery in a popular wine region Basically my job involves talking people through our wines pouring wines selling as much wine as possible and ensuring customers have the best possible experience We get all sorts of interesting customers and no shift is without its storyI had only been working there a couple of weeks when this first story occurred We had just swapped over vintages with our red wines from  to  and hadnt had a chance to update the tasting notes yet so the vintage on the notes was not what we were tasting We were all careful to make customers aware of this and make it clear what they were tasting and no one had a problem until the Grumpy Old Man GOM came along It was the end of a very busy day when GOM and his wife came up for a tasting I gave them my usual chirpy greeting and asked what they would like to taste I always try to make conversation with customers and build a rapport but all I got from this man was huffing and grunting and displeased looks In my distraction with the busy bar I forgot to tell him about the change in vintages though it was clearly marked on the bottle in front of him At the end GOM decided that he like the Shiraz and wanted to buy a bottle of the  at which point I had to explain that the one he tasted was actually  and did he still want to buy the now more expensive  or the one he tried Next thing I knew I had a tantrum on my hands He was screaming about false advertising how incompetent I was how he wanted to buy what he tried but he wanted it to have been the older vintage and he didnt want the younger one actually I dont think he knew what he wanted I had no idea how to deal with this  and his poor wife obviously took pity on me as I tried to come up with a solution to keep him happy and she tried to make conversation while her husband fumed She asked me So dear which wine is your favourite here To which her husband snapped SHE WOULDNT KNOW THAT and stormed off to the car Apparently being a young new cellar door assistant means I had no idea what I personally liked to drink His wife bought a bottle of something and hurried off after him apologising profusely ,How would she know what she likes tales from a winery,59
throwawayaccount,7,9,1ph2w2,55,This is a short story  So a customer came bought some small items left it was nice and easy  Next customer in line comes slams his hand on my desk and yells at me for not having another cashier open even though the only the  people were in the line him and the customer I helped previouslySo this rude guy wants to buy some  product  I scan it  Then he hands me a printout of our stores flyer saying the product is on sale for  off  However the printout starts on the next day  If you are signed up through email you get the eflyer a day early Now normally I dont mind changing the price  Managers let me have that authority  However since this guy was so rude I just pointed at the date and said no  He kept arguing with me but I refused to change the price  He demanded to speak to my supervisor  I got the one that was near by since I suspected he heard everything  He stood by my decision  Customer ended up getting super mad but bought the thing anyways,Always be nice to your cashiers and they will return the favor,64
OrbOfConfusion,17,11,1ph289,36,First post here just started working a cash register at a casual restaurant  no waiters you order up front with me and we bring you your food So no one really makes tips  We do have little cups by the registers that are technically tip jars but since pretty much no one ever tips the customers mostly use them as take a penny jars Whatever its annoying but in over a month Ive made less than  in tips so Im not missing out on much relevant So this older crabby guy OCG comes in and orders a sandwich and stuff I ring him up and his total is say  Something like that I dont remember exactly He counts out  dollars in bills and starts looking at his coins Yay for exact change But he ends up handing me exactly   Me Alright sir I just need one more centOCG Take one from here He indicates the tip jar as though this was the most obvious thing in the world and I shouldve known to do it on my own Me Sir its empty I hold the cup up to show him  OCG Well I dont have another penny Go find one Now we were busy that day There was a line forming behind him I was not going to leave and go around to the other registers and look for pennies in our tip jars no less to give this guy  Me I cant do that sir  OCG Cant you just get it Its just a penny He throws his hands in the air in disgust Me Sorry sir I need   I mean I guess I couldve just taken the money he had but Ive been reprimanded by my managers for being a few cents off on my drawer before and that was just from regular human error I wasnt going to purposely make it worse And Im pretty sure at this point the guy wanted me to reach into my own wallet and give him a penny OCG Fine He waves his hand at me to give him back his money  I hand it back to him and he slaps a  bill in my hand Here I get my fake cheery voice on Heres your change sir have a good day He harumphs at me and walks off My coworker saw the exchange and puts one of his own pennies in the jar for me in case it happened again Just to be clear if youre super nice to me Ill probably be willing to dig around in the other registers for a penny for you but I definitely wont take an amount less than the total to put in the register Its policy and I thought it was obvious to everyone But apparently its my job to run my ass off to get you one cent just so you avoid having a few coins in change ,Im a penny short Go find one for me then,47

thetarget,11,5,1pgu6o,6,Just wanted the opinion from checkout employees cashier customer service bagger other counter workers How do you feel about the use of self checkout registers Is is a cold shoulder from the business with them to much effort to eliminate cost Or do you get the same joy thinking you can use the registers to get out faster then the longer line with an employee to help youAnd last any stories of others or yourself using these machines,self checkout,11
C,19,33,1pgqj8,108,Hi there TFR Im never really sure where to post my stories as I work in retail Box Office but I also work at the front desk So Ill post this here first and if people think that it would work in rtalesfromthefrontdesk as well I might pop it on there alsoAs you can see from my previous post here months ago I work in a busy multivenue theatre in the UK With three venues multiple shows on a night in each so it can get quite manic Especially when you have  sold out shows exiting at the same time and you still have customers trying to collect tickets for the later shows And they all have to go through the foyer Thats what was happening at this moment in time It was a Saturday night I was two thirds through a  hour shift We had two sold out venues exiting one from the basement and one from the main house  both around  people so nearly  in total And countless people trying to collect at the box office for out shows later that nightA family of four came up from downstairs as far as I could tell they were an elderly couple grandparents their middleaged daughter and her adult son They decided to stand right in front of me I could see there were people trying to get through to the Box Office but these ignorant oblivious people just stood there talking about how quaint the theatre was and how exciting it was to be offWest EndThe son was finishing off a glass of wine so I thought they would be going back into our bar When they didnt move I stood up and as nicely as I could muster asked them to either make their way outside or into the bar so that the foyer which is a fire exit can be kept clear and people can get to the box office The middleaged woman just looked at me with such contempt and venom that such a lowlevel servant had dared spoken to them She then spat out Were leaving in a secondI replied with a Thank you very muchThe son then finished off the last dreggs of his wine and placed the large glass right bang in front of meNow as I said I work at the box office Not the bar The bar is less than  feet from the box office Now it was busy as it was a Saturday night but there were tables right by the entrance that someone could leave down a glass if they so wanted to without going into the actual bar Another thing to note is that there is a small bar in our downstairs venue They are both run and staffed by the same company When he put the glass down I looked up at him and said Im sorry sir but you cannot leave that here if you could kindly bring into the bar I would really appreciate it as we cant deal with glass hereThe grandfather replied incredulously We were ushered out of downstairs and didnt have time to bring it to the bar down thereMEI apologise if you were moved out quickly but we do have another show down there in half an hour and we need the turn around time This glass can be brought into out main bar just behind youThe son then went to pick up the glass cue shocked gasps and I thanked him Thinking that that is one less THING I have to deal with tonightBUT Just as he picked it up his mother  this guys own mother  took the glass out of his hand and placed it defiantly back down all the while staring straight at me I tried to say something but words would not come I sat there speechless until they started to move out Both me and my colleague who had witnessed the whole thing started to actually shout after them Excuse me SIR Your glassBut he just turned around and gave the biggest shit eating grin I have ever seen It just said I am better than you and I know itI was angry the rest of the night that I had to go onto raww to calm myself downTLDR Selfentitled middleclass family decide that treating people like something they scraped off their shoe is a better example to their children then showing some respectgt,Excuse me SIR,141
FredFltStn,302,753,1pgoim,1625,BACKGROUND  I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heavenSTORY  Welcome to the week of scam artists They rarely get away with it but that sure doesnt stop them from tryingOne of my cashiers was ringing up a large order when she flagged me down She noticed that the price sticker on one of the items was wrong and wanted to let me know so we could fix it We occasionally screw up once again Im talking about you Josh and misprice stuff When we do we always sell it to the customer at the marked price since it was our fault Well then go back and fix the mistake on any remaining inventory on the shelfThe item was a large mortar kit that retails for  buy  get  free The price tag on it said  so the female customer was definitely going to get a deal on our screwup I walked over to the shelf to check the price on the remaining products but they all seem to be ok so I went back to helping other customersA minute later I get flagged down again for another price check Its another large item and its priced for less than half of what it normally sells for I make a mental note to castrate Josh then go to check out the remaining items Once again they all seem to be priced correctly but I did notice that a different package on the shelf was totally missing a price tag I grabbed a price gun and tagged the package missing a stickerI barely finished putting a sticker on the item when Im flagged down AGAIN Now the customer starts fuming and berating my cashier about what screw ups we are She really starts to raise hell so I apologize and tell her that well take care of the issue I also remind her that even though the items were mispriced we were giving them to her at the lower priceI go to check the item on the shelf and once again all of the remaining inventory seems to be priced right Now my spider sense is tingling I walked back to the counter to help the cashier ring in the rest of the itemsAmazingly I noticed that at ALL of the larger items that the woman has brought to the counter are mispriced All of her large items no matter what the original price now have a price tag of  I stopped the transaction looked the lady in the eye and told her Im not selling you anything and you need to leave nowDo you remember the scene from the movie The Exorcist where Father Merrin Max von Sydow tries to expel the demon from Reagan Linda Blair The scene that unfolded at my tent was very similar to that but with less head spinning and more swearingIm in my s and I honestly believe that I learned a few new words that day She combined swear words and ethnic slurs that Im fairly certain have never been used together before She wove an amazing tapestry of obscenity punctuated occasionally by wild arm waving and the liberal use of her middle finger I think she could have honestly set some type of world record but I apparently threw off her rhythm when I started applauding her performanceI offered to call the police and have them sort it out but she was apparently uninterested and made a beeline for the door The sad thing was she would have gotten away with it if she had just changed the price on one or two items In retrospect I really need to train my staff better My cashier actually did a great job in spotting the mispriced items but when I started to applaud the impressive display of obscenity none of my staff joined in Ill be adding that to our Standard Operating Procedures SOP before the upcoming New Years EveIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,She would have gotten away with it if she wasnt so greedy Tales From a Fireworks Tent,2378

RattsWoman,9,19,1pfxxn,89,Ah the age old argument of retail the argument of whether or not the cashier gave the customer their change Now folks Ive had my fair share of trying ordeals with customers from being a victim of racism to being indirectly blamed for moldy raspberries but last nights events takes the cake so far anywayIll put the tldr up here because this is probably the lengthiest recount of events Ive ever hadTiny old lady angrily and violently accuses me of stealing her change ends up being accused of stealing her own groceriesIm at my register putting through a customers order when I see a customer that I had just had maybe  minutes prior Shes tiny feeblelooking in her oversized parka and winter hat and looks to be no younger than  years old The items she placed on the belt were the exact same items she brought through earlier Im thinking Maybe she forgot that she bought these items already so when its her turn I smile and ask Didja forget something She immediately responds in anger with Yes You didnt give me my change I bought      items slams each item on the belt as she counts  and you asked me for a nickel her total was  and I gave it to you along with twenty dollars to pay for this and you never gave me the receipt OR my changeI calmly inform that I did indeed give her her  change and she must have misplaced it to which she angrily continues No you didnt Im not stupid I went to the bank and got twenties in my wallet and after I came through here I have one less twenty and no change This is when the next customer in line begins defending me coolly saying Maam youre not going to get what you want if you keep behaving this way and the old lady replies to her You shut your mouth and mind your own business I even ask the old lady if shes implying that Im stupid enough to not give her her change The defending customer keeps trying to calm the lady down and attempting to make her see reason which is when this tiny little old lady yells at her in her tiny old lady voice You dont shut up Ill punch you in the mouth You bitch Mind your own business She didnt give me my money and youre being a bitch thats what you are At this point I almost died because it was too hilarious but also kinda scary that I was even in this situationOld lady demands to speak to my manager about me so I told her to go ahead Ill call him for her if shed like meanwhile Im very shaky and upset by this whole ordeal She shuffles away to the service desk to complain some more and my lane is shut down after helping my last very helpful customer in order for my tray to be audited I was perfect My superiors printed out the receipt to show the lady and I resume working From this point on Im not  sure of what happened because I was working and not involved with the actions taken afterward I assume the old lady didnt believe the printout so they got the acting manager to review security camera footage This lead to a comedy of errors Acting Manager only reviewed the tape up to the most recent time the old lady was in my line This footage showed her placing her items on the belt then placing them back in her buggy and walking away after some time making it look like I let her get away with stealing so now I was in trouble and that no actual transaction had taken place As you can guess little old lady was now accused of attempting to steal her  worth of groceries I can only imagine how frustrated and infuriated she became and acting manager had had enough at that point told her Maam theres nothing more I can do You tried to steal these items and no transaction took place between you and the cashier If you want to call the police then by all means go ahead but there is nothing I can do now I didnt see when she left but when I went on my break I was told that she was caught stealing I became confused and then realized that they didnt look far enough back in the tape so I informed them of this Of course it showed me handing the lady her  change and her receipt all in one hand so alls well that ends well We all had a good laugh about this lady accusing me of stealing her money and ends up being accused of stealing her own groceries However I was so rattled by this whole thing that I clocked out half an hour early by accident only to be stopped by a supervisor asking me uhhh where do you think youre going I have you for another half an hour I laughcry and clock back in The relief I felt when it was actually the end of my shift was indescribable and Im glad Im not back in until end of this week,You dont shut up Ill punch you in the mouth   year old tiny lady,108
YoshisIsland,4,10,1pfwsg,48,After many years in retail I have finally escaped the shackles that bound me and have entered the work force I have a cubicle and everything As a last hoorah I give you one of the last amusing things that happened to me on the jobOne of our regular and very annoying and cheap customers came in with a return She chose an item of the same value thinking she could make an exact exchange Heres the thing  she used a coupon on the first item and our policy is that once you use a coupon its gone unless you exchange for the exact same item in a different color or sizeShe proceeded to throw a huge fit  she grumbled about how unfair it was and argued with me as I continually told her I couldnt give her the coupon back While Im returning the item she inquires so is this item still full price I am suspicious Yes  I told her Let me stop and note that our store policy for returns without a receipt is current selling price in the form of a merchandise credit I am holding the receipt in my hand as I process the transaction and she has the audacity to say cant you just pretend I dont have my receipt and give me full price on a merchandise cardI struggled not to laugh and instead put on my straightest face That would be dishonest I have your receipt in my hand She had paid half of the full price with the damn coupon Anyway she angrily walked out with her friend as she loudly explained what had just happened As soon as she was gone I laughed out loud and told my coworkers the storySo long retail ,Free at last A final story,58

notmyfaultyousuck,36,46,1peoo0,169,Background I work as a cashier in a small town grocery store where yes the prices are expensive but thats because its a small town and the next nearest grocery store is  minutes away by car Take it or leave itEither way I have been working at this grocery store for over  years now and there is this one customer who is absolutely dreadful to deal with Every time he comes in he huffs around the store complaining speaking rudely to the cashiers and being genuinely annoyingAbout three weeks ago he came in and wanted to return two empty L water bottles for two new ones not a problem whatsoever However my coworker who was in the express counter with me that day spoke French as her first language and misunderstood this English speaking customer She did the return without charging him for new water bottles and this man erupted in anger He began yelling at her leaning over the counter so his face was right in front of hers and was calling her uneducated because she cant understand simple mathematics She ran into the back of the store and started cryingI went up to the store manager after the incident with my coworker and gave a detailed account of what happened and a description of what he looked like My store manager said he would handle the situation next time he came in and was pointed out to himIts been three weeks and this man has been on a rampage every single day because he shops at our store every single day and needless to say none of the cashiers want to deal with him and my boss has done nothing about him despite having pointed him out more than once This customer yells at us over prices loud enough to draw attention to himself and he treats us disrespectfully by saying I spend so much money here I might as well just pay your salary from my own damn pocket When I tell my boss I dont want to deal with being treated that way any more he just says that he has it under control and hell deal with it Im frustrated because that man gets under my skin every shift and nothing is being doneSorry for the wall of text I just needed to tell you guys and get this off my chest,Customer makes cashiers lives a living hell every day,215
LameCake,6,7,1peha3,40,I work at a childrens entertainment facility that allows people to have birthday parties and a private room for a pretty low price My party for the day had shown up and according to the books they were expecting about  children The birthday boys were twins this is relevant The mom shows up with her twin boys and a few other guests I show them back to their room the biggest one and the mom exclaims that its a very big room I ask how many more people she is expecting and she tells me about  more So oh well not the  people we were expecting and I have a big room to clean afterwards no biggie I get the drinks out and Im conversing with the guests when the mom asks if its  guests that shes paying for and the two birthday boys and two parents that are free this is to participate in the games At our company the birthday children are included in the  guests for the base price and each person after that is   I explain this to her and she says the person who booked her party told her differently I tell her that it has always been the the birthday children are included in the  guests and it could have been a misunderstanding I say this all in my nice hostess voice and she says okay and I head to the front to great any more party guests The mom comes up after some time with a guy who I assume is the dad She asks for my coworker who happened to be in the party room stocking plates and cups when my conversation with the mom took place He goes out there and the dad tells him that they were told that the birthday boys would be free and that they werent told that they would have to pay for them too All the while the dad is exclaiming that this is bull shit but not a big dealwtf and that they just want to get back to enjoying their party If its not a big deal then why is he making a big deal I understand wanting to clear it up but he came on kind of aggressive in very hushed tones and a big ground standing this is what we were told attitude I knew I was doomed right then no tip for me My coworker directs them to our manager and he tells them the same thing but will call the person who booked the party whom is the ownerNow lately there have been some mistakes on cake orders made by him as well as names of parties but I dont think he would actually tell a person that the birthday kids are free as this has NEVER been policy He usually explains in great lengths what is to be expected in what they are paying forThe owner says no this is not what he told them and even explained that it would be the two boys and six guests for the base price and  each person after He caves a little and says instead of having to pay for two birthday children to just combine it to one Great now we are at  Since I am still confused as to how many people are showing up and the first game is about to go in with still only  guests I go back and ask the mom how many people in total again She say  Since this greatly affects how many pizzas I make I make four pizzas With  guests I should only make  Guess what no one else shows upThe manager tries to tell the mom whats going to happen now but she doesnt want to hear it and to just tell the dad I end up telling the dad after I serve everyone pizza that instead of having to pay for two children the well just combine it to one He shakes his head and says whatever a couple of times in a  dont want to hear it demeanor Okaaaayyyyy Im sorry that your expectations were miscommunicated but this is how it works In any case you HAVE to pay for a minimum  guests so even if the owner decided to say dont charge for the birthday boys they would have paid the same exact price because it would have been  guests The rest of the party goes without a hitch and the children were actually some of the best children Ive had Paying for the bill time comes and no tip TLDR Expecting to pay for  guests wants birthday children to be free only  guests show up,Dont Shoot the Messenger,47
BigMacisBP,46,15,1pegr1,74,TFR I need your input on something I may or may not have been that asshole customer this past weekend and I need some input on what happenedSaturday I was sent out with list of honeydos while my hubby was at work One of them was to pick up a few items corn syrup food coloring and some sparkling cider because srsly sparkling ciderfrom the store for a zombie crawl that we were going to that night I managed to find a lane that was not too terribly overwhelmed with people maybe three or four parties each group with less than  items a piece In my wait I noticed two managers standing a bit away from me in womens softlines Both of them were quite literally leaning on a rack of clothes shooting the breeze Now I happened to work for this particular company in the past and currently being a manager at my current company I found it annoying to see the two of them doing effectively nothing but wasting oxygen I put it out of my mind until I was second in line approximately three to five minutes later when the cashier says to the party in front of me that they would need to pay with a card as she did not have cash in her drawer to make change I asked her if she in fact had said that she had no cash in her drawer and that she was only able to accept cards to which she confirmed Now my first thought was I admit why the hell didnt she say anything sooner or have a sign up but I took stock of the lanes and realized that the store actually had more lanes open than was normal and all of them were at least  people deep so I backed off and gave the cashier credit for moving people along as fast as she could However as I turned my sights fell to the two managers who were still shooting the breeze And I kinda slipped off my rocker a little bit I walked up to the two of them and in my most pleasant voice simply saidExcuse me while the two of you are standing here holding this rack of clothes down and making sure it doesnt float away your cashier over on  has no cash in here drawer and the department you are standing in needs help with its zoningI turned on my heel and walked away To which they hollered after meThanks sir well take care of itI walked to the end of the store to find another register Another  minutes later I am walking out and low and behold the two of them are still standing there ensuring that the laws of gravity over that one rack of clothes didnt suddenly cease to exist So TFR was I out of line for calling the managers out like that And for those who would interject that I didnt know what they were talking about I know what shooting the breeze looks like and these two were armed with bazookastldr  attacked by giant glittersneezing pandas while at cancan practice for Macys Day Parade,TFR was I out of line,89

lexarqade,10,24,1pe2i2,149,I work in a very small wine store that rents some space out from a much bigger grocery store The entire store is maybe  feet wide by  feet deep Despite being a small store we get quite a bit of business due to the fact that we are located literally right beyond the cash registers  You absolutely cannot miss us if you exit the storeAnyway our store closes at pm sharp which causes some confusion because our host store closes at midnightYesterday I had just closed the store which involves pulling in all of the displays as well as putting the gate across the front but not locking it To a normal person we looked  closed As I was counting the till and doing some paperwork some guy came up to the gate and pushed it aside then tried to grab something off the shelf which he couldnt do as there was literally no room to moveNot even asking if we were closed It took a few tries to get him to clue in that he should leave,We are in fact closed,173

FredFltStn,170,534,1pdzxx,1353,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square foot of fireworks heavenSTORY  I think this week Im going to focus on stories about people who try to scam me They rarely get away with it but that sure doesnt stop them from tryingWe had two customers that came into the store and announced to the cashier that they were looking to spend around  and wanted to pick up a lot of fireworks My dad greeted them and offered to show them aroundDad went through the spiel and started showing them videos and helping them out The entire time these two were trying to work a better deal I know most people dont try to haggle when shopping at their local Target store but hey I get it its a fireworks tent and the truth is we usually are willing to haggle a bit especially if youre picking up a lot of stuff These guys definitely took it to the next levelMy dad is one of the nicest people youll ever meet but this type of thing wears on him pretty fast especially when someone is obviously going over the top Its one thing to offer a lower amount for an item but when you start criticizing the products or my store my dad is going to quickly lose interest in helping youAfter about  minutes of this I could see dad was pretty much over these guys so I walked up and told them that if they were going to pick up a lot of stuff we would just give them  off their total order They immediately protested that that wasnt good enough but I was pretty firm I already know that Im cheaper than anyone else and  is a substantial discount Hell the only reason I did  is because my dad was tired of dealing with them and I wanted to get them out of the storeThe guys finish picking out their stuff and go to check out They fill out the liability waiver and the cashier starts to ring in their stuff After the cashier rings in their purchase she waves me down and I walked over to the counter to see what the issue wasTweedle Dum and Tweedle Dumber TD were trying to pay with two  gift certificates Now I give away a LOT of gift certificates on the radio and during sales promotions The thing is I only give away  gift certificates These two idiots have obviously photocopied and altered a real gift certificate and are trying to pass it offNow Im pissedME  This is the worst forgery Ive ever seen You guys are idiotsTD  I won those on the radio Theyre realME  My gift certificates are printed on custom paper and I only issue  Gift Certificates These are colored scans of a gift certificate and theyre not realTD  Yes they areTD  Besides if youre gift certificates dont say no reproductions on them you can make copiesME  Yeah thats not what the law says What the law DOES say is that youre guilty of rd Degree Felony Theft for trying to steal  of fireworks their amount before the  discountTD  We didnt try to steal anythingME  You attempted to pay with a forged document Its the same as if you used a stolen credit card I have your name address and multiple witnesses and I fully intent to press charges You guys can stay until the cops arrive or they can arrest you at home doesnt matter to meTD  Thats not real We didnt steal anythingME  Oh because the last two times this has happened at my store never actually happened before the people were arrested and convicted of theft I guess well let the police sort it out If you cant pay for the fireworks its theftTD and TD start an intense negotiation between themselves that involves more than a little shouting at each other After a while they insist that Im wrong but theyre willing to pay with a credit card just to be done with it Theyre trying to figure out how to split up the  when I informed them that the total was  Theres no way in hell I was giving them a  discount after they tried to scam meIn the end they only paid for and received around  of fireworks and they had to split the charges over four credit cards between them to do that We were very careful with the signatures and I made the cashier copy down their drivers license numbers just in case they tried to dispute the charges To be honest I would have just let them leave if they had tried Its not really worth my time or effort to press it and I was actually just making it up as I went along because they pissed me offThey definitely didnt leave happy My dad couldnt resist when they were walking outDAD  You dumbasses come back and see us again next yearThey havent been backIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,Scam me and Ill scam you back Tales From a Fireworks Tent,1887
mbz,38,73,1pdz2g,331,So Im working in the final days of a grocery store that is closing its doors Despite two enormous easel type signs by each of the stores entrances another large sign right when you walk in the front and smaller signs taped to every door and scattered throughout the store I still get at least four customers every shift asking what is going on Oh it isnt like the store is fully stocked either As soon as you walk in you can see that signs have been removed displays are gone and shelves are near empty Not to mention most of the service departments have already shut down Excuse me you used to have x brand nuts over in the produce departmentdid you move them or somethingIm sorry but most of those items have been transferred to other stores Whatever is out on the sales floor is all we have leftWhat Why Are you remodeling or somethingMam did you miss the big signs at the entrance saying the store is closing Oh my gosh I had no idea Walks awayMost customers get the hint or sympathize with me and ask where I will be going now etc but I swear if you cant tell a business is closing I question how you were able to function to get to the store in the first place ,Yes sirmam the store is permanently closing Forever,404
JealousyGrey,15,48,1pdxfe,233,So I seem to see a lot of posts complaining about incompetant coworkers but not quite as many focused on giving them kudos So to give some appreciation to one of our fellow under appreciated retail brothers I am going to rant about a guy I shall call IanIan is a fairly nondescript guy in his thirties who was hired a little later than I was almost a year ago I dont know much about him outside of work but he spent some time in the military relevant and goes to the same community college I do He is one of the nicest friendliest people I have ever met Because he was in the military recently he follows every direction given to him by the managers They love him for this because they can tell him to do anything and they know it will get done He is often taken advantage of but if you ask him he would say he doesnt mind and he would mean itThis guy has stepped up to the plate time and time again going from cashier to customer service to electronics but he helps out wherever hes needed Im especially fond of him because he thinks nothing of running back and forth from electronics to customer service to help me out when he sees Im struggling Im new to CS so this is often Even though he was hired after me he knows almost everything there is to know about the three places hes worked in and a few things about the departments he hasntIan is also AMAZING with customers He is soft spoken and eventoned through even the most stubborn angry and belligerent people You seriously cannot faze this guy You know those times when you know there is nothing you or anyone else in the store can do to help the person yet they refuse to accept theyre wrong Then you have to pretend like youre doing everything in your power to help them and Ian is the ultimate service associate He goes through all the inventory logs looks up the item number upc goes to the store website anything it takesExample the reason Im writing this actually A woman comes in with a flat antenna she says she purchased in our store She has no receipt and doesnt know when she bought it or if she payed with one of her many cards so we cant look one up Since it is policy to get all electronics checked out by an electronics associate before they can be returned I call Ian up He looks it over okays it but when I begin to process it as a no receipt return it comes up as not in the system Ian and I both know that without a receipt there is nothing a manager can do so we dont bother calling one Instead while I deal with the massive line that built up Ian looks up the product in the computer system its not there Its not just Not On File its never been on file with the home office But this woman is POSITIVE she bought it in our store She remembers what the display looked like and everything She doesnt understand why we cant just look back to what turns out to be LAST CHRISTMAS we have a  day return policy and look up our inventory from that time But Ian takes it like a champ and looks up the item on the store website It turns out the item is sold through a third party vendor through our site so it wouldnt be on file anyway since she actually ordered it online Long story short Ian gets this formerly angry and stubborn woman to leave unsure and apologetic with the customer service information for the third party vendor in hand in less than  minutes Without once getting visibly annoyed or frustrated this guy was zen Afterwards of course we broke out in laughter because with some customers its all you can do TLDR Ian is magic everyone loves him and he will be an amazing manager one day,Coworker Rant,281
rossildosil,109,149,1pdp45,502,I work in a Large hardware store One time when I was out in the garden centre watering the plants this guy comes through the doors screaming his head off my manager calmly walks in behind him It turns out he saw some Lillys on the clearance section and decided that because they were reduced from  to  that the ones NOT in the clearance section should be the same priceThey get over to the Lillys and then the guy goes mental about how the same product shouldnt be different prices my manager calmly explains that its because the Lillys he saw in clearance had already bloomed hence them being reduced The argument went on and on with the guy hurling abuse at my manager for about  minutes meanwhile a small crowd had gathered next to me as I was hiding in the bamboo watching this all unfold at this point my manger lost it and began shouting back at him Telling him to get out the store and not to come back The angry gentleman then proceeded to knock plants over and kick the trolleys as he went towards the exit he did the same when he was in the actual store knocking over tins of paint on the ends of the aisles It took about  hours to clean up his rampage and we had to write off about  worth of stock due to the about of paint he knocked over and damaged other stuff on his way Edit not sure if the police were called or not I presume not I dont work there anymore but if Im in Ill ask,Argument over  causes  worth of stockloss,651

tristans,10,23,1pdakn,121,A bit of background I work at the only gas station in a growing town The procedure is we are never allowed to keep more than  in a register Anyways an older man who looked like he was either retired or a truck driver walks into the store as it begins to pick up its a Friday night so people are coming in to rent movies and to pick up snacks He approaches me and asks for a pack of cigarettes I grab a pack and begin to run him through when he pulls out a government cheque As standard procedure we only take cheques from very specific peoplewho our boss has cleared After I tell him we dont take government cheques he starts causing a fit telling me that theres no difference between his government cheque and paper money While I disagree i tell him that my boss has not told me to take government cheques I cannot accept his  cheque He tells me to call my boss annoyed I go to the phone and call both my bosses phones no anwser So I walk over and tell him I cant get a hold of them so I wont take it I also mention even if i could take it I would not be able to reemburse him the remaining  He tells me hes sick of senior discrimination and asks for my name Me not caring at this point tell him my first and last night Knowing he was full of shit and wasnt going to do anything He complained a bunch more and yelled Its on your ass He storms out in a storm of rage only for my normally quiet coworker to yell after him Have a nice day After an hour or two the bosses daughter calls and asks why we had called her Shes also a manager I fill her in on the details and she thanks me for dealing with him respectfully and that she appreciates that I didnt accept the check TLDR An older man wants to buy cigarettes with and  cheque I refuse and get commended from my boss for it,Its on your ass,144

ChiefMishka,5,8,1pd8f9,24,A department store is the locale for the story Ive been working at this store for a year this coming black friday my second day was black friday last year but enough about me This is about a coworker whose name shall simply be UE for Useless EmployeeUE is the type of worker you see come through in all lines of work Tries really hard to make it look like he is contributing but really doesnt do that much and every night you close with them you consider yourself a person down This one however seems to exhibit not a single working brain cell So aside from the usual things this type of worker might do in any job to make it look like they are working hard I thought I might list some of the special cases that have arisen during the few months I have worked with this personUE takes a call from a person who is asking if we carry suits While we dont sell sets we do have all the individual items suit jackets suit pants dress shirts ties dress socks dress shoes etc UE however jumps to the conclusion that the customer is only interested in a package that contains everything the customer might need and proceeds to tell the customer no we dont have suitsUE is on a register Personally I would rather have UE there than on the floor because he is slow and always misses stacks of clothes that need to be folded so one of us usually has to come along after UE is done and double check everything UE got a customer one day who wanted to return a suitcase Customer had the receipt so there wasnt a big problem with that Our return policy is that we can return it to the method of payment made If the customer paid with a credit card we return it to that card gift card goes back to a gift card cash or check or debit card is given as cash The customer made the purchase with credit card and UE gave him cash for the return which was a hundred or so dollars Mistake number one Mistake number two came when the customer then comes back to UE with a new suitcase trying to get a new suitcase but the customer wanted to exchange the suitcase they just returned for the suitcase they picked out So UE is having difficulty completing an exchange for the suitcase because the system shows that the suitcase being exchanged was already returned  minutes earlier by UEWe have a store credit card that we are constantly told to ask customers if they would like to sign up for We require photo ID to enter the customers information into our system and verify they are who they say they are I have heard UE asking the customer for this information out loud and wondered why when he could just read it off the ID I only recently learned that he has been known to not get an ID and just ask for all the informationHeres the story that prompted me to write this post Im working at the register but with no one in line I am just folding and separating returns as we were closing in an hour or so Both UE and another coworker well call him Ryan were cleaning the floor and talking about  feet away from myself It was far enough that I couldnt hear exactly what they were discussing but as a customer and her child younger than  walked by I did hear thisRyan I apologize for UE MaamCustomer Oh dont worry I hear far worse from my kidsThe customer and her child walk casually towards the doors and I wish them a good evening UE goes off to do something unproductive and Ryan comes over and asks me if I heard what UE had said I hadnt and he was relieved because he wanted to know if anyone else outside of those  feet had heard it UE had in their discussion pointed to his show and said This fucking thing loud enough that the customer had heard This saint of a woman however simply shrugged it off and was not bothered by it one bit UE had gotten very lucky that is wasnt one of the other thousands of customers that would have immediately asked for UEs name and a manager or that it was a manager who walked past,A Useless Coworker,32

LP,9,9,1pcnlf,23,Most of the posts here seem to be about funny quirky or horrible people I though you all could use a story of a lighter tone So last week a might I add very attractive woman came into the appliance department I work in She was looking for a new dryer and was very nice but had really no idea what she wanted So we spent the best part of  minutes going over all the new features since she last purchased a dryer and rather quickly started a conversation not appliance related We probably talked for close to an hour For any of you that have had an awesome customer that is content with a nice chat its quite lovely on a slow evening and makes the time pass quickly Being a man that pays attention to details such as nail polish color and things I made a mental note of things about her so I could remember her if she came back laterToday she comes back and I greet her like I just saw her yesterday The funny part was she did the same This time we taked business for about five minutes and over the course of the next fourty five minutes we talked and I finished her order usually takes six minutes Since Im paid hourly I dont care at all about taking that kind of time and it helps the time pass faster She never even lost interest in my speaking when I explained D printers to her and I nerded out for a bit If anything I was unaware of at the time it turned her on a bit We finish up her order and she leaves and my coworker female comes over with this silly grin on her face and asks me when the customer and I are going out I responded with something like she was interested in me Im totally oblivious to that sort of stuff I litterally need someone directing me and saying it  waved hands like airplane traffic director  My coworker laughs and said something like wow you are clueless she was totally in to you You should call her when you get off she points to the phone number of the customer on the order still on my screen Im not sure if I should call her or not but the point of the tale is that eventually despite all the assholes out there you will get some really nice customers that will make your day go nicely TLDR Beatiful woman comes into showroom Salesman is clueless and needs coworker to point out that the woman was totally into him,The actually quite plesant customer,32

bnkls,73,82,1pcccq,295,I work as a fry cook and cashier for a pretty busy fast food chain restaurant Ideally we have at least four people while the dining room is open so that theres one person on every station but lately weve been really understaffed From around  PM to  AM when the dining room closes theyll occasionally only leave us with three people which makes our order times skyrocket and exhausts whichever unlucky three have to stayA few weeks ago there were only three of us working when we got a huge rush after a baseball game ended We completely lost control and it was taking twenty minutes to get our front orders out I dont even know how long the drive through was taking Customers were shockingly forgiving about it presumably because our home team won if they lost Im sure we would have had a riot and eventually it slowed down enough for us to get everyones orders out and close the dining room for the nightAfter that was over we were all very stressed out but the grill guy seemed like he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown He was leaning against the wall with his hand over his chest breathing hard and complaining that his heart was beating rapidly and his chest hurt I had already clocked out and just decided to chat with him for a moment to see if maybe it would calm him down and offer him a cigarette He threatened to walk out or quit if he heard the drive thru beeping at us again but he ended up staying for the rest of the graveyard shift Apparently our shift leader and the morning shift leader wrote him up for basically having a bad attitude and being lazy that nightThe next day he doesnt show up and on the schedule our managers have written in No call no show by his name and crossed out his shifts for the rest of the week He comes in again about a week later and I ask him how hes doing he tells me that hes doing pretty shitty and hes been to several doctors that week He walks upstairs to talk to our manager and comes back out with an honest to god pink slipThe other day he came in and was leaving right as my shift ended so I walked with him and he explained to me that he had apparently had a minor heart attack that night hes in his early twenties holy shit and gotten a doctors note saying that he needed five days off of work At the end of the five days they fired him so he called HR and they offered to help him sue the management for wrongful termination He came in that day to get an official written reason for his firing for his lawyersSorry for the wall of text but thats every bit of information I have and Im really curious to find out what will happen next If everything he says is true and the company that my managers work for is going to help him sue them theyre definitely going to get fired right Or is there a possibility that theyre going to get out of this without any repercussions And are the omniscient people from corporate going to see my post and figure out exactly who I am and fire my ass I suddenly feel very paranoidId also appreciate any similar tales of workplace drama because Im really bored thanks,Is my boss going to get fired,377
Gamesrock,9,15,1pc87u,46,Three weeks ago I was at a convention with my friends Around lunch time we decided to look for some fast food restaurants to eat atTo save time and money So we take a  minute walk to one that I found on my google mapsIts around noon so the place is packed Not too big of a line but it was obvious we just missed the rush as I could see the employees scrambling to get all the orders done After waiting about  minutes it was my time to order After placing it I go wait across the ordering line  minutes later I hear my order number get called and I go up to the counter The employee who was handing me my order looked exhausted She was the one handling most of the lunch rush I took my food and said thankyou She looked at me smiled and said youre welcome in one of the most heartfelt ways I could have ever imaginedI think I was the only person during this lunch rush to say thatTo honest I was quite surprised Then again after being on this subreddit with all the crap most of you all deal with from customers I think she was quite surprised from actually hearing thankyou from a customers mouth,Kind words do still matter,61

numenorweeps,18,11,1pbrwb,60,I just need to vent a little bit so I can get this off my mind and go study for a test Its a pretty short story I worked open to close yesterday It was a normal Saturday Not terribly busy Today I was excited to go into work I only work on weekends so there are a few of my coworkers that I rarely or never get to see Today was a meeting so Id get to see them for once Not to mention after the meeting I was off for the day This is the first Sunday I havent worked on in about  months The meeting is the usual stuff Inventory coming up no cellphones on the floor need to get the stock room in the back organized etc Most of it is directed at one individual who nods and smiles and then promptly forgets everything said Not a big deal Then were told that the TM isnt happy with our store now Apparently whoever closed last night forgot to press the end of day button before they left which means he got a call around  or  and had to come up to press the button himself Well guess who was closing yesterday Me Of course I have no issue with that I know I messed up He has a right to be upset he doesnt live particularly close From what it sounds like he called the manager so she could call whomever was closing but she was in bed sick so he had to do it himself Im going to issued a written verbal warning Basically if it ever happens again on my watch I will be written up Thats all right Im in trouble but not really I know Ill never make the same mistake again so Ill be ok What I have an issue with though is that Im not the first person to do this but Im the one getting the warning Apparently our TM isnt upset that it happened hes upset that its happened three or four times over the last  months This is the first time Ive ever made any mistake My manager even told me such today I started working there in January my first job I might add By April I was a key holder By May they were having me train the new employees Other people people who have worked there for  or more years messed up a couple times prior to this and just had a finger shaken at them I however am halfway to a write up And its not because Im the new kid Our TM didnt know who did it He just issued a mass email to all the key holders saying that it couldnt happen again and telling our manager to issue the verbal written warning So Im being made an example of Im getting in trouble as a warning to the other key holders as well as the manager so it wont happen again Maybe its just me Maybe its because this is my first job and Im just not used to how the chain of command works or whatever But it seems to me that if you are going to issue an official warning for a mistake you should do it every time that mistake is made no matter who makes it not just when the mistake catches you on a bad day and inconveniences you I know that this really doesnt matter that much It doesnt affect me more than me having to sign a paper saying I know Ive done wrong If it was going to be more than that I know my manager would stick up for me But this TM really should not be in the position that hes in He will yell about the smallest things from not having a stopper on a hook that was just put out to finding a layer of dust on a counter to not making sales when we didnt have anywhere near enough people coming in to come close to the ridiculously high goal were given He smiles and takes you to lunch for a job well done one day and the next throws you under the bus when his boss comes to him with an issue The only thing that keeps me enjoying my job are the people I work with Its a very small tight knit group We all try to protect each other and make sure everybodys job is done We trade off on sales so that we all stay pretty well neck and neck If the store doesnt make goal no one makes goal We keep it fair and even The occasional drama always is fixed within a day and blows over within a week But our store has been picked to house the RM TMs boss starting in November Which means well be seeing a whole lot more of TM Well have a bunch of policy making bureaucrats in a store that doesnt fit in the mold theyve set the policies to Were the only store in the country inside a museum which means we have to cut corners and run things a little differently to accommodate the strange hours and the different set of people we deal with But now the policy makers are going to be at our store every day I am not looking forward to that ,Im the example,71
DarlingShivar,27,31,1pbql8,117,I do not have magic powers that allow me to estimate somethings weight based on its appearance I am not going to be able to cut this roast to make it the weight you want it exactly Also cutting a full roast into a weird shaped chunk is silly Similarly fish I need  pounds of salmon Cool but wouldnt you rather have a full fillet Or half a fillet Basically unless its bulk product something I can slowly pile a bit on until it reches the right weight asking for it by weight is really annoying and I feel like you can deal with a roast thats a whopping fifth of a pound heavier than you want I cant tell you how many fillets of salmon end up chopped in  pieces and nobody wants those size pieces just because someone insisted they get a fillet of an exact weight and it took a few tries,If you approach the service counter for a roast proper procedure is to pick one not ask for a specific weight,148

acciobrainyspecs,24,41,1pam5y,167,I put in my two weeks at the restaurant last night and I guess because of that the universe decided to remind me what I was going to be missingThe night was going smoothly I was flying high on the knowledge Ill be out of the industry by the th I got a large party that wound up containing a very old friend of mine I hadnt seen in years and I was feeling good despite the fact that my back was hurting like hell Whatever no biggie Im used to a tense back After my large party left I had a moment to run to the restroom and while sitting down I somehow dont ask me I dont know managed to wrench the hell out of my back It it hurt really bad Unfortunately it was a Friday night so I pretty much just sucked it up until about  minutes later when my back muscles start spasming and put me in tears I have a very high pain tolerance and coupled with being stubborn as a mule I put on a brave face and went with it until it slowed down and one of our lovely wonderful hosts finally asked our manager to cut me I had a lot of help from the hosts with taking the heavy extension off the table and clearing the heavier plates and our manager B gave me my checkout sheet early I started wiping down my tables and Im sure I was looking a little odd because I couldnt bend without incurring massive pain so I was periodically rubbing my back and bending stiffly at the knee to sweep and wipe my tablesI noticed a man at the table immediately next to my section watching me but I figured that he was just a bored single diner watching me do my thing in a rather humorously odd manner I was wrong He asked his server to send the manager over and B came out and sat down to talk to the guy Their conversation went thuslyMan Ive been watching this girl and you have come to check on her and several other people have come to check on herB Yes sir shes having some back pain so were trying to get her free so she can go homeMan I dont think shes having back pain at all You need to have her tested for drug useB Im sorryMan Shes clearly under the influence you need to have her tested for illicit drugsB turns to glance at me but the man stops himMan No no no Dont look dont alert herNow I should note I was standing RIGHT NEXT to this table sweeping I could hear every word this man urgently muttered to B It took an incredible amount of self control not to look up and say I can hear every word you are sayingB Sir shes not on drugs shes just in a lot of painMan You dont understand youre putting yourself at a huge risk for liability having her work here I guess you dont know who I am You NEED to have her testedB Sir Im not sure what you want me to do about thisMan You dont have to do anything it isnt hurting meB Im not sure what were talking about then Is everything else okayMan Oh yes the food is fantasticSo when B and I tell this to everyone in the back a large group of us are already laughing about this man B said it took everything he had not to glare at the man say Sir she is pregnant just to fuck with him Our kitchen manager told me I should put some lemonade in a glass and drop it off at his table and our assistant manager urged me to walk by the table scratching my arm sniffing and just generally fulfilling every cliche druggie tic we could come up with Now please note I am a homebody with homebody friends I have never done any sort of recreational drugs because it never came up and the only time I even drank under age was with my mother And even better I took a drug test three days ago for my new job Everybody agreed there was not a single more ridiculous person for him to single out as a junkieThe man left his server  Yes one cent And wrote on the bottom of the bill not going to say anything just saying  from manager on downsic We never did find out who he is but were having fun coming up with ideas my personal favorites are selfrighteous fuckhead and drug dealer you should have asked him for some muscle relaxantsTLDR Im a deaf drugged out ticking time bomb,Apparently I am on all the drugs,208

Kelnam,16,62,1paeto,184,I just found this subreddit today  Ive only been working in retail for a few months but I already have a few good storiesIm in high school right now and work summers at a large farmstand which is really just a mediumsized local produce store thats missing a couple of walls  Were known for a few products which we grow and make just down the road at a mediumsized farm and which have been described by many customers as the best that theyve ever tasted  Were in an area that gets a lot of summer tourism like literally  of houses in a nearby town are only occupied during the summer from rich snobby people from the nearest major city which is a rather large and wealthy one  The rich assholes from the city are typically called cidiots from city idiots and theres a lot of passiveaggressive hostility from the locals towards these people but most of the jobs and businesses out here depend on them to survive so we usually try to keep up appearancesOne of the foods we are known for is our tomatoes  They are of a unique variety that was developed by the owner of the farm and the stand  Theyre lb but everythings super expensive out here in the summer and a decent amount  of the people that vacation out here typically can burn  without blinking an eye so they sell well anywayAnyway around the weekend of July  one of our busiest times of the year this one cidiot lady walks in with her designer sunglasses and Louis Vuitton purse no different than the  other clones of her that dress exactly the same that walk in there every day  She browses for a while and stops to look at several boxes of tomatoes that we have stacked against a wall She approaches me and immediately asks to speak with my manager  Even though I am  certain I can answer her question or resolve her dispute by myself I oblige because its pretty much my policy that if someone is an especially stupid cidiot I try to give them what they want until they leaveThe lady stares at my manager with her hands on her hips in this confrontational pose and with the smuggest Gotcha look on her face says Your tomatoes are in boxes  That means they arent local  My manager somehow looks a bit incredulous for a second and then says Actually theyre grown right down the road  My boss buys those boxes so we dont have to carry them out of the field in our arms  Quite a few would get dropped if we did that  The lady instantly realizes her mistake and the  people that are watching the exchange suddenly turn from the shocked witnesses in her mind to the amused spectators of reality  She turned as red as the tomatoes she accused us of importing and quietly apologized and walked away  TLDR Lady thought she was going to uncover a massive conspiracy instead got laughed at by a store full of people for being an idiot,Idiots are okay Loud idiots are the bad ones,246

meguriau,39,134,1p961l,448,Hey TFR Ive been intending to make a post but struggled with wording until I came across an askreddit post and submitted my first story as a comment Im in the middle of procrastinating from my thesis at the moment so this first one will be almost a direct copypaste with modifications Background Two years ago I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals The majority of the customers Ive had have been pleasant however there have been interesting characters and even a few nasty pieces of work discontent customers that have come by If theres any interest Ill try to make it a point to post a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this timeThis first story is from the early months of this year It was my first summer working for the brand and the thermometer had not dipped under  degrees Celcius for several days at that point My manager and I were working an incredibly busy shift when the motion sensor sounded In came a local girl noticeably overweight disheveled hair belly exposed from illfitting sporting attire racquet bag over her shoulder and large quantities of chocolate smeared around the edges of her mouth Without any warning or acknowledgement of any sort she began pulling hats from almost every shelf making it a point to try on the most expensive hats possible In a most meticulous fashion she went about smearing sweat and ice cream on the linen and organza hats brushing felt hats against the direction of the nap of the fur and jamming them back onto the hat block amongst other travesties in the process Upon completing the first of her objectives she made a rude remark about the brand with regard to some of the products then skipped off on her merry wayA few hours later while my boss was on her lunch break the same girl returned As it turned out after everything she had done she still had the audacity to leave us her resume I gave my boss the satisfaction of putting it through the shredder,Please excuse my behaviour from earlier heres my resume Tales from a Hat Boutique,582
neilstriker,19,45,1p93kj,80,Last night my friend and I were killing some time in crate and barrel found a real bottle of Bombay sapphire in one of the display bars We took a few hefty Nips from it sat down on one of the couches and decided crate and barrel is not that bad a store This was over  hours ago so the booze was not poison This got me to thinking howwhy the bottle was even there in the first place Was it bought by some manager who didnt think to use an empty bottle of booze Did I just drink an employees secret stash What possible explanation could there be The bottle was full I found it about  months ago and when I came back to the store last night it was still there,Open bar at the Crate and Barrel,125
EndlessNerd,8,23,1p8wxg,72,Quick story from the other day  I work at a hobby shop  game store for context  A guy calls the store asking asking if we sell chess sets  Im paraphrasing here what he actually said sounded something like You guy sell chess  No accent maybe he was drunk  I tell him We have a large selection of chess sets and boards what are you looking for  Just regular chess  I say Just a basic set  Ive got some wood sets starting around   Did you need a board too  Fifty dollars  For chess  No cheaper  I think the least expensive set I have that isnt a travel set is around  Its standard size and has a roll up board  Thirty dollars is too much do you have cardboard chess  A cardboard chess set  I dont think Ive seen standard cardboard chess pieces  Whats your name  Endlessnerd  I want to talk to your manager  I am a manager what can I do for you  Youre a big man   He said this with what I can only describe as a seething anger as if I had wronged him deeply  He then hung up  It occurred to me a little later that he probably meant a cheap chess set with a foldout cardboard chessboard  But I had such a hard time understanding him that I didnt immediately grasp that  Not that it mattered we dont even sell sets like that,Youre a big man,95

dayandnightowl,10,16,1p8li9,90,Preface I work at an artist supply store Not a craft store Trust me there is a difference and we sometimes have various art demos on the weekend This was one of those weekendsAlso it should be noted I have a tendency to be long winded and over explain Sorry in advanceI was in charge of doing a plasterbandage mask making demo for my store I had made a few masks the night before and planned to do a few more during my demo I can usually stay at my demo table for the entirety of it but we were busy so I kept having to get up and help leaving the table empty During a lull where I wasnt needed at the register I was sitting at my table making a mask No one else had really shown any interest beyond Oh hey person what are you doing Oh making masks Thats cool I guess Oh man must be shopping now so sorry  My demos usually go great so I was a little bummed out that nobody was interested in this thing I had worked hard to put together Especially you lady that interrupted me saying I dont care just tell me where the kid stuff is BooooooooSo this young kid comes over asking what Im doing and I give a short explanation After I tell him hes welcome to paint one of the masks I made the night before and I figure hes going to decline and be on his way Instead he looks overjoyed and sits down with as much enthusiasm as a person sitting down enthusiastically He starts choosing his paints and talking  to me about all the art things he does and I notice he keeps saying things are boss which was cracking me up He was totally enthusiastic about what he was doing and calls his sister over He tells her how boss painting the mask is and convinces her to start painting too Eventually the parents walk over telling the kids that its time to go but they beg to stay so they can keep working on their masks The parents are cool with it and start talking to me as well asking if I do art what kind I do etc and then both kids are telling me about the kind of art they do the little boy says that sculpting is boss drawing is boss his mask is boss and he AND his sister are so excited about it and my heart is growing three sizes etc The kids eventually finish thank me profusely for letting them paint tell me how excited they are to go home and try making their own masks The little boy asks if I like working there I tell him I love it He agrees it would be boss to work there so I tell him when he starts applying for jobs I will put in a good word for him and he seems over the moon and tells me that it would be boss I almost offer to babysit on the spot They leave several more children come in throughout the day who are almost as adorable and I have enough warm and fuzzies to last me a weekTLDR Awesome kids love art and proceed to tell me little boy calls everything good boss children are awesome the rest of the day and I am happy,Little kids are totally boss and I want to hug them all,106

mrjoekickss,42,13,1p7nkb,60,Heu first post hereDoesnt have anything to do with customers but since ive seen a lot of stories here with just stupid or entitled people i thought i give it my share English is not my native language nor am i good at writing storiesThis didnt happen to me but to a friends father F who has a sheepfarmOn a spring day  people from a city drove through the countryside and saw a lamb who couldnt stand on its hooves I dont know what causes it but its pretty harmless and the lamb will learngrow to stand on its hooves The lamb was basicly walking on its ankles with his hooves flapped backwardsThe  guys parked their car to check it out because they were worried about the lambs well being They instantly thought the owner of the sheep was a lazy hick who didnt care about his sheep OBVIOUSLY the lamb was very very sick and needed immediate help from a veterinarianThey chased the lamb around and after  minutes or so they caught it The neighbor saw the city people fucking around in Fs land so he went to see what they wantedHe greeted them and asked them what they were doing They said this lamb was walking weird and needed immediate help from a vet Also the owner should be reported to the police for neglecting his animalsThe neighbor said he knew F and he said he cares for his sheep and wouldnt leave the lamb in agony by ignoring a problem The neighbor said he would go to F to tell him about the weird walking lamb and the  city guys The  guys agreed to wait for the neighbor and F to come back to see if there was a problemWhen neighbor explained the situation to F they both came back to the land where the lamb and the guys would wait They were gone with the lambOfcourse F was mad stealing my animals How dare theyF with my friend rushed to the nearest vet to hopefully meet the  guys thereNope they werent there DAMN To the next one closer to the city were they assumed the guys livedWhen F arrived he was furious He saw  guy outside probably waiting for F to show up F parked his car and wanted to go inside The city guy stopped him because he thought F would take his lamb who needed treatment Which  punch to the face F KOd the guy and walked past himInside the vet was just finishing up with the lamb and city guy The vet laughed and said the lamb didnt need any treatment because it just needed to develop his feet further F tore the city guy a new one because in most cases city people know whats best for the farmer and his animals They might know jack shit about animals or farming but they will always have a entitled opinion about it Ofcourse F was still mad He just grabbed his lamb and went home The city guys wanted to apologise and said atleast nothing bad happend F said Fuck off and went home hours later the lamb was dead Too much stress F knew this was a likely outcome Thats why he was so angry at the city guysEdit F might seem a bit angry in this story but he just really cares for his sheep He also hates city people who think they know whats best for something they know nothing about,City people steal a lamb,73

Challymo,3,6,1p77zy,24,To set the scene I used to work in a department store in the uk that likes to count itself as upmarket the clothing generally was good quality but most of the foodstuffs was made in the same place and in the same way as the standard supermarkets  As I cant remember any long stories that I dealt with I will go over some shorter ones and some fun memories   The Awesome Store Manager  For most of my tenure at this store I worked in the operations department ie Stockroom this meant that I ended being a keyholder and would often lock up at night At the time we were very shortstaffed so the evenings where there was supposed to be  of us until close ended up being just  of us because of this we very often would end up behind during the day which meant alot of the tasks needed to be done before evening stocking would not get finished in time Now the scene setting is done on to the incident and resultAbout pm foods manager comes down in to the stockroom to request some extra stuff be pulled for the overstaffed team upstairs to get working on at the time I was rather stressed and had a list of things to get done as long as my arm so I politely told him to get lost at which point he started to berate me about not doing my job and that he was going to call the store manager being fed up I told him to go ahead and see what happensI carry on with my list of tasks for half an hour with nothing more said about the extra stock needed until all of a sudden one of the floor staff from upstairs comes into the stock room asking where to find a list of items the same one the manager wanted It was the next day I found out that when the manager had called the store manager she had told him that I was on my own and had enough to do without more being added on and to get one of his staff to do it or do it himself The bananas  Around christmas the store would be heaving all the time as most of you probably know as such you would end up with people wandering in to the other departments to purchase there food this was never a problem except for loose produce as the scales for weighing them and pricing them were only in the foods area Anyway arsehole customer AC comes up to homewares counter with a bunch of loose bananas and heads straight to pleasant cashiers PC tillAC    doesnt say a word just plonks bananas on counter  PC  Oh im sorry sir we dont have any scales in this department so im afraid you will need to take these through to the food hall  AC  This is fucking ridiculous picks bananas up and throws them at PC then just walks out the store The tongue  Before I worked in operations I worked on the shop floor in foods but would often pop in to the stock room to catch up with a friend of mine J or to grab stuff that needed restocking So one day customer asks me to see if we have more of something in the stockroom so I head off to see if we do and as I walk into the stockroom to see the operations team leader OTL holding the accident book and J stood talking to him as I walk in I start listening to the conversationOTL  So J can you explain to me how you got your tongue stuck to the racking in the freezer Just to not OTL is desperately trying to hide his laughter  J  sounding like he has his mouth full Im sorry I was concentrating on what I was doing and when I concentrate I stick my tongue out  OTL and other operations staff burst out laughing at this pointEdit  Readability,A few memories from my days in retail,30
robertr,37,69,1p7755,316,Many years ago I was a manager at a popular fast food restaurant  It was the middle of lunch rush with lines out the door and I am in the kitchen area helping cook because we were short handed  One of my cashiers tells me their is a customer with a complaint so I head up front and see an angry looking guy standing at the counter  On the counter is a burger wrapper with I would say less than  sq inch of burger left a small biteThe guy tells me that the burger was horrible and practically inedible yeah right  I break in on him before he can make any demands with a big smiles and say Im terribly sorry sir  Please understand that we never want you to feel you need to eat a burger that is not up to your expectations  In the future please feel free to bring the burger up to us and we will be happy to remake it or refund your money  I turn away and head back to the grill stating over my shoulder Remember you dont HAVE to eat the burger if you dont like itHe actually stood there for a few minutes before he realized that was all he was getting and walked away defeated  This was a privately owned franchise  rather than corporate owned so I wasnt too worried  If he complained above me I never heard about it,You ate it already what do you want from me,385

ghstflwers,61,85,1p72zf,471,Ive been working at the same restaurant for nearly  years now and overall my customer experiences have been okay pretty average nothing out of the ordinary but there are always a few that stand out in either a good or a bad way These two stories happened in the last  months and just show how easy it is for a table to stand outSTORY Family of  comes in mom dad and two kids somewhere between  and  boy and a girl The kids were being annoying from the moment they sat down I have  young cousins who I am very close with and I understand that its difficult to keep them under control when one is doing something so exciting as going out to eat But I felt like these parents were just enforcing the brattiness They were whining and picky throughout the whole meal They werent doing anything wrong per se at first just being annoying but then later when I came out to clear their table it started I dropped a little dish with dipping sauce in it it was plastic so luckily it didnt break My hands were pretty full so I couldnt pick it up just then The mom asked her son to pick it up for me He gets up and walks over to the dish Instead of picking it up he KICKS it at me Mom and Dad laugh oh kids hahaha I say in a somewhat playful voice Well that wasnt very nice go inside to put the dishes I am holding away and come back to finish clearing upWhen I go back outside the kids are running around the patio screaming Parents arent saying anything of course I drop the check and finish clearing off the table As I am about to leave the kids come back up to the table Mommy mommy look I look at their hands Theyre covered in chalk In dismay I look over to the chalk board One of our staff members goes to art school and is extremely talented She does an amazing job at designing our chalk boards This one has a really nice picture of assorted fruits and was advertising our smoothies Well had The kids had wiped away the the picture leaving a mess of little finger prints everywhere Ooooops hahaha sorry about that laugh mom and dad And they didnt even tip me well after all of thatSTORY This just happened last night A family of three sat down mom dad and their little boy probably around  or  I bring them their waters and ask if they would like anything else to drink The little angel asks me miss what kind of sodas do you have After I go through the list he asks in the sweetest little voice ever May I please have a Sprite My ovaries just jumped I dont even have kids and I was about to cry cause the way he asked was so sweet I bring them their drinks and take their food orders Later in the night when I come to clear the table he says Excuse me Miss can I ask you a question He then proceeds to ask me how many Red Sox games Ive been to and then tells me that his parents just told him that the reason they are in Boston tonight is to go to the game and its his first World Series game ever His parents had told them they were going to pick up something at a store and surprised him during dinner with the tickets As they were leaving the restaurant he comes up to me I was at another table taking their order at the time Excuse me Miss have a wonderful night The other table and I cant stop daaaawwwwwwing That sweet little angel deserves to go to every Red Sox game TLDR Its so easy to go from just an average everyday customer to someone your server will never forget Whether they remember you in a good or bad light is up to youEdit Thanks for the reddit gold kind stranger  ,Two simple ways to make your server remember you forever,556
coolbeans,15,50,1p70cc,247,I read thishttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentspeujbestparentthativeseeninalongtime story about a good parent so I thought Id share my own from a few weeks ago I work in a store that sells themed glass ornaments this time of year and some kids and adults just cant fight the urge to touch them One day I heard a shatter in that general part of the store so I headed over to see a mom and her ish year old son kneeling on the ground and I hear the mom scold This is why I told you not to touch Now were going to pay for this using your birthday money When a customer breaks something we usually dont make them pay for it so I told her this This is the part that I love Her response to me was No I told him a few times not to touch and he didnt listen so these are the consequences Parenting A in my opinionWe have adult customers in there who break things and lie to our faces about it or just dont bother to tell anyone at all and leave shards of glass on the floor until someone sees it I love that this mom was teaching her son to be honest and about the consequences of his actions at the same time I wish more parents were like this one  ,Another rare example of good parenting,297

pompous,211,444,1p6euj,1598,Closer to the end of my shift today a family came into the store It was a mom dad and two daughters probably around  and  They browsed for a bit and every once in a while I would listen in The mom kept asking the daughters if they had enough money for what they were buying and the girls would think it over and answer When they picked out the items they wanted to buy two Disney Infinity characters and a game and my coworker told them their total the mom turned to the oldest daughterYoure paying for these with your birthday money Do you remember how much money you have When the daughter shook her head the mom pulled out her money and slowly counted it with her daughter letting the daughter add up the  dollar bills When the girl had decided she had  my coworker reminded her that she owed  The mom asked her if she had enough money to pay for her new toys The daughter replied yes really hesitantly and her mom encouraged her to be confident in her answer So the daughter handed the money to my coworker who rang up the transaction gave her the change and helped her count it out The daughter thanked us and began to leave carrying the bag but the mom stayed behind to thank us She was trying to help her daughter understand the concept of money and its value and at other places cashiers would get impatient with how long it took the daughter to count her money and decide if it was enoughIt may seem very insignificant but examples of good parenting coming into my store are few and far between and I thought Id share with you all,Best parent that Ive seen in a long time,2042

gehjl,19,54,1p4szv,247,I saw the story about someone not believing they were the manager because theyre a girl  Well being a girl isnt the only thing thatll make them not believe youre a managerA bit of backstory Ive posted a story here before and it was from the same location  I worked in a cash advance booth inside a casino we dealt with getting people money off their debitcredit cards or cashed checks but we werent employed by the casino  We were a rd party company working inside  We had our own set of policies I worked there for a bit over a year till I was promoted to manager and was around  at the time  But I look a lot younger than my age probably We had  locations inside the casino the big main one and a small booth inside the High Roller section  Didnt need anything special to get in the high roller section just all the machines were a lot more expensive  That booth is manned by  or  people depending on the day amp time  So I get a call from the employee saying theres a guy there asking to talk to a manager  I start walking over there and when I get there the disbelieving customer DC comes up to me and goesDC Are you the managerMe Yes how can I help youDC Youre not the manager youre too young to be the manager  There must be someone else  Get me someone elseMe Well I am the manager and Im the only manager on shift right now  If you want you can wait for the general supervisor shell be in at am  It was around am at the momentDC This is unbelievable theres gotta be someone else that can help meI wasnt aware of it but there was another person normal customer NC that asked to see the manager while I was walking in between boothsNC interrupts DC Well you can help me if he doesnt want itMe Sure whats the problemTurns out he used the ATM and if you dont select the right choice or you go over your daily cash withdrawal limit itll process the transaction as a Point of Sale allowing you to go over your withdrawal limit with a higher fee  Of course theres notices that come up before it does that but I mean what kind of people actually read the ATMs notices right  Well if it does that it sends you to the cashiers us to get your money and well need your card and ID  Turns out his ID was expired by a few weeks and technically we arent allowed to process the transaction  He wasnt an asshole explained the situation was nice so I made the call to process the transaction for him  Us voiding the transaction would put his money in processing for  days so I try to help out nice people with minor issues  Had his ID been expired for monthsyears Ive seen those I wouldnt have processed it  Either way I told the cashier to put the expiration date as today and well process this one as a courtesy I tell him what happens if we void it and if he comes back again we wont be able to help him out  Ive had that happen as well processed one out of courtesy and they come back saying Well they did it for me an hour ago just do it again now  Its great seeing their faces when they ask for the manager and they see its me again  I void the transaction and send em on their wayI start walking back to the main booth when DC starts calling after meDC  Wait wait  Maybe you can help meHe explains the situation to me  He used the ATMs and had to see us to get his cash but he didnt have is ID on him  Again technically we wouldnt be able to process the transaction for people in this circumstance but I knew who he was came in here often and was a VIP for the casino  Ultimately I had the choice to help him out or not  I knew the casino has copies of VIP IDs in their system so I went over to them and asked if I can get a copy of his ID  They printed a copy of his ID for us I gave it to the cashier in our booth and told him to use this for tonight  I explained to DC that well use that for tonight but this is a courtesy and we wont do it again next time  He thanks me and heads off to throwing his money away in slot machinesGreat way to start my shift that dayOn a side note I truly hate entitled VIPs  Any slight inconvenience and theyd start making a scene getting their casino host and sometimes even the floor manager to come and try to solve their issue  Since we didnt work for the casino that meant diddly squat to us  No greater pleasure then telling someone no after all that ruckus and watching their host explain to them that we dont work for the casino and they have no controlWriting this story reminded me of another one where a guy swore Id be fired by the next morning  Ill post that one in a few days  There was good justice at the end of that one,Youre not the manager Youre too young,301
MedeaUnleashed,15,15,1p4i09,92,I never expected to hear the Its not you its me in a context other than a break up But thats functionally what my manager said I have been accused of stealing popcorn  We won a tin of popcorn for a contest It was stored in the managers office it had smaller packages inside of chocolate fudge gummies and other treats including popcorn Someone went into the office and ate several things out of it The manager came in discovered the lost and lost it She called everyone who wasnt working to ask if they had eaten the popcorn searched through a weeks worth of trash to find the evidence of the stolen treats and spent a very busy saturday stressing out over the loss of the popcorn She also refused to share the rest of the treats on the appointed day because it was evidence Then when one employee admitted after denying it to eating some of the popcorn she heavily implied that I was the other culprit So the manager and assistant came back to me and demanded to know if I had in fact taken the popcorn When I again denied it I was AGAIN questioned if the other employee had acted suspicious or had enough time in the back to eat the popcornI have been accused of being hostile when I inquired about a prize I had earned I have been accused of assisting an employee in finding a second job at the same location my girlfriend works When I said no it was a coincidence I was told if I had it would be really underhanded I have had to listen to the lamentations of the betrayal of this same employee who took a second part time job This employee was getting  hours a week after asking for more she was moved up to  So she took a second job that is  MF THis leaves her open CL MF and OPEN AVAILABILITY on Sat amp Sun    for part time that is amazing availability But the manager can only lament that she has more hours than she can spend for November and December and this employee would have been issued more hours How could she do this to usMy question is what about January and February Ive worked retail long enough to know that it rains hours in November and December and those hours dry up in January Better to find that second job now So all this winds up to after the job assistance accusation I was given the Its not you its me speech I was told that she the manager has a hard time trusting people because shes been burned so often So she knows shes been unfairly hard on me but its just a trust thing that she has to work through So    let me get this straight I am being shat upon because she is unable to trust me even though I did nothing wrong And the only thing that I can do is wait it out and hope she is able to find a way to trust me That doesnt really work for me So when my new job search ends in success I will have to give her the Its not me its you speech ,Its not you its me,107

BlueLily,22,26,1p4ejt,171,I just wanted to get this off my chest The recently hired operations manager at my store has been a jerk to me since he started I dont know what I did to make him unhappy with me but no matter what I do my customer service and job performance are never good enough I got nothing but positive remarks on my evaluations until he got there and now all of a sudden Im a bad employee My hours have been cut Ive been refused opportunities to branch into other departments to pick up more and Im at the end of my rope Yesterday I got there for my measly  hour shift to find out I was only there to clean the registers I was not scheduled as a cashier at all Just to clean the registers we have a cleaning crew that probably hasnt touched them since the store opened  years ago About halfway through my shift I get called into the office Apparently a customer survey came back from the day before saying the cashier that checked them out I was the only one there at the time appeared distracted and disinterested So I had been written up with no chance to discuss it with a manager to resolve the situation Maybe having me straighten up and clean the registers attempt to greet every customer face and stock the first aisle and answer the phone when Im the only cashier and theres maybe one other employee to help if I get busy isnt such a good idea I dont know maybe they were rude to me and put me off I dont say anything more than necessary to those people to reduce the chance they could report me for smarting off Either way he immediately jumped to disciplinary action without discussing it with me first He also took the liberty of saying that I was gloomy uncooperative and unfriendly towards my coworkers because I didnt hear him ask me something as I walked out the door that dayI just dont understand what Ive done wrong I try to be nice and helpful to everyone and I truly did enjoy my job and working with everyone there until this manager started singling me out I just cant deal with it anymore Im giving the store manager whom Ive always gotten along well with my two week notice todayThanks for listening I love reading this subreddit for all the stories from fellow retail workers who deal with stupidity on a daily basis like I have been for the last year and a half,So Im quitting my retail job today Ive had enough,197

bekahbbydoll,4,6,1p3vjw,12,So Im not sure if its because Ive been in a lot of pain lately because of my recent surgery or if Im just starting to notice these things more But this is a two for one tonight FIRSTWhen I close I usually go on my  around  but tonight because we had an extra front lanes manager well call him Asian Persuasion AP from now on on the clock they wanted me to go at  thats fine no skin off my teeth Well I didnt end up clocking out till  because I had to wait for my front lanes team lead to get back from her  Now I believe it was a combination of the pain I was in and my meds or what but Im so use to just clocking back in at  so thats what I did Well before I even get back to the guest service desk Loud Mouth LM from now on had told me that I took a  minute lunch I was so shocked I didnt think it had been that long I immediately started apologizing She told me that I needed to go talk to Passive Agressive Manager PSM from now on  I found her  seconds latter and went straight for an apology Me PSM I am so sorry I didnt realize that I had taken so long at lunch PSM well I mean it just is a real inconvenience cause AP was suppose to leave  minutes ago Me I really am sorry PSM I guess I just lost track of time I also had to clean out my sockets PSM well this isnt the first time its happened Just try to be a little more conscious of when you clock out please Me yes maam I understand First of all I genuinely had no idea I had been gone for so long and I felt really bad because I know that AP wanted to go home Secondly if I did something wrong reprimand me for it Dont beat around the bush and constantly say well I mean or well Um grow a pair of balls and tell me I also had no idea that this wasnt the first time this had happened So how am I suppose to magically know if you dont tell me Id rather get yelled at and be a little butt hurt after words than it feel like you dont have the balls to confront someone when there is a problem SECONDSuper bitch woman SRW from now on comes in to do a return I tell her Ill be right with her because I was busy working on something else She was literally waiting no longer than  minutes and when I finally walk over there she sighs loudly like she has been waiting for longer than  minutes I chalk it up to it being late and she probably just wants to go home I can sympathise with that Me hi How are you doing this eveningSBW stares at meMe you just have a return to do tonight SBW scoffs Um yes thats why Im at the Guest Service Desk Me Alright Well what do you have tonight SBW points to the bag and then slides her receipt across the counter towards meMe Alright Lets see what we got here I take her items out of the bag even though technically its company policy that the guest takes items their returning out of the bag I scan her receipt and notice neither of the shirts shes returning have tags on them No big deal there are tiny tags on the inside that have the DPCI number on them I put the first number in and no problem Type in the second number and the register is prompting me that this item has already been returned Me well maam it looks like this item has already been returned SBW I have the item so its obviously not been returned yet Me Well maam my register is saying that its already been returned SBW Did you not just hear me Are you dense I have the item right here therefore it hasnt been returned yet I try to ignore her overly rude comment and try to fix the problem Sometimes cashiers will ring one of two items that are similar twice even though the DPCI numbers are different So i try typing in the number of the first item again to see if thats what had happened Nope Me Well maam Im not sure what the problem is but my system isnt letting me return this item because its saying that its already been returned Im just about to tell her that we can do a no receipt return but that she might just get a little less than what she paid for And she starts flying off the handleSBW HOW IN THE HELL COULD IT HAVE BEEN RETURNED IF I FUCKING HAVE IT Me Maam I totally understand where youre coming from and I get it but when the system shuts down like this and wont continue there isnt anything I can do to over ride it SBW Just give me my fuckin receipt my mom can come in and do this tomorrow Me Maam it doesnt matter if she comes back tomorrow or not the system is still going to say that its already been returned SBW stares at me like Im speaking a third would language Just give me my goddamn receipt this is fucking ridiculous I tried my hardest to hold my tongue and because of that I rolled my eyes Which she noticed She snatches the receipt out of my hand and her items off the counter I just walk away cause Im done dealing with her She muttered something under her breath and nearly rips the bag caddy off the counter trying to get a bag to put her items in and then storms out of the store HAVE A GREAT FUCKING NIGHT MAAM TLDR I have the worst passive aggressive front end manager ever I tried to help a woman with her return but the register said it had already been returned When told this news the woman flips her shit and nearly breaks store property during her hissy fitEdit just for a little clarity PSM is our Front Lanes Team Lead who was closing that night our extra front lanes manager who is AP was schedules from  until  They wanted me to go to lunch at  instead of  so that there would be coverage at the Guest Service Desk so that PSM wouldnt have to attempt to watch the front lanes and the guest service desk while I was on my meal,Passive Agressive Bosses and Bitchy Guests,18

genericname,1,2,1p3o5p,16,So a few years ago I was working in electronics at Some Random Superstore It was midafternoon and I get a phone call from someone looking for a portable dvd player Well call him CG He starts asking about the features of dvd players we have Then he begins to tell me he wants to mount the dvd player to the ceiling of his car and he needs AV inputs so he can hook his xbox up to it to play while hes driving I politely answer his questions as best I can even though obviously we dont have any dvd players you can hang from your car ceilingAs if his plans werent clue enough he starts asking the same questions over and over after I had answered them At this point I pretty much know its a prank call  He finally decides on one and asks me to hold it for him and hell come in in a couple hours Whatever i humor myself and I set it aside and put his name on it Low and behold he never shows upThe next day Im telling my coworker about him My coworker gets excited and says he had a call from him earlier in the week but says CG wanted to put it on the roof of his car so the helicopters had something to watch while they were following himOver the next week we get a couple more calls from him asking the same questions about AV inputs and chargers and such and of course never coming in This guy was persistent for a prank callerThen one day I opened and found a portable dvd player on hold from the day before I locked it back up and went on my merry way A few hours later an older man with cornrows came up in one of our store scooters and asked for help My jaw dropped when he told me his nameCG My names CG You have a portable dvd player on hold for meMe I just locked it up Ill grab it for youI give it to him and he looks it overCG This isnt the right one This isnt the one they set aside for meMe This was the one on hold from last night but ill show you some of our other ones to see if one of those was the one he described to youHe looks at every one in the case and length fully reads their features CG No none of these are it Can you look around and see if he put it somewhere elseAt this point my manager is over and she begins looking too He has us look in the backroom under the counters in our supply drawers He keeps demanding to us recheck everything Loss prevention is watching him the whole timeFinally my manager goes back into the backroom and grabs a random one that was just overstock from what was in the case Manager I found this one maybe this is itCG proceeds to open the box and look over every piece He takes out the instruction manual and starts reading it front to back No exaggeration he sits there and reads this manual for an hourFinally he gets done and goes back over to the case My manager asks him if he made his decision He points at the VERY FIRST ONE that we gave him the one that had been on hold from the night beforeCG demands What about that one You havent showed me that oneAt this point its been a good  hours of dealing with this guy My manager was irritated and made some remark about wasting our time and not wanting to show him anymore I guess that startled CG and he hastily says he will get the one he had been looking at We check him out and he leaves Ive never seen him after that ,One of my most memorable customers,18

PhaelonCorrespondent,4,3,1p3cdz,35,I have the olfactory bliss of maintaining the fragrance wall at a cosmetics retailer in the US  I also have the bliss of dealing with at times homeless people that use our bottled scents in lieu of bathing  Having slept in my car before I am not judgmental but I also didnt exchange Chanel for a shower  Today I had the pleasure of dealing with not only one of our homeless regulars but one with a recent hospital admittance bracelet and a major miscalculation of his much needed dose of schizophrenia medicationI usually use the mornings before we generally get busy to do price updates file things upstock and dust  As I am filing away price tiles I see my homeless pal enter the store  He normally bathes in Armani spray deodorant as soon as he hits that particular section of the fragrance wall  In the past hed ask for samples while holding up his beltless pants and I would cheerfully make them thinking I might possibly be the only person who would be nice to him that dayToday he came my direction as usual and asked for samples  I said Sure thing pick your three and Ill make themHe muttered something about me being quick to say only three when hes had up to six before and then I heard him say to someone like an aside in his head I told you before these bitches is mean And I tell you what this bitch here hates n  Ive seen her around beforeNo shit youve seen me before I help you all the time but Im a wage slave so I inquire if he wants a sample of the fragrance hes currently holding  I told you IM STILL LOOKING  He then starts to throw the bottle of Gucci Made to Measure in my direction then changes midswing and slams it on the counterAt this point Im on a headset in midsentence asking for a manager  Im not going to be on the local news tonight  I step away as he douses himself and bathes in the rubbing alcohol we keep to sanitize lipsticks behind my station  When my tiny manager emerges from the office and observes his behavior she decides he has to go  Now she has to get him to leaveYouve been abusive to my staff and Im asking you to leave  I have already called securityGuy seems unfazed and is still talking to himself  When he does realize that my manager is asking him to exit he starts to lunge for her  She yells for one of us to dial  and that seems to make him shrink back  She and one of the larger cast members physically block him from entering deeper into the store or continuing to douse fragrance  He still lunged at them repeatedly before retreating alternately calling the three of us white Asian and AfricanAmerican racists and bitches then pointed at us through the front glass and said we would get oursSecurity of course shows up about five minutes after the fact and using our description locate him in another store in the mall I thought like bloodhounds they could use a blotter of his favorite scent to sniff him out and then book him for being a fragrancecrazed asshole but it was less dramatic than that  A bike cop physically rode beside the loudsmelling guy as he walked to the bus stop and made sure he was on it  All they can do is issue a notrespass warning and if he comes back then hes arrestedSo hes out in society with a hunger for Armani Code and no fear in obtaining it,Attacked by a Homeless Cologne Aficionado,38

Sydhw,8,7,1p39wb,12,I think this can be xposted in rparanormal but since it happened during my overnight shifts in a local grocery store chain Ill post it hereStory Number OneI was with one of my employees one night and we were together fronting the shelves to make the store look pretty The entrances are locked but the exits are open to please the fire department Just as we were in our last aisle of fronting do I hear a loud shatter of glass Turns out the meat promo case blew up No one was around to affect it or tamper with it in anyway The glass was firm in the frame and the glass was still in the frame but the middle of it was destroyed The security camera pointing at it didnt show anything strange happen to it for  hoursStory Number TwoWe had double doors that wouldnt latch correctly in the back of the store We put a wooden shovel handle in the handles to keep it from opening up The handle was approximately inches in diameter These doors weigh around as much as a CHEP pallet each and open outward About  hours after arming the back doors and putting the handle in it does the handle snap in half and the doors fly open Again the doors werent tampered with from the inside or outside as our security cameras showed us thisJust some creepy shit that happened I have more stories of seeing shadows when I was alone in the aisles and I was the only one in the store Hearing my name called from my boss when he wasnt there I even heard a low guttural growl in my ear when I was alone in the aisles I told the store manager the place is haunted but my goofy demeanor made him chuckle,A couple of Interesting Stories,19
darkenseyreth,8,5,1p39vv,28,I used to work in a camera store in one of the larger malls in the world where we offered a print service One of our services was a canvas print that you ordered off of one of our photo kiosks basically a touch screen computer with our ordering software on it Customers sometimes need a hand navigating the software so when a gentleman asked for a hand on how to order a canvas I was happy to help Usually they just need to be pointed in the right direction be shown where they need to go to find the right product and how to access their files etc so i did just that He asked for a little more help and I was happy to oblige I showed him where to find his files and he clicks on it next thing you know there are dozens of pictures of his wife popping up that look like they were part of a nude glamour shoot on a beach Nudity happens from time to time so i politely avert my eyes as if it were a mistake but no the guy starts asking my opinions on the photos We go through the entire gallery which I honestly didnt mind because his wife was pretty hot for a woman in her early s and finally settle on a picture of her lounging in the sand He then gets me to help me order a x canvas which he apparently intended to hang above his living room fireplace,Another Awkward Moment,33

ragdollsandzombies,31,21,1p36in,117,Ive had monthly doctor appointments going on for six months now I make sure to request those days off over two weeks in advanced  Today on my day off I was at the doctors and one of my labs came back abnormal  I was pretty much told it was a nonemergency  emergency   Meaning that because Im pregnant I need to go to the lab tomorrow and if in between then I have x y or z symptoms then off to the hospital but otherwise Im told to try not to worry or stress over itI do the responsible thing and call my work as soon as I get home to let my manager know that I wont be able to make my shift tomorrow because I have to get test done I give her a brief run down without going into graphic detail  Well because of being understaffed and because no one wants to come in on their days off or trade shifts there is no parttime employe to cover me and honestly I dont blame them for not wanting to come in when not having to  So my manager tries to tell me that I dont really need to go to get lab work done tomorrow I can put it off until my next day off which isnt until Saturday  and when that doesnt work she gives an exaggerated angry sigh and tells me that she guesses she will just have to come in on her day off then  At that point I was about to lose it my shift is only for four hours and yes it sucks coming in on your day off but by god how many times have I had to do the same because the schedule wasnt done right or someone called in at the very last minute  Here is a hint a lot  I so wanted to tell her that she should just put on her big girl panties and be a freaking manager and deal with it  But I held my tongue until the call was over and then screamed into my pillow in frustration for a good minute  I am so over this job,Your medical emergency is an inconvenience to me as your manager,138
jbh,34,18,1p32uy,95,About a week ago the door to the freezer that holds the cakes and pints cracked No impact on the door it just cracked in the corner possibly from the cold and bad construction and soon spread like crazy spiderwebbing the laminated glass Suffice to say its bad and very dangerousWe took the standing store signs and put caution tape between them and placed them front of the freezer We didnt know if the door would shatter so none of use wanted to risk having a customer break it Youd think that police tape would stop people from trying to opening itLol nopeTwo days ago two people a man and a woman come into the store presumably a couple or relatives etc They cause a usual fuss I see about the lack of flavors we run out of some of the more popular flavors fairly often the prices the scoop sizes etc Just not entirely pleasant people but Im politeThey go to sit down after ordering I start helping another customer out when I hear the sound of something large being dragged against our tile floursI turn to see the woman moving one of the standing signs with the caution tape and going to open the freezer doorI start freaking out and practically scream at the ladyStop Stop STOP Do not open the freezer Step away from the freezerShe continues to open the door and look at the pints I tell her to back away as the door is broken and could shatter any momentShe and the guy just stare blankly at me and ask me why and stated that they just wanted to see if they wanted a pint to go I tell her again that the door is close to shattering and we do not want anyone to touch itShe just could not get that She still has the door open tooI tell her to close it gently and step away and to not cross the caution tape She slams it shut I heard a few more cracks form in the process and goes behind the tape grumblingThe guy then chimes up with his wisdom on the subject Apparently they thought that the yellow police tape only means we do not want people to go behind the counter and that the freezer was not clearly labeled as off limits I tell him that since its in front of the freezer that means accessing the freezer would be off limitsHe gets mad at me practically yelling that the door wasnt that bad you guys judge for yourselveshttpiimgurcomyyfvtGipng and that if we wanted to clarify we meant the freezer was off limits then the tape should have been on the doorI explain again that to access the freezer one needed to pass the tape but he jut kept going on how it was unfair that not allow access to a perfectly fine freezerI told them that we have to get the pints from our walkin they just could not get them from the freezer That was not acceptable so they leftTLDR Yellow caution tape forming a blockade is ok to pass if you want ice creamNote the pic is actually of the door but a small section to make sure the name of the shop is not seen Imagine that spread over at least  square feetEdit I wrote the story yesterday but submitted it today so it took place two days ago not yesterday,Step Away From the Freezer,113
SiliconLemming,4,12,1p2y5g,77,This is not SiliconLemmings proudest momentThis is a the time I managed to almost kill myself with a mop This harks back to my time working at my local cinema and the kiosk area had laminated flooring that required daily scrubbing to remove all the post mix and trodden in popcorn It was the kind of duty you could just switch off and do at the end of the day Understand I am by no means making excusesI put the mop into the bucket and it had a little bracket that prevented the handle from falling down This left the tip of the handle at a slightly below face level The handle was made of wood and had a rounded end I had finished the job and was just turning around to makes sure I had cleaned everything At that moment a screen emptied out and my manager called over to me see if I had finished I turned and managed to trip over my own feet  I was a clumsyclumsy kid and started to fall over Towards the mop handleAs I fell forwards it hit me in the mouth I had managed to turn my head enough that it ended up grinding up my gums to the corner of my mouth At this point the pain hit me and most likely prevented worse injury I was suddenly aware of the very real possibility this could punch out of my cheek or something and in pure fear I managed to free one of my feet and stamped down hard hurling myself away from my foeUnfortunately I somewhat over committed to the move and ended pinwheeling myself onto my back where I stayed for a while until the pain in my mouth had reached acceptable levels Moments later I looked to see dozens of people including my manager just staring at me stunned into silence He came over to make sure I was okay and after making sure that I was okay could only venture HowI mean how did you jut beat yourself up with a mopTo this day Ive tried to answer that question Sometimes  I wake in the middle of the night and have to bite my knuckles for a couple of minutes I cant deny however it made me the man I am todayTLDR Kitchenware has an agenda and I for one am not going to stand for it any further,Wherein our intrepid hero is ambushed by a mop,89

kyp,15,14,1p2tmb,11,Hello I have started a bloghttpanthropologyandbookswordpresscom about bookselling Here is my first page It is longI have recently discovered that I cant keep doing the Masters degree in Medical Anthropology I just started about a month agoThis means I have to sell books full time instead of part timeThis means my anger levels will rise It is something that cannot be helped It happens I am sure to everyone who works in retailAt the moment its worse for me because I thought I had a way out Ive been a bookseller full time and part time for nearly seven years now I thought I was going to escape to discover new things and become enlightened and intelligent and loving and patient I was going to find a way to help people I was going to make the world a better place I mean I hadnt quite figured out how yet but I was going toOh yes I was going to be someoneBut that is not happening Not yet So I am back in the bookshop five days a week speaking to peoplePlease do not misunderstand me I mostly like people I mostly love books But sometimes it is difficultSo I am thinking that I need an outlet Some way of preventing me from taking out my frustration and anger and confusion on customers Some of them may deserve it but it would get me in trouble eventually and I would not want thatI came close yesterday I spoke to a few customers in a not so happy way I became frustrated and confused and unsure of how to cope But why you may askHere are a few examplesThe phone rings and I pick it upMe Bookshop Bookshop I say the name of the bookshop in real lifeCustomer And older man a bit difficult to understand Hello My name is Claude One of you put a book aside for me I have the flu and I can not collect it What I want you to do is keep the book I will send you a cheque When the cheque clears you will send me the bookMe We dont take cheques unfortunatley butClaude No no NO You are not listening to me I said I will send you a cheque When the cheque clears you will send me the bookMe we dont take cheques We cant take cheques Thats all I can say about cheques But there are some other things that we can do I can keep the book aside for longer orClaude How longMe getting a bit tired of being interrupted I can choose the date of when you would like to collect it on our system OR I could take payment over the phone now and get the book sent out for you tomorrow You would pay  for shippingC How would I pay nowM With your bank cardC I know how this works You will take my details and then other people will find them and use themM Your details go into the card reader and the payment goes through Noone else sees them It goes straight to the bankC And who will you tellM Knowing that somewhere in some way this is amusing I will not tell anyone else your bank details I promiseI took the details after reassuring him that I would not steal his identity After the payment was accepted I made the mistake of saying Ok Thats gone throughC NO We are not finished yetM I know this I still have to take your addressAnd so I did And then we were done At which point Claude said So have I paidOh wowBut I survived I did it Claude hung up and I went on with my dayShortly after as I was shelving travel guides a gentleman did that thing of looking at me trying to make eye contact but not saying anything So I looked back at him and smiledGentleman I have this book here It is the newer one because the one I own is from Me Its important to have the newest travel guidesG I go to Italy because Im a celiacM OhG You say celiaca to any of them and they immediately know what you meanM Thats goodG Has a widow read the new Bridget JonesM slightly taken aback by the sudden change of subject I dont think anyone who works here has read it yetG Because I know a woman whos husband has died and I think it might be a good present for herM OKG But I worked for people who looked at behaviours of widows Its amazing what books get wrong about widows You would laughM Well research is important in booksG Yes Men get into classical music Women become interested in football I am a widow he actually said widow there Just in case you were wondering if I didnt know about the word widower but I did not listen to classical music Not all widows doM I seeG I went to a footbal match once in Italy The crowd was full of older womenM G I think that they feel safer travelling with football fansM WellG It was a tour you seeM Yes That is saferG Im going to get this thenAnd then he left And I was left dazed looking around for support But nobody was thereFinally I was behind the tills being approached by a chap when a woman called out Wheres the new Bridget Jones bookI replied Its on that small table right next to you there The one with the sign that says Bridgets Back on itThe woman looked at the table and I turned to the chap to serve himWhich one the woman calledThe hardback on that table just in front of you calleWhat Mad About the BoyYes That book just there And again I turned to the man now standing directly in front of me as the woman picked the book up to look at itWhys it half priceMy customer man smiled at me in amusement as I looked over at the woman againBecause it is a popular bookAnd so I turned once again to the amused man and served him in a polite professional and curteous mannerI think if it had been a few years ago I would have been more jolly I might have said to the woman Well you can pay full price if you want or some such chummy amusing thing But not at the moment At the moment I am struggling to be jovial with customersTLDR I sell books and it is hard,My First Tale From Retail,25
LRGinCharge,51,78,1p2qnn,321,So this is just more of a head scratcher incident that makes you realize people really have no idea how retail stores work I used to work at an arts and crafts store that also has a custom framing department which was my assigned department If there were no framing customers to help I was in the back room doing framing stuff but had a wide open doorway where I could see if a customer came by or where customers would poke their heads through to ask me for custom framing helpOne day around the holidays I am working and it was incredibly busy The holidays also means the store itself is much busier and there are lots of custom framing orders so I had a ton to do If we get backed up on orders then people wont get their artwork by Christmas and thats bad Im working away and a woman pokes her head in the doorway which at first didnt strike me as unusual because customers did this a lot Woman Excuse me can you come out here and helpMe Yes did you need help with a custom framing orderWoman No the lines at the checkout are insanely long can you go up and helpMe In the front of the store or right here at the framing counter I did have a register right out there but it was just for ringing up the framing ordersWoman At the front of the store its ridiculous I cant wait that long to check out Me Well Im the only one in framing right now and we have a lot of orders so I have been assigned to work back hereWoman Well the lines are really long you should be up there helping Me Im sorry unless Im told by my manager I cant just start ringing people up She just huffed and walked off I cannot believe the nerve of this woman to interrupt me while Im clearly working on something to tell me to go across the very large store and ring her up on a register Clearly she never worked in retail because she would know its not as simple as me just walking up to a register and checking people out Plus she seriously had to seek me out because the room I was in was literally as far away from the front cash registers as you could possibly be without going in the back where only employees were allowed I can only assume she saw me back there earlier saw the lines then decided I just wasnt working hard enough and came back to give me shit This was years ago and her sense of entitlement still astounds me to this day ,How about No because youre not my boss,399

Adventureisoutthere,17,17,1p2idg,91,Im new to this subreddit but Im glad I found it Im sure Ill end up posting several stories Ive worked in retail since I was  am now  and have had a LOT of negative experiences although most of my dealings with the public have been nice or at least tolerableCurrently I work at a high end grocery store similar to Central Market or Whole Foods Its the first like it in our area and at least half if not more of our customers are entitled inconsiderate and selfish Most days I am either checking or at the customer service desk but occasionally I will cover a shift in our fuel centerLast week gas prices went down under  and then mid week went up to  and then  Typically our store stays a penny cheaper than all of the other gas stations on the same highway where we are located Our customers also earn points with loyalty cards at other stores owned by our company which they can use to get a discount on their gasFriday I was working in the fuel center and our price was still at  while everyone else was cents less than us Several people commented on it but no one made a huge deal of it except for one manI was walking up to the store to take my lunch break this was very obvious I had my purse over my shoulder and keys in hand and he stopped me and the following took placeHim Excuse me I just want to voice a complaintMe I already know what he is going to say Alright what seems to be the problemHim All the other gas stations on this road are at  and your price is Me Yes sir Im so sorry for the inconvenience but I cant change the prices until my manager tells me toHim I understand that but you need to pass this along to your GD managers Youre screwing me out of a dimeMe Yes sir I will talk to my manager about that as soon as I get into the store for my lunch breakHim Yeah you better let them know Im about to call corporate and file a formal complaint Youre screwing me out of a dimeThis wasnt a huge thing but the idiocy of it just irks me Dont give us your business if it matters that much There are AT LEAST  other gas stations less than  minutes from my store in either direction If you want your dang dime go to one of those Ugh,Youre screwing me out of a dime,108
rabblefish,39,44,1p2eoa,192,When I was slogging my way through my undergraduate degree I worked parttime in a computer store  It was a fun environment to be in  I got to play with the latest tech toys and my boss was an awesome stand up guy to work for still good friends with him to this day  Because of this I felt very loyal to this store and I always endeavoured to do my best to keep the business afloat  That included scaring away potential thievesOne of the problems with working in a computer store is that you sell a lot of expensive products which attracted a LOT of people who tried to scam us by purchasing products with fake credit cards Presumably theyd pay for the product with these fake credit cards and try to sell it for cash on sites like Craigs List or KijijiThese fraudsters were usually pretty easy to spot  Their body language was usually a dead giveaway shifty eyes fidgeting constantly eyeing the exit to the street etc but the most major red flag was when they would ask for the most expensive machine in the store without asking the sales staff any indepth questions  Most legitimate customers talked to us extensively before plunking down their hard earned money for a machine that cost upwards of   I usually spent at least  minutes answering questions when a computer sale was involved and sometimes customers would come back  or  times with followup questions before making their purchasesOn one particular day I had a woman come in to purchase a top of the line  laptop which retailed for   She smiled and tried to qualify this by telling me I need this because Im an interior designer   Now I generally try not to judge a book by its cover but internally I snorted and said to myself Yeah honey and Im the freakin Pope  God bless you my child  Interior designer my assFor starters she was wearing a hot pink leopard print tube top and a black ruffled micro skirt that barely covered her assets  The skirt could more accurately be described as a wide belt  A violently green gstring was poking out of the top of it and she teetered precariously on a pair of  lucite platform stilettos because nothing screams interior designer like lucite heels  Her skin was practically covered in crappy biker tattoos  They had that trademark DIY stick and poke look to themI smiled and played along with her ruse as I usually do in these cases  I asked her if she had any questions before I grabbed the computer from the stock room and she fidgeted and brusquely told me that it wasnt necessary because she had already done her research ahead of time  Once I got to the stock room I gave my manager the heads up and told him to keep our lossprevention officer on standby  I waited for a few minutes and returned to the sales floor with the computer she wantedI processed the transaction as I normally would and she handed over her credit card  I stifled a laugh  Suspicions confirmed the card was fake  I could tell by the dots that it was printed using an inkjet printer  It looked like it was printed at the lowest quality setting to save on the cost of ink  The holographic sticker one usually sees on a genuine credit card was also peeling off  With a straight face I asked her for a piece of governmentissued of photo ID to verify that she was the cardholder  Its standard procedure for purchases of this size  I had to try really really hard to stifle another laugh because what she presented was barely a step up from thishttpihredbubblenetimagemtdxnsTWNMbZpbiEDffffffjpgThen I feigned puzzlement and frowned at the screen on the register telling this interior designer that we were having technical difficulties  I called K the aforementioned lossprevention officer and told him Hi K  We have a code   Would you mind coming up and making sure that my register is in good working order  While we waited she fidgeted quite a bit eyed the exit about half a dozen times and texted nonstop on her BlackBerry  I smiled and told her we should have it sorted out in a few minutes  A pokerfaced K came up and I handed over the card to him  He went into the back office called merchant services and verified that it was indeed a fakeMs Interior Designer seemed to sense that the jig was up  She didnt even wait for K to come back with her fake credit card  Good thing too because if she had waited around he would have arrested her  She excused herself power walked as quickly as one could in  lucite heels and practically RAN towards a car parked outside the store  K dashed out after her heard her yell ALLEZ ALLEZ French for GO GO to the man in the drivers seat and managed to jot down the license plate of the car before it screeched away  K reported the incident to the police and a couple of weeks later he tells me that they were arrested  Apparently this wasnt an isolated incident for Ms Interior Designer and her gang of accomplices  They were doing this in computer stores all over the city and it finally caught up with them  TLDR Trashy biker chick dressed like a stripper pretends to be an interior designer attempts to purchase a  laptop with a fake credit card tries to prove her false identity with a laughably fake ID gets thwarted by salesperson and is eventually arrestedEdited for crappy French  Thanks ubsievers ,Fake credit cards and how to deal with the morons that use them,236
terattt,30,10,1p2b6o,42,A woman came in today with both barrels blazing to make a complaint about how she had returned a coffee pot a few days ago and had just now noticed that on the receipt she didnt receive all the money she should have It had been on sale when she purchased it and she claimed that we refunded her as if the sale had been applied to the item price after taxes instead of before taxes turns out this makes no difference since multiplication is commutative so she was completely wrong But she came in so angry and was so condescending to me that I could barely even speak She intimidated me and started saying how I had no idea what I was doing when I took even a second to try to follow her logic and didnt understand all the confusing things she was throwing at me immediately Do you REALLY not understand what Im saying she said as she gave me a look of utter disdain I just apologized and tried to figure it out but luckily another more seasoned employee came over and handled it for meBut I want to know How do you handle people like this If I had been able to keep my composure I wouldve been fine but the way she had me against the ropes by insulting me insinuating I was dumb for not getting it immediately I got flustered and fell right into her trap And I felt horrible afterward I dont want this to happen again Please help me,New to retail How are you supposed to deal with angry condescending customers like this And how do you not get flustered,52

jdpatric,74,89,1p293f,391,After reading Layaway httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsptwdlayaway I thought of my time at the hardware store and rentalsI was going to post it there as a comment but its just really long I used to work at a small hardware store in a medlarge town We offered a few in store services and one of them was rentals We had two different types of carpet cleaners we rented along with pressure washers Each rental had a form we had to fill out on the computer We didnt require an email address but we did require an in state drivers license or some form of military ID two phone numbers and a credit card we charged the deposit to the credit card Note If youre reading this you probably know that a debit card can be run as credit provided it has a major logo on it I cant

afraid theres nothing we can do it you wont give us two phone numbersHH  This is insane Fine Heres my work cell really all thatI ring him up and set him on his way Didnt think anything of it I the next had three days off due to the way my semester was scheduled at the time and then was on for four days When I returned the owner was on the phone yelling at someone not terribly unusual owner was great but occasionally he had to call people and be that guyThe next day someone goes to return a carpet cleaner using the form the guy had rented it with the previous WEEK at this point Theres a huge late fee which the guy had negotiated down a bit with the owner Note the guy returning HHs machine is not HHNew guy NG  I need to return thisMe  OK do you have the card it was rented on expecting the worst we needed the card to refund the depositNG  Yeah HH wont be needing it anymore Hes been firedTurns out the guy was a really midlevel fairly new employee at a local company who had invited a bunch of friends to his office to watch college football they had several rather large TVs and projectors for conferences and such apparently and party on Saturday with the intent of cleaning up the mess on Sunday Something went awry when he tried to use his company card to pay for the rental and got caughtNumber three On a really cold day a sketchy guy and his equally sketchy wifepartnernot even sure what walk into the store and ask to rent a pressure washer This is in Florida so cold is a relative term but it was legit winter and the high was in the low s I wouldnt want to pressure wash on a

seconds between each number and forget our area code with the first one when SL picked this moment to find SGs drivers licenseSL  Oh heres his licenseI take one look at it and I see the saddest excuse for a fake ID Ive seen Probably ever It was beat to death The guy on there while also a very sketchy individual was NOT SGMe  Sir Im sorry I cant rent you this machinethis is not you in the pictureThe computer we used for rentals was LITERALLY on the wall of the owners office and the walls didnt connect to the ceiling so he could hear whenever we had a problem with a rental and he had one way glass so they could see it tooOwner comes out of the office and tkaes the fake ID  Sir Im going to ask that you hang around here for a few minutes until the police arrive or I wont be giving you your drivers license backSG  KEEP IT runs away with SL in towOwner didnt really call the cops but pinned the license up to ward off future attempts to steal our machinesNumber fourThis is one of my all time favoritesA couple in their late s early s walk in the door and right off the bat I can see something is off They just look a little confusedsomethings just differentI could tell Me  Howre yall doing today yeah southern drawl Id put it on for retail lol Can I help you with anythingConfused couple CC  Utter silenceMe now confused myself  Can I help youCC  Still silentAt this point they began to sign to each other and I determined that they were both deaf Well that explains a lot Found out that they were both INCREDIBLY proficient at reading lips to the point where they warned me not to mutter anything negative under my breath as theyd probably pick that up too We communicated via writing on slips of paper They need a carpet cleaner Ok no problem I write that I need  a drivers license and a credit card They gladly provided me with both Since they could read lips I would usually just ask them questions and theyd writeMe  OK I just need a home and a cellphonenumber I realized how ridiculous this was as I was asking for itthey were DEAF why would they have a phoneThe man just looked at me with a stare that said what the fuck am I going to do with a phoneMe  Ummmsorryone secI go straight to the owner who happened to be there that day obviously he hadnt heard much if any of the one sided conversation I was having with CC I explain the situation to the owner At first he doesnt budgeOwner  We need two phone numbers no matter whatMe  Owner They Are DEAF They dont HAVE one phone between them let alone twoOwner  YeahI guess weve never had this come up beforeummmYeahUhhhhjust fill in the blanks with numbersHad anyone but the owner told me to do that Id have told them to pound sand but that came from the tippity top and it was already an odd case so

stillalurker,64,109,1p24c1,508,So a couple people asked for more about the manager at the orange home improvement store well here you goFor those that didnt see the last post I work as an order picker for deliveries and will call Basically you order something Im the lucky guy that gets to find it in the store put it on a pallet and then shove it on a truck So a customer went through management to place an order for about  linear feet of molding they normally come in  foot lengths Apparently after talking to this manager she created the order and pulled it herself But she didnt put the order to the dispatch so our delivery trucks dont know they have an order to deliver She didnt put a location as to where she left the order And she didnt put a purple tag on it to say that it was for deliverieswill callSo going through the store picking the order we are only able to get about half of the molding Great So I call the customer to see if they want to wait or if we want to try to get it from another store She assures me that we have enough and to talk to my manager So I dial  manager picks up and I explain the situation She quickly snaps back at me that the order is by the managers office on a cart This was surprising because when you complete an order you put a tag on it and you put it by the door that we load the trucks out of not the managers office So whatever I go pick it upOnce there she tells me that she told me about this yesterday and that Im wasting time I paused and reminded her that I dont work on Tuesdays that you must have told someone else She said that she knew she told me So I go and print out my punch times for the last week and none were made on Tuesday I shove it on her desk and kindly tell her to let us handle deliveries because it wastes her time She looks a little embarrassedSo we get the order and are all set too put it on the truck But the driver says that he doesnt have room for it and that its not in the dispatch route he has Well fuck me Nothing we can do about it hes right So we call the customer and inform them that we have the material but that we cant deliver it today Lady flips a shit and asks to speak with managementCouple minutes later I get a call from this bitch of a manager And she is screaming at me for not delivering it Then I explained how it wasnt in the dispatch and the driver didnt have room so he couldnt have taken it Here comes the face palm moment She asked what the dispatch is Ohhhh boy She had no clue that you need to let the fucking delivery truck service know that you have an order or orders to pick up So I end up walking down to her office again to show her what she didnt do And I told her that she can call the customer back and tell them why we cant deliver it And I stood there and watched her sheepishly explain how she didnt know what she was doing to the customerMoral of the story managers have no clue on the daytoday operations of store employees And things only take longer when they get involved,Your manager told me you guys have enough of it,617

HamadyneR,15,7,1p0x98,53,Part  HerehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsolrlifeandtimesatthemoviesparttheWow Im surprised that I got such a great response with my first post to TFR Thanks again for reading everyone This is a twostory post so buckle yourselves in Buy popcorn before readingLike I said before I worked in the burbs This resulted in a lot of soccer moms and very entitled teenagers coming in just not getting our policies One of my jobs is to stand and take customers tickets letting them know where their movie is Its boring seeing as I have to stand for several hours but hey its easy cash The other part of that job is checking IDs for Rrated movies These are usually checked by the box office but many people ordered tickets from our ticket kiosks in the lobby As a result these tickets needed to be checked by someone like me Otherwise wed once again get in trouble with corporateOne evening a group of teenagers walks in to see a certain Rrated movie If youve been to the movies at that age that means being asked for an ID before we can let you in And without fail theres always that one person That one guy or girl who is offended that you had to get them to show their ID And then they dont have itBut Im  You gotta believe me Im not lying to youIm sorry but you need to be  in order to see this movieBut I dont have my ID with meOnce again I cannot let you into this movie You can get a refund at the box office thoughIm with all my friends and they have tickets tooThen I need to see their IDs as wellSurprise surprise none of them have an IDI apologize but I cannot let you guys in either Cue huffy attitudeYou should just let us in We came all this way and now YOU had to ruin our funAt this point I have stopped caring Clearly this group wasnt getting itSorry everyone You can get a refund at the box officeThankfully the group leaves to go get their money back Shortly after two other teenagers show up I check their IDs which they have Andtheyre old enough Huzzah responsible teenagersOkay you guys are all set Enjoy the showOne of the girls from the previous group emerges from the bathroom at this point noticing the two teens that just entered Turns out she knows them from her school From the corner of my eye they start talkingCue one of my managers who comes over to see what had been holding me up at my station I explain what had happened to which he nods and empathizes with my temporary plightDID YOU CALL HER A BThis sudden exclamation makes the both of us turn around One of the boys that the girl was talking to starts yelling at us insisting that I had torn up her ticket into tiny pieces and made fun of herNow TFR I am not an angry person People who have come to know me describe me as mellow a human puppy and calm I have not in any way treated customers like this This is something my manager also knew so he immediately knew this group was trying to start something with us He directs the group to leave and collect their refund to which they begin to comply with Until one of them throws their plastic cup of water at the both of us and missedNow my manager is really ticked off He immediately starts forcing them out of the lobby sans refund with nothing but words alone Twas a glorious nightBUT WAIT THERES MOREThe morning following the incident the girl who had started the whole thing has her uncle of all people come on down to chat with my general manager about what had happened While I wasnt there my managers let me know how it went downThe uncle demanded to see a manager about the way we had mistreated my niece last night followed by a surge of profanity My manager managed to settle him down and get him upstairs to our offices After telling my manager about what he had heard my manager showed him the footage from our security cameras to confirm that such an event had taken place Suffice to say it did not The previous nights events were all on there in full color in clear detail It then became obvious that someone had lied to this girls uncle and it sure wasnt usThe uncles replySorry for wasting your time ThanksAnd he promptly left no questions askedStory two begins a few years before the above incident back when I first started working at the theater I was a newlychristened ticketer all set and ready to direct customers to their respective theaters One of the movies we had out at the time was Slumdog Millionaire If you havent seen it its a fantastic look into life in the slums of India And their version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire apparently It was also noted for some pretty violent and graphic scenes in the first halfhour or so giving it a muchdeserved R rating Our box office has ratings of all of our movies up on several displays and the movie posters have the R notification courtesy of the MPAA stamped on each copy we ownWith that in mind lets continue our storyA family with a boy no older than  years old angrily comes back to the box office approaching me This had been about  minutes after the show had startedWe want a refund This movie was inappropriate for our sonIm sorry it wasnt to your liking sir Could I ask what movie you were seeingHe hands me his ticket and I immediately see the Slumdog Millionaire tag on our ticketThis is false advertising Theres not a single dog in the movie And it was so violentwhutIt takes all of my willpower to not laugh at how silly this was Im sorry sir but our box office has ratings next to our movie Please be sure to check with us next time if you have any questions about the filmSuddenly a little voice comes into the conversationI TOLD you it was rated R Dad Why didnt you listenThe mans son was clearly a notch brighter when it came to ordering tickets Face reddening the man and his wife head up to the box office

HeresJerzei,13,3,1p0wim,27,I worked in a music store for a few years and loved it  It was a locally owned store but bigger than most It had a great rep and Id been going there and buying stuff from there for many years To get a job there was the most awesome thing to ever happen to me After a while the store was getting too big for the premises The owner wanted to expand the product lines and make significant changes but there just wasnt the space Hed looked around for a new building but there was nothing suitable available at the time As a shortterm interim solution we ended up splitting into two stores for a while The drums and audioPA gear went to one store while the rest of the departments stayed where they were I went to the drumPA store There was no internal phone line so calls from the other store came through the usual line or went to one of our mobile phones As a result of this we often answered calls after closing because it could be the other store calling about stock orders or the daily takings or whatnot But often it was customers calling after closing One call went like thisMe LocalMusicStore this is HeresJerzeiCaller Hey man I need to buy a snare drumMe Sorry man its nearly  and were closed We shut at Caller But Ive got a gig tonight and I need a new snare drum Can ya wait a few minutes Ill be down there with cashMe Sorry man Im on my way out the door and Im about to put the alarm onCaller Aww come on dude Cant ya stay open I need a snare drum Where can I get a snare fromMe Well you could always try OtherMusicStore Theyre not too far away and theyre open till  Caller OK whats their numberMe I couldnt tell you mate I dont call them very oftenCaller Well youre about as useful as a hatful of arseholesCLIKHave a great day Hope ya got your snare drum,As Useful as a Hatful of Assholes,30
stillalurker,28,78,1p0ul9,285,So I work at an orange home improvement store and am an order picker Basically myself and another employee start at am to pull orders for either delivery or will call pick up The store opens at am so we have  full hours of using forklifts without a spotter or having to work around customers In these  hours we go ham we pull everything we can before the store opens Those hours are equal to about  hours of the store being open One morning one manager is late to open the doors for us by an hour So not only are we standing around we arent able to get in and do anything She finally gets there and we are noticeably unhappy She knows she messed up Anyway a couple hours later the truck shows up for us to put our stuff on they were an hour early for delivery Well we dont have it all ready to go yet And when we go to tell this same manager she has the audacity to ask why we are behind She even brought the store manager to hear her bitch us outAfter she was done the store manager starts to get on our case I just sat there looking at her with so much disgust After we got our assholes chewed up I asked what time our manager was supposed to be there to let us in Our manager said that it was supposed to be at  And then I opened up giving both barrels back to this lying idiot manager How she would have the kind of bone in her body to complain about something she caused and then go to management about it Myself and my coworker got double pay for that day and we each got raises in order to make up for the bitching out we got I got lots more stories about her already and shes only worked there a couple of months ,Why are you so behind,363

Broniba,58,106,1p0b7t,452,Backstory So at my little corner of coffee house bliss we have an extra room attached to our main shop that used to be a liquor store  when it closed we bought it and turned it into an event room that people could rent out for meetings parties what have you Its not part of the general shop and we reinforce this by keeping the door closed  however it isnt always locked because potential renters often want to see the space to see if itll fit their needs what they need to rent so far as furniture yada yada All this to say room is there not supposed to be used unless you have reserved and paid for this room Well last night as I was manning the bar I notice two ladies open that door and walk into the room Now these ladies had been sitting just the two of them at our largest table for over an hour at this point sipping their free cups of ice water They were both very obviously well to do  they gave off that vibe of Im rich and youre not and we both know it Well theyd been there until Id gone to the table about ten minutes earlier placing down the reserved table sign and letting them know that no rush but in about thirty minutes a group was coming in that had previously reserved that big table They didnt seem to have any problem with that at the time so I went back to work Didnt think about them again till my co worker says I wonder what theyre doing I look up and see the ladies disappearing into the room Well co worker is very new so I told him that if hed watch the bar for a minute Id go ask I honestly figured maybe theyd seen the room and were wanting to rent it or something So I walk back and was thoroughly puzzled to see them sitting at one of the tables in there still sipping on their waters  in the dark I might add No event equals no lights on in the room and only the light from the shop coming through the door window I open the door and the following conversation occurred with Rich Lady or RL from now onMe Hi there ladies Can I help you with anything RL Were just having a conversation There were getting to be too many people in there Me Haha I understand it gets a bit crowded sometimes Im sorry to tell you though that this room isnt part of the general shop area Its a special room we save for reservations RL But were just having a conversation kid you not same phrase twice as though I somehow missed it the first timeMe Maam Im sorry but this room can only be used for folks who have reserved and paid for it Cue facial expression that lets me the minimum wage plebe know exactly that she Ms Rich and Fancy Pants does not appreciate my trying to tell her that she cant have her way RL Ugh I know what this room is for Ive paid for it beforeWaitso you know what the room is for youve used it and noted that no one from the main shop wandered in and crashed your party yet you cant seem to understand why Im asking you to leave said room Honey Sugar pieuse the brains so well concealed by your bad dye job I think my confusion must have shown a lot because she rolled her eyes and huffed again I tried one more time Me Im really very sorry ladies but Im not allowed to let our regular customers use this room without reservation for any reason One more big huff and they start to get up And leave their cups on the table as they stiffly walk out and flounce out the door I justI dont get people Seriously You came into a very crowded very public shop but somehow deigned that your conversation was so deep and dark and mysterious that you literally needed to go through a closed door into a dark room and have your talk thereand then youre gonna act surprised when we noticeReddit customers make me crazy A lot TLDR I interrupted a dark and secret meeting The Devil and her minion did not approve ,Ugh I know Ive paid for it before,558

internetmexican,3,20,1ozrgd,81,Background My family owns an automotive shop in Hayward CAWhile I was out We get a customer lets call him Ed who tells us he recently hit a pothole which resulted in one of his really nice and very expensive rims getting messed up He informs us that we took his rim to some rim repair place where they told him it was really fucked up and probably would not be able to do much He tells us that we told them to try but that they said that they might not be able to get rid of all the damage and even if they get it working that they might not be able to get rid of all the superficial damage Ed is now asking us if we think they fucked the job up our manager says he would not know we did not see the rim in its previous condition and we are not involved in rim repair Ed tells my manager that he thinks they messed it up because the tire keeps going flat Manager tells Ed we can look at it and see if we find the problem nothing is free of course so for our time we will charge  Ed says ok and so we begin to look over his rim in the very end it turns out that the rim was really dirty so our guy just cleaned it mounted the tire again gave the tire back to Ed Ed paid and we asked him to go on his wayMy tech noticed that the rim had a couple superficial dents here and there some scratches obviously from the damage he had told us about earlier Manager made note of it too While I was there  days laterEd comes back says we messed rim up Says he demands not only a refund but  to replace his rim Manager my uncle says no Manager reminds Ed that he told us that the damage was there from when he drove through a pothole and that we would not be paying for damages we were not responsible for Ed says that he had the rim fixed so there was no damage on it Manager gets annoyed and reminds Ed that he HIMSELF told us that the repair people were not able to get of all the damage considering how badly he claimed to have banged his rim up Ed says no the damage came from our tech dropping his rim on the floor and that he saw wheel weights on the floor and those caused the damageManager gets annoyed tells Ed to hold on I get called from the back its my uncle the manager He tells me the situation and asks me to go deal with it Ok I go to the front to talk to EdMe Hello Sir what seems to be the problemEd Are you the ManagerMe I am the owner not true but I like the POWER of saying it plus why not my Dad owns it and he has already told me to say that when dealing with difficult customersEd Well I brought my rim here blah blah the story I already told and you guys messed it upMe According to my employees you told them that you hit a pothole messed up your rim took it for repair they did not get rid of all damage but now you are saying we caused the damage that was already there I mean sorry but it just seems like you are trying to get some free money out of usEd No no See I took it to get repaired and yes they could not get rid of some of the damage but you guys made it worseMe How soEd Your guy was too rough he was throwing the rim around there was those metal weights on the floor and those damaged the rim even moreMe Do you remember who was working on your rimEd Yeah it was the Mexican guy gee  employees all Mexican Me Which one the guy with the mustache the short guy or the tall dude with a flat topEd Tall guyI go and call Tall guy TG he comes over I brief him on the situation He shakes his headTG Thats stupid there was no weights on the fucking floor Me I know but he keeps saying there wasWe had just finished working on some r tires and so yeah right at that moment there was  big tire weight that had fallen off the  inch rim Ed goes and picks it upEd It was one of theseMe doubt it those get picked up and placed by the tire balancer for the big trucks all the way over there which is true we never leave them on the floor because yes they could damage those expensive rims Ed Well it was the small ones but yes it was a weight that damaged itTG doubt it we never have weights in this area the balancer is not even out here and your tire was never on the floor to begin with You werent even back here Ed well I walked out for a sec and saw you throwing it around This argument goes on for a while till TG says Fuck it bring your rim ill put a weight on the floor we will drop the rim on it like you are saying I supposedly did If we get the same damage on the rim as we see on it now ill buy you a new one Ed agrees Me UhI dont recommend you do that I am telling you now that we here at Family Business will not take any responsibility for your guys little agreementTG Dont worry boss this is all on me Tg then lets the rim drop on the weight picks up the rim No damage Ed grabs it points to some scratches and yells SEE wheres my money TG Wtf it didnt even fall on that area Fuck this I got work to do TG went back to work so I tell Ed to let me talk to my Dad and ill call him back laterLater in the day Ed calls me tells me if we are going to pay him back I tell himEd Well after listening to the Manager the techs and your story it is clear that the damage on your rim was due to the pothole you hit you yourself told us that they were not able to get rid of it completely Also your claim that we dropped the rim as we worked on it is completely unbelievable because we use a machine to take the tires off the rim the tire comes off but the rim stays on the machine This machine is specially designed for dismounting tires and has special rubber attachments to prevent damage to rims such as yours Considering all of that and statements from my manager and techs that you were never even in the back while TG worked on your rim I will have to dismiss any and all of your claims that the damage is our fault I mean seriously YOU told US that they could not get rid of it all but now you want to say we caused it Ed WELL AT LEAST MAKE TG PAY ME YOU HAVE TOMe no I dont You entered that agreement with him on your own after I told you not to and that we would not take responsibility for your decision Also you two entered that agreement togetherhave a problemtalk to himEd Give me his numberMe No hangs uphe never came back after that ,Tales from Hayward,101

wittyithinknot,13,34,1ozdc8,198,My head manager has a bad habit of coming to the fast food joint I work at to yell at a lower manager about supplies our drivethru times or coworkers who dont show up for work It would be ok if he would come into the store have a quick word or two with a shift manager help out a bit you would not believe how often he shows up during a rush and just stands there taking up space in the kitchen and leave Instead he most often comes through the drivethru to talk to shift managers This sparks confusion from customers sometimes who have no idea why this dude pulled in front of them while their order was being taken and then didnt get any food  Yesterday was the last day for one of the shift managers On a side note I am not unhappy to see him gohe would poke me in the side inappropriately and often pulled my visor over my face The visor pulling got so bad that I traded it in for a ballcap that wouldnt budge if I had my ponytail in it Another shift manager told him to go home early since another coworker would be coming in early The other coworker was told by head manager not to come in because there were too many people working that day anyway  Coworker doesnt show up for work were shorthanded shift manager calls head manager to call coworker The head guy decides to come to the store instead of talking to people on the phone like a normal person  Heres where I come in I work at the register taking orders and money at the drivethru We start to get so busy that a line forms There is no place to cut in front of someone to get to the second window  Head manager decides that instead of coming in hell pull alongside customer cars to yell at the shift manager  A middle age woman comes up to my window and sees head manager hurling abuse As I read out her total I cant figure out why she looks so appalled She hands me her money and says I cannot believe this  Um pardon I think shes talking about the price of her sandwiches  The rudeness of some people  At this point I think shes talking about me I try to be as polite as possible but I can get spacy sometimes I look up from the change Im trying to total and she looks fucking furious She has tiny flames in her eyes Her hand is on the door handle and she looks like shes about to get out and verbally attack me on a facetoface basis  Maam  Just to clarify did that customer pull up just to insult your coworkers  Uh thats my boss Unfortunately hes allowed to do that  Oh she puts her hand back on the steering wheel her flamey eyes turn to hot coals He shouldnt do that in front of customers You shouldnt be rude to fast food people  Maam were you going to confront him  She looks a little ashamed I was but I guess your boss is allowed to be as unprofessional as he likes  I was so happy that she was going to get into a verbal altercation over someone being rude to fast food workers that I gave her a free ice cream Tldr Im on mobile so it may be one horrible paragraph Ill fix it from a computer hours from now ,She had tiny flames in her eyes,232

flarpy,31,115,1oz9nd,509,This previous summer I started a new job as an ice cream man My job consisted of driving my converted school bus around town and peddling my wares to anyone who would buy One of my favorite areas to drive through was this dingy little back road that housed some of the strangest people I ever interacted with The first odd experience happened right around my second week on the job By this time I had become pretty familiar with my route and was now focused on building relationships with my customers I remember encountering this one kid who shall be referred to as Kingpin in this story Now Kingpin was this adorably small blonde haired boy who was probably around  years old The couple of previous times he had bought from me I could barely hear him order so I naturally assumed he was just a meek mannered boy This day however turned out to be quite different As I pulled up to Kingpins house I could see  older kids wrestling in the front yard The all had Kingpins blonde hair but were much larger and seemingly more aggressive than him So Kingpin comes strolling out of the house bypasses the violent tussle in the yard and comes straight up to my truck Are those your brothers I asked attempting to foster some relationships and all that jazz Yep Three ice cream sandwiches he replied without giving a glance to the MMA exhibition happening behind himI figured he was just being a nice brother and buying ice cream for his siblings but I was surprised when he unwrapped one of the sandwiches and began eating it feverishly Now my boss trusted me to give out ice cream when it would help build a relationship with a customer so I figured that Kingpin just didnt have enough money to buy one for all three As he began to walk away I called out to himHey Take an extra one so all your brothers can have one I said feeling confident that I was doing my good deed for the dayImagine my surprise when Kingpin unwrapped a second ice cream sandwich and began to demolish it despite the fact that he hadnt finished the previous one No I got one for them which was spoken with the biggest smirk on his face Then he leaned in close to me and delivered the line that quickly cemented his place in my Hall of Favorite Customers Im gonna make em fight like dogs And then Kingpin walked away into legend,The Ice Cream Truck Tales PT ,624

truck you know those small ones with the  inch tires that are a BITCH to change since we keep it old school with the bars They get off the truck and right away it is clear that they are fresh immigrants due to the terrible English and the THICK accent but its cool we WILL make this conversation work Old New TireMe You want new tires Ok let me check the size Yup we have those in stock how manyNew We want  new tire for front his accent is a little better than Olds and his English is not as bad but still pretty badMe Well Ok we have several brands it depends on how much you are willing

Old Old is not happy eitherOld No Amigo too muchNew Yeah too much you give to us for xxxMe No I give to you for the price I told you or I dont give it to you at all Old Says something to New which I assumed to be What did he say New No cmon my friend too much you give discount pleaseMe Is this your first time here he looks confusedYou come here beforeNew No first timeMe Sowhy would you expect me to give you a discount look man this is the cheapest we can go These tires are good if you have ANY problem with them just bring them back and we will replace the tire However I can NOT go lower than this priceThey talk it over in their language and finally agree to pay the price I ask them to go the office to wait while we work on their truck They sit there uncle offers them some coffee maybe a pan dulce if they want it chats em up the usual thing we do to keep guests entertained One of the guys and I work on the truck Once we have the tires mounted and balance we dunk them in water to make sure there is no leak anywhere all is clear and so we put the tires back on the truck I inform Old and New that they are all set They get into their Hino and drive off happy as can beAbout an hour and a half later see the same Hino coming back think to myself There is no way in hell there is anything wrong with those tires THEY WERE BRAND NEW but whatever I have to deal with this Me Welcome back gentlemen is everything alrightOld in a pissed tone TIRE NO GOOD YOU CHANGEMe What happenedNew We go to work we park truck When we go back to truck all air is gone You say tire good but no good Go over to the truck left side is perfectly fine but right side is flat no problem Tell my guy to go get another tire while I work on taking this one off This is when I noticed it The tire was all scuffed up like when you get too close to a sidewalk curb while parking The rims are scratched up and still have some dust on the from the concrete curb they hit I get up and walk to the tires in the back same pattern Tires scuffed up rims scratched and scraped but all is good Think well their warranty covers the tire so whatever I go back to the front tire I notice the reason that their tire is flat is because when they hit the curb they destroyed their valve stem This shit is not our problem now Me Ok guys the reason your tire is flat is because you guys hit the a curb or something the tire is goodOld NO GOODMe It is good but you guys FUCKED up your valve stemNew No tire no good you changeMe no tire is PERFECT your valve stem on the other hand is DESTROYEDThey look at each other and talk in their language They look at me and finally New says Show me what you say So I take him to the side of the truck and show him the valve stemMe That is your problem you guys hit a curb and destroyed your valve stemOld NO WE NO HIT IF HIT NO MIRRORwait what I ask New what the old guy meansNew We got mirror at junk yard so no is too sturdy If we hit wall the mirrors are fall down but they are not We no hit wall then he pissed me off when he said this YOU break valveMe If I had broken the damn thing off like this you would not have been able to leave because it would not have held any air I keep calm but I am annoyed that he would blame me for thisNew We come here valve ok now valve broken we no break It no break when we come so how it broke you breakMe No I didntlisten If I broke it how would you have left with a fully inflated tire You guys hit a sidewalk or something because I mean look at the scuff marks on your tires and see the rims are all banged up now tooOld NO HIT MIRRORS NO BROKEMe Ok but how would the mirrors have hit the damn sidewalk when they are all the goddam way up here Look if you want the valve replaced then its going to be  bucks okOld NO YOU CHANGE TIRE NO GOODNew YOU BROKE WE NO PAYAt this point my Dad came to the back and asked what was going on I explain it to him while telling him to deal with them because I am losing my patience My Dad talks to them he tells them the exact same thing I did they get pissed and keep saying we broke it Finally after about  mins of this my Dad comes to us and says Dad Just change their damn valve and get them the hell out of here he was obviously frustrated but was trying to keep his coolWe change their valve for free all the while Old kept saying WE NEVER COME BACKOnce we finished we sent them on their way New says We never come back here again before he leaves We just ignore them and go back to doing other workFast forward about  months New and Old are back again See them looking at some used tires I go over Me Hello gentlemen how can I help youNew We want used tire for backI help them choose some pretty great used tires we start talking price Once again they are NOT happy with the quote and start asking for a discount I say no then New saysNew No discount I come here beforeMe Ohis that rightNew Yes I come here before I buy tires hereMe OH YEAH NO I REMEMBER You were the guy who hit some concrete with his tire broke the valve stem blamed it on us refused to pay and then cried about how you were NEVER COMING BACK AGAINof course I never forget people like youNew he is standing there looking at me with this smile on his face like he is thinking to himself oh shit Yesafter that though he bought the tires but he didnt ask for a discount again Funny thing is they became regulars they

sabersar,46,5,1oyhv8,20,Share anything that gets on your nerves or rubs you the wrong wayIll share a few of mine I work at a popular office supply store Customers love to pull the price tag from its location and bring it with them to the front so they make sure they get the price listedCustomers often obliterate the binder wall leaving it nearly impossible to recover at the end of the night without dedicating  of your time to itWhen Im facingrecover block etc the store and a customer walks up and messes up a whole  foot section that they JUST saw me straighten just because they had to take a closer look at EVERYTHINGWhen customers leave trash around the store Cups paper wrappers gum wrappers etcCustomers who make you their personal shopperCustomers who have no ability to read signs and use common sense,Working in retail what are things customerscoworkers do that really get on your nerves,25
dredsina,10,9,1oyd33,66,I work at the customer service desk for a large home retail chain I live in an area of the country where people can be a little aggressive about being environmentally friendly A few neighboring cities have outlawed plastic bags though they are still legal in my city and a large portion of my customers refuse bags On the weekdays I am usually the only cashier other than backup One fateful day a few months ago I was helping a woman with a very large transaction She didnt seem in the best of moods but it didnt seem like a big issue I was friendly and working quickly I was confident my work would be satisfactoryBecause she had a lot of items we rolled an extra empty cart behind me to put things in once Id scanned them About halfway through her order I wasnt sure whether she would want the smaller items I was scanning in a bag or if she wanted me to just put them in the cart with some of her other items as this was what she had asked me to do Normally with so many items I would automatically put them into bags but some people really just dont want bags and she had after all asked me to put items into the cart behind me I wasnt sureThe next thing I did apparently was an unforgivable mistakeI asked her if she wanted a bagShe looked me dead in the eye and asked Do you think Im stupidI sputtered not knowing how to answer her accusationShe launched into a fullblown rant as I started to scan and bag as fast as physically possible Do you think Im stupid Do you think I dont know how to recycle Do you think Im not going to reuse these bags once I get home Of course I want bags Look at all this I cant possibly carry all this Why would you ask that What a stupid policy Why do you think I shop here and not in neighboring city that has outlawed plastic bags I live there Do you think I voted for that aggressively green mayor and those stupid bag laws Of course not and nobody I know voted for him either Where is your manager I want to talk to a manager This is my protest right now Im taking a stand NO I dont want to talk to just any manager I want to talk to THE STORE MANAGER I wont leave until Ive talked to themNow the store manager was not there at the time but my supervisor and the manager on duty were only a few feet away from me They had not heard this rant though because we had become very busy and they were both helping customers I was trying not to look panicked though I eventually got the attention of the MOD who swiftly took over the situation Crazy bag lady started ranting again Its ridiculous that you have this policy of asking if we want bagsMOD Well its not really our store policyCBL Then why did your cashier ask if I wanted a bag Thanks for that MOD MOD Our cashiers just like to ask that because some people dont want bagsCBL Well does she think Im stupid Anyone with this much stuff would want a bag Im green Ive been green for longer than youve been alive I recycle Note CBL is probably in her s and MOD is in his s though looks to be in his sMOD Im very sorry this happened and I agree it is very ridiculous I live in a different city that has outlawed bags and its very annoyingMOD kind of just apologizes over and over again and distracts her rage from me as she makes her stand and stages her protest and I finish scanning and bagging Her rage subsides a little and we manage to get her to leaveTo this day one of my coworkers will tease me and ask aggressively if he can have a bagFast forward to a few weeks later Im the only cashier and Im close to finishing my transaction when I see CBL come through the door with something to return Amazingly Trouble by Taylor Swift was playing in the background when she walked in When we have any sort of line we are encouraged to call for backup cashiers though if we think well be done pretty soon we usually just rush the end of the transaction and avoid calling for backupLuckily for me a coworker is walking by and I call to him Can you backup as I slow down considerably trying to avoid a confrontation with this woman Coworker doesnt know what hes in for Poor guy He says Sure and takes her to the first register After about  minutes of cashiering I look over and her return is still on the counter and neither she nor my coworker are doing anything The MOD different one than last is talking to her says When we dont have a receipt or the card it was originally paid with we have to give store credit Theres nothing else I can doShe yells I dont want store credit I dont want to ever shop here again Everything you sell here is crap Why would I ever want to come in here againMOD says he will look through all the purchases for that item in the last several months to see if he can find her transaction otherwise he will get in trouble with regional management for returning an expensive item onto a card without the receipt It takes about twenty minutes and my coworker is trapped at his register all while this woman is still ranting at him about how crappy the item was how it broke suddenly on her and how were a terrible storeMOD is able to find her transaction and returns the item onto her new card CBL leaves supposedly to never returnI apologize profusely to coworker after she has left he says its alright but mentions the shoe rack she was returning had broken along the screws in the wood which meant it was her fault it had broken because she had overtightened the screws He said I agree most of the stuff we sell is crap but it was really her fault that this brokeShe did however break her promise that she would never shop at my store again I wasnt the one to ring her out but I saw her again though she seemed to leave without incident I have never seen her after that though Good riddanceTLDR Woman flipped her shit because I asked her if she needed a bag,The Crazy Bag Lady,75

hogglethebear,13,29,1owqxp,167,This unfortunate incident happened several years ago in a bar in some dark corner of England Apologies if my shoddy memory means some details are vagueThis story starts off in the most ordinary of ways I was a student and working as a bartender in a chain pubrestaurant It was one of those bars that isnt classy but also isnt a complete dive at the same time Most of the the time we had no trouble keeping everything in control and doing our jobs well However this was the kind of place where a situation will escalate out of nowhere and leave the most dedicated of employees confused about whether to run away or stay until the end of their shiftIt was a Sunday quiet as usual and everyone was just waiting for the evening to end Thanks to my bad clockwatching habit I can tell you it was about  at night That gave us  minutes until the bar closed and with everything as quiet as it was wed finished almost all the cleaning and closing downOf course in traditional fuck you Mr bartender fashion a rowdy group of middleaged men sauntered in singing some football chant and demanding jagerbombs After Id helped them learn what jagerbombs actually were but not before theyd downed them the team leader on duty lets call him John took the chance to ask them politely to quiet downIt was then while we both waited for them to chill out that I noticed something I really did not want to notice Above one of the mens heads was rising a thin column of smoke Oddly it was originating around his straw hat Not so odd if you were looking at it from a different angle and could see the blokes friend holding a lighter up to the hat with a mischievous grin on his faceJohn is he on fire I said too bewildered to reactUnfortunately before I could get a reply the hat was more fire than straw and everyone was shouting something I was shouting at the men to put the fire out John was loudly asking them to leave before they burnt the pub down and several of the regulars were cheering in surprise and amusementLuckily one of the men was sober enough to agree that they should probably exit and find another place to burn down The guys started to file out but the arsonist decided now was the time to complain loudly that he shouldnt have to leave for setting his friend on fireAfter all he explained they were out celebrating their graduation from police academy You cant throw police officers out of a bar he reasoned even if theyre lighting each other on fireSomehow while confused beyond belief we managed to get them to leave and after a reasonable period of stunned silence every person near the bar burst into laughter and we made a note to watch the whole thing back on the CCTV,You cant throw us out we just graduated from the police academy,196

Kalcaman,24,52,1ow5gn,229,MooBg Im a pizza manager running a popular pizza delivery store I see all kinds and as I am the boss I usually am the end to all issues My motto is  All problems can be fixed by throwing pizza at it StoryThis one is fresh out of the oven and since the nature of the conversation had with this particular customer was so wild and ridiculus quoting it is near impossibleSo I get a phone call at  minute till close and start up with my usual script even if its a minute from close ill still take that order Right out of the gate the man on the opposite end of the line starts telling me how he had just recieved his pizza from us and it was covered in bugs and how disgusted he was Mind you this man was speaking as if he was an actioneer fast and monotone My initial reaction is always a straight up apology and then to find the order a customer is complaining about and fix the issue while documenting the case Now our computer systems are very up to date and all orders and phone calls are recorded in our caller Idorder system i can see what time a call came in even an order wasnt placed and can look up past orders recorded under numbers Well I attempt to get as much info as possible from him to see where this order went wrong Soon several lies start to surface as well as some odd things being said His story since he was talking like a meth addled junkie I pieced it together from our  minute convo bit by bit He had placed an order from our store no less than  minutes ago and had been delivered a large all meat pizza pepperoni and sausage and xtra cheese it had been delivered by a young guy and his pizza was covered in bugs He had thrown up his friend almost died and he was about to call the police He did not want a refund and only wanted another pizzaInconsistencies at this time of night all pizzas are made cut and boxed by me And its slow enough that I can pretty much track all orders well Not ONE order has gone to the hotel he is calling from in the past  hours which was later conformed by the front desk clerk there and my computer systemThen there was the pizza itself I had not made a single pizza matching any of his descriptions let alone sent it there There was no young men running orders that night Just two girls and a  yo maleComputer system no phone calls to or from any of the numbers he supplied yet he swore he called in He claims he paid cash and the reciept he had proves his order BUT on cash orders here we actually do not give reciepts unless asked and those are memorable requests because I print those reciepts Final was the kicker Each box contains labels on them that has distinct information on them such as address time price and ordrer number When I asked him to look for the very large order number at the top left to verify his order he gave a sob story about how his eyes were bad from recent surgery and he couldnt do that THEN proceeded to read off our address and info from his reciept which is honestly smaller that the label Which the info that he read was actually from our special made hotel cards Really its not that hard to get a free pizza from me you just have to have a previous order from me and some complaint about anything my extra sauce extra cheese pizza was too salty and I would rather throw a pizza your way and ensure you are a happy customer This man would not stop and threatened legal action police a lawyer the news anything to scare me I told him that it was his right but since he was now threatining legal action I would need to have his full name perminant place of residence blah blahFinally it ended with me telling him straight that this was sketch since we had zero records of this transaction he would not get a free pizza and he would not get a refund His reaction was then that he will come in tomorrow morning and I sad excellent ill be there bright and early I happen to be opening as well so please bring the pizza and reciept by and ill gladly fix this for youHe hung upThe whole mess agitated me because while I do make mistakes and will gladly fix them I cannot stand blatent scams Plus I called the hotel front desk to verify if there was an occupant inthe room number given and guess what It was empty Chances are he was just going to hustle us out of a pizza but there was also the chance that I would be sending my driver into a situation where they could be robbedharmed Not on my watchKidsdont do meth,Bugs in my pizza Tales from a pizza manager,281

offbeathamster,206,219,1oshit,768,I Work weekends on the information desk in a large shopping centre and during my time there I have met all sorts of odd people but this guy has to be the worstHe lost his  or  year old son in the centre at a peak time on Saturday no sweat just look for the kid and if all else fails get us to send out an announcement or at least check his kid wasnt at the desk right Wrong This fucknut waits a full  minutes for the kid to find him before deciding fuck this and going homeThe kid had more common sense he found his way to us at the desk and we attempted to find the father no luck After  minutes of security searching we were unable to find or contact the father and were ready to call the policeThen the father rings us and tells us Id like to report a lost child lost about an hour ago He doesnt sound worried or even interested This is clearly just an inconvenience to him But we match up the descriptions and ask him to pick up his offspringThis is where I really lost faith in humanity The guy tells us honestly and openly that he will not pick up his lost son because and I quote Ive got home now and I have started dinner He even goes as far as to tell the child to walk back the journey would take at least an hour and a half probably more It took five minutes of us threatening to get the police involved for him to finally agree to pick the child upEDIT The boy said he spent  mins looking on the different levels for his father initially he only wanted to go up onto the next floor and back down again The neighbourhood the boy said they lived it is relatively goodHowever the thing which is most significant and really annoys me is that it had been raining it was dark pm The reason why we did not call the CPS is that we were letting security handle it They were assessing all the options and were about to call the CPS when the father agreed to pick up the child but  guards had a long word with him escorting him to the car park,Lost Child Some people shouldnt have kids,987

Kaspariano,17,31,1orkmm,103,So this was from the time I worked as a sale assistant in a sport shoes store as in sneakers running shoes basketball shoes etc in a mall near where I lived it was around  years agoThe mall was in a neighborhood that had a Orthodox Jewish community they were usually the nicest costumers You could always tell them apart as all men wore Kihpahs and the women wore skirt that went almost to their anklesSo this women came in with her  daughters youngest was  oldest was  and one of my colleagues got them on the rotation so he went up to them and asked what they were looking for all as usualApparently they were looking for some sneakers for the older girl for gym he asked the size and went up to get her all as normal I later become aware of them again when the woman was raising her voice I went over and hovered nearby see if my colleague needed help and I was just curiousSo the mother had told my coworker that her daughter was a size  this is in Brazil so feel free to look up the conversions if you want so we usually bring a bigger and smaller size along just in caseSo size  was way too small for the girl as was size  this isnt weird btw those are pretty small shoe sizes Noticing this my friend went to get a size  and  just in case when he was stopped by the girls mother who didnt want her daughter wearing bigger shoes she thought sizes bigger than  were unladylike and then she started n her own daughter for pretending the shoes were too small I went and called the manager over who is awesome she basically went over and tried to convince the mother to let us measure the poor girls feet and get her some proper sized shoes the woman was not convinced but she allowed us to get her a size  for her daughter the manager then sends me to the stock and tells to get a size  take out any size indicators and put it in a box for a size I ran up and do this the best I can the mother is suspicious but eventually relents we even fake the receipt so the mother doesnt get suspicious we are afraid of getting in trouble with corporate over inventory inconsistency but its all worth it for the huge look of relief on the girls face when she wears a she that actually fits,Shoe Size,134

RedHeadedBug,6,13,1oreht,33,One fine February evening in  while I was covering our primary cashiers dinner we had a very nice woman NL nice lady from now on come in to return a bag of mylar cat balls She just wanted a straight return but her receipt was from December Very much over the  days we have on our return policyI paged into the office to ask if the policy this week was to give a gift card or cash for the return because our LP and DM refuse to agree on the procedure for such returns Despite our return policy we are to never ever ever refuse a return unless the person returning is on our list of problem peopleMy manager whom we will call J tells me to wait just a moment and he will be right out I tell my customer and all is well so far J comes out and scans the balls with our inventory gun before scuttling off onto the sales floor I exchange a confused look with NL and we wait for him to come back When we does come back he tells NL that we will not be doing the return because we should have three packages on the shelf and we only have two and that her package looks brand new as if it had never left the storeHoly shit on a shingle what the fuck are you doing J He argues back and forth with NL while I am trying to tell him a saw her walk in with it and it just has an old receipt Finally poor NL says that she doesnt need the return but wants our customer service number his first name and our store number all of which he refuses to give her before he locks himself in the office Im freaking out and apologizing to this woman like my very life depends on it I give her all the info she asked for and keep apologizing NL lives up to her name and is very nice to me and keeps telling me it isnt my fault and that she isnt mad at me She leaves but tells me she will be right back in to get cat litterShe does come back to get her cat litter and comes through me line again As I am just about to process her payment J come bursting out of the office which is just behind my register and asks very loudly and very forcefully if there is a problem I tell him no that NL just wants to get her cat litter and go home Then Im pretty sure J lost his goddamned mindHe starts in on NL demanding she give him the mylar balls and telling her that he had checked the camera and she didnt walk in with them He tells her that if she just goes and gets them he wont have to call the police NL is understandably upset and keeps saying she doesnt appreciate being accused of something she didnt do All this is happening as I am trying to tell him that NL did come in with the balls and I saw her He eventually tells NL that he is contacting the police and that he needs to speak with me in the office NL tells him go ahead and that she has done nothing wrongIn the office J calls our GM and explains while I pace and freak out and try not to pull out my hair He gets off the phone and shows me the camera footage of her coming in with a cart to get her litter I have to explain to him four times and then find her coming in the first time through our secondary door to get him to believe that she didnt steal those stupid mylar balls Now he is freaking out as badly as I am and keeps asking me what he should do I of course have no idea how to make this right and am still freaking out myselfJ finally goes out and apologizes for his mistake and has me finish the transaction which I took  dollars off of because that was the highest amount I can take off without a manager I keep apologizing the whole time She leaves and again assures me she isnt mad at meGM comes in and we tell her everything that happened separately By this time I am off the register and our primary cashier is backGM leaves again but not  minutes after that NLs husband comes in In full police uniform He is furious and demands to speak with everyone in the store He yells and screams about how dare we treat his wife like that totally uncaring of who he is directing his anger at Now between my nerves from the whole incident and now a very large very armed man yelling at me and my coworkers I am crying He points at myself and our primary cashier and demands to know which one is RedHeadedBug J of course points me outIm terrified and crying so when he lifts up his giant hand and sets it on my shoulder I almost pass out He tells me that he is sorry he yelled at me and that his wife was very happy with the way I tried to handle things before turning to my manager and tearing into him again He finally leaves and I am seriously wishing I wasnt pregnant so I could go have a cigarette J doesnt look much better The whole thing took just over  minutes but it felt like hoursI found out later after talking to one of our other managers that J told GM when she came in that there was no receipt and that NL did not come in with the balls He also said that the lady threatened him and myself Apparently he did get in trouble and got a write up for the whole thing but they defended him to our DM when he heard about it His story totally conflicted with what the customer said which would have been in Js favor had it not been for the fact that my story lined up perfectly with NLs I got a caught in the act which meant I got a nifty little multitool with a flashlight and a knife on it with out store logo TLDR Manager accuses a woman of stealing  dollars worth of mylar balls when she didnt Her husband comes in and terrifies everyone working Manager isnt fired over it,Still Amazed They Didnt Fire Himlong,46

Shawntae,13,14,1oqlc5,29,This arent exactly stories but rather a few of the things Id like to apologize for during my time in retail The Karma for these things has not yet caught up to me that I know of so maybe if I apologize Karma will let bygones be bygones  I worked for a well known company as a Sandwich Artist The shift before me had been busy and they did not get to prep for my shift Among other things I had no unfrozen chicken patties I put some in a container put the container in warm water and prayed no one was in the mood for chicken About  minutes in a customer wantsyou guessed itchicken I grab one of the thawing patties throw it in the microwave located under the counter which prevents customers from seeing what youre doing and hope it doesnt turn into chicken jerky I make her other sandwiches leaving the dreaded chicken for last I open up the microwave thank god its unfrozen and edible I grab it out of the microwave thank the sandwich gods burn my hand on the hot chicken and drop the it along with my hopes on the floor I couldnt stall for another chicken patty so it was either serve her a frozen one or wipe the floor chicken off and be done with it Yup I gave the lady floor chicken Im not proud of it but the manager would have flipped out if a customer complained about us being out of something because of lack of prep and would have flipped out even more over someone biting into a frozen chicken It seemed like my best option So dear lady who got floor chicken from me in the summer of  Im sorry Also working as a Sandwich Artist when I started there was a promotion going on  footlongs for  This was many moons ago before super fancy automation that would automatically ring up promos so you had to manually discount each sandwich to give them the promo price A very nice couple came in ordered the deal and when I rang it up the total was like  The guy hands me cash and his girlfriend stops him saying thats too much for it to be the right price I delete the order ring it up again same total The guys says he doesnt care and pays me anyway Im sure he felt bad for  year old me first week on the job looking like a deer in headlights It dawned on me later that night but Id forgotten to give the discount on each sandwich I will say though that because of his understanding Ive always been very kind to all people working in retail mistakes happen its not always intentional But to the couple who I over charged and did not bite my head off for it I am sorry This last one is not so bad It kind of depends on how you look at it Working in fast food things can get hectic and sometimes you have to make hard choices There were several occasions where I was trying to get the current car out of my drivethru but waiting on french fries to be done because we were short Like they ordered a large but we only had enough to fill a medium Well Id shove a crisscut or two in there to fill up the container and finish it off with the french fries that were ready Technically the crisscut costs more and whenever I get a stray onion ring or crisscut fry in my container Im stoked Im a fryfrench is half full kinda girl But it was kind of a dick move and for that I would like to apologize  Quick one when I worked drive thru during graveyard hours I would wait to give people their sodas until the very end because on more than one occasion I had people chug the soda and demand a refill then yell at me when I tell them it was corporate policy to not handle the cup after theyd drank from it To my thirsty customers who longingly stared at their drinks through the window Im a little sorry TL DR OP admits retail shame and begs for forgiveness ,Something different I have a few things to apologize for,43
