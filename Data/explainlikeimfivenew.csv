There are countless instances where a company is found to be at fault with the public and is legally asked/obligated to change (even though this measure in Switzerland didn't pass), but it seems that very little actually happens or comes about.

Why don't companies just admit they did something wrong and change their practices to serve people better?  Is the purpose of these laws/regulations/fines for the sake of posterity or appearance or appeasement, or is there something more to them that actually impacts change?  If not, what would impact meaningful change in the business practices of corporations?

You ask for change, elect a specific promise of change, and you get change, just was it the exact change you wanted?

We are going to add a feature! This feature will give the masses the connectivity they have always been asking for... Well yes, it takes away from some privacy and other things they wanted... We will announce the permanent changes after we have launched for 6 months...

Kartinka,3,,1,1rfyja,,0,"I'm aware this question isn't new or mind-blowing, but while I vaguely pretend to understand the concept of tuition inflation, I'm flabbergasted when my down-South friends tell me what they pay in tuition! I understand that student fees for a regular university in the States can easily reach 20, 30, 40k per year, and I'm not too sure how anybody is expected to be able to pay that considering that that comprises a yearly salary for some people? How long would it take for you to pay off your $100k student loans, say, if you graduate and get an average-paying position in middle management or whatever? Do the numbers I'm guesstimating above even include room and board?

For context, I'm currently on round two of attending one of the more respected universities in Canada. My tuition is the highest it's been in years, roughly $8000CAN (which I find to be highway robbery), plus the expenses which come with living off-campus. On-campus tuition fluctuates at roughly $14k this year, to be extremely general. Of course, there are specialized programs, including commerce, engineering, med school, etc. that are significantly more expensive, but on the other hand, college (as opposed to university) tuition is something like 3k/year here. 

I just can't believe that higher institutions expect parents to start a college fund for their kid right when it's born, some 18 years before admission! Can someone explain this to me? Because every American I've spoken to thus far doesn't seem to understand my confusion.

P.S. Also, and I'm sorry if this is a silly question, but why are so many countries able to maintain free or nearly-free tuition for their students based on entrance exams, and why is this not a viable system to implement in Canada or the U.S.?

Background: I have ALWAYS been curious about this. When I was in 4th grade, we were learning about rocks and such. My teacher poured about an inch of sand Into a glass (16oz or so), filled the rest with water, and mixed it up. As we watched it settle, he told us about how eventually, given enough time, the sand would Turn into stone from the pressure of the water. He left the glass up on a high shelf so it could 'sit' throughout the school year.

Would that be possible with such a small amount of water? It has been a little over 15 years since I witnessed this; if I could find that same glass today and poured it out, would there be any difference as to what my teacher mixed up 15 years ago?
