daniellelasvegas,119,386,1r28l6,1290,Backstory  So I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan I live very close to a NJNY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner Its a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly So if youre lucky enough to get a seat youll enjoy your ride into the city in comfortThe epicenter of the train is in Jersey City This stop could be considered the Grand Central of this small train line This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city This is your chance to get the coveted seatNow as a young healthy female I dont mind whether I get a seat or not It definitely is nice to have one just so I dont feel like a sardine but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly manwomanThe Story  The platform was empty since a train to the city just left they come every  minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited People began filling up the spaces around me Nothing new People stand next to me behind me etcetc but since I am standing right behind the yellow line no one goes in front of me since theyd probably fall onto the tracks Some girl lets call her PB for pushy bitch my age clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me Im sure PB angered those several people but I didnt hear anyone complain PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her leftANYWAY the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform Because everyone wants a seat on the train you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit I always hold my ground because I dont want to end up as rail pancake The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little shove Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didnt affect my time or ability to catch myself I turn around and its PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else I knew it was her Also if it were even possible at this point she moved closer to me I feel her breathing down my neck The train pulls up and the doors are directly in front of me but they arent open yet It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doorsPB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train Of course I am as close as I possibly could be but she wasnt satisfied Shes off the phone now Another bag hit Im pretty ticked off by now and it was like this petty revenge was meant to beSo I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her I did it a couple of times I finally decided to say Hey did you drop that and I pointed to the ground near her At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasnt fast enough She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots Oh well PB dont be a pushy bitchTLDR  Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train Pulled the old did you drop that on her making her miss her chance to get a seatEdit words,Almost push me onto the tracks Good luck grabbing your desired seat,1676
neenerneenerboo,69,490,1qw75b,1255,Sorry this is long But oh so sweet This guy that went to my high school Jimmy was the absolute worst He was the typical asshole jockeveryone let him get away with shit But I acted cordial around him because we shared mutual friends and classes I would sometimes call him out in a teasing way so he thought we were even friends My main beef with him was the way he treated girls Though Jimmy wasnt very attractive he coasted on popularity and our school was very small with more girls than boys He mostly preyed on underclassmen my first interaction with him was turning him down as a freshman because he seemed creepy but he was a great charmer and manipulator when he wanted to be so I witnessed over and over again as hed suck in one of my friends who would be convinced that hes changed for her and being genuinely nice this time and then turn on the assholery once she was emotionally invested He dated one of my friends Jane who is the sweetest person in the world She was going through some tough times at home with a prolonged family illness and Jimmy just would not give her a break Telling her shes gaining weight flirting with other girls in front of her general toying of her emotions You could tell she was super stressed out and finally she broke up with him Wahoo But it didnt end there We had assigned seats in computer class and I sat between Jimmy and Janes sister Beth who is equally sweet On the other side of Jimmy sat all of his jock friends close to Mr Teachers desk so he could try to keep them in check where they would act obnoxious and talk loud so that the whole room could hear about how awesome they were Right after the breakup Jimmy talked about how hes over it and already has a few public school sluts lined up lols private school lifethis was the equivalent of having a girlfriend you met on vacation so she lives in a different city and other stuff that was really disrespectful to Jane and it seemed very intentionally done in front of Beth who was not a confrontational person I plotted Jimmy was very insecure about his intelligence Since he was put in the spotlight so often it was easy to see that while he could get an A at getting girls to send him nudes he struggled academically So I left lunch early one day to get in the computer room before everyone else I hooked up an extra mouse and keyboard into his computer pulling the cords behind and underneath the desk so that the mouse and board could rest hidden under my pullout keyboard there was a lot of hidden room they sat just out of view above my own keyboard Jimmy made a loud and unnecessary entrance as usual but when he tried to log in to his computer to start the assignment he just could not get it right This is because I would sneakily tap a key as he would type in his student password He tries a few more times before yelping for help from Mr Teacher who looks annoyed after typing in Jimmys information just fine Maybe you had your password wrong he says but Jimmy is insistent that he isnt that stupid and something is wrong with the computer I tormented Jimmy for weeks pushing the extra keyboard and mouse as far up as I could to hide it in between classes He would put his mouse icon over a button and then Id slightly wiggle my extra mouse before he clicked on it infuriating Jimmy that he could not select something Inputting passwords and other information was often impossible His documents were full of typos He would type a word and I would just press one letter to throw him off and then hed try again only for the same thing to happen Pretty soon he just used spellcheck instead but rightclicking that function was difficult for him when I was paying attention Open the task manager while hes in a program Hed look away and Id close a window or document or just press backspace until he turned around I was careful to be pretty inconsistentwhen other people were looking Id back off to make him look crazy Whatever hed been trying to do would always work when Jimmy called the teacher over My movements were minute and mixed in seamlessly as I typed on my real keyboard I started to punish him this way Wandering eye Wandering mouse while hes trying to play a game Distracted as he bragged to his friend about texting with that na√Øve freshman Oh look his PowerPoint text boxes somehow all got rearranged Ignore new girlfriend because its funny Unexpected shutdown because losing unsaved work is funnier One time he tried to reset a password where the characters are replaced with dots for privacy and I put a number at the end of his new password and the same thing when he confirmed the password This new password then didnt work and he couldnt reset it again without knowing the current password Jimmy was going nuts but it was all so subtle that his complaints made him look like a crazy person who didnt know how to use a computer He insisted over and over again that something was wrong with the computer His assignments took longer so he had less time to horse around with his friends People started to talk about how irritable and unpleasant he was during computer class and people would even tease him about not being able to use technology if he had any problems with his iPhone or anything One time when I was sure that no one else was looking and Jimmy didnt even have his hands on anything I wiggled the mouse slightly back and forth as he stared at the screen His eyes widen and he shouts Look interrupting Mr Teachers lecture I stop It was doing it My mouse was moving and I wasnt even doing anything We all look at each other in disbelief over Jimmys delusions as he keeps yelling myself and Beth included although we were laughing on the inside giddy at the thought of telling Jane later about Jimmys meltdown Thats it Mr Teacher said worn thin over Jimmys incompetence No one else is having problems with that computer Youre just not compatible I guess Move to that one He points to a computer far away from his buddies and any other students which is usually used by people giving presentations or student teachers Jimmy protests suggesting Mr Teacher just fix it but at this point Jimmy is pretty done with that computer too We werent bothered by Jimmy too much the rest of the year in that class But to my surprise Jimmy still had problems Almost all the stuff I was doing He stopped complaining since it made him look like he was just hopeless with simple tasks but he would still ask me questions about what it could be after class since he thought I was relatively good with computers One day alone in the computer room I was inspecting the computer that Jimmy used when Mr Teacher comes in He sat down at his desk and got a sly look on his face as he messed with a cordless mouse which wiggled around on Jimmys screen Wifi he explained Turned out Mr Teacher knew what I was doing all along He hated dealing with Jimmy too and distracting him meant less class disruption But after his meltdown Jimmy just raged quietly in his corner as he failed to engage his faraway friends Tldr Guy is a douche to my friend plug a secret mouse and keyboard into his computer and mess with him He goes crazy and everyone talks about it Edit for more info We had a pretty relaxed atmosphere our teacher was a young lad who just taught an easy class in order to be a coach and he was Jimmys track coach so even though Jimmy annoyed the shit out of him during class they joked around a lot At our school the real authority was with the coaches so a prank like this between them would have been a big deal He was the kind of teacher that let us spend a lot of time playing games and helped us with senior pranks as long as they were tame enough He was just a few years out of college and only really messed with jimmy when he was a disruptionJimmy really actually was bad with computers At one point he thought his MacBook was totally broken because he accidentally leaned on the dim screen button so his screen was black He would never notice anything unusual plugged into his computer I know that using Bluetooth doesnt always require a USB and it has been many years since I was in high school so perhaps thats what the teacher meantI am really not that great with that stuff myself Jimmy only thought I was good with computers because he was amazed by things like keyboard shortcuts ,The time I played with a high school player,1745
teuker,158,401,1r5efr,997,Once upon a time I was a graduate student in a liberal arts field Now the department I was in was to put it mildly rife with squabbling petty professors more concerned with marking their territory and playing favorites among the grad students One professor had it in for me She didnt much like my theoretical approach that I took in one of her seminars nor did she like my prospective dissertation adviser Every two years in a graduate students time there they undergo a review At my fourthyear review as I was told later on by a professor who I was friendly with she complained about me being a misogynist a comment that was entirely out of line and that NO ONE backed up at the meeting At any rate within a year I decided to transition out of academia into a field that made moneydoing course management for the IT team of my university But I still harbored a grudge at being malignedOne of the systems that I maintain governs the uploading of syllabi to meet a state mandate Its a balky system and occasionally has issues with crosslisted courses that end up in requiring me to to go manually fix them for the faculty Once I learned the system I saw my path of revengeI crosslisted this professors courses which never were crosslisted in the first place with a test course meaning that every time she tried to upload she had an error message saying that she needed to contact the system maintainer for help So she sent an email to the general address for this and I was able to respondFirstname she LOATHED being called anything except Dr LastnameIts rather odd that you had this error but I have been able to fix this problem for you You may go ahead and upload your syllabusTeukerI never saw her face after she got the emails Ive done this for the last two semesters but it warmed my heart to know that I was able to inconvenience her in just the smallest of ways,Call me a misogynist Good luck uploading your syllabus without me,1398
gottadance,110,254,1r2c95,976,My Alevel biology teacher told me she refused to assign me a coursework project because I missed the lesson where the coursework was arranged I had told her beforehand that Id being absent to go to my brothers funeral She shouted at me for  minutes saying I wasnt her responsibility that I didnt take my education seriously and Id have to get zero for the coursework element which meant losing  Every time I opened my mouth to suggest a solution she got angrier I went to speak to the head of science who was shocked at how shed treated me and agreed Id done nothing wrong My biology teacher kept being a bitch to me after that so I swapped her whiteboard pens for permanent markers She got through three quarters of the lesson before realizing Even if I had got caught the ensuing meltdown was well worth it I started feeling sorry for her after she started crying so I told her going over it with a dry erase pen and rubbing it off might work She had to explain to the next teacher that he couldnt use one panel of the board because she used the wrong pens She spent the entire lunch break getting it off,Teacher shouts at me for going to my brothers funeral I swap her pens for permanent markers,1230

compuhyperglobalmega,58,150,1qzcpe,697,Was sitting in massive surface street commuter traffic  This was lane road near several shopping centers and multiple intersections jammed with cars very slow going  My goal was in sight however  If I could just make it through the next light I could hit the freeway onramp and get out of here  As luck would have it the light turned red just as the car in front of me crawled through the intersection  Stuck for another  minutes  My own irritation was interrupted by a loud honk from behind and I glanced in my rearview mirror to see a middleaged woman in a lifted Ford F gesturing wildly at me as though I cost her the lightI just smiled and prepared to ignore her until I noticed the red lights of a fire truck and EMT heading our way from behind trying to make their way through the traffic jam  There were so many cars with nowhere to go at one point they were forced to cut through the shopping center parking lot  While Im watching this drama unfold our light turned green and F lady immediately began honking and waving her arms at me  What she didnt notice through her rage but everybody else on the road did was just as the light turned green the EVs had swung into the opposing traffic lanes which had cleared out It was obvious they were going to hit our intersection and swing back into our lanes which had cleared out ahead of the intersection during the red light  The only thing I could do was sit tight keep the intersection clear and stay out of the way I just kept watching in my rearview as the lady became more and more enraged and EVs got closer and closer  She was laying on the horn continuously just as the EVs blew by on the left and swung in front of us and went on their way  The look of horror on her face as she suddenly realized that everyone nearby was staring at her like the asshole she was was doubled when our light turned red again before we could get through and I got to watch her cringe with embarrassment for five more minutes,Emergency Revenge,847

ksquid,32,103,1qytdq,404,My first job was in a bowling alleyarcade I originally worked at the prize counter and then switched over to the food court Theyre not the best stories of revenge but they felt pretty good for  year old meThe first tale of revenge comes from a real prick of a coworker During my first week he constantly left me alone behind the counter to go hang out in the food court with some other employees If I had a problem and went to ask him for help he would refuse to move if I didnt have every minute detail leaving me running back and forth between Prick and a now annoyed customer There were many times where he left the counter to go play games on the clock something I had been told was a fireable offense He constantly had a problem with anything I said or did or enjoyed When introducing me to other employees or regulars he would always say Thats ksquid the lesbian because I had a short hair cut He also would refer to me as retard or call anything I liked retardedYou may be wondering whether or not I went to management I did Multiple times I told them exactly what Prick was saying and doing but they either ignored it or laughed and said something like Yep thats Prick for you I tried going to the arcade manager to get different shifts but there were none available I was stuck working with Prick all the timeEventually we all found out that Prick had dropped out of high school In May of his senior year No intention of continuing elsewhere or getting a GED Wat On this particular night some of Pricks friends had come in to say hi and play games and Prick started making fun of everything about me his friends joining in and all of them having a good laugh at my expense Finally Prick says Ksquid youre such a fucking retard Without skipping a beat I replied Yeah I may be a retard but at least I wont have to work here for the rest of my fucking life He stared at me slack jawed while his friends were rolling with laughter He never called me retarded againThe second story of revenge took place after I switched to the food court to get away from Prick and while I was planning on putting in my two weeks notice A friend from school had gotten me an interview at the coffee shop he worked at and it seemed definite that I would be hired I was in the endBeing that the bowling alley was my first job ever I was a total model employee suck up Id be there early every day stay late do whatever the managers asked without complaint or question and took shifts for people whenever they asked After switching to the food court it was also rather common for the food court manager to schedule me from pmm and then come to me at pm the day of to say that she was leaving to see her boyfriend and that I was to stay until close at am I did this without complaint and often without a break even though it was illegal to have someone under  working past midnightI had put in a request off for a particular weekend well in advance I was promised that I would have it off with no issue Lo and behold I get scheduled both Saturday and Sunday I went to the food court manager who told me that she and her boyfriend had decided to go away for the weekend so I would just have to work I went to the GM who told me there was nothing he could do I had to find someone to cover both shifts Of course not a single person was willing to take my shifts Even though Id taken at least  shifts for each of them I went back to the GM who told me Its not my problem I dont careDefeated I went home at the end of my shift and just bawled I was so sick of being treated like complete shit of being talked down to and taken advantage of It was then that I decided my revenge Cue to Saturday afternoon  pm Im sitting comfortably in my PJs at home The bowling alley arcade and food court were likely already swamped with customers and it would only continue to get more and more busy I called the food court and said I wouldnt be coming in Id quit The guy I was supposed to work with immediately got the GM on the line You cant quit now Its the busiest night of the week Male coworker is the only one weve got Food Court Manager is out of town and I know you couldnt find anyone else to work for you What do you expect us to do I took a breath steadied my voice and said Its not my problem I dont care  then hung up,Two stories of Petty Revenge from my first job,507

YesYouCannot,103,123,1r7zub,419,So I have an  year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction If you tell him to get off his PS at am on a school day hell chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over Sometimes when you give him helpful advice hed palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what youre telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn wayAnyway the other day he was at home on a school day I woke up when his mum he and his mum live in the house with us had already left for work I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home something he does a lot and something she gives in to a lot After having to experience this many times I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS I decided that even though I wasnt certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother my mum and owner of the house entitled him to a bit of karma So I turned off the router He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either It was great The entire day he was at home I heard barely a sound from his room also the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the betterLater during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house some  hours after he had been awake I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends It was very civil and didnt involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when hes gaming with them I was impressed by his good behaviour He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour I palmed it off and said I didnt know because I didnt want him to know how easy of a solution it was but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home he had been relatively good today compared to other days so I figured Id cut him some slackAs I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left he approached me asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it He was very polite at this point so I was quite happy to help him I continued to say I didnt know what was wrong with the internet but Ill check soon and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS to his mobile for internet He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me You cant do that Ive tried it and it doesnt work I told him yes you can I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time I told him my friends connect their PSs to their mobiles all the time too a lie but I just wanted him to know that you can do it He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PSs cant do that So I told him that if his PS connects through WiFi then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet I spent around  minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him I ended up snapping at him Fine You know what If youre going to have that attitude when I try to help you then Im not going to bother checking on the internet He didnt say anything went into his room and angrily slammed the door I didnt care and just left the house He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me Not only that but I intend on doing this to him every time hes at home from now on I cant wait for his school holidays to start where hell be at home all day without internetAlso I found out later that day that his mum didnt even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drainEdit Holy shit woke up to so many comments Will begin replying now Sorry for the delay  scratch that will reply in an hour or two after I do some errands first,Okay you can play in offline mode then,542
lessthanthreesquared,23,70,1qzcxw,284,A friend and I were traveling together but had been assigned an aisle and window seat We were hoping no one would be seated between us but some guy hopped on the flight just before we left My friend asked him if he wanted an aisle seathe said sure and started to get up but when she pointed out that in the row next to ours  and the one behind us there were empty aisle and middle seats he refused politely and sat back down Weird but no big deal We expected someone to be in the middle seat when we got the seating assignments so this guys own stupidity confused us more than it annoyed usGenerally I tend to give the person in the middle seat a lot of leeway full reign of the armrest keeping any of my movements into their space to a minimum air lights etc He began our relationship by splaying his elbows into my seating area and listening to shitty live music on his phone without headphones but electronic devices would be turned off soon enough and I figured Id only need to say something if he did it again after takeoff I used a magazine as a force field to get his elbow out of my seat turned the channel to something boring enough to sleep to and settled in Thankfully the music stopped once he turned off his phone for takeoff and I thought it would be the end of thatOnce we were in the air though he threw his jacket over himself spilling sleeves and coattails into my seat and my friends seat and both of us kept handing back his sleeves asking him to be more careful Hed make a show of tucking in loose ends and being in his own space but every time he shifted it would happen again I later found out he had also used my friends armrest controls and gotten wildly confused when his channels werent changing but when he was asked to stop did he apologize Of course not He was just generally a clueless idiotHeres the thing clueless idiot thing aside he really wasnt that bad UntilMy personal last straw was when I fell asleep comfortably and woke up in a deep sweat because he had taken it upon himself to turn off my air He kept craning his neck into my seating area to look out the window so once I caught on to that I shut it for the rest of the flight so I could sleep Thing is I like to see the lights in the city when we land so I had to weigh my options when we began to descend I knew he would enjoy the show but I too wanted to see the lights and I felt an opportunity for petty revengeSo I opened the window and he jumped into action craning his neck moving his elbows into my space trying to see better So I made sure my whole face was taking up that window and I turned around to make my best Wow this is AMAZING face at my friend Eventually he reached behind me to open the window between us and the row behind us but by then he was clearly agitated and the plane had reached the landing striptoo late I leaned back in my seat affecting his view of the other window and shut my own window pointedlyWhen we got off the plane we were behind him talking about how pretty the city looks from up in the sky and he shot me a nasty look before we parted ways I could only grintldr Guy is a bad airplane seatmate he gets a nice view of the back of my head while we land,Dont know how to be a good airplane seatmate Hope you enjoy not looking out the window,354

wellingtonbear,27,48,1qzeqs,209,I got my petty revenge sorta indirectly during my first job working at OfficemaxI worked the furniture department and on all the desks chairs etc I would print up the little pull tags and place them in holders on each item in the department  There were hundreds of items and thousands of tags since the store didnt want the number of tags to match the actual inventory we could order an item if we were out of stock and most desks were sold in parts so we had multiple sets of tags for one desk   Id print these out daily due to the number of people who are just browsing and take home tags of stuff they were interested in but didnt actually buySo one Saturday afternoon this couple comes in with this little brat that is just running wild all over the store  Yelling screaming picking up and slamming the handsets down on the display phones and fax machines taking merchandise off the rack and throwing it onto the floor etc  Just being a general terror and the parents just completely ignoring herA different customer came in and bought a desk so I went to the back and found the item loaded it on a flat bed cart and wheeled it up to the front desk to carry it out to their car from them   Our entrance was at the very end of the shopping center and customers had to walk PAST the exit door to get to the entrance door  This was very annoying because if the exit doors opened when they walked by it they would walk in through the exit while i was trying to wheel out heavy furniture so whenever I would see this happening i would turn off the sensor on the door so it would not open from the outside and theyd naturally continue to the next doorI saw the father of this nightmare outside talking on the phone and was pacing back and forth and i saw the door open  I instinctively walked over to shut off the outside sensor  As I was walking to where the switch was thats when I saw it the brat was running out to meet her father and was double fisting a giant stack of pull tags she had removed from nearly every single desk in my department  Just as she exited the carpeted area of the furniture dept she threw them up into the air like confettiShe ran right past me and out the door and sat down on the curb next to her dad  I was flabbergasted and fucking pissed that i now had to pick up all that shit sort them out and find the appropriate desks  Since the parents obviously didnt give a shit all I could do was flip the switch turning off the outside sensor so at least she couldnt get back inThen it happened  I walked back to take my place behind the cart with the desk on it and the little girl turned around and spotted her mom at the next register  She stood up and yelled mommy and darted towards the door which had just started to close  With the censor off it was not stopping as she approached  She got there just in time to stick her fat head through the crack of the door as it closed pinning it up against the door jamb  She immediately tried to fall but for a good second and a half the door held her up BY HER HEAD as her body dangled then the door opened because it was obstructed and dropped her right on her faceA coworker who was uncouth to say the least literally pointed and laughed at her and her mom and she scooped up her daughter and make a quick exit probably on their way back to hell,Brat gets her comeuppance,257

gtrmu,32,57,1qrq75,176,I posted this to tales from retail originally but they dont want it because I guess unless youre bitching about customers or fellow employees they dont care WhateverTo start I work for a major retailer that is known for very low prices and treating their employees like crap You can figure out which one I started there in the electronics department in June In September I was transferred to the wireless department due to  people leaving from there in a  day time frame This made me happy because its not as busy up there and I like working with phones Most of the time though you just get paid to sit around and do nothing Thatll make anyone happyAnyway shortly after I was moved up there electronics got a new assistant manager over the department The person who was above it is still working at the same store just over a different department The old one was someone who actually listened to the associates and did what he could to fix their concerns The new one just sees customers as dollar signs and when she gets a customer complaint she berates the employee without listening to their side of the story I had  complaints in  weeks since shes been there but not one when the other guy was over the department Needless to say her and I dont get alongNow our department manager used to be a fair person She left for  months because she had blood clots in her legs Since shes been back shes been a different person Very strict very dictator like I dont know if it has anything to do with the new assistant manager but I wouldnt doubt it if it didAnyway enough back story For the last month theyve been fucking with my hours Theres usually  shifts for wireless in my store opener mid shift and closer It seems like whenever Im scheduled for one of these shifts and theres a second one scheduled when they come in I always get sent back to electronics Which is all and fine but wireless hours are not as long as electronics hours Not to mention they get mad at me for not completing my work despite the fact that I have to cover the breaks and lunch of whoever is in wireless Classic case of overworked and underpaid And lets not forget my hours have gone down to the point where I only have  hours a week now Lucky if I ever see  VERY lucky if I ever see Heres the revenge part This past Monday I got called by the place I first interviewed at when I moved to where I am now last December I re applied and they want to interview me again So I go and  and a half hours after I interview theyre offering me the job which I immediately accept The biggest reason True full time hours  hours not the retarded retail definition of full time benefits every Sunday off with another day during the week I wouldve been an idiot not to accept itSo I walked into my current work on Wednesday and gave them my notice which was a satisfying feeling itself What was even more satisfying was when the manager asked what my last day would be when I was putting my notice in writing You shouldve seen the look on his face when I told him it would be the day before Thanksgiving That is my ultimate revenge to them You treat me like shit and screw me over I will screw you right backWhile theyre all forced to work Thanksgiving and Black Friday Ill be enjoying dinner with my girlfriends family and have a nice long weekend to rest and prepare for my new job on December ndScore one for the little guyTLDR My work fucks me over on hours I retaliate by getting a full time job and making my last day the day before Thanksgiving so I dont have to work that day and Black FridayEdit Please stop with the fast food comments Its not a fast food joint ,Dick around with my hours Have fun being a person down on Thanksgiving and Black Friday,233
,30,42,1r7z7m,195,Well I work in an office so I can pay for college and all that My supervisor is the department secretary and Im like her assistant secretary but I do  of the work  She is elderly and a very grouchy sarcastic old lady  She should have retired a few years ago  but she just sticks around because she literally can dump her work on me and get away with it When our boss asks her to do something she will say sure thing And the minute he is back in his office she gives the work to me goes back to reading or watching tv and then takes credit once I finish the work  She isnt very good with computers either  She always has to ask me how to get back to her email how to buy stuff online how to add an attachment to an email etc She has recently discovered amazon prime so she has me log her into her account every day so she can watch her show for the entire work day She also never allows her computer to turn off because she doesnt like waiting for it to do its updates whereas if she did them every day the updates would take just a few seconds THE REVENGEI get into work before her every day because she walks in late with a mcdonalds bag every morning Before she arrives I wipe her internet history so she cant just jump into watching tv online she asks me to find amazon for her but I tell her I am working on something for the boss When she finally remembers what amazon is she had to ask me what show she was watching and I just play dumb so she has to search for what looks familiarBut once a week or two after I wipe her history I turn her computer off,My supervisor takes advantage of her position,237

LochnessLurky,13,48,1r0cz0,141,So this happened right after I graduated high school I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London My girlfriend is getting thirsty so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink She grabs a chocolate milk pays for it and we walk back to our gate After opening it and taking a sip she asks me to smell it I do and it definitely smells sour Just to be sure I take a small drink to verify We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her Me We just purchased this chocolate milk but it is bad Can you give us a refund Clerk Its already opened so no I cannot refund the drinkMe Its bad You shouldnt even be selling it Can you replace it with another drinkClerk Smells milk It smells fine You can buy another drink if youd like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is hereAt this time I asked her to call the manager I had an hour to kill before the plane left so why not She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager As people come up and try to buy drinks I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk  minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rageClerk DONT TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERSBitch I already bought something And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake At this point I decided to cut my losses This lady was on a mission to keep her  even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were She had  rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets There must have been upwards of  little packets in each basket I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich to which she replied YesMy mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor I picked up the two baskets dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch walked  feet to the trash can and emptied my pouch I thought that was all but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages I then walked back to my gate but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy tooSo there it is the story of how I paid  for some sour chocolate milk and  condiment packets Hope you enjoyed,Some people just want to watch the world drink sour chocolate milk I hate those people,189
Redsnork,9,29,1r3gpz,136,A few years ago I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop I never abused my power except for this one timeA good friend of mine came up to me one day at school raging mad Her brother who was autistic had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade They would call him names make fun of his strange interests and talk about him behind his backLater that week at our weekly Boy Scout meeting I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had They had made a list of quotes said by my friends brother I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friends brother were in my troop and more importantly under my powerI had an agenda for the meeting something about celebrity eagle scouts but I immediately ditched it as I formed my planI called the meeting to order and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards and that anyone that didnt pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip This entailed digging holes for people to shit in and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we leftI pretended to be nice by allowing people to form their own cleaning groups Naturally the boys that harassed my friend clumped togetherAs soon as everyone was split up into groups I divyed up areas where each group had to clean I gave the bullys the bathroom Now this wasnt a nice modern bathroom The lights were dim the tiles were coming up and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small cramped room The group of about four boys came to me and complained I tried to ignore them but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster I told them that if they tried to report me I would tell him what they had been writing on the board After that they didnt say anythingEveryone else got their jobs done in about half an hour but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meetingBefore I closed the meeting I pulled the bullys aside I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran outThe boys looked scared and not a single one of them said anything in responseThe next day I told my friend what I had done On the verge of tears she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brotherLater on I ended up meeting him and invited him to a boy scout meeting I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop and let him make the first smore during the program that night Ill never forget the smile on his face or the scowls of the bullys as he made his first smoreEventually word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it I admitted to everything He ended up being a friend of the boys mom and was familiar with what their family had to go through He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL but told me to keep on looking out for those who need it,Make fun of my autistic friend Clean the toilets,165
semenhurricane,24,28,1qx2lb,106,TL DR  Gay porn boomerangsThis is a little more fun than most posts on here as it contains no real malice or anger but I think its funny nonethelessI had a roommate in college lets call him Bob  Bobs a great guy and we got along great living together for about  years in college  For various reasons I moved around a lot after college and ended up moving back in with Bob for about a year and a halfDuring this time Bob decided to start messing with my computer  Bob is a bit of prankster by nature  Mostly it was minor stuff that was mildly annoying picking the bathroom lock and pouring cold water on me in the shower hiding and trying to scare the shit out of me when I come around a corner etc  I am really not prankster but I will only take so much before I get revengeBob wasnt great with computers beyond the basics like web surfing typing etc but I think I know the day that he learned out how to change desktop backgrounds because I came into my room to find a naked dude hand on his manhood as my desktop background  Bob was hiding out and giggled when he saw me discover the prank  I rolled my eyes changed the background back and did what I needed to do on my computer  I probably should have set a password on my computer at this point but who wants to do thatAnyway I come back later in the day to find the same picture as my background  Bob laughs  I change it back again silently making a note to think of a revenge planBob traveled a fair amount for his work but it did not always require his work laptop so he often left it at home  Shortly after I found a naked dude as my background he went out of town for work and I had decided how I was going to get revengeI opened up his laptop to discover he had set a password  His girlfriend who also lived with us happened to be around and she helpfully gave me the password she did her best to stay out of our pranks on one another so she assumed she could avoid blowback by helping me and I set about doing the deedCut to a couple days later when Bob comes home  He opens up his laptop and clicks on IE to do some surfing  A gay porn video immediately starts and I start laughing  He scowls at me and says sarcastically something to the effect of thats funny and then tries to open IE again  Same result  He tries various other shortcuts on his desktop only to find that I have helpfully reset all of his shortcuts to point at the gay porn video that I had downloaded and hidden on his hard drive  After watching the first few seconds of the video the fourth time he starts whining about it being his work computer and how I need to fix it because he doesnt know how and he doesnt want to get into troubleBeing the nice guy I am I fix it  He didnt mess with my computer again  And I think he was annoyed with his girlfriend for throwing him under the bus  Not my problem,Youll be sorry if you mess with my computer,134

OscarSaysJackAss,16,24,1qsv0a,99,About two weeks ago we lost  chickens to raccoons  We had not had any issues with animals in several months and so I got a bit lax when it came to locking up the chickens at night  Unfortunately two of our best layers were killedLast night I went to lock the chickens up but it was already dark outside so I really couldnt see into the coop  I noticed that one of the chickens looked like it was not on its normal roost so I went and got a light to investigate furtherWell I discovered that there was a raccoon hiding out in one of the nesting boxes so I set a trap at the entrance to the coop and after some yelling and banging I was able to get the raccoon to run out and into the trapBy this time I was feeling pretty smug  I had trapped the stinky murderous raccoon and was deciding its fate  It was being pretty aggressive and I decided to take my flashlight and give the raccoon a poke its pretty small and fit between the wires of the cage  Well the raccoon was having none of that and it bit the end of the light and pulled it into the cage  Of course at this time I was pissed that the dumb raccoon was going to waste my batteries because I certainly wasnt going to be able to get the light back until the morning when it was time to evict the critterThis morning I went out and discovered that in his act of petty revenge the raccoon had completely destroyed the flashlight  There were a few chunks strewn about the cage and I found the batteries and the bulb  Im not positive but I think the raccoon had a little smirk on its faceTLDRI try to get petty revenge on a raccoon by annoying it with my flashlight  The raccoon gets revenge by eating my light,The one where I try to get petty revenge on a raccoon,123
marvin,11,20,1r3fov,94,Okay so here Im truly trying to live up to the ideals of this forum A very petty revenge act for a minor annoyance a few months ago Not even gonna bother with a throwawaySo Im a Masters student responsible for planning visits at my university for various consulting companies who want to hire our graduates as programmers These events are usually somewhat lavish where the companies in question talk about their businesses and then take  of our students out on the town to have a nice dinner drink lots of beer and socialize What can I say the labor market for programmers right here is insane at the moment I have a certain amount of discretional power regarding which students get to join these presentationsSo for a bit of backstory I was leading a different company presentation on my birthday three months ago Good food plenty of free beer good professional connections and great fun for everyone involved Anyway it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute shes not even a programmer lets call her Claire had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest companys expense Whatever No one cares if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this theyve just saved the  they would have spent on a headhunter So anyway as the night draws to a close me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning At this point Claire notices me and says derisively so do you always spend your birthdays picking up other peoples trash while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up I back away make this small fingerwaving gesture and say nuhuh no trash pickup service for you young lady How did she even know it was my birthday I make another mental note that this girl is no good pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I knowSo anyway back to this November afternoon Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students Ive carefully monitored the guest list this time seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target But we still have two open spots an hour before the presentation starts I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying hey can Claire join us for the presentation since theres still room for more I carefully weigh my options This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway This is when I remember the incident three months ago I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back Sorry man I need to cover my ass on this one Shes not a programmer and get the reply Sure thingI had an excellent meal at our fancy restaurant while having beer and shooting the shit on academic subjects with the companys head researcher Great evening Its nice to be a grad student,Insult me on my birthday three months ago No free food for you,114

bassboyjoe,12,14,1r3dao,73,So there is this girl lets call her Jenna that was on my course at university For whatever reason after the first year in the summer she decided she didnt like me and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this all in quite unsavoury terms A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women had absolutely no idea and thus didnt respond to her advances For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group which was a big deal to me I didnt get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldnt find out until it was too late or when I didnt have the money So most evenings I would come home from uni cook dinner and it eat it in my room on my own She blocked me on facebook which in itself I couldnt give a crap about but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials which meant I couldnt see anything she posted or events she created I tried my best to ignore it and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up however I still never felt like I belonged there which is a horrible feeling when youre a couple of hundred miles from homeAnyway after our final exams we all hit the pub I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years This must have seemed a good idea to her but it was just an insult to injury for me Graduation day comes round today and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses I find my seat in the cathedral one seat into a row Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me Yep you guess it Jenna She is on the end of the row I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me or mention how nervous she was There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet Multiple times she tried to converse with me and multiple times I ignored that bitch At one point I noticed her texting someone mentioning how awkward she felt Might not have been much but it made me feel fantastic TLDR  bitch made my uni years pretty lonely and tedious so I ignored the hell out of her when she was assigned seats next me at graduation ,Make my time at uni miserable Ill ignore the crap out of you at graduation,87

aubzzz,18,24,1qy3oa,23,Some brief background info I worked for a couple of years during high school at a fast food chain that served only fried chicken fingers and a few sides that were not exactly the healthiest By no means is our food unhealthy enough to cause heart problems but we are not exactly a health food restaurant Our menu is small and somewhat limited but people enjoy coming to our restaurant and enjoy our food The story Its a slow day and I am enjoying the shift working the drivethru When we are not as busy it is easier for me to strike up conversation with our customers and being able to talk to some of them really brightens my day Of course there are always a few exceptions But I am having a fairly good day At one point a car pulls up to the speaker to order food After saluting her with a sugercoated greeting the customer speaks Hi yes Ummm Do you have grilled chickenIt is not an uncommon request but it is also one I am unable to fulfill I regretfully respond I apologize maam we only serve our chicken fingers friedThe woman gasps as if her life were just threatened What So you only serve fried chickenYes maam only fried I reiterated I can hear her chuckling over the headset Well it seems to me that you have no concern for those living a healthy lifestyle Note this is a fast food place I can offer you unsalted fries as well as toast without the butter I reply doing my best to be helpful even though this lady seems pretentious For drinks we also haveThe customer interrupts me with a sound of pure disgust No I dont want your your Ugh She apparently does not have the right vocabulary in her mental arsenal to describe the food that repulsed her so  I just want a large diet soda This confused me slightly I wouldnt imagine a woman who seems to be a health nut to order any kind of soda Maybe she was simply counting calories but to me it was counterintuitive to her previous disgust She pulls to my window and paid for her oz drink her angry glaring eyes set fixedly on me I hand her the soda and before I could say another word the woman speeds off obviously still perturbed I am not too bothered and the shift continues as usual The petty revenge Little did she know I filled half of her drink with her requested diet soda and the other half with regular Enjoy the calories bitchEdit If I would have believed my revenge to be dangerous I would not have done so I have had gluten allergies brought to my attention and I feel awful when there isnt really anything I can do But this woman was obviously concerned for her health which means she should go out to a fast food place Also diet soda is worse for you than regular It just has less calories and less sugar So to those of you claiming this was dangerous  I assure you it was not This was a rare instance when I enacted petty revenge on a customer I dont spit in food because thats sick But I will be filling a soda with half water or seltzer next time Thats genius,On a diet Enjoy your soda,47

AnoruleA,16,18,1r6kqx,22,BackgroundBehind my house there is a short narrow alley and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days one night and she needed a place to park  Since road construction was preventing my friend and everyone else in my neighborhood from parking in the street I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spacesConflictWhen me and my friend were watching a movie in my room I heard people talking outside my window  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friends car so I popped outside to explain the situation  Immediately they were on the offensive and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was in fact not our place to park  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work school and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied  NEVER in the halfyear Ive lived here  Whatever I thought theres no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anywaysIt was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car Tenant parking only with permanent marker  Yeah I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property and he said he was the one who wrote the message  This was a grown man probably in his sixties who did it  We exchanged some insults and I leftThis is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge  I can handle irrational people  I expect as much from strangers anyways  But ever since then this happened a month ago the people who live there have started doubleparking which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there  YEAH YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES HUH  THATS WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK  Fucking assholes  I do have my own car but I park it in my driveway during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friends car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways  But apparently they didnt take it  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situationThe RevengeSince I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces  This usually amounts to two a day  So far no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see  Their parking spaces must be so precious to them and it feels so good to slowly make their space less and less attractive to the outside observer,How dare you write on my friends car with permanent marker,40

oohfriedrice,3,14,1qqwlg,14,TLDR Fedora Wearing Douche Canoe causes the One Act Drama productions to have a huge amount of drama so I tell him his essay is perfect even though it is a piece of shit with no main idea that didnt respond to the writing promptThe yearly student directed one act drama productions began with a shit load of drama After each director auditions everyone all the directors fight for who they want to cast because it is unideal to cast one person in multiple shows There is an unspoken rule of seniority Note the word unspoken Directors who have directed before and are seniors have seniority and basically are allowed to cast whoever they want Seniority is then given based on age so if a senior director and junior director have a conflict over casting the senior director gets who they want Due to the dearth of males in drama it was a fight to the death to cast the male you wanted There are six directors Awesome Girls AG who have directed twice before and are seniors Drama Club President DCP Fedora wearing Ass Hat FDAH who caused this conflict Girl who tries to mediate everything and fails me and Young Jew Sophmore YJS FDAH and his codirector a senior wrote their own one act while AG got theirs online AG and FDAH want to cast the same male as their lead but FDAH disregards the fact that AG has SENIORITY over him claiming his one act is the most important Though AG present a perfectly valid argument about how it is their last year directing FDAH says this is not a valid argument and says he should get said male After  minutes of steam escaping from multiple peoples ears FDAH says he has to leave and study for a math test the following day and write an essay due the following day He also says that he is content with casting DCP as his lead relinquishing his hold on the male he had first wanted to castDCP posts potential cast list online for everyone to see and FDAH says he is casting the male actor he had given away to AG because he had yet to hear an argument that has persuaded him The guy does not get the unspoken rule of seniority he just cares about himselfThe resulting conversation resulted in a GINORMOUS timesink of  minutes and Im only at home for  minutes before internet shuts off He further went on to say he was going to ask said male whose one act he wants to be in which a informs male about our inner troubles and b puts him between a rock and a hard space In order to justify his action FDAH said  If ltactors namegt wants to be in both castsfine if not such is life yah FDAH thanks for screwing us over Being that now the cast lists are far from complete DCP proposes another meeting the next day YAY more time wasted in result of FDAHNot ten minutes after posting that he was taking the male actor FDAH asks me if I can edit his essay as we are in the same literature class Analysis of quotes from the book was needed in this essay to prove if the book should be banned or not but sadly FDAH did not get this memo He used quotes from other sources that did nothing to prove his point I told him his essay was perfect and that he would get A even though he did actually complete the essay prompt and had several items in his essay on the automatic zero list,If you cause unneeded drama in Drama I wont tell with you what is wrong with your essay,28

neenerneenerboo,69,486,1qw75b,1263,Sorry this is long But oh so sweet This guy that went to my high school Jimmy was the absolute worst He was the typical asshole jockeveryone let him get away with shit But I acted cordial around him because we shared mutual friends and classes I would sometimes call him out in a teasing way so he thought we were even friends My main beef with him was the way he treated girls Though Jimmy wasnt very attractive he coasted on popularity and our school was very small with more girls than boys He mostly preyed on underclassmen my first interaction with him was turning him down as a freshman because he seemed creepy but he was a great charmer and manipulator when he wanted to be so I witnessed over and over again as hed suck in one of my friends who would be convinced that hes changed for her and being genuinely nice this time and then turn on the assholery once she was emotionally invested He dated one of my friends Jane who is the sweetest person in the world She was going through some tough times at home with a prolonged family illness and Jimmy just would not give her a break Telling her shes gaining weight flirting with other girls in front of her general toying of her emotions You could tell she was super stressed out and finally she broke up with him Wahoo But it didnt end there We had assigned seats in computer class and I sat between Jimmy and Janes sister Beth who is equally sweet On the other side of Jimmy sat all of his jock friends close to Mr Teachers desk so he could try to keep them in check where they would act obnoxious and talk loud so that the whole room could hear about how awesome they were Right after the breakup Jimmy talked about how hes over it and already has a few public school sluts lined up lols private school lifethis was the equivalent of having a girlfriend you met on vacation so she lives in a different city and other stuff that was really disrespectful to Jane and it seemed very intentionally done in front of Beth who was not a confrontational person I plotted Jimmy was very insecure about his intelligence Since he was put in the spotlight so often it was easy to see that while he could get an A at getting girls to send him nudes he struggled academically So I left lunch early one day to get in the computer room before everyone else I hooked up an extra mouse and keyboard into his computer pulling the cords behind and underneath the desk so that the mouse and board could rest hidden under my pullout keyboard there was a lot of hidden room they sat just out of view above my own keyboard Jimmy made a loud and unnecessary entrance as usual but when he tried to log in to his computer to start the assignment he just could not get it right This is because I would sneakily tap a key as he would type in his student password He tries a few more times before yelping for help from Mr Teacher who looks annoyed after typing in Jimmys information just fine Maybe you had your password wrong he says but Jimmy is insistent that he isnt that stupid and something is wrong with the computer I tormented Jimmy for weeks pushing the extra keyboard and mouse as far up as I could to hide it in between classes He would put his mouse icon over a button and then Id slightly wiggle my extra mouse before he clicked on it infuriating Jimmy that he could not select something Inputting passwords and other information was often impossible His documents were full of typos He would type a word and I would just press one letter to throw him off and then hed try again only for the same thing to happen Pretty soon he just used spellcheck instead but rightclicking that function was difficult for him when I was paying attention Open the task manager while hes in a program Hed look away and Id close a window or document or just press backspace until he turned around I was careful to be pretty inconsistentwhen other people were looking Id back off to make him look crazy Whatever hed been trying to do would always work when Jimmy called the teacher over My movements were minute and mixed in seamlessly as I typed on my real keyboard I started to punish him this way Wandering eye Wandering mouse while hes trying to play a game Distracted as he bragged to his friend about texting with that na√Øve freshman Oh look his PowerPoint text boxes somehow all got rearranged Ignore new girlfriend because its funny Unexpected shutdown because losing unsaved work is funnier One time he tried to reset a password where the characters are replaced with dots for privacy and I put a number at the end of his new password and the same thing when he confirmed the password This new password then didnt work and he couldnt reset it again without knowing the current password Jimmy was going nuts but it was all so subtle that his complaints made him look like a crazy person who didnt know how to use a computer He insisted over and over again that something was wrong with the computer His assignments took longer so he had less time to horse around with his friends People started to talk about how irritable and unpleasant he was during computer class and people would even tease him about not being able to use technology if he had any problems with his iPhone or anything One time when I was sure that no one else was looking and Jimmy didnt even have his hands on anything I wiggled the mouse slightly back and forth as he stared at the screen His eyes widen and he shouts Look interrupting Mr Teachers lecture I stop It was doing it My mouse was moving and I wasnt even doing anything We all look at each other in disbelief over Jimmys delusions as he keeps yelling myself and Beth included although we were laughing on the inside giddy at the thought of telling Jane later about Jimmys meltdown Thats it Mr Teacher said worn thin over Jimmys incompetence No one else is having problems with that computer Youre just not compatible I guess Move to that one He points to a computer far away from his buddies and any other students which is usually used by people giving presentations or student teachers Jimmy protests suggesting Mr Teacher just fix it but at this point Jimmy is pretty done with that computer too We werent bothered by Jimmy too much the rest of the year in that class But to my surprise Jimmy still had problems Almost all the stuff I was doing He stopped complaining since it made him look like he was just hopeless with simple tasks but he would still ask me questions about what it could be after class since he thought I was relatively good with computers One day alone in the computer room I was inspecting the computer that Jimmy used when Mr Teacher comes in He sat down at his desk and got a sly look on his face as he messed with a cordless mouse which wiggled around on Jimmys screen Wifi he explained Turned out Mr Teacher knew what I was doing all along He hated dealing with Jimmy too and distracting him meant less class disruption But after his meltdown Jimmy just raged quietly in his corner as he failed to engage his faraway friends Tldr Guy is a douche to my friend plug a secret mouse and keyboard into his computer and mess with him He goes crazy and everyone talks about it Edit for more info We had a pretty relaxed atmosphere our teacher was a young lad who just taught an easy class in order to be a coach and he was Jimmys track coach so even though Jimmy annoyed the shit out of him during class they joked around a lot At our school the real authority was with the coaches so a prank like this between them would have been a big deal He was the kind of teacher that let us spend a lot of time playing games and helped us with senior pranks as long as they were tame enough He was just a few years out of college and only really messed with jimmy when he was a disruptionJimmy really actually was bad with computers At one point he thought his MacBook was totally broken because he accidentally leaned on the dim screen button so his screen was black He would never notice anything unusual plugged into his computer I know that using Bluetooth doesnt always require a USB and it has been many years since I was in high school so perhaps thats what the teacher meantI am really not that great with that stuff myself Jimmy only thought I was good with computers because he was amazed by things like keyboard shortcuts ,The time I played with a high school player,1749

YesYouCannot,103,121,1r7zub,427,So I have an  year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction If you tell him to get off his PS at am on a school day hell chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over Sometimes when you give him helpful advice hed palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what youre telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn wayAnyway the other day he was at home on a school day I woke up when his mum he and his mum live in the house with us had already left for work I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home something he does a lot and something she gives in to a lot After having to experience this many times I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS I decided that even though I wasnt certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother my mum and owner of the house entitled him to a bit of karma So I turned off the router He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either It was great The entire day he was at home I heard barely a sound from his room also the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the betterLater during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house some  hours after he had been awake I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends It was very civil and didnt involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when hes gaming with them I was impressed by his good behaviour He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour I palmed it off and said I didnt know because I didnt want him to know how easy of a solution it was but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home he had been relatively good today compared to other days so I figured Id cut him some slackAs I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left he approached me asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it He was very polite at this point so I was quite happy to help him I continued to say I didnt know what was wrong with the internet but Ill check soon and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS to his mobile for internet He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me You cant do that Ive tried it and it doesnt work I told him yes you can I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time I told him my friends connect their PSs to their mobiles all the time too a lie but I just wanted him to know that you can do it He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PSs cant do that So I told him that if his PS connects through WiFi then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet I spent around  minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him I ended up snapping at him Fine You know what If youre going to have that attitude when I try to help you then Im not going to bother checking on the internet He didnt say anything went into his room and angrily slammed the door I didnt care and just left the house He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me Not only that but I intend on doing this to him every time hes at home from now on I cant wait for his school holidays to start where hell be at home all day without internetAlso I found out later that day that his mum didnt even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drainEdit Holy shit woke up to so many comments Will begin replying now Sorry for the delay  scratch that will reply in an hour or two after I do some errands first,Okay you can play in offline mode then,548
lessthanthreesquared,23,74,1qzcxw,276,A friend and I were traveling together but had been assigned an aisle and window seat We were hoping no one would be seated between us but some guy hopped on the flight just before we left My friend asked him if he wanted an aisle seathe said sure and started to get up but when she pointed out that in the row next to ours  and the one behind us there were empty aisle and middle seats he refused politely and sat back down Weird but no big deal We expected someone to be in the middle seat when we got the seating assignments so this guys own stupidity confused us more than it annoyed usGenerally I tend to give the person in the middle seat a lot of leeway full reign of the armrest keeping any of my movements into their space to a minimum air lights etc He began our relationship by splaying his elbows into my seating area and listening to shitty live music on his phone without headphones but electronic devices would be turned off soon enough and I figured Id only need to say something if he did it again after takeoff I used a magazine as a force field to get his elbow out of my seat turned the channel to something boring enough to sleep to and settled in Thankfully the music stopped once he turned off his phone for takeoff and I thought it would be the end of thatOnce we were in the air though he threw his jacket over himself spilling sleeves and coattails into my seat and my friends seat and both of us kept handing back his sleeves asking him to be more careful Hed make a show of tucking in loose ends and being in his own space but every time he shifted it would happen again I later found out he had also used my friends armrest controls and gotten wildly confused when his channels werent changing but when he was asked to stop did he apologize Of course not He was just generally a clueless idiotHeres the thing clueless idiot thing aside he really wasnt that bad UntilMy personal last straw was when I fell asleep comfortably and woke up in a deep sweat because he had taken it upon himself to turn off my air He kept craning his neck into my seating area to look out the window so once I caught on to that I shut it for the rest of the flight so I could sleep Thing is I like to see the lights in the city when we land so I had to weigh my options when we began to descend I knew he would enjoy the show but I too wanted to see the lights and I felt an opportunity for petty revengeSo I opened the window and he jumped into action craning his neck moving his elbows into my space trying to see better So I made sure my whole face was taking up that window and I turned around to make my best Wow this is AMAZING face at my friend Eventually he reached behind me to open the window between us and the row behind us but by then he was clearly agitated and the plane had reached the landing striptoo late I leaned back in my seat affecting his view of the other window and shut my own window pointedlyWhen we got off the plane we were behind him talking about how pretty the city looks from up in the sky and he shot me a nasty look before we parted ways I could only grintldr Guy is a bad airplane seatmate he gets a nice view of the back of my head while we land,Dont know how to be a good airplane seatmate Hope you enjoy not looking out the window,350

wellingtonbear,27,44,1qzeqs,211,I got my petty revenge sorta indirectly during my first job working at OfficemaxI worked the furniture department and on all the desks chairs etc I would print up the little pull tags and place them in holders on each item in the department  There were hundreds of items and thousands of tags since the store didnt want the number of tags to match the actual inventory we could order an item if we were out of stock and most desks were sold in parts so we had multiple sets of tags for one desk   Id print these out daily due to the number of people who are just browsing and take home tags of stuff they were interested in but didnt actually buySo one Saturday afternoon this couple comes in with this little brat that is just running wild all over the store  Yelling screaming picking up and slamming the handsets down on the display phones and fax machines taking merchandise off the rack and throwing it onto the floor etc  Just being a general terror and the parents just completely ignoring herA different customer came in and bought a desk so I went to the back and found the item loaded it on a flat bed cart and wheeled it up to the front desk to carry it out to their car from them   Our entrance was at the very end of the shopping center and customers had to walk PAST the exit door to get to the entrance door  This was very annoying because if the exit doors opened when they walked by it they would walk in through the exit while i was trying to wheel out heavy furniture so whenever I would see this happening i would turn off the sensor on the door so it would not open from the outside and theyd naturally continue to the next doorI saw the father of this nightmare outside talking on the phone and was pacing back and forth and i saw the door open  I instinctively walked over to shut off the outside sensor  As I was walking to where the switch was thats when I saw it the brat was running out to meet her father and was double fisting a giant stack of pull tags she had removed from nearly every single desk in my department  Just as she exited the carpeted area of the furniture dept she threw them up into the air like confettiShe ran right past me and out the door and sat down on the curb next to her dad  I was flabbergasted and fucking pissed that i now had to pick up all that shit sort them out and find the appropriate desks  Since the parents obviously didnt give a shit all I could do was flip the switch turning off the outside sensor so at least she couldnt get back inThen it happened  I walked back to take my place behind the cart with the desk on it and the little girl turned around and spotted her mom at the next register  She stood up and yelled mommy and darted towards the door which had just started to close  With the censor off it was not stopping as she approached  She got there just in time to stick her fat head through the crack of the door as it closed pinning it up against the door jamb  She immediately tried to fall but for a good second and a half the door held her up BY HER HEAD as her body dangled then the door opened because it was obstructed and dropped her right on her faceA coworker who was uncouth to say the least literally pointed and laughed at her and her mom and she scooped up her daughter and make a quick exit probably on their way back to hell,Brat gets her comeuppance,255

LochnessLurky,13,50,1r0cz0,141,So this happened right after I graduated high school I was going on a vacation to Europe during summer break with some of my classmates We had a great deal through EF Tours and this was essentially our senior trip We get to the New Orleans International Airport and wait for our flight to London My girlfriend is getting thirsty so I walk to the snack stand with her so she can buy a drink She grabs a chocolate milk pays for it and we walk back to our gate After opening it and taking a sip she asks me to smell it I do and it definitely smells sour Just to be sure I take a small drink to verify We walked back over to the clerk and explained the situation to her Me We just purchased this chocolate milk but it is bad Can you give us a refund Clerk Its already opened so no I cannot refund the drinkMe Its bad You shouldnt even be selling it Can you replace it with another drinkClerk Smells milk It smells fine You can buy another drink if youd like but I cannot refund you unless the manager is hereAt this time I asked her to call the manager I had an hour to kill before the plane left so why not She gets on the phone while I hang around her stand and wait for the manager As people come up and try to buy drinks I explain to them that I bought a chocolate milk  minutes ago that was bad and she would not refund or let me trade it in I also pushed the remaining chocolate milks to the back of the refrigerator so nobody could see them The clerk saw me do this and burst out in a fit of rageClerk DONT TOUCH MY PRODUCTS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO BUY ANYTHING AND STOP HARASSING MY CUSTOMERSBitch I already bought something And I was helping your customers to avoid making a mistake At this point I decided to cut my losses This lady was on a mission to keep her  even though she sold me a sour bottle of milk I apologized for touching her merchandise and asked how much the sandwiches were She had  rather large baskets filled to the brim with Mayonnaise and Mustard packets There must have been upwards of  little packets in each basket I asked her if they were free after she told me the price of the sandwich to which she replied YesMy mindset went from curious customer to vengeful victor I picked up the two baskets dumped the entire contents of mustard and mayo packets into an empty backpack pouch walked  feet to the trash can and emptied my pouch I thought that was all but I then realized that I would not put it past this lady to go dumpster diving for some condiments I walked back over to her stand and grab my chocolate milk then turn it bottoms up and empty the rancid milk all over the unused condiment packages I then walked back to my gate but not before giving her a sly wink and telling her thank you for her great service I noticed a few security guards around the stand as we were boarding but I was never approached so I guess they thought she was crazy tooSo there it is the story of how I paid  for some sour chocolate milk and  condiment packets Hope you enjoyed,Some people just want to watch the world drink sour chocolate milk I hate those people,191
Redsnork,9,28,1r3gpz,135,A few years ago I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop I never abused my power except for this one timeA good friend of mine came up to me one day at school raging mad Her brother who was autistic had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade They would call him names make fun of his strange interests and talk about him behind his backLater that week at our weekly Boy Scout meeting I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had They had made a list of quotes said by my friends brother I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friends brother were in my troop and more importantly under my powerI had an agenda for the meeting something about celebrity eagle scouts but I immediately ditched it as I formed my planI called the meeting to order and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards and that anyone that didnt pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip This entailed digging holes for people to shit in and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we leftI pretended to be nice by allowing people to form their own cleaning groups Naturally the boys that harassed my friend clumped togetherAs soon as everyone was split up into groups I divyed up areas where each group had to clean I gave the bullys the bathroom Now this wasnt a nice modern bathroom The lights were dim the tiles were coming up and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small cramped room The group of about four boys came to me and complained I tried to ignore them but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster I told them that if they tried to report me I would tell him what they had been writing on the board After that they didnt say anythingEveryone else got their jobs done in about half an hour but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meetingBefore I closed the meeting I pulled the bullys aside I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran outThe boys looked scared and not a single one of them said anything in responseThe next day I told my friend what I had done On the verge of tears she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brotherLater on I ended up meeting him and invited him to a boy scout meeting I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop and let him make the first smore during the program that night Ill never forget the smile on his face or the scowls of the bullys as he made his first smoreEventually word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it I admitted to everything He ended up being a friend of the boys mom and was familiar with what their family had to go through He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL but told me to keep on looking out for those who need it,Make fun of my autistic friend Clean the toilets,163
semenhurricane,24,30,1qx2lb,103,TL DR  Gay porn boomerangsThis is a little more fun than most posts on here as it contains no real malice or anger but I think its funny nonethelessI had a roommate in college lets call him Bob  Bobs a great guy and we got along great living together for about  years in college  For various reasons I moved around a lot after college and ended up moving back in with Bob for about a year and a halfDuring this time Bob decided to start messing with my computer  Bob is a bit of prankster by nature  Mostly it was minor stuff that was mildly annoying picking the bathroom lock and pouring cold water on me in the shower hiding and trying to scare the shit out of me when I come around a corner etc  I am really not prankster but I will only take so much before I get revengeBob wasnt great with computers beyond the basics like web surfing typing etc but I think I know the day that he learned out how to change desktop backgrounds because I came into my room to find a naked dude hand on his manhood as my desktop background  Bob was hiding out and giggled when he saw me discover the prank  I rolled my eyes changed the background back and did what I needed to do on my computer  I probably should have set a password on my computer at this point but who wants to do thatAnyway I come back later in the day to find the same picture as my background  Bob laughs  I change it back again silently making a note to think of a revenge planBob traveled a fair amount for his work but it did not always require his work laptop so he often left it at home  Shortly after I found a naked dude as my background he went out of town for work and I had decided how I was going to get revengeI opened up his laptop to discover he had set a password  His girlfriend who also lived with us happened to be around and she helpfully gave me the password she did her best to stay out of our pranks on one another so she assumed she could avoid blowback by helping me and I set about doing the deedCut to a couple days later when Bob comes home  He opens up his laptop and clicks on IE to do some surfing  A gay porn video immediately starts and I start laughing  He scowls at me and says sarcastically something to the effect of thats funny and then tries to open IE again  Same result  He tries various other shortcuts on his desktop only to find that I have helpfully reset all of his shortcuts to point at the gay porn video that I had downloaded and hidden on his hard drive  After watching the first few seconds of the video the fourth time he starts whining about it being his work computer and how I need to fix it because he doesnt know how and he doesnt want to get into troubleBeing the nice guy I am I fix it  He didnt mess with my computer again  And I think he was annoyed with his girlfriend for throwing him under the bus  Not my problem,Youll be sorry if you mess with my computer,133

OscarSaysJackAss,16,25,1qsv0a,97,About two weeks ago we lost  chickens to raccoons  We had not had any issues with animals in several months and so I got a bit lax when it came to locking up the chickens at night  Unfortunately two of our best layers were killedLast night I went to lock the chickens up but it was already dark outside so I really couldnt see into the coop  I noticed that one of the chickens looked like it was not on its normal roost so I went and got a light to investigate furtherWell I discovered that there was a raccoon hiding out in one of the nesting boxes so I set a trap at the entrance to the coop and after some yelling and banging I was able to get the raccoon to run out and into the trapBy this time I was feeling pretty smug  I had trapped the stinky murderous raccoon and was deciding its fate  It was being pretty aggressive and I decided to take my flashlight and give the raccoon a poke its pretty small and fit between the wires of the cage  Well the raccoon was having none of that and it bit the end of the light and pulled it into the cage  Of course at this time I was pissed that the dumb raccoon was going to waste my batteries because I certainly wasnt going to be able to get the light back until the morning when it was time to evict the critterThis morning I went out and discovered that in his act of petty revenge the raccoon had completely destroyed the flashlight  There were a few chunks strewn about the cage and I found the batteries and the bulb  Im not positive but I think the raccoon had a little smirk on its faceTLDRI try to get petty revenge on a raccoon by annoying it with my flashlight  The raccoon gets revenge by eating my light,The one where I try to get petty revenge on a raccoon,122
marvin,11,20,1r3fov,96,Okay so here Im truly trying to live up to the ideals of this forum A very petty revenge act for a minor annoyance a few months ago Not even gonna bother with a throwawaySo Im a Masters student responsible for planning visits at my university for various consulting companies who want to hire our graduates as programmers These events are usually somewhat lavish where the companies in question talk about their businesses and then take  of our students out on the town to have a nice dinner drink lots of beer and socialize What can I say the labor market for programmers right here is insane at the moment I have a certain amount of discretional power regarding which students get to join these presentationsSo for a bit of backstory I was leading a different company presentation on my birthday three months ago Good food plenty of free beer good professional connections and great fun for everyone involved Anyway it became clear that a somewhat unpleasant girl from a different institute shes not even a programmer lets call her Claire had managed to get onto the guest list and was having free beer at our guest companys expense Whatever No one cares if these guys can hire one of our grads after an event like this theyve just saved the  they would have spent on a headhunter So anyway as the night draws to a close me and a couple of fellow students are picking up empty beer bottles for the recycling This was in the common study hall where people come to study in the morning At this point Claire notices me and says derisively so do you always spend your birthdays picking up other peoples trash while holding out her empty beer can for me to pick up I back away make this small fingerwaving gesture and say nuhuh no trash pickup service for you young lady How did she even know it was my birthday I make another mental note that this girl is no good pack up and run off to the real birthday event of the night with a different girl I knowSo anyway back to this November afternoon Tonight is the last presentation I am leading before handing the big responsibility over to the next generation of students Ive carefully monitored the guest list this time seeing as the research company in question had some pretty specific thoughts about which students they wanted to target But we still have two open spots an hour before the presentation starts I suddently get a text message from one of the other Masters students saying hey can Claire join us for the presentation since theres still room for more I carefully weigh my options This girl is from a different institute and definitely not the kind of person the company is looking for But no one would notice or care if I snuck her in anyway This is when I remember the incident three months ago I chuckle darkly as I text my friend back Sorry man I need to cover my ass on this one Shes not a programmer and get the reply Sure thingI had an excellent meal at our fancy restaurant while having beer and shooting the shit on academic subjects with the companys head researcher Great evening Its nice to be a grad student,Insult me on my birthday three months ago No free food for you,116

bassboyjoe,12,15,1r3dao,70,So there is this girl lets call her Jenna that was on my course at university For whatever reason after the first year in the summer she decided she didnt like me and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this all in quite unsavoury terms A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women had absolutely no idea and thus didnt respond to her advances For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group which was a big deal to me I didnt get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldnt find out until it was too late or when I didnt have the money So most evenings I would come home from uni cook dinner and it eat it in my room on my own She blocked me on facebook which in itself I couldnt give a crap about but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials which meant I couldnt see anything she posted or events she created I tried my best to ignore it and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up however I still never felt like I belonged there which is a horrible feeling when youre a couple of hundred miles from homeAnyway after our final exams we all hit the pub I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years This must have seemed a good idea to her but it was just an insult to injury for me Graduation day comes round today and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses I find my seat in the cathedral one seat into a row Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me Yep you guess it Jenna She is on the end of the row I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me or mention how nervous she was There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet Multiple times she tried to converse with me and multiple times I ignored that bitch At one point I noticed her texting someone mentioning how awkward she felt Might not have been much but it made me feel fantastic TLDR  bitch made my uni years pretty lonely and tedious so I ignored the hell out of her when she was assigned seats next me at graduation ,Make my time at uni miserable Ill ignore the crap out of you at graduation,85

pickmeapart,4,12,1r6jed,61,I live in a college dorm About a month ago my roommate we lived on the th floor of the building and thenbestfriend decided he no longer wanted to talk to me The reason is a long story in itself basically I had been talking to another girl while I had a girlfriend and he assumed for some reason that I was flirtingcheating When I found out he was judging me for this he had been talking shit about me to another one of our friends I asked him why he hadnt talked to me about it and had instead gone straight to being done with me as a friend He said that he didnt like the choices I was making  and thought I wasnt a good person Anyway I couldnt handle living with him after that knowing that he and his friends thought I was a terrible person so I requested a room change Now I live on the second floor of the building Today when I was coming back from class I saw him waiting for the elevator I took the stairs up to the second floor toward my room and pressed BOTH the up and down buttons on the elevator from the second floor So either the elevator got to him later than it should have or on his way up the doors opened at the second floor and he saw that no one was actually waiting for the elevator and he had to wait probably  seconds for the doors to open and then close before he could go up to his room ,The elevator door has a really long delay too,73

PurplePeduncles,9,20,1qzihb,59,This happened at the store I worked in and didnt involve me but I figured the story was worth telling On my mobile so excuse formatting and long text Ive put in a TLDRI was hired as a sales assistant in a new branch of a large footwear company along with several other new employees The store opened a couple of weeks ago and for the most part the new team all get along and everyone is friendly However the new supervisor lets call him Pete had already shown himself to be not exactly the best supervisor Put briefly he got into arguments with the manager of the store that he trained in childishly complained that he wanted to go home one evening when everyone was staying up late getting the shop setup and then disappeared without telling anyone when he was told that he needed to stay and generally did not follow instructions or act professionally in store On one of these occasions our area manager was visiting and this pretty much resulted in her telling our manager well call her Amy to get rid of him His next shift comes around and he is called into the office for a meeting and even though our manager didnt want to as she has always gotten along with him he is fired on the spotHowever this wasnt the end of it for PeteFirst he put in an appeal to get his job back Fair enough but seeing as the area manager herself told Amy to fire him chances of that were slimA few days later we spot Pete and his girlfriend walking around the shopping centre You have to get a bus out to where we are so everyone thinks this is a bit odd but brushes it off Later on his girlfriend walks into the shop looks around then leaves No big deal Until that is were cleaning up and we find the notice for his replacement screwed up into a little ball and stuffed into a shoe Very professionalBut wait theres more A little while after we find the notice an angrylooking guy in his s strides up to me and demands that he talk to the manager naming her saying they need a private chat He refuses to give a name Amy comes out and he insists they go into the stock room to talk Fast forward a little bit he leaves and Amy reveals that the mystery man was none other than Petes dad Pete is  but has moved in with his girlfriend who has demanded to know why his son had been fired because he was being blamed for something my assistant manager mistakenly did a few days prior long story short if youre going to comment on customers wait until theyve left the store and cant hear you Petes dad threatens Amy with solicitors and appeals but after explaining why Pete had actually been fired he looks pretty embarrassed and leftWe figured it would end there but nope he had one last stunt to pull Amy used to be the assistant manager in another store in the shopping centre were in and is still in contact with her old colleagues A couple of days ago she gets a text from one of them saying Ive had someone called Pete hand in a CV today saying This is to replace Amy  Reeeeal matureHis appeal hearing is this Friday with our area manager who has been made aware everything that has gone on In this case I really dont think any amount of petty revenge will help him get his job backTLDR  Supervisor lost his job appealed for wrongful dismissal then ripped down the ad for his replacement and left it in the shop sent his dad in to shout and my manager then applied to replace my managers place at her previous job Before his appealEdit A word,You really think youll get your job back after that,79

RotatingMaleCow,21,18,1r0xcu,28,A few weeks ago I was making a long drive up to visit some friends and happily flying along in the consistent flow of the fast lane Everything was going swimmingly as usual the fast lane was  the speed limit and going by the other  lanes I was so happy Enter commander shitbird This guy decides that he needs to go faster so he rides my ass so hard I cant even see his headlights Im not sure what he expected me to do as the  cars in front of me were going the exact same speed and were still much faster than the traffic to our right I figured hed ease off after a bit but nope the commander stubbornly persisted and then i saw a big semi truck coming up in the lane next to me Going much slower than the fast lane A mad grin leapt across my face and as I pulled up next to the semi i slowed down considerably to match it  miles slower than the fast lane Unfortunately I had some collateral damage as there was a car behind the commander but there is no way I was about to let this opportunity pass For a whole  fucking minutes commander shitbird was my bitch and going  mph slower than he was previously I was so happy in that moment I could have vigorously masturbated but I didt want to miss a minute of his misery Maybe next time if youd like to continue to enjoy the speed of the fast lane you should reconsider the impudent tailgate Shitbird edit i cant numbers ,Tailgater gets stuck next to a semi which gave me a semi,46
AngryCyc,17,38,1qsbju,23,So my apartment is currently having a contest where everyone is supposed to video their apartment doing an MTV Cribs style tour Whoever gets the most views on youtube by tomorrow night wins some cash That cash used to go to things like keeping our prices low instead of raising them again or for maybe servicing our apartmentsI made my own submission to the contest today herehttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvoSeRwrQUU giving what I think to be a pretty good tour of my apartmentId have had nicer stuff in my apartment but both last year and the year before that when they were doing moveouts for the roommates that were not staying we each rent only our rooms and its a  room apartment the service people they sent in to clean the apartments did not perform as admirably as desired The first year they came into my locked room and completely trashed up the place throwing all my belongings on the ground in the center of the room so they could paint it Apparently they thought that my room was an abandoned apartment or something Several things were damaged but the apartment complex apologized and later paid for the damages to some of my belongingsThe very next year during the same time when moveouts were happening they left my door unlocked and several of my personal belongings were stolen Nothing came of that howeverSuffice to say Im tired of this living arrangement It was a cheap apartment but I can find cheaper now as they have risen the prices and are no longer giving bonuses for releasing Anyway Hopefully this isnt TOO petty for this subreddit,My apartment has not been the best apartment They are doing a video contest for touring your apartment,61

aubzzz,18,26,1qy3oa,21,Some brief background info I worked for a couple of years during high school at a fast food chain that served only fried chicken fingers and a few sides that were not exactly the healthiest By no means is our food unhealthy enough to cause heart problems but we are not exactly a health food restaurant Our menu is small and somewhat limited but people enjoy coming to our restaurant and enjoy our food The story Its a slow day and I am enjoying the shift working the drivethru When we are not as busy it is easier for me to strike up conversation with our customers and being able to talk to some of them really brightens my day Of course there are always a few exceptions But I am having a fairly good day At one point a car pulls up to the speaker to order food After saluting her with a sugercoated greeting the customer speaks Hi yes Ummm Do you have grilled chickenIt is not an uncommon request but it is also one I am unable to fulfill I regretfully respond I apologize maam we only serve our chicken fingers friedThe woman gasps as if her life were just threatened What So you only serve fried chickenYes maam only fried I reiterated I can hear her chuckling over the headset Well it seems to me that you have no concern for those living a healthy lifestyle Note this is a fast food place I can offer you unsalted fries as well as toast without the butter I reply doing my best to be helpful even though this lady seems pretentious For drinks we also haveThe customer interrupts me with a sound of pure disgust No I dont want your your Ugh She apparently does not have the right vocabulary in her mental arsenal to describe the food that repulsed her so  I just want a large diet soda This confused me slightly I wouldnt imagine a woman who seems to be a health nut to order any kind of soda Maybe she was simply counting calories but to me it was counterintuitive to her previous disgust She pulls to my window and paid for her oz drink her angry glaring eyes set fixedly on me I hand her the soda and before I could say another word the woman speeds off obviously still perturbed I am not too bothered and the shift continues as usual The petty revenge Little did she know I filled half of her drink with her requested diet soda and the other half with regular Enjoy the calories bitchEdit If I would have believed my revenge to be dangerous I would not have done so I have had gluten allergies brought to my attention and I feel awful when there isnt really anything I can do But this woman was obviously concerned for her health which means she should go out to a fast food place Also diet soda is worse for you than regular It just has less calories and less sugar So to those of you claiming this was dangerous  I assure you it was not This was a rare instance when I enacted petty revenge on a customer I dont spit in food because thats sick But I will be filling a soda with half water or seltzer next time Thats genius,On a diet Enjoy your soda,47
Morkant,7,23,1qr3bn,21,So a few years back I worked at a fastfood restaurant in Canada As an employee there I was required to work drivethru on occasion which meant serving hundreds of people their food over the course of my shift With hundreds of people coming through And my shifts being later in the day  being the most common I would try and be smiling and upbeat for every customer that came through But sometimes you get that one thats so rude you just need to stand up for yourself somehowSo Im working the drivethru its midevening about  oclock and the rush has died down The store is fairly empty and theres only a few of us left working night shift doesnt get in until  I hear a beep at my headpiece and I answer a middle aged mans call for a pair of donuts Grabbing the donuts I quickly trotted over to the drivethru window and took his money whilst handing him his donuts in a little paper baggy Thinking that was the end of it I smiled at him and turned to resume mopping the floor as he drove off  seconds later I hear a voice through the window Id left it open and see the man is back Hed reversed back into the drivethru only to end up a good  feet away from the window Yelling angrily about how Id gotten the wrong donuts he proceeded to throw the donuts still in baggy at full force through the window forcing me to snatch them out of mid air before they hit the wall and went everywhereI dont think I made a mistake with his order and either way company policy said I was going to replace it anyways but there was no reason for him to be such an ass about it Throwing away the old order I went and got the  new donuts that he requested and walked back to the window to find him standing there having gotten out of the car With a massive grin on my face I handed him the donuts and asked What You didnt want to catch ,Were Not Playing Catch,44

jmorlin,9,35,1qqfbe,17,Last year was my freshman year of college and a close friend of mine from the fifth grade through highschool ended up in the same dorm building  Familiarity breeds contempt and I like to say that our friendship is built on a mutual hate We argue mock and generally fuck with each other all the time but it rarely becomes heated enough to start a real fight Well for whatever reason sometime last spring we fought over something and it became physical with me slapping him then being tackled by him We were separated by mutual friends then went back to our own rooms to cool off Over the next week or so we went back to aloud regual routine but I still wanted revenge  Not being very creative I went and bought one of thesehttpwwwamazoncomgpproductBJCSKCieUTFampforcefullsiteamprefawbottomlinks  It was completely worth it One night a few of us were sitting around in his dorm room watching TV  Right before leaving for dinner I made sure to be the last one out of the room and got the device out of my bag turned it on and his it under the radiator After dinner we came back up to his room to play some Mario Kart  Now at random intervals the device began to make high pitched beeping and buzzing sounds  After a while everyone else in the room began to wonder what it was and started to look for it but to no avail  There were roughly  months left of school before summer break at this point and we would hang out in his room almost daily because he didnt have a roommate no one had to get caught in the cross fire  He quickly became infuriated at the beeping and buzzing and at least once dragged his mattress out to the lounge so he could sleep He tore apart his room on multiple occasions looking for the source and even considered calling housing to see if they could fix the problem The whole time I was really enjoying myself  I was slowly driving him insane In the end I mentioned it to one of our other friends so he would stop looking for the source but he ended up ratting me out at the end of the year  TLDR Slowly drove my friend insane with a beeping and buzzing sound I his in his room ,Our friendship is built on a mutual hate,52
AnoruleA,16,20,1r6kqx,20,BackgroundBehind my house there is a short narrow alley and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days one night and she needed a place to park  Since road construction was preventing my friend and everyone else in my neighborhood from parking in the street I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spacesConflictWhen me and my friend were watching a movie in my room I heard people talking outside my window  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friends car so I popped outside to explain the situation  Immediately they were on the offensive and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was in fact not our place to park  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work school and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied  NEVER in the halfyear Ive lived here  Whatever I thought theres no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anywaysIt was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car Tenant parking only with permanent marker  Yeah I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property and he said he was the one who wrote the message  This was a grown man probably in his sixties who did it  We exchanged some insults and I leftThis is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge  I can handle irrational people  I expect as much from strangers anyways  But ever since then this happened a month ago the people who live there have started doubleparking which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there  YEAH YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES HUH  THATS WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK  Fucking assholes  I do have my own car but I park it in my driveway during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friends car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways  But apparently they didnt take it  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situationThe RevengeSince I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces  This usually amounts to two a day  So far no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see  Their parking spaces must be so precious to them and it feels so good to slowly make their space less and less attractive to the outside observer,How dare you write on my friends car with permanent marker,40
