daniellelasvegas,119,394,1r28l6,1337,Backstory  So I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan I live very close to a NJNY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner Its a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly So if youre lucky enough to get a seat youll enjoy your ride into the city in comfortThe epicenter of the train is in Jersey City This stop could be considered the Grand Central of this small train line This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city This is your chance to get the coveted seatNow as a young healthy female I dont mind whether I get a seat or not It definitely is nice to have one just so I dont feel like a sardine but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly manwomanThe Story  The platform was empty since a train to the city just left they come every  minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited People began filling up the spaces around me Nothing new People stand next to me behind me etcetc but since I am standing right behind the yellow line no one goes in front of me since theyd probably fall onto the tracks Some girl lets call her PB for pushy bitch my age clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me Im sure PB angered those several people but I didnt hear anyone complain PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her leftANYWAY the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform Because everyone wants a seat on the train you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit I always hold my ground because I dont want to end up as rail pancake The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little shove Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didnt affect my time or ability to catch myself I turn around and its PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else I knew it was her Also if it were even possible at this point she moved closer to me I feel her breathing down my neck The train pulls up and the doors are directly in front of me but they arent open yet It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doorsPB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train Of course I am as close as I possibly could be but she wasnt satisfied Shes off the phone now Another bag hit Im pretty ticked off by now and it was like this petty revenge was meant to beSo I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her I did it a couple of times I finally decided to say Hey did you drop that and I pointed to the ground near her At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasnt fast enough She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots Oh well PB dont be a pushy bitchTLDR  Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train Pulled the old did you drop that on her making her miss her chance to get a seatEdit words,Almost push me onto the tracks Good luck grabbing your desired seat,1731,pettyrevenge

teuker,164,426,1r5efr,1066,Once upon a time I was a graduate student in a liberal arts field Now the department I was in was to put it mildly rife with squabbling petty professors more concerned with marking their territory and playing favorites among the grad students One professor had it in for me She didnt much like my theoretical approach that I took in one of her seminars nor did she like my prospective dissertation adviser Every two years in a graduate students time there they undergo a review At my fourthyear review as I was told later on by a professor who I was friendly with she complained about me being a misogynist a comment that was entirely out of line and that NO ONE backed up at the meeting At any rate within a year I decided to transition out of academia into a field that made moneydoing course management for the IT team of my university But I still harbored a grudge at being malignedOne of the systems that I maintain governs the uploading of syllabi to meet a state mandate Its a balky system and occasionally has issues with crosslisted courses that end up in requiring me to to go manually fix them for the faculty Once I learned the system I saw my path of revengeI crosslisted this professors courses which never were crosslisted in the first place with a test course meaning that every time she tried to upload she had an error message saying that she needed to contact the system maintainer for help So she sent an email to the general address for this and I was able to respondFirstname she LOATHED being called anything except Dr LastnameIts rather odd that you had this error but I have been able to fix this problem for you You may go ahead and upload your syllabusTeukerI never saw her face after she got the emails Ive done this for the last two semesters but it warmed my heart to know that I was able to inconvenience her in just the smallest of ways,Call me a misogynist Good luck uploading your syllabus without me,1492,pettyrevenge
gottadance,115,256,1r2c95,1019,My Alevel biology teacher told me she refused to assign me a coursework project because I missed the lesson where the coursework was arranged I had told her beforehand that Id being absent to go to my brothers funeral She shouted at me for  minutes saying I wasnt her responsibility that I didnt take my education seriously and Id have to get zero for the coursework element which meant losing  Every time I opened my mouth to suggest a solution she got angrier I went to speak to the head of science who was shocked at how shed treated me and agreed Id done nothing wrong My biology teacher kept being a bitch to me after that so I swapped her whiteboard pens for permanent markers She got through three quarters of the lesson before realizing Even if I had got caught the ensuing meltdown was well worth it I started feeling sorry for her after she started crying so I told her going over it with a dry erase pen and rubbing it off might work She had to explain to the next teacher that he couldnt use one panel of the board because she used the wrong pens She spent the entire lunch break getting it off,Teacher shouts at me for going to my brothers funeral I swap her pens for permanent markers,1275,pettyrevenge
YourFederalOverlord,52,215,1rg4z6,814,When I was in middle school many years ago I had a Digital Arts teacher whos job it was to teach us about computers and how to use them correctly  She did not do that at all instead opting to give us the same typing routines several times over and call it a class  She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year this being back in   She attempted to get tickets but the website was overloaded so instead she did the logical thing and forced her classes to get them for her telling us all to reload the page until it came back online so that she could get her tickets  Failure to comply would mean no credit for the day as well as a black mark on our record  I wasnt pleased by this so I having figured out her administrators password a few days earlier she had it on a sticky note on her desk like a chump surreptitiously logged into the system and added the tickets page to the list of blocked websites before changing her password to  logging out and feigning shock at the sudden block to the page  It took her almost a week to figure out how to unblock the page though the school did figure out the password pretty quickly and she never did end up going to the World Series  God Im horrible    ,No tickets for you,1029,pettyrevenge

YesYouCannot,204,218,1r7zub,734,So I have an  year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction If you tell him to get off his PS at am on a school day hell chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over Sometimes when you give him helpful advice hed palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what youre telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn wayAnyway the other day he was at home on a school day I woke up when his mum he and his mum live in the house with us had already left for work I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home something he does a lot and something she gives in to a lot After having to experience this many times I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS I decided that even though I wasnt certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother my mum and owner of the house entitled him to a bit of karma So I turned off the router He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either It was great The entire day he was at home I heard barely a sound from his room also the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the betterLater during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house some  hours after he had been awake I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends It was very civil and didnt involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when hes gaming with them I was impressed by his good behaviour He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour I palmed it off and said I didnt know because I didnt want him to know how easy of a solution it was but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home he had been relatively good today compared to other days so I figured Id cut him some slackAs I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left he approached me asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it He was very polite at this point so I was quite happy to help him I continued to say I didnt know what was wrong with the internet but Ill check soon and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS to his mobile for internet He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me You cant do that Ive tried it and it doesnt work I told him yes you can I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time I told him my friends connect their PSs to their mobiles all the time too a lie but I just wanted him to know that you can do it He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PSs cant do that So I told him that if his PS connects through WiFi then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet I spent around  minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him I ended up snapping at him Fine You know what If youre going to have that attitude when I try to help you then Im not going to bother checking on the internet He didnt say anything went into his room and angrily slammed the door I didnt care and just left the house He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me Not only that but I intend on doing this to him every time hes at home from now on I cant wait for his school holidays to start where hell be at home all day without internetAlso I found out later that day that his mum didnt even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drainEdit Holy shit woke up to so many comments Will begin replying now Sorry for the delay  scratch that will reply in an hour or two after I do some errands firstEdit Whilst most of my comments show how bad my nephew and my sister his mother can be I do want you to know that this isnt a constant thing They can be very nice and loving and caring people sometimes and I still love them they just drive me insane sometimes haha,Okay you can play in offline mode then,952,pettyrevenge

Redsnork,61,143,1r3jsq,644,Im sure all of you know about the Boy Scouts of Americas recent decision to allow gay scouts into their programs But back when I was in the scouts the policy was still in full effect For the most part at least in my troop everyone seemed to be in full support of itOne time on a campout I was sitting with my friends talking about the BSAs policy on gay scouts An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against Gods wishes and that the policy is to protect boys who wouldnt last in scouting anyways He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be too dirty for themAt the time I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop I was a closeted bisexual and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troopAs the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting I grew more and more pissed off but didnt do anything at the time The final straw came when he told me that a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank That day I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout awardAbout three months later I got my Eagle Scout award The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremonyAt the reception I ran into one of my good friends who also happened to be bicurious We had a slight history but thats another story After the reception as everyone was walking out I started to hold my friends hand I had explained everything to him earlier Mr Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped Feeling ballsy I gave my friend a light peck on the lips I almost could feel his shocked stareI had to walk past him on the way out As I walked past I said this fag made it farther in scouts than you ever did He had quit after first classThey say success is the best form of revenge I agree wholeheartedly,Proving a homophobe wrong,787,pettyrevenge

MrsQuess,24,120,1rawsw,473,I seriously did not get along with my sister growing up  She moved back into my parents  bedroom apartment when I was   She was four years older  So we had to share a room and I didnt even like the chick I was the angsty artsy type and she was the prep  We just clashedSo my parents refused to get me a stereo that had a CD player on it because they thought CDs were just a passing trend  It just wasnt a logical birthday or christmas gift for me I had finally saved up enough baby sitting money to buy my own stereo and I didnt want to share it with my sister   Id come home from school and she would be listening to it loudly on some country station  I hated anything she did so I was always shitty with her   One of the reasons I chose the stereo I did was because it had a remote control with it and I thought that was coolest  It was poorly designed because if you hit mute on the remote you could not unmute the stereo from the stereo itself  It had to be unmuted by the remote control  Once I figured this out I just put my stereo on mute whenever I left the house and took the remote control everywhere I went just so she could not use it,Took the remote with me,593,pettyrevenge

LovesEwoks,72,66,1ri9iq,386,I have a recipe that my now deceased grandmother had always used for a potato dish Over the years I perfected this recipe experimenting with ingredients and seasonings creating a nearly perfect dish its always a hit at parties dinners and gatheringsAfter I was married I brought this potato dish to one of my spouses family gatherings People raved and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering  I am happy to oblige since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together The potato dish quickly becomes known as LovesEwoks Potatoes well my actual name not screen name Although I always refer to them as my grandmothers potatoesOver the next few years I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday mostly by request I share this recipe many times with my spouses family every aunt uncle cousin and sibling who asks I even give some tips for best resultsA week before Thanksgiving my sisterinlaw calls me explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her inlaws house and asks for specifics on the recipe the exact brands of products I use where I purchased the pan etc I go into great detail giving her step by step instructions for perfect resultsA few days later my motherinlaw calls me asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering Oh I thought I would bring the potatoes She informs me that my sisterinlaw Kelly is bringing potatoes and I should bring something else This is not a problem for me since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmotherWe gather for Thanksgiving and in walks Kelly with her potato dish She removes the cover and its funny because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring I had just assumed she was going to bring something else Nope exact same recipe exact same pan She walks around telling everyone you MUST try Kellys potatoes At first I thought this might have been a joke so I let it go this is not the first time she has acted very jealous and did things for attention In the past she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skillsChristmas gathering same situation I decide to ignore it and let her have Kellys potatoes  just not worth dealing with her I had brought along a dessert again people raved and requested I bring it again at Easter thanks grandma It seems I might have a new signature dish My sisterinlaw calls me a few days before Easter asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas can you believe it I give her the recipe except this time I leave out a very small but critically important ingredient Easter gathering I bring my the dessert as requested by the host Just as I suspected in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty until she said everyone must try this I found the recipe on pinterest Needless to say they were terribleSteal my grandmas recipes and call them your own Hope you like recipes that are missing an ingredient,You followed the recipe and it still tastes different How strange,452,pettyrevenge
murrhurr,24,50,1rbsaq,189,Back in  RuneScape was one of the largest freeplay MMOs It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit RS was blocked at school so kids often went to the library to play in their free time I was one of those kids I couldnt really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus LolSo Id see this kid at the library also playing RS He was pretty highleveled at the time ish and had lightblue rune armorthe best in the free game I would choose the computer next to him and logon to my character Id talk to him and he seemed friendly enough He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up As a noob I was level  at the time I gladly took on this offer However as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams I would attend the library regularly and after about a week of gaining my trust the guy offered to trim my adamant armor Of course since he was so helpful to me before how could I refuseIn RuneScape like other MMOs players trade items through a specific screen So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor which was expensive for a noob like me A friend loaned me some money to buy it which was about  coins or k Even though it cost so much I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to himWe completed the trade and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor He said depending on your crafting level it can take a few minutes because you had to trim each part by itself He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return Meanwhile his avatar on the screen beside me stood still Then it autologged meaning the game automatically loggedout his account after a period of inactivity Now it had been over  minutes since he left I wondered what took him so long After waiting a bit longer I went to check up on him Checked the male bathrooms on both floors He wasnt there It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit Well I wasnt going to have that Lucky for me there was a particular computer this kid always used probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something I hatched a plan You see in a game as popular as RuneScape was there were private servers many of questionable quality These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications like X normal XP rate and player commands that in the real game only admins JMods could use One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game You could tell it was a scam because many of the accounts advertising it were highlevelmeaning that other curious players checked out the site and got their main accounts hijacked with malware No pro player would actually advertise a private serverthey were already far ahead in the real game I was gonna infect this kid with malwareMy plan was simple I went on the kids computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape Then I typed in the URL of the private server website I did as much fishy shit as I couldclicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way At this point I figured the computer was fucked but functional On the outside everything seemed normal Until it was too late I wanted to test if the computer was infected now I logged onto the disposable account and logged off I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password I hopped back to the uninfected computer and logged onto my main account It was in Varrock a popular trading city for players and spammers Now to play the waiting game I added the disposable account name to my friends list so I could be notified when it logged in Sure enough five minutes later my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL Satisfied I logged off and went home When the kid came back the next day I confronted him I asked him why he left without trimming my armor Guy said Oh dude I forgot Im real busy Of course youre not busy youre in middle school Guy was pulling lies from his ass I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor actually He didnt seem to care Fair enoughI took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer Thats all I needed to see I said I had to leave guy still didnt seem to caretoo busy killing other players in the wildernessI wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight I went home and disobeyed my parents rules to not play RuneScape To my delight I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL My plan was a success The neat thing is that these bots could spam  until they were muted andor bannedthat was a bonus I only needed to ensure he couldnt access his account I returned to the library the next day Guy was furious I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldnt logon to his accountpassword was changed He didnt have recovery questions so his account was pretty much fucked I dont know what happened after that but I hope his main was banned for botting TLDR I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items No regrets PS To those who wonder if other innocent users got infectedI prepared for this I used a USB stick to load extra malware onto the computer Complained that it ran slowly to library staff Got it replaced like the day after the kid lost his acc ,Petty RuneScape Revenge,239,pettyrevenge

Redsnork,9,37,1r3gpz,166,A few years ago I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop I never abused my power except for this one timeA good friend of mine came up to me one day at school raging mad Her brother who was autistic had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade They would call him names make fun of his strange interests and talk about him behind his backLater that week at our weekly Boy Scout meeting I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had They had made a list of quotes said by my friends brother I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friends brother were in my troop and more importantly under my powerI had an agenda for the meeting something about celebrity eagle scouts but I immediately ditched it as I formed my planI called the meeting to order and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards and that anyone that didnt pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip This entailed digging holes for people to shit in and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we leftI pretended to be nice by allowing people to form their own cleaning groups Naturally the boys that harassed my friend clumped togetherAs soon as everyone was split up into groups I divyed up areas where each group had to clean I gave the bullys the bathroom Now this wasnt a nice modern bathroom The lights were dim the tiles were coming up and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small cramped room The group of about four boys came to me and complained I tried to ignore them but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster I told them that if they tried to report me I would tell him what they had been writing on the board After that they didnt say anythingEveryone else got their jobs done in about half an hour but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meetingBefore I closed the meeting I pulled the bullys aside I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran outThe boys looked scared and not a single one of them said anything in responseThe next day I told my friend what I had done On the verge of tears she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brotherLater on I ended up meeting him and invited him to a boy scout meeting I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop and let him make the first smore during the program that night Ill never forget the smile on his face or the scowls of the bullys as he made his first smoreEventually word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it I admitted to everything He ended up being a friend of the boys mom and was familiar with what their family had to go through He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL but told me to keep on looking out for those who need it,Make fun of my autistic friend Clean the toilets,203,pettyrevenge

BNugget,4,30,1rdot8,94,When I moved into the dorm I brought a small TV with a remote The TV was to be shared between myself and my roommate I ended up not being around that often since I had friends and the roomie was a little antisocial Whenever I would come home the roomie would have been watching tv and the remote was always on her side of the room instead of placed back on the microwave stand in neutral territory when she was done I didnt want to hunt through her area for MY tv remote Yes I am unnecessarily possessive of things I paid for but am supposed to share I recognize this flaw and I do not careShe was a little absent minded sometimes so when she was in class one day I took the remote and stuck it in the microwave Then I left Happy Hunting She eventually found it and told me later how she must have done it when she was getting her lunch together or something I was pleased that I had made her feel silly for a moment,Hidden Remote,124,pettyrevenge
Cawkii,29,24,1rdk0e,91,After watching a video on YouTube it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too TLDR at the bottom for anyone that doesnt want the build upMy Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study windowAfter a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders probably thinking he wants some too  minutes go by and I look out again to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using The wire isnt very thin about as thick as a pencil I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after  minutes of betting we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hoseThe next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now But oh no My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel as long as it doesnt well kill them the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons and I dont blame himI go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up thinking that hes going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away oh no he wasnt I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up with a nice evil smile days go by without any sightings of a squirrel until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in but lathered up with the same engine grease he used minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire one foot two hands then as he leaves the safety of the branch THUMP he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash me and my Dad are in tears and laughing and we have a toast to engine greaseThe height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only  foot or less I am sure he got away ok although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on In that case he put chicken wire all around the ballTLDR Squirrel got into my Dads bird feeders so he got his revenge and put engine grease on the wire connecting it to the branch we saw a squirrel fall off and laughed really hardEDIT EDIT EDITPlease people it was one Grey squirrel that may or may have not been injured in this case I DID see it a week later and it moved perfectly fine If you want to go on about animal cruelty you might want to read up on the Grey squirrel and what their species did to our native Red Squirrels,The evil uses of Engine Grease,115,pettyrevenge

bassboyjoe,16,18,1r3dao,89,So there is this girl lets call her Jenna that was on my course at university For whatever reason after the first year in the summer she decided she didnt like me and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this all in quite unsavoury terms A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women had absolutely no idea and thus didnt respond to her advances For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group which was a big deal to me I didnt get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldnt find out until it was too late or when I didnt have the money So most evenings I would come home from uni cook dinner and it eat it in my room on my own She blocked me on facebook which in itself I couldnt give a crap about but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials which meant I couldnt see anything she posted or events she created I tried my best to ignore it and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up however I still never felt like I belonged there which is a horrible feeling when youre a couple of hundred miles from homeAnyway after our final exams we all hit the pub I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years This must have seemed a good idea to her but it was just an insult to injury for me Graduation day comes round today and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses I find my seat in the cathedral one seat into a row Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me Yep you guess it Jenna She is on the end of the row I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me or mention how nervous she was There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet Multiple times she tried to converse with me and multiple times I ignored that bitch At one point I noticed her texting someone mentioning how awkward she felt Might not have been much but it made me feel fantastic TLDR  bitch made my uni years pretty lonely and tedious so I ignored the hell out of her when she was assigned seats next me at graduation ,Make my time at uni miserable Ill ignore the crap out of you at graduation,107,pettyrevenge

AnoruleA,19,26,1r6kqx,30,BackgroundBehind my house there is a short narrow alley and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days one night and she needed a place to park  Since road construction was preventing my friend and everyone else in my neighborhood from parking in the street I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spacesConflictWhen me and my friend were watching a movie in my room I heard people talking outside my window  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friends car so I popped outside to explain the situation  Immediately they were on the offensive and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was in fact not our place to park  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work school and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied  NEVER in the halfyear Ive lived here  Whatever I thought theres no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anywaysIt was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car Tenant parking only with permanent marker  Yeah I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property and he said he was the one who wrote the message  This was a grown man probably in his sixties who did it  We exchanged some insults and I leftThis is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge  I can handle irrational people  I expect as much from strangers anyways  But ever since then this happened a month ago the people who live there have started doubleparking which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there  YEAH YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES HUH  THATS WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK  Fucking assholes  I do have my own car but I park it in my driveway during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friends car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways  But apparently they didnt take it  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situationThe RevengeSince I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces  This usually amounts to two a day  So far no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see  Their parking spaces must be so precious to them and it feels so good to slowly make their space less and less attractive to the outside observer,How dare you write on my friends car with permanent marker,56,pettyrevenge

YourFederalOverlord,52,217,1rg4z6,807,When I was in middle school many years ago I had a Digital Arts teacher whos job it was to teach us about computers and how to use them correctly  She did not do that at all instead opting to give us the same typing routines several times over and call it a class  She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year this being back in   She attempted to get tickets but the website was overloaded so instead she did the logical thing and forced her classes to get them for her telling us all to reload the page until it came back online so that she could get her tickets  Failure to comply would mean no credit for the day as well as a black mark on our record  I wasnt pleased by this so I having figured out her administrators password a few days earlier she had it on a sticky note on her desk like a chump surreptitiously logged into the system and added the tickets page to the list of blocked websites before changing her password to  logging out and feigning shock at the sudden block to the page  It took her almost a week to figure out how to unblock the page though the school did figure out the password pretty quickly and she never did end up going to the World Series  God Im horrible    ,No tickets for you,1024,pettyrevenge

YesYouCannot,204,217,1r7zub,735,So I have an  year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction If you tell him to get off his PS at am on a school day hell chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over Sometimes when you give him helpful advice hed palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what youre telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn wayAnyway the other day he was at home on a school day I woke up when his mum he and his mum live in the house with us had already left for work I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home something he does a lot and something she gives in to a lot After having to experience this many times I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS I decided that even though I wasnt certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother my mum and owner of the house entitled him to a bit of karma So I turned off the router He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either It was great The entire day he was at home I heard barely a sound from his room also the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the betterLater during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house some  hours after he had been awake I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends It was very civil and didnt involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when hes gaming with them I was impressed by his good behaviour He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour I palmed it off and said I didnt know because I didnt want him to know how easy of a solution it was but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home he had been relatively good today compared to other days so I figured Id cut him some slackAs I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left he approached me asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it He was very polite at this point so I was quite happy to help him I continued to say I didnt know what was wrong with the internet but Ill check soon and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS to his mobile for internet He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me You cant do that Ive tried it and it doesnt work I told him yes you can I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time I told him my friends connect their PSs to their mobiles all the time too a lie but I just wanted him to know that you can do it He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PSs cant do that So I told him that if his PS connects through WiFi then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet I spent around  minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him I ended up snapping at him Fine You know what If youre going to have that attitude when I try to help you then Im not going to bother checking on the internet He didnt say anything went into his room and angrily slammed the door I didnt care and just left the house He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me Not only that but I intend on doing this to him every time hes at home from now on I cant wait for his school holidays to start where hell be at home all day without internetAlso I found out later that day that his mum didnt even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drainEdit Holy shit woke up to so many comments Will begin replying now Sorry for the delay  scratch that will reply in an hour or two after I do some errands firstEdit Whilst most of my comments show how bad my nephew and my sister his mother can be I do want you to know that this isnt a constant thing They can be very nice and loving and caring people sometimes and I still love them they just drive me insane sometimes haha,Okay you can play in offline mode then,952,pettyrevenge

LovesEwoks,72,69,1ri9iq,387,I have a recipe that my now deceased grandmother had always used for a potato dish Over the years I perfected this recipe experimenting with ingredients and seasonings creating a nearly perfect dish its always a hit at parties dinners and gatheringsAfter I was married I brought this potato dish to one of my spouses family gatherings People raved and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering  I am happy to oblige since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together The potato dish quickly becomes known as LovesEwoks Potatoes well my actual name not screen name Although I always refer to them as my grandmothers potatoesOver the next few years I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday mostly by request I share this recipe many times with my spouses family every aunt uncle cousin and sibling who asks I even give some tips for best resultsA week before Thanksgiving my sisterinlaw calls me explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her inlaws house and asks for specifics on the recipe the exact brands of products I use where I purchased the pan etc I go into great detail giving her step by step instructions for perfect resultsA few days later my motherinlaw calls me asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering Oh I thought I would bring the potatoes She informs me that my sisterinlaw Kelly is bringing potatoes and I should bring something else This is not a problem for me since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmotherWe gather for Thanksgiving and in walks Kelly with her potato dish She removes the cover and its funny because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring I had just assumed she was going to bring something else Nope exact same recipe exact same pan She walks around telling everyone you MUST try Kellys potatoes At first I thought this might have been a joke so I let it go this is not the first time she has acted very jealous and did things for attention In the past she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skillsChristmas gathering same situation I decide to ignore it and let her have Kellys potatoes  just not worth dealing with her I had brought along a dessert again people raved and requested I bring it again at Easter thanks grandma It seems I might have a new signature dish My sisterinlaw calls me a few days before Easter asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas can you believe it I give her the recipe except this time I leave out a very small but critically important ingredient Easter gathering I bring my the dessert as requested by the host Just as I suspected in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty until she said everyone must try this I found the recipe on pinterest Needless to say they were terribleSteal my grandmas recipes and call them your own Hope you like recipes that are missing an ingredient,You followed the recipe and it still tastes different How strange,456,pettyrevenge
murrhurr,24,53,1rbsaq,184,Back in  RuneScape was one of the largest freeplay MMOs It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit RS was blocked at school so kids often went to the library to play in their free time I was one of those kids I couldnt really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus LolSo Id see this kid at the library also playing RS He was pretty highleveled at the time ish and had lightblue rune armorthe best in the free game I would choose the computer next to him and logon to my character Id talk to him and he seemed friendly enough He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up As a noob I was level  at the time I gladly took on this offer However as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams I would attend the library regularly and after about a week of gaining my trust the guy offered to trim my adamant armor Of course since he was so helpful to me before how could I refuseIn RuneScape like other MMOs players trade items through a specific screen So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor which was expensive for a noob like me A friend loaned me some money to buy it which was about  coins or k Even though it cost so much I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to himWe completed the trade and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor He said depending on your crafting level it can take a few minutes because you had to trim each part by itself He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return Meanwhile his avatar on the screen beside me stood still Then it autologged meaning the game automatically loggedout his account after a period of inactivity Now it had been over  minutes since he left I wondered what took him so long After waiting a bit longer I went to check up on him Checked the male bathrooms on both floors He wasnt there It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit Well I wasnt going to have that Lucky for me there was a particular computer this kid always used probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something I hatched a plan You see in a game as popular as RuneScape was there were private servers many of questionable quality These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications like X normal XP rate and player commands that in the real game only admins JMods could use One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game You could tell it was a scam because many of the accounts advertising it were highlevelmeaning that other curious players checked out the site and got their main accounts hijacked with malware No pro player would actually advertise a private serverthey were already far ahead in the real game I was gonna infect this kid with malwareMy plan was simple I went on the kids computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape Then I typed in the URL of the private server website I did as much fishy shit as I couldclicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way At this point I figured the computer was fucked but functional On the outside everything seemed normal Until it was too late I wanted to test if the computer was infected now I logged onto the disposable account and logged off I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password I hopped back to the uninfected computer and logged onto my main account It was in Varrock a popular trading city for players and spammers Now to play the waiting game I added the disposable account name to my friends list so I could be notified when it logged in Sure enough five minutes later my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL Satisfied I logged off and went home When the kid came back the next day I confronted him I asked him why he left without trimming my armor Guy said Oh dude I forgot Im real busy Of course youre not busy youre in middle school Guy was pulling lies from his ass I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor actually He didnt seem to care Fair enoughI took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer Thats all I needed to see I said I had to leave guy still didnt seem to caretoo busy killing other players in the wildernessI wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight I went home and disobeyed my parents rules to not play RuneScape To my delight I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL My plan was a success The neat thing is that these bots could spam  until they were muted andor bannedthat was a bonus I only needed to ensure he couldnt access his account I returned to the library the next day Guy was furious I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldnt logon to his accountpassword was changed He didnt have recovery questions so his account was pretty much fucked I dont know what happened after that but I hope his main was banned for botting TLDR I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items No regrets PS To those who wonder if other innocent users got infectedI prepared for this I used a USB stick to load extra malware onto the computer Complained that it ran slowly to library staff Got it replaced like the day after the kid lost his acc ,Petty RuneScape Revenge,237,pettyrevenge

Redsnork,9,36,1r3gpz,166,A few years ago I was the senior patrol leader of a boy scout troop I never abused my power except for this one timeA good friend of mine came up to me one day at school raging mad Her brother who was autistic had been harassed by this group of boys in his grade They would call him names make fun of his strange interests and talk about him behind his backLater that week at our weekly Boy Scout meeting I walked into our scout hut and saw a group of boys crowded around the ancient chalkboard we had They had made a list of quotes said by my friends brother I immediately realized that the people who were bullying my friends brother were in my troop and more importantly under my powerI had an agenda for the meeting something about celebrity eagle scouts but I immediately ditched it as I formed my planI called the meeting to order and announced that we would be cleaning the scout hut and all surrounding areas I told everyone that there would be an inspection afterwards and that anyone that didnt pass inspection would be put on latrine duty during the next backpacking trip This entailed digging holes for people to shit in and making sure that all of the holes were covered up before we leftI pretended to be nice by allowing people to form their own cleaning groups Naturally the boys that harassed my friend clumped togetherAs soon as everyone was split up into groups I divyed up areas where each group had to clean I gave the bullys the bathroom Now this wasnt a nice modern bathroom The lights were dim the tiles were coming up and a thin layer of film seemed to coat every inch of the small cramped room The group of about four boys came to me and complained I tried to ignore them but they went so far as to threaten to report me to the scoutmaster I told them that if they tried to report me I would tell him what they had been writing on the board After that they didnt say anythingEveryone else got their jobs done in about half an hour but the boys were scrubbing until I had to close the meetingBefore I closed the meeting I pulled the bullys aside I told them that if I heard that they were bullying anyone again I would assign them latrine duty until my term as SPL ran outThe boys looked scared and not a single one of them said anything in responseThe next day I told my friend what I had done On the verge of tears she hugged me and thanked me for looking out for her brotherLater on I ended up meeting him and invited him to a boy scout meeting I personally introduced him in front of the whole troop and let him make the first smore during the program that night Ill never forget the smile on his face or the scowls of the bullys as he made his first smoreEventually word got back to the scoutmaster about what I had done He pulled me aside one night and confronted me about it I admitted to everything He ended up being a friend of the boys mom and was familiar with what their family had to go through He warned me about abusing my power as an SPL but told me to keep on looking out for those who need it,Make fun of my autistic friend Clean the toilets,202,pettyrevenge

Cormasaurus,18,27,1r5rw8,100,So recently my grandmother died and Ive been really beat up about it Last night my friends decided to take me out to eat and just have fun On our way home my friend that was driving switched lanes in front of one of those assfucks that try to speed up before you can get into their lane but she had the faster car and got overNow these fuckers are all salty and began to weave through traffic to get next to us and wave and do general asshole things We turned right onto a four lane road with tiny lanes The asshole van decided to make yet another dangerous maneuver and cut people off to turn and follow us They proceed to pass is barely avoiding hitting us and try to brake check us horribly if I may add Then they get into the lane beside us and try to match our slowing speed to keep messing with us Each time we tried to pass theyd move over a few inches seriously the lanes are so fucking small and the driver had to slam on her brakesWe reached a red light We were in a left turning lane and the douche van was in the lane next to us We stopped far enough back that they couldnt do anything to us except hang out of their shitty van and make rude gesturesMy driving friend kept yelling at them and flipping them off and the girls in the back kept screaming like babies I told the driver to stop giving them what they wanted andOh wait whats that Is that a license plate number and a cell phone in my hand Oops I called the cops informed them that I thought you were drunk and told them every thing you did during the entire chase Enjoy your tickets shitheads,I hope being a huge asshole was worth the money ,127,pettyrevenge
Cawkii,29,22,1rdk0e,93,After watching a video on YouTube it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too TLDR at the bottom for anyone that doesnt want the build upMy Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study windowAfter a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders probably thinking he wants some too  minutes go by and I look out again to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using The wire isnt very thin about as thick as a pencil I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after  minutes of betting we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hoseThe next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now But oh no My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel as long as it doesnt well kill them the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons and I dont blame himI go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up thinking that hes going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away oh no he wasnt I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up with a nice evil smile days go by without any sightings of a squirrel until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in but lathered up with the same engine grease he used minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire one foot two hands then as he leaves the safety of the branch THUMP he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash me and my Dad are in tears and laughing and we have a toast to engine greaseThe height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only  foot or less I am sure he got away ok although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on In that case he put chicken wire all around the ballTLDR Squirrel got into my Dads bird feeders so he got his revenge and put engine grease on the wire connecting it to the branch we saw a squirrel fall off and laughed really hardEDIT EDIT EDITPlease people it was one Grey squirrel that may or may have not been injured in this case I DID see it a week later and it moved perfectly fine If you want to go on about animal cruelty you might want to read up on the Grey squirrel and what their species did to our native Red Squirrels,The evil uses of Engine Grease,115,pettyrevenge

bassboyjoe,16,21,1r3dao,84,So there is this girl lets call her Jenna that was on my course at university For whatever reason after the first year in the summer she decided she didnt like me and felt it was necessary to bombard me with texts telling me this all in quite unsavoury terms A couple of people belive it was because she had a soft spot for me and typical me being the most oblvious person ever when it comes to women had absolutely no idea and thus didnt respond to her advances For the remaining two years she did her best to make me feel me feel unwelcome in our friendship group which was a big deal to me I didnt get on with my house mates for all three years as I cannot abide living in the state that students feel is necessary As a result I looked forward to lectures as I relied on these guys and girls Unfortunately Jenna was the sort of person to organise a lot of socials and as a result a lot of things were organised and I wouldnt find out until it was too late or when I didnt have the money So most evenings I would come home from uni cook dinner and it eat it in my room on my own She blocked me on facebook which in itself I couldnt give a crap about but we had a private group with people on my course to discuss courseworks and socials which meant I couldnt see anything she posted or events she created I tried my best to ignore it and everyone realised what she was doing and told her to grow up however I still never felt like I belonged there which is a horrible feeling when youre a couple of hundred miles from homeAnyway after our final exams we all hit the pub I proceeded to get smashed and sit fairly quietly just musing Jenna comes up to me after a few drinks and actually apologises for how she had treated me over the last few years This must have seemed a good idea to her but it was just an insult to injury for me Graduation day comes round today and we are assigned seat numbers based on surnames and courses I find my seat in the cathedral one seat into a row Eventually guess who has been assigned the seat next to me Yep you guess it Jenna She is on the end of the row I proceeded to completely blank her everytime she tried to speak to me or mention how nervous she was There was no one else around that we knew as our classmates tended to be early on in the alphabet Multiple times she tried to converse with me and multiple times I ignored that bitch At one point I noticed her texting someone mentioning how awkward she felt Might not have been much but it made me feel fantastic TLDR  bitch made my uni years pretty lonely and tedious so I ignored the hell out of her when she was assigned seats next me at graduation ,Make my time at uni miserable Ill ignore the crap out of you at graduation,105,pettyrevenge

AnoruleA,19,23,1r6kqx,32,BackgroundBehind my house there is a short narrow alley and in that alley are five parking spaces used by the residents of a small housing complex located on the opposite side of the alley from where I live  One weekend my friend visited me from out of town for two days one night and she needed a place to park  Since road construction was preventing my friend and everyone else in my neighborhood from parking in the street I saw no problem having my friend park back there because there are always empty spacesConflictWhen me and my friend were watching a movie in my room I heard people talking outside my window  I looked outside and there was a man and two women gathered around my friends car so I popped outside to explain the situation  Immediately they were on the offensive and since I do not like conflict I was happy to move the car since it was in fact not our place to park  But what really got under my skin was that they said they needed all five spaces even though I walk down that alley every day to get to and from work school and other places such as the grocery store and have never once seen more than three spaces occupied  NEVER in the halfyear Ive lived here  Whatever I thought theres no need to go calling them out about it and my friend is going to be leaving in just an hour or two anywaysIt was not until I parked the car elsewhere when I noticed that some fucker wrote on the window of the car Tenant parking only with permanent marker  Yeah I was able to get it all off with fifteen minutes of scrubbing using a standard household cleaning spray but what the fuck is wrong with just leaving a piece of paper under the windshield wiper  So I went over there and asked to speak to the manager of the property and he said he was the one who wrote the message  This was a grown man probably in his sixties who did it  We exchanged some insults and I leftThis is not what prompted me to begin my petty revenge  I can handle irrational people  I expect as much from strangers anyways  But ever since then this happened a month ago the people who live there have started doubleparking which I am certain is an effort to prevent me from parking there  YEAH YOU NEED ALL FIVE FUCKING SPACES HUH  THATS WHY YOU DOUBLE PARK  Fucking assholes  I do have my own car but I park it in my driveway during the conflict I had explained to them that it was my friends car and she was going to be leaving soon anyways  But apparently they didnt take it  This pisses me off more than anything else about the situationThe RevengeSince I walk through the alley around an average of five times a day I have now started throwing my cigarette butts onto their parking spaces  This usually amounts to two a day  So far no one has picked any up and the pile is growing ever more satisfying to see  Their parking spaces must be so precious to them and it feels so good to slowly make their space less and less attractive to the outside observer,How dare you write on my friends car with permanent marker,55,pettyrevenge

RotatingMaleCow,21,26,1r0xcu,23,A few weeks ago I was making a long drive up to visit some friends and happily flying along in the consistent flow of the fast lane Everything was going swimmingly as usual the fast lane was  the speed limit and going by the other  lanes I was so happy Enter commander shitbird This guy decides that he needs to go faster so he rides my ass so hard I cant even see his headlights Im not sure what he expected me to do as the  cars in front of me were going the exact same speed and were still much faster than the traffic to our right I figured hed ease off after a bit but nope the commander stubbornly persisted and then i saw a big semi truck coming up in the lane next to me Going much slower than the fast lane A mad grin leapt across my face and as I pulled up next to the semi i slowed down considerably to match it  miles slower than the fast lane Unfortunately I had some collateral damage as there was a car behind the commander but there is no way I was about to let this opportunity pass For a whole  fucking minutes commander shitbird was my bitch and going  mph slower than he was previously I was so happy in that moment I could have vigorously masturbated but I didt want to miss a minute of his misery Maybe next time if youd like to continue to enjoy the speed of the fast lane you should reconsider the impudent tailgate Shitbird edit i cant numbers ,Tailgater gets stuck next to a semi which gave me a semi,49,pettyrevenge
